The dimensions and weight of the vehicles which may be used on regular omnibus services are subject to regulations made by the Minister for Local Government. <Col N="1123" /> When the roads are narrow or otherwise unsuitable for a particular type of vehicle, permission is not given for their use.</P>

As a result of that question, I found that £1,117,000 more was received from petrol taxation last year than was received in 1947-48.  On the following day, by a question addressed to the Minister for Local Government, I found that a sum of £600,000 more was received from motor taxation last year than was received in 1947-48.  In view of that position and of the extra wear and tear that must be imposed on roads, when so much extra petrol is being used and so much extra heavy lorry and other traffic is being carried, would not the Parliamentary Secretary consider that it is only just that some of that money should be devoted to the upkeep of the roads that are being torn up now?

Tá a fhios agam nach féidir linne anseo dul i gcomórtas le Hollywood. Tá tiortha beaga ar an MórRoinn nach dtugann aird dá laighead ar Hollywood agus tá sár-phictiúirí beaga déanta acu.

      <P>There is one further matter to which I would like to refer on this debate, and I think it is of very considerable importance because I think it has a very great effect upon the educational system of this country in what I should describe as the broadest sense of the word and the most literal sense of the word &ldquo;education&rdquo;, and that is the mental food available to our people after they leave school-na daoine fásta &mdash;imported newspapers and periodicals. I quite appreciate that the importation of literature and reading matter from abroad is strictly in the domain of the Minister for Industry and Commerce but I think I can fairly relate what I have to say about this to this debate because we all appreciate that in the broad sense of the term the word &ldquo;education&rdquo; has a wider connotation than just the business of teaching and learning.  What directed my mind to this subject of importation of reading matter from England principally is that a few months ago I happened to be at Collinstown airport on a Saturday afternoon.  I was looking at some Aer Lingus passenger planes and I noticed that their seats had been taken out temporarily converting them into cargo planes.  I enquired the reason for this and I was told that every Saturday night three of these planes fly to Manchester and come back late on Saturday night or Sunday morning laden with English Sunday newspapers. Each plane, I understand, brings three tons of this mental food for our people, young and old.</P>

      <P>I have considerable sympathy with the last speaker because the matter he was discussing seems to be nobody's child.  It is very difficult to see where, except perhaps on a matter of general policy, the matter could be raised.  It is very hard on the Department of Education who are trying to give the right mentality to our children that they may be spoilt afterwards by the influence of such things as the imported Press, which has become a very acute question at present, and of the cinema as well as other things.  These are matters which one would imagine the Minister for Education would be very pleased to remedy because all the work he might set out to do to make the country Irish-thinking and Irish-speaking is being spoilt a few years after the children leave school.  However, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has ruled that the question cannot be discussed in detail we will have to leave it alone for the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disappointed with the Minister's attitude on the question of broadcasting for schools, because a great deal of investigation work had been done by the Advisory Committee of Radio Éireann earlier on, and we were always hopeful that the Department of Education would become more imaginative about its possibilities, in view of what has been done in other countries through having the radio in all the schools.  It is true it might cost some thousands of pounds, but it would be well worth it, not merely from the point of view of general education, of which one can get full experience by listening to some of our neighbouring stations when lessons are being given, but also from the point of view of its value in getting a really good accent and standard of Irish all over the country, and giving the teachers and the children in all the schools a feeling of strong national impulse with regard to perfecting what I think is called a <i>lingua franca</i>, a common speech of Irish of a very high standard.  I have spoken of this before and I hope the Minister will at some stage become more imaginative about it and inclined to take a more sympathetic attitude towards it and press for the money necessary to carry <Col N="1134" /> out the scheme as it is being carried out in other countries.  It is a pity that we should always be more backward in these matters than other countries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Con Lehane spoke of Clann na Poblachta policy, which appears to me to be very unrealistic, with regard to university education.  He wants everybody in Ireland to get university education and to get it free.  If he realised the present position with regard to university education in Dublin and how overcrowded the National University is, he would scarcely press that point of policy, particularly when what the people really need is more technical education. Apparently, judging by the speech of Deputy McCann, technical education is not getting as much attention as it should. The work done in the Bolton Street schools is enormously valuable from many points of view and in some respects the education provided there is as good as the education to be got in the university.  In any case, the number of students in the university <Col N="1135" /> in itself constitutes a problem, and I have advocated more than once that there should be a decentralisation up to a certain point in university education and that places like Limerick and Waterford should be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so.  University education is the kind of education suitable for a great many people in the country.  It is very suitable for people going for professions, but technical education, if developed on proper lines, can be much more useful and valuable to people in after life than university education.</P>

In present conditions, because university education is not by any means exclusive in regard to fees, it is possible for people who really want it to get it.</P>
      <P>I was speaking of decentralisation and I suggest that, in the earlier stages of the arts, that decentralisation could easily be brought about in respect of places like Waterford, where we have schools.  If there was anything the Minister could do to help a development along those lines, it would relieve the congestion in Dublin and give people an opportunity of getting a considerable amount of education near their own homes.  I again press the Minister to reconsider the matter of the broadcasting of lessons in the schools.</P>

Tá fhios againn go léir gurb iad an dá bhliain deiridh is mó a ndéanaimid foghlaim, go mór mhór i gceantar nach bhfuil againn ach an t-aon scoil amháin&mdash;an scoil náisiúnta. <Col N="1136" /> Mar sin, mo bharúil-sa, ba cheart é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá mé cinnte go dtiocfaidh maith as agus go rachaidh sé i dtairbhe do na daoine lá is faide annon ná an lá inniu.</P>
      <P>Deir siad &ldquo;an rud a théann i bhfad go dtéann sé chun righneadais.&rdquo;  Mar sin chuaigh feisteadh agus déanamh scoileanna nua sa cheantar thiar den Ghaillimh chun righneadais.  Ach ó tháinig an tAire isteach chuir sé beagán bogadh ar an scéal a bhí ann.  Faoi láthair tá scoileanna nua dá dtógáil agus scoileanna dá bhfeisteadh agus scoileanna nua eile leagtha amach le tógáil.  Bíonn cuid de na daoine ag caitheamh ar na bainisteoirí i dtaobh gan scoileanna nua bheith dá dtógáil nó dá bhfeisteadh.  Is é mo bharúil-sa nach cóir seo.  Ní cóir é, ar chaoi ar bith, sa tír seo againne.  Tá na bainisteoirí sa cheantar sin ag déanamh a seacht míle dícheall le haghaidh na scoileanna nua d'fháil agus scoileanna d'fheisteadh agus na scoileanna nua a fhághann siad feistithe a choinneáil i gcóir.  Nuair a bhíonn an sagart ag iarraidh scoil nua a thógáil fághann sé anró mór ag iarraidh talamh feiliúnach d'fháil mar tá acraí talún sa cheantar sin againne gann.  Caithfidh siad íoc ar a son seo agus, chomh maith, cuid den chostas tógála a chur síos sul a molfar scoil a thógáil.  B'fhéidir go gceapann daoine nach bhfuiltear ag iarraidh ach beagán orthu, ach is é mo bharúil-sa gur deacair an beagán sin d'fháil sa gceantar sin, agus i go leor ceantracha eile.  Tá fhios agam áiteachta a gcaithfidh an sagart é d'íoc as a phóca féin.  Tugann na daoine obair laethanta gan páigh agus in aisce le haghaidh an dúshraith agus le haghaidh an talamh d'fheisteadh. Do réir mo bharúla, sa cheantar sin ba cheart an beagán seo, atá le cur síos roimh ré, a dhéanamh níos lú.</P>

Do réir mo bharúil-sa ba cheart ceann a bheith i ngach pobal. B'fhéidir nach dteastódh é bheith chomh ardnósach leis na scoileanna in áiteacha eile.  Ach tóg pobal Leitir Fraigh, pobal an Chlocháin, pobal Chloch na Rón, agus an Líonáin. Níl ceann i gceachtar acu.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil an oiread ceart acu sin scoil den tsórt sin a bheith acu agus tá ag na pobail taobh thoir de Ghaillimh, atá in aice meán-scoileanna.</P>

    <P>Focal faoi na drámaí, ba cheart rud eicínt faoi leith a leagan amach sa Ghaeltacht le haghaidh na ndrámaí seo.  Dhéanfadh sé maith an domhain gach pobal nó leath-phobal a chur suas in aghaidh a chéile le duaiseanna ar son na ndrámaí.  Nuair a bheadh dream an dráma dá bpiocadh piocfaí an duine is fearr a mbeadh intleacht aige.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I happen to have an almost incurably logical mind, I usually approach problems from a definite and logical stand point.  My attitude towards the teaching of the Irish language in <Col N="1139" /> the schools is simply this: If we can succeed in getting our people to speak the Irish language we should go ahead and do it.  If we cannot, there is no hope and we should abandon it and forget about it.  With that viewpoint, I have approached a number of young and active teachers and asked them do they believe it is possible, within a reasonable time, to get our people to speak the Irish language.  The majority of them have told me that they believe it is possible, but that we must change our methods.  I was surprised at the number of teachers who expressed that view.  I asked them what was wrong with the present system and they said that there was not sufficient oral teaching and practice of Irish in the schools.  They stated that there is too early an introduction of children to the writing and reading of Irish and that sufficient time is not devoted to oral instruction and practice.</P>
      <P>I think that there must be a good deal of logic in that suggestion.  A language that is not spoken in the homes is an innovation to children, and it must be brought to them in the simplest form possible.  If it is made difficult, if the burden is piled on too heavily, they will revolt against it and acquire a distaste for it.  I am told that the readers provided for most classes in Irish are rather too difficult for these particular classes.  I am told, and I would be inclined to agree, that it is wrong to expect children in the third and junior classes to be able to write a composition in Irish; that all these things add to a burden which children find it difficult to carry and that, as a result, they do not acquire a taste for the language but rather a strong distaste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it ought to be obvious that in the teaching of a new language, because Irish must be regarded as a new language to children who do not acquire it in their homes, the first objective should be to get the pupil to speak at least a few words of it. Mere hearing of a language alone is not sufficient.  I have been listening <Col N="1140" /> to many very able and eloquent speeches in Irish in this House during the last ten or 11 years and I am sorry to have to admit that I would not be able to reproduce one word or phrase of these speeches.  As the saying is in one American educational organisation, you have to learn to do by doing, and, in the same way, you have to learn to say by saying.  Children have to be introduced gradually to speaking a few words at a time until they eventually gain the confidence necessary to make them Irish speakers.  There is, I think, a timid approach on the part of pupils generally to this question.  There are people of various ages up to 30 or 40 who have got a chance to learn Irish at school and college and, while they may be able to read Irish books and literature, and may be able to write a considerable amount of Irish, they find great difficulty in speaking the language because they have never actually practised speaking it.  We all know that many brilliant conversationalists when they get up to speak on a public platform find themselves at a loss because that type of speaking is unfamiliar to them.  In the same way, while pupils may have acquired a considerable knowledge of Irish from reading and writing it, they find great difficulty in speaking it.  Therefore I think that whatever time is devoted to the teaching of Irish in schools should be devoted in a great measure to getting the children to speak the language. Even though some people may think that the time so spent should be utilised in learning to write the language and in learning the grammar and so forth, I think that what I suggest would be found to be not a waste of time but a most valuable step forward. The same remarks apply, in a great measure, to English.  I do not think that in the schools our children are allowed sufficient time for reading and recitation.  To my mind the whole art of learning depends upon being able to express oneself.  The better one is able to express oneself the more one is inclined to learn.  I think that the old hedge school teachers were ahead of us in that particular respect, inasmuch as they taught their pupils to recite whole chapters of classical literature and entire poems.  That <Col N="1141" /> had the effect of broadening the minds of their pupils and of giving them a sense of confidence in themselves, which is the first mark of a good education.  There is no point in children coming out of the primary schools or even out of the secondary schools with a vast amount of figures and facts and dates in their heads, if they are not able to express themselves fluently.  If they are not able to express themselves fluently I am afraid that very quickly they will forget everything they have learned. That is what is happening not only in regard to the Irish language but in regard to school subjects generally.</P>
    <P>A considerable number of teachers have informed me that the English school readers in use in the classes are rather too much for the classes for which they are intended.  The books are too large to be got through in a particular space of time.  The result is that they are more or less rushed through.  I feel that the minimum that is absolutely necessary should be taught but that it should be taught in such a way that it will never be forgotten by the pupils no matter how long they may live.  That applies to almost every subject.  We should try not to teach too much, but to teach a little and to teach it in such a way that it will never be forgotten.  In that way pupils will leave our primary schools, our secondary schools and our vocational schools with a certain amount of knowledge which they can stand over.  They can have absolute confidence in themselves and in the realisation that their knowledge cannot be challenged.  In that way character is formed and a sense of confidence is created in the minds of the pupils&mdash;a sense of confidence which lasts a lifetime.</P>
    <P>One of the great drawbacks of the present day is the fact that much of the teaching in our national schools is undone because of subsequent contacts which our young people make when they are out in the world.  Children who are leaving school&mdash;and even before children leave the primary schools&mdash;are brought into contact with foreign literature, foreign films and foreign radio programmes.  I do not believe in rigid compulsion in matters of this kind.  I <Col N="1142" /> do not believe in building a wall around this country or in putting our people in a glasshouse in order to protect them.  While we may take certain measures to protect ourselves, our approach, in the main, should be towards providing our people with an alternative entertainment and an added education in this country.  I am certain that we can produce in this country educational films and the types of radio education and radio entertainment that are so desirable.  I do not know how far it is within the Minister's sphere of responsibility to encourage the establishment in every parish of a hall which would be used not only for recreational purposes, but also for educational purposes.  In addition to whatever number of vocational schools which we may have, each parish should have a vocational educational establishment in the form of a parish hall, where practically all essential vocational subjects would be taught An effort should be made to enourage any natural interest of our own young people in drama, music and so on.</P>
    <P>I have always felt, and still feel, that there is not sufficient ground work given in history, particularly Irish history.  There is not sufficient enthusiasm aroused in our young people for the story of their own country and for history as it relates to each particular school area or parish.  Perhaps our English school readers should specialise more in this respect.  An effort should be made to arouse in the children a national consciousness, which is essential for their success in their native land and which also is a safeguard if they have to emigrate, as then they would carry with them an Irish outlook and viewpoint which would impress the outer world and redound to the benefit of their own country.  I have a feeling that we are not doing enough in this respect.  We must make the school subjects not too difficult. We must make a popular appeal to our young people that will encourage them to learn for learning's own sake.  Compulsion in any shape or form is of very little use.  While you may compel children to attend school, if you want to teach them you must arouse their interest and enthusiasm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> I have heard a good deal of criticism here and there through the country of the new Council of Education, not on the ground that any members of the council are lacking in the highest educational qualifications but on the ground that the council is hardly sufficiently representative of the various sections of our community.  While it may be said that education is purely a matter for educationists, it must be remembered that there are other people who ought to have some voice in its formulation and in the formulation of educational policy.</P>
    <P>Farmers often have complained about governmental commissions which were manned exclusively by non-farmers.  It would have been a good gesture if the Minister had retaliated, when establishing this council, by putting a few farmers on it.  A few people with practical knowledge of business would have been useful also.  I know the council intends to do what is best for education and I hope it will fully consider the question from every standpoint and do its utmost to improve the general standard of education.  Considering the vast sums that have been spent on education over the past 25 years, I do not think we have made the progress we should have made. This Council of Education will have to get down to the task vigorously and must be prepared to break away from old-established traditions and oldestablished regulations.</P>
    <P>I am not keen or enthusiastic about the proposition of teaching in our primary schools through the radio.  I feel that the personal contact between the teacher and the pupil is essential, but in a small way the radio might help, provided that the radio instruction was conducted by a person of outstanding merit.  There are some people who can talk so interestingly that they hold the attention of everyone, regardless of class or age.  There are very few such people.  It might be desirable if one or two such instructors were obtained and permitted to use the radio, with the co-operation of teachers.  That could be done only on a limited scale and could not to any <Col N="1144" /> great extent take the place of the teacher in the class.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been made by city Deputies during this debate on the overcrowding of the schools.  I have an entirely different complaint to make, that of undercrowding.  In my constituency I find that there are certain rural areas where the number of children is so small that it is impossible to continue to conduct the particular school.  I do not know what the minimum number is.  In one particular school it has been found impossible to obtain a teacher and for some months the children in that area have been left without any school.  I do not want any secrecy about the matter; the particular school is at Ballyraheen, County Wicklow.  There are less than 20 in that area for instruction and it has been found impossible to secure a teacher, as the district is a rather backward one and the teachers, like most modern people, prefer to live in more or less up-to-date surroundings. Having regard to the small number of pupils in that area, the best solution of the problem would be to provide a means of transport for those children to the nearest school.  There is one about five miles away which is exceptionally good, and the children would derive first-class instruction if they could be transported to that school.  In general principle, I am not in favour of closing down schools in small areas, except where the population is very low.  In this case the population is so low that the children's interests would be better served by conveying them to the nearest national school.</P>
    <P>There is one matter with which I am not very familiar, but which has been the subject of complaint.  That is, that teachers who have obtained the Ard Teastas do not rank for the purposes of remuneration as being equal to teachers who have a university degree. If that is so, I do not think it is right. As the Ard Teastas is regarded as a very high educational attainment and is not easy to obtain, teachers who have acquired it should be classed as being equal to those who have the Bachelor of Arts degree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> There is another matter that has been the subject of considerable complaint on the part of teachers, namely, that ambitious and progressive teachers who are anxious for promotion and who sit for examinations are required to pay a fee of two guineas for each examination.  Only one or two teachers are promoted as a result of the examination and there is no established waiting list.  The same teachers are called back for the next examination, and so on.  Some teachers have spent a considerable proportion of their salaries in fees for such examinations.  Surely it should be possible to establish a waiting list on the results of each examination so that the same teachers would not be called up again and again.  There is some weight in that complaint as I have heard it from a number of sources.</P>

      <P>This is the most important Estimate that comes before the Dáil because it deals with the unformed and impressionable mind of the child.  It is very important that all the surroundings of the child during its school years should be of the best.  The child who has spent seven or eight years of its life in an unrepaired, damp and badly lighted school will in later life be rather careless, probably, about its home surroundings. A child who has been in a school&mdash;a new school for preference&mdash;that is bright and cheerful, will have a cheerful outlook on life and will be able to do his lessons very much better.  Therefore, I would asked the Minister to get more schools sanctioned and to get schools that have already been sanctioned built as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of new schools, it is important that the playgrounds should be adequate.  The county councils provide an acre of land for every rural cottage.  It seems to me that it is just as important that schools should have adequate playgrounds.  There is also the question of water supply. <Col N="1146" /> Wherever possible, flush lavatories should be supplied in the schools.  I am thinking of a town like Killorglin, for instance, where a water supply passes the national school but water is not laid on.  I would ask the Minister to pay particular attention to those two points.</P>
    <P>Education should not be confined to the abstract but should embrace practical instruction as well.  That is where vocational schools come in.  They play a very important part in rural Ireland. The number of children attending technical schools has increased very much in recent years.  That is the best test of the good education given in those schools.  What use is it to a girl, for instance, to know the cause and effect of every war in history if she cannot cook and cannot look after a home with method?  The same applies to a boy.  A boy who has been through a rural science course will probably be a good scientific farmer.  If he has been through a woodwork course, he will be able to make things on the farm and in the home.  Therefore, he will be an asset to the country.</P>
    <P>One of the things that is hampering the spread of technical education is the lack of teachers.  It seems to be a sure passport to matrimony for a girl to go through a domestic economy course because the Vocational Education Committee, of which I am a member, appoint a girl and, within three or four months, we are congratulating her on her marriage.  I hope that the Minister will be able to do something about supplying more teachers for vocational schools.</P>
    <P>While I am in favour of the scheme, which several Deputies have suggested, of adding rooms to national schools to be used for technical education, that should be only a stop-gap.  It would be much more valuable to build a new school, because of the psychological effect on the child.  If children go back to the national school where they have spent a number of years they do not feel that they are going on to something better, whereas, when they go to a technical school, they feel that they are really getting to be grown up, and that has a good psychological <Col N="1147" /> effect on their work.  I hope that when requests for more vocational schools come to the Minister he will treat them very sympathetically.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a village in Kerry, Rathmore.  It is a growing village. It has a creamery and a factory.  The factory employs over 100 people.  The families of those workers need technical education very badly.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will consider that when the matter comes to him.</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse the remarks of Deputy Mrs. Crowley.  I agree that this is the most important Estimate that comes up for discussion. We need an entirely new attitude towards education.  One of the faults I have with the present method of education is that it is simply training people to conform to their environment and to the conditions of presentday life.  It does not give the pupils an idea of their obligations to the community when they leave school.  I regret the lack of social sense amongst the children.  Sometimes I ask children of 16 and 17 years of age if they ever got any lesson or lecture on citizenship or their social obligations to the community.  They got none whatever. That is one of the reasons for the lack of sense of citizenship, especially among children leaving school.  I agree with Deputy Mrs. Crowley that, if we do not make the schools attractive, we cannot expect much from the children afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was reading the report of the Medical Officer for County Donegal recently.  I was amazed at the report there of the conditions in the schools. I also read the report of the Medical Officer of Roscommon and really you could hardly credit that we could have such conditions in our schools as we have in these country places.  I went to another country school and it was a most depressing thing to see the children at their play hour and as far as the sanitary conditions were concerned you would think you were in some foreign country.  Like Deputy Mrs. Crowley, I wonder if children spend seven or eight years in that environment, what we can expect from <Col N="1148" /> them in their habits and in their outlook on life when they leave school.  I am not going to lay the blame on the Minister-no matter what Minister&mdash; for the conditions in our country schools, but the managers in charge of them have a lot to answer for when they allow such conditions.  I visited a school recently in the South of Ireland and really these little children were depressing to see.  The day was bad and as far as I could see there was no means of drying the wet clothes they brought with them.  Are we really doing our best in the prevention of illness among growing children if we neglect those items?</P>
    <P>I was rather surprised that I did not hear from the Minister what is to be done for talented boys and girls who have not the opportunity or means to reach the university.  I have from time to time seen parents who got appeals from teachers to leave a certain boy or girl in school because of their latent talent, but when they reach 14 years of age they are taken from school because of economic necessity and the next thing we find is that they are in a factory.  Has the Minister got figures to show what percentage of our children reach the college through State grants compared with England or other countries?  What means are offered to the poor man's child who has latent talent to reach the place he is entitled to reach because of that talent but which he cannot reach because of his parents' economic circumstances? We can have no true education in this country unless talented boys and girls are permitted to reach the university.  I often think that children who have a big amount of money spent on their college education have no more merit for such education than the poor child with talent who is compelled to go to the national school.</P>
    <P>I wonder have we not a system of class education.  I see children going to different schools and I feel we are developing class distinction in the growing children of our country.  It is very hard to explain.  I do not object to children being sent to a school where their parents want to <Col N="1149" /> send them and where they will get good example and good ideas of life, but we have too much class distinction in our system of education.  Children who must go to the national school and who are full of latent talent cannot go beyond that, while children whose parents have a certain income can go to a school which is thought good and desirable.  No chance is given to the poor children.</P>

      <P>When I see that a certain uniform and a certain tie must be worn&mdash;and it is very much adhered to &mdash;in some schools as against the poor children in the national school, I cannot convince myself that we have a genuine system of education in this country.</P>
      <P>Then we have the unfortunate position of children who are taken from school at 14 years of age and sent off to work as messenger boys or in a factory.  A certain figure was recorded the other day at the opening of a school in Dublin.  It was stated that over 1,000 girls between the age of 14 and 15 were employed in two industries alone in Dublin.  Surely anybody who has knowledge of what children are and how underdeveloped their minds are at 14 must wonder what we can expect from them in any aspect of life. I would like to see the Minister giving an opportunity to boys and girls who have latent talent to go to the university.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, I cannot speak Irish, but I know children who have got honours in Irish and the regrettable thing about it is that they cannot be got to speak the language in their own homes or among themselves.  When I ask them why they have not a greater regard for Irish they simply say: &ldquo;Ah, there is no need for it; we are tired of hearing it in school.&rdquo;  What we want is an inducement in the schools <Col N="1150" /> and a greater effort to inspire the children with a love for the language. I do not blame the teachers, because I find that in some schools when the teacher meets the pupils they speak only Irish.  There is need for a campaign to give children who leave school a desire for the language and love for it.</P>
    <P>I agree with what some speakers have said about history.  I have seen children studying the history of the 17th and 18th and 19th centuries, but ask them about what happened in 1916, what led up to it or what happened since and they have not the remotest idea.  I think that is wrong. Boys and girls of 15 or 16 who are about to go out in the world should have a knowledge of these things.  I happened to be on a certain board where girls were being examined to become nurses.  Some questions were asked about Irish history and their answers were deplorable.  Probably if we had asked them something about the 18th or 19th century we might have got intelligent answers, but some of the answers on Irish history were the most deplorable thing you could witness. The time has come, in my opinion, when this matter should be revised.</P>
    <P>I would like to say also that I am afraid that the Minister and his Department and the Government as a whole have not taken sufficient notice of the evil effects of the cinema and the radio.  I often wonder why we have not made more use of the radio than we have in the matter of education. I do not know if we have engaged in the important work of giving educational talks not only for children but for the people as a whole. I have listened to such talks from other countries and found them enlightening and interesting but I have never heard anything enlightening or interesting from our radio, and that is a matter of which the Minister should take cognisance.  I do not go to the cinema more than once in two years, but I know people who go, especially children, and I see what they see at the cinema re-enacted when they come out.  That shows the effect of the cinema on the minds of the children. <Col N="1151" /> I did go to the cinema one night recently just to take myself off the street.  I was shocked to find that the picture shown dealt with nothing but violence and robbery and that we have no censorship of this kind of film which may be shown to children is a shocking state of affairs.  I remember going to a cinema two years ago and all I saw during the whole show was the activities of gangsterdom, with gangsters shooting each other most of the time.  What kind of influence have such films on young persons, and especially boys of 14 or 15 who cannot find employment or find something at which they can usefully occupy themselves?</P>
    <P>These are matters of which we ought to take very serious notice from an educational point of view and the time has arrived when we shall have to get our schools to give lessons, or some kind of instruction, on citizenship to boys and girls from, say, ten to 14 or 15 years of age.  I suggest seriously also that we raise the school-leaving age to 16.  It is a terrible thing to see these boys and girls leaving school at the age of 14 and unable to find any place for themselves until they are 17 or 18.  I have seen children on the streets, often in very dangerous places, and when asked their age, they say they are 14 years and so many months old.  When you ask if they are going to school, they tell you that they have not gone to school for the past four or five months, and I suggest, therefore, that the school-leaving age be raised to 16.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch spoke about the one day school being such a marvellous success.  I have been told it is a success, but I personally do not believe it is. I am merely expressing a personal view when I say that, but I feel that a boy or girl going to school one day in the week is not doing the work necessary from an educational point of view.  We have messenger boys going to these schools and we find very often that these boys, having been four or five hours at school, have to go back and carry on their jobs as messenger boys. We have all sorts of evasions being practised.  The system operates in Cork City, but does not apply to the <Col N="1152" /> suburbs, and if a commercial firm wants a messenger boy&mdash;they cannot take him unless they are agreeable to allow him to go to school one day&mdash; they take him from outside the city area and he can remain at his job without going to school.  That is not what we should aim at.</P>
    <P>We need a definitely different attitude to education and it is only when we get people thinking on right lines that we will get right action. Undoubtedly our country is suffering to-day from a lack of enlightened public opinion and it appears to me that we will require almost another resurgence in this country to bring about the necessary changes.  I am afraid we cannot talk about a proper system of education while we leave the mass of our children without the means of developing their talents, and, until these means are provided for them, I am not satisfied that our system of education is sound.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the people of the country are satisfied with the interest displayed here in education and I think I can say with confidence that, since I came into the Dáil, that has always been the case. For generations before our time, the people of this country were denied education.  Every effort was made by the then Government to see that facilities for education would not exist.  That created a very great hunger for education when we got the opportunity of providing it, and it may be perhaps that we forgot some of the fundamentals in our eagerness to get on with the development of education.  The national school is the place where education begins and I agree entirely with Deputy Mrs. Crowley that it is on the first day a child enters that school that his impressions in life begin.  So far as County Meath is concerned, we have made a decided effort to set up new, clean and neat schools, but they are only a few.  A large number of the schools are not what anybody could call edifying.  They are not clean, because it is not possible to clean them, and very often they are not heated.  The surroundings are not presentable and, in most cases, are unclean. If we could spend a little more <Col N="1153" /> money in that direction rather than on other forms of education, it might be much better and have a much better effect on our youth.</P>
      <P>I notice that in the schools there are no formal ceremonies in relation to training in good citizenship.  Now and again, the children do sing the national anthem, but seldom do they hear anything of modern history. Sometimes they reach the secondary school and pass their final examinations there, but know little or nothing about modern history.  The modern history of a country, its national anthem, and its flag are things which are used in normal countries to cultivate what one might call proper citizenship, and I think it is a matter the Minister ought to consider.  We will have, I hope, a peaceable world for another couple of years, and during those years the Minister ought to give serious consideration to it.  Above all, every effort should be made to provide better and cleaner schools, and the expenditure of money on other aspects of education might be curtailed for the moment in order that they might be provided.</P>
      <P>In former years, the principal function of the elementary or primary school was the teaching of the three R's, and older people have spoken of a famous book, &ldquo;Reading Made Easy.&rdquo;  Perhaps, as I said at the beginning, we have tried to advance too much and too rapidly, and enough attention may not be given to the teaching of what were known as the three R's.  After all, if children have learned reading, writing and arithmetic fairly well, they can almost educate themselves afterwards.  Seeing children at their lessons, I sometimes feel that somebody must have pushed them too rapidly, and that we want to get them on too quickly.  That should not be allowed to happen.  The speed of teaching in the schools and the development of different subjects should be curtailed somewhat, and the children given a longer time to study what we often speak of as the three R's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are undergoing lately a big change in this country.  Formerly the <Col N="1154" /> national schools had only to teach what they called Civil Service writing and certain other subjects to suit the Civil Service.  We are now becoming industrial and that must bring about a change in our educational system.  Our vocational schools were meant to help the people over that change and prepare them for the new developments that have been taking place.  Our vocational schools have been reasonably well attended.  It is true that we cannot distribute them all over the rural areas, that we can only have them in centres such as towns.  But it is a pity that these schools are not made more useful.  It is also true, of course, that if the children make use of these schools they may have to emigrate.  For years to come I believe we will have a good number of people emigrating.  When I see children emigrating who have attended vocational schools and learned how to use their hands and their brains, I feel that it is not exactly so sad and grievous to see these children going away once they have something to equip them for work other than sweeping crossings. It was the want of that system of education formerly which compelled a great number of our boys and girls to become domestic servants in slums, and to sweep crossings in the big cities of Great Britain and the United States.  With the advent of the vocational schools, we have the consolation, anyway, that if they have to go they go prepared to defend themselves and compel people in other countries to think more about them.  Therefore, the system of vocational education is one that we should make every effort to develop.</P>
    <P>That, of course, is on the industrial side.  But there is another side to the matter, and that is the agricultural side.  My experience has been that there was considerable difficulty between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Education so far as the teaching of rural science and other agricultural subjects were concerned.  When we got the opportunity in County Meath we took over what were supposed to be large farms with houses on them for the purpose of <Col N="1155" /> agricultural education.  That was quite a sensible idea, although there were great objections to it.  Young farmers' clubs are now being developed and they are clamouring for some place in which experiments can be carried out or short courses given to their members.  There is a splendid opportunity now for the two Departments to come together and see what can be done about that matter.  You will have the farmers' sons then being trained somewhat scientifically in agriculture and the girls who go abroad trained in domestic economy.  Other young fellows who may go abroad or stay at home will be trained in different technical matters.</P>
    <P>I should also like to make some reference to the National Museum which, I take it, comes under Science and Art.  That is an extremely good museum.  I do not think there are better ones in many parts of the world. I have seen quite a number of them and I think ours is an excellent museum. There are, however, more objects hidden below in the cellars than are exposed in the museum, because the staff is not able to deal with them.  An effort should be made to provide extra staff for the museum and give the numerous people who go in there, an opportunity of seeing these ancient objects.  I have also noticed in the last year or so, that the number of objects handed over to the museum has diminished very seriously.  The museum has not any other means of getting such objects except through the good will of people who find them.  There should be, therefore, some form of propaganda in that respect because quite a lot of people come here to see the objects in that museum.</P>
    <P>Then there is the National Art Gallery.  I have not been there for a long time, but there are excellent pictures in the gallery. I am told, however, by some people connected with it that some of the best pictures are stored in the cellar.  It may be that they are not at liberty to hang these pictures on the walls of the gallery or that the light is not suitable.  I do not mind that so much, but what I am concerned about <Col N="1156" /> is that there is a number of young people employed in this city who went to some of the vocational schools down the country and efforts were made to get loans of pictures from artists in Dublin to cultivate the taste of these people for good pictures.  Some of these people are civil servants and others are engaged in business houses.  They do not get out until 5 or 5.30 in the evening and at that time they find the doors of the gallery are locked securely.  I think the Minister should see that the gallery is left open until 9 or 10 p.m., especially when summer time is in force.  I know there are quite a number of people in the city anxious to spend a few hours of their leisure in looking at these pictures.  That gallery also draws a great number of tourists to this country.  It helps in the cultivation of art and I think we should do our utmost to see that that is done.</P>
    <P>As I said, however, we should begin with the schools and see that they are kept neat and clean and, so far as possible, that new schools are provided. The school is one of the first places a child goes into outside his home. The very moment he goes inside he gets an impression.  If it is a good one, it remains; if it is a bad one, it also remains.  The Minister has a very heavy responsibility.  There is a big interest taken in education.  I am sure that the present Minister takes just as deep an interest in education as all Ministers for Education have taken. It may be due to the hunger which existed for education, but my experience is that we may have gone too fast and expected too much.  I hear a lot of people talking about the cultivation and development of the Irish language. That is another example of expecting too much in a short time.  We cannot expect to hear Irish spoken generally in this country until the mother with the child on her knee begins to speak Irish to the child.  The first language a child hears is the language it learns. No matter what country we may happen to live in, if the child's nurse belongs to that country her language is the first language that the child will speak.  Therefore, I think we should not be over-anxious.  We should do <Col N="1157" /> our best to do things well and properly and whatever we do we should do well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree entirely with Deputy O'Reilly that the basis of our primary education should be what was originally known as the three R's.  I think the curiculum in the primary schools should change with the vocational school.  For instance, on the seaboard, elementary astronomy and elementary navigation should be taught as it was in the old schools.  Again, say, in an agricultural area, elementary lessons in rural science should be given.  The basis, however, of primary education should be the three R's.</P>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister and his predecessors on the serious efforts which have been made to build new schools and to repair existing schools.  But, having built these new schools and having repaired existing schools, they should now concentrate on the cleaning of the schools. The method of cleansing national schools in rural Ireland is really primitive. We depend entirely upon the older children to give superficial cleaning to the schools.  Parents do not object to that, but they do object to the sanitary accommodation being cleaned by their children.  It is a fact that managers are very slack in supervising the cleansing of the school itself and of the sanitary accommodation attached.  A small grant should be provided by the Department for the cleansing of each school during the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only speak for County Donegal, but in respect of that county I should like to say that the School Attendance Act is not being enforced.  I am told by the Garda authorities that there are two reasons, (1) that the Garda stations are understaffed and (2) that some district justices are too lenient in dealing with these offences under the School Attendance Act.  These are minor offences in the beginning.  However, the Minister should seriously consider the institution of proceedings, say, on the strength of a certificate or affidavit or declaration by the national school teacher or principal as to the non-attendance of a particular pupil. <Col N="1158" /> That would do away with the necessity for the attendance of a Garda, firstly, in the school and later in court.  After all, he can only testify as to what the school teacher has told him.  In the event of the facts of a case being investigated, the school teacher could himself do that by affidavit or declaration. The Minister should seriously consider the institution of such proceedings. I believe it would improve attendance at the national schools in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>As an Ulsterman, I should like to bring to the notice of the Minister the lack of primary readers in the Ulster dialect of the Irish language for the province.  There is no doubt whatever about it, we people in the Ulster Gaeltacht have a dialect of our own.  We find it most difficult to acquire and to read and to write the dialect in which some of our primary standard readers are produced.  Perhaps if the Minister would consider the setting up of, say, a small commission of three or four school teachers to go into the whole point and advise him, it might be for the benefit of the language generally and to the advantage of the students attending primary schools, particularly in Donegal.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Little that we should concentrate more on vocational schools.  Let me not be misinterpreted when I say that university education is the curse of rural Ireland.  It is the ambition of the parents of every child in rural Ireland to provide for their son or daughter a university education. They neglect and look down upon the vocational school where the children could acquire some trade which would be much more advantageous to them than an honours or a pass degree from a university, without a profession. One particular branch of vocational education which is seriously neglected is that of navigation and marine engineering.  For the seaboard counties of the country we should concentrate on vocational education for prospective candidates for our merchant fleet and navy.  I know that the boat yards do something in that respect, but it is not sufficient.  We require teaching in marine engineering and navigation.  I am certain that if the Minister considers <Col N="1159" /> the matter he will do all he possibly can.</P>
    <P>A Deputy complained of the lack of the parochial hall in rural Ireland. The answer to that complaint is that the Public Dance Halls Act did away with the parochial hall.  Prior to the introduction of that Act every schoolhouse in the country was a dance hall. It was the meeting place of the local dramatic society.  The céilís and dances of the parish used to be held there.  These schools are no longer eligible for a licence under the Public Dance Halls Act.  The result is that we have driven the people who used to attend these rural schools into the dance halls in the big towns.  The Minister and the Government should seriously consider permitting public dances and public céilís to be held in these unlicensed schools&mdash;just as the Army are permitted to hold dances and public céilís in the sluagh halls all over the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is agreed that, after the home, the school is the place where a child's character is moulded. Hence, it is very necessary, as other speakers have stated, that a good impression should be created on the mind of the child while he is at school. To accomplish that end certain fundamental things require to be done.  In the first place, the school should be in a good state of repair and properly equipped.  Special attention will have to be given to the shocking problem of sanitation in rural schools.  The previous Government and the previous Minister did their best to cope with that problem and I would urge the present Minister to give immediate attention to the matter.  I know he is doing his best but the position is extremely serious.  If possible, a grant should be provided by the Department to enable the managers of the schools to deal with the problem.  Several instances, in County Dublin, have been brought to my notice.  It is very tiring and very distressing to hear so many complaints about the matter.  Parents feel very strongly about it.  I am sure it would be possible to provide a special grant for the cleaning of schools.  We hear a lot of talk about <Col N="1160" /> hygiene and the elimination of disease, yet we still have the problem of sanitation in rural schools to contend with. Is has been a problem in the past and it is now a problem which the present Minister will have to solve.</P>
      <P>As well as having a good school and good surroundings, we must have contented school teachers.  A school teacher to-day, who takes his job seriously and who is a teacher by vocation, has a very heavy responsibility. The moulding of the character of the child is in his hands, as well as in those of the family.  He must try to make the child a good citizen who loves his country and who will stand up for his religion.  He must try to fit him for the world as best he can, whether he be in primary or secondary school.  To do that, the conditions of the teacher must be good. I have spoken for a number of years about this particular matter, and I must say now that when the Roe Commission was set up I thought, and teachers thought, that their case was settled for once and for all.  It is a pity, in the interests of the Irish nation, that the findings of that Commission were not accepted.  I believe we would have benefited and that posterity would have benefited.  To make a man do things properly in any walk of life, that man should be paid to do the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a problem on the outskirts of Dublin, in my own area, in Walkinstown, where we have over 1,000 houses, in a fast-growing area, and no school.  The manager in that area is a most hard-working clergyman who has very big responsibilities over the last few years, as a result of the city expanding towards that area. This problem occurs also in other fast-growing areas like Crumlin, and even out around Santry.  In Walkinstown, fathers and mothers have told me that they cannot get schools for their children, as the local national school is overcrowded.  If the Minister for Education, in conjunction with the ecclesiastical authorities responsible for the building of schools in those areas, could see his way to come along with a 100 per cent. grant in cases like that, it would make an enormous <Col N="1161" /> improvement in the position.  It is beyond the resources of such a growing parish to provide the money, as it cannot be organised like an old parish.  The people are coming in from other parishes and the same family life does not exist, as they are all new to one another.  The schools manager has a big problem there, and I strongly recommend to the Minister and his Department to see what can be done to alleviate any sufferings or inconveniences, of which there are many at the present time, in this partucular area of Walkinstown, County Dublin.  It is the area which has been brought under my notice most at the present time.</P>
    <P>There is a problem we have not dealt with in this country yet, that of the backward or handicapped child.  In every school in Ireland we have the bright child, the average child and the child handicapped through no fault of his own.  That child cannot keep up even with the average child, but has to carry on, and he or she gets disheartened after a while.  I wonder if the Minister or the Department could see if, in large schools in the city, there is a possibility of developing on lines where, in the same school, proper segregation of the children would take place, so that the 1 per cent. or 2 per cent. very slow to learn could be put into a separate class.  That would mean that the children in that class would be somewhat similar and they would get encouragement and no child would feel discouraged.  The backward child or handicapped child, one slow in grasping the ordinary subjects, will naturally become discouraged when placed with bright pupils or even average pupils.  In fitting these backward children for the world afterwards, a lot of harm has been done in that way.</P>
    <P>I myself remember attending Gaelic League classes and the first discouraging thing I remember was when, one night, four native speakers came into the class.  They started to speak fluently in the language and the class &mdash;there were about 20 or more in it&mdash; became discouraged right off the reel. They were all similar in the class, all trying to learn the language, and the <Col N="1162" /> few people who had the advantages of knowing it, as a result of accident of birth, were far superior to us, discouraged some of the pupils there. The same parallel can be found with the backward child.  The time is ripe now to make a trial in our city schools. We have the opportunity of putting a classroom aside, even if we had only ten backward children.  They could be put together and given the opportunity they deserve as citizens of the country. I strongly recommend to the Minister to try and do that.  Both backward children and others who cannot attend school, and who are not getting any chance to do anything in the world afterwards, have to try and carry on at present.  Other countries have tried to adapt themselves to this problem. Trained psychologists have attended at schools and psychiatrists have tried to deal with such children and help them to improve their prospects.</P>
    <P>With reference to vocational education, no one can speak too highly of the wonderful work that has been done throughout the country in our vocational schools.  I look upon them as the poor man's university.  I am very sorry that we have not a greater public spirit abroad amongst parents and children that would encourage boys and girls on leaving the national school at 14 to attend the technical school at night, if they are working during the daytime, and so try to improve themselves as best they can.  There should be a campaign to encourage our people to attend vocational schools.  In rural Ireland centres of education may be remote and children may have a long distance to go, but county committees of education are trying to facilitate pupils living in remote areas by having vocational classes at night in the national school.</P>
    <P>With reference to national history, Deputy Matthew O'Reilly made a very good point.  It is very desirable that children should know the history of their country.  Very little interest is taken in that matter by some children. I would make an appeal to the teachers, and would ask the Department to appeal to the teachers, to ensure that children will have a greater interest in our traditional history and <Col N="1163" /> that they will visit museums and various other national monuments.  The child who does not know something about his country and its history is losing a great deal.  The Minister should very seriously consider the point made by Deputy Matthew O'Reilly about the National Gallery.  As a rule, the museum and the National Gallery are closed at 5 p.m.  To keep them open until a later hour might possibly entail having more staff, but why not employ more staff if it would allow those people who are working all day an opportunity of visiting these places in the evening?  In that way parents could bring their children to these places and thus develop in them an interest in history and national culture.</P>
    <P>There is another problem, the problem of overcrowding in schools. Teachers have told me about the number of pupils in a class.  It is a very serious problem, because a teacher who is overworked by having too many pupils cannot do justice to the children.</P>
    <P>The question of the school-leaving age was raised in this debate.  That matter has been discussed since 1944. To give every child a chance, the school-leaving age should be raised to at least 15.  I would like to see that problem considered further.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Council of Education, I feel the Department possibly have missed some very fine points.</P>

      <P>As this Estimate has been discussed so fully, I intend to say very little.  The few points that I wish to draw attention to have been mentioned by other Deputies, but they are of such importance that it is well to repeat them.  The first point that I wish to make is in connection with the question of proper and adequate supply of piped water and the improvement of the sanitary arrangements in national schools.  There is credit due to the present Minister and to past Ministers and the Department for the work done in providing schools but, even now, the conditions that prevail in some national schools are appalling. It is a pity that even where splendid new schools have been built they are still without these amenities.</P>
      <P>In Cork County and South Cork, in which, naturally, I am most interested, there are instances of splendid schools that have been built and in connection with which the local people are financially handicapped in trying to provide a proper water supply.  It would be a great help if it were possible for the Department, in conjunction with another Department, to make a grant available for the purpose of providing these necessary amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that I am concerned with is the question of delays in connection with the building of new schools.  I have been interested in some such cases, as I am sure other Deputies have been.  While we may be worried about the delays, I want to say, in fairness to the Department and also in fairness to the Board of Works, who must move slowly, some avoidable delays are caused locally and not in the Department.  It would be well if it were known generally throughout the country that some of these avoidable delays could easily be obviated if the local school managers woke up a little more to their responsibilities.  I fully realise what I am saying when I say that and fully realise the responsibility that is on them.  I say it in fairness to boys and girls who have to remain all day long in these condemned schools and in fairness to the teachers <Col N="1165" /> who have to teach in them.  I think it is a pity at times that locally the responsibility resting on certain people is not considered of such importance that they would see that sites are made available far more quickly than they are at the present time.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to mention briefly is the question, not so much of school books themselves, but of their cost.  It would be of great advantage if it were possible not to have so many complete changes in national school books.  I know a man with a family and it is a very heavy burden on him when one child progresses luckily enough and the next child comes into the place vacated by his senior and has to get new school books.  If the books were considered adequate for the elder child they should be adequate for the second child.  It is very hard to see that books bought at a high price in one year are not of any use to the next member of the family the next year.</P>
    <P>The next question, one that has been referred to by other speakers, is the question of the grants for cleaning schools.  I can understand the Minister's position but if it were possible to make the grants a little larger it would be a great help.  I myself as one member of this House have spent a lot of time at school&mdash;in the national school, thanks be to God.  I never saw the inside of any university college and I am not interested in them, but I know enough about national schools and I had to spend my time sweeping the dust after the day's work with the other lads.  I think it would be only fair to make these grants adequate to employ a proper person and have the schools properly cleaned.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to say that I thoroughly agree with the views of Deputy O'Donnell from Donegal in so far as he drew attention to the necessity of having a line of education in the national schools corresponding to the regions where the children are born, reared and educated.  After all, it would be of great advantage to children in a sea-board area if they got some little instruction on maritime work.  In some sea-board parts of Cork <Col N="1166" /> many boys as they grow to the years of manhood, face the broad Atlantic. Thank God we have ships of our own now, but some naturally enough take their place in foreign ships.  It would be an advantage for them if they could be taught a little of the science necessary in that occupation.  They are depending on what little knowledge they may get from older people who have spent their lives at sea.  In rural areas where the primary occupation is agriculture, it would be of great advantage to children if they could be taught something about it at school.  Often fathers and mothers who have heavy expenses already must send their children to a city school when they finish at the national school.  It seems, often ultimately, to be the case that when such a child finishes at his city school, having improved in education and perhaps shown brilliance, on account of the state of the market, no employment is available to him.  If those children in the country could be brought up in accordance with the general state of the area, it would be a great help and it might be one means ultimately to help the younger generation as they come to manhood to place more reliance on their own state of life and realise the importance of rural life and it might eventually stem the movement into the cities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is right that the Estimate for the Department of Education should be discussed in a completely non-controversial atmosphere and I do not want to bring an atmosphere of controversy into this discussion, but I do think that it is due to the Minister and the Government as a whole to correct some of the misleading impressions which may have been created by some Deputies in the course of this discussion.  One matter on which a certain number of misleading comments were made was the national teachers and the Roe Commission. Not only many Deputies on the opposite benches but some Deputies on these benches referred, and referred repeatedly, to the fact that the Minister turned down the proposals in the majority report of the Roe Commission.  I do not think that is so or that it states the facts <Col N="1167" /> accurately at all.  The Minister accepted a great number of these proposals, and I think it would be as well, if the Deputies want to discuss this matter in an atmosphere devoid of controversy, that they should also do it in a spirit of accuracy when they are dealing with a matter which has raised a certain amount of controversy outside.  The Minister has in many respects adopted the majority report of the Roe Commission; in particular respects he did not adopt them.  I certainly do not grudge any man, particularly, perhaps most particularly of all, members of the teaching profession, a decent living salary, but I do want to express my confidence in the Minister and Government as a result of the particular way in which they met the situation arising out of the teachers' demands for increased salaries.  I think it was the duty of the Government in the circumstances existing at that time and which still exist to take an over-all view of the picture and to consider the entire economic and financial position of the country and the capacity of the taxpayers in relation to this matter.  That is what the Minister and the Government did, and I believe they were perfectly right.  I trust if Deputies are sincerely desirous of being helpful in discussions on teachers and education that they will at least make allowances for the number of items in the majority report which the Minister accepted.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister himself, when opening this discussion, mentioned the admission of the principle of equality in pay for male and female teachers.  He drew attention to the fact that the admission of that principle was without precedent not only in this country but in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well.  Personally&mdash;and again I do speak personally&mdash;I do not believe that it is a good principle to have admitted for very many reasons into which I do not propose to go in detail now.  I feel that in accepting that principle the Government went a very long way in meeting one of the matters for which teachers had agitated over a long number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also the improved pensions <Col N="1168" /> scheme which is proposed by the Minister and marriage gratuities and allowances.  Even before the Roe Commission sat, the Minister had gone a long way towards meeting the viewpoints of the teachers' representatives in respect of a number of the matters of which they complained.  Taken all in all, I think the Minister deserves the wholehearted congratulation of Deputies for the manner in which he has improved relations between the Department and the teaching profession. It is, I suppose, true, and probably will always be true, that some grievances still exist, that something more will always be demanded than can be given.  That is a very natural state of affairs which probably will always exist.</P>
    <P>In connection with the Council of Education, I believe the Minister should be congratulated on the work he has done.  I am one of those Deputies who, at this time last year, urged on the Minister the necessity of approaching the matter of the Council of Education along somewhat different lines from those on which he has approached it.  I felt that there was a definite demand from parents' associations and such bodies that the ordinary parent should be represented on the council.  I heard what the Minister had to say about it, not only in opening this discussion but elsewhere before that, and I feel no sense of embarrassment at all in admitting that I am quite convinced by the point of view the Minister has put before us. I think the Minister has probably got the type of Council of Education which will be most helpful to him and to the interests of education.</P>
    <P>It occurred to me in listening to a number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Burke and, I think, Deputy Cogan, who pleaded for a broader type of representation on the council by which the viewpoint of the ordinary farmer or other sections of the people would be heard, that, in fact, if you combine in your mind the Council of Education and the Dáil in its discussions of the Education Estimate and other matters in connection with the Department which may arise from <Col N="1169" /> time to time, you have in this Assembly a broader Council of Education, a council consisting of 148 members representative of all shades of opinion throughout the country.  The Minister has always approached the discussion of his Estimate in this way, that he felt he wanted the Dáil to criticise him if they thought he should be criticised, in a constructive way, and to endeavour to assist him and his Department in the best interests of education.  If these Deputies accept the Minister as being sincere in that desire and co-operate with him in the manner he would desire, we can safely assume that the Council of Education which the Minister has nominated will perform very adequately, more than adequately, the tasks which will confront it.  The Minister, on the other hand, will have the views of the Deputies representing the various sections of the people expressed here in the House.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion, as is only natural, of the question of the revival of the Irish language.  I expressed the belief last year, and I express it again now, that a system of teaching children through Irish, when they do not understand the language properly, is not popular with either the children or the parents.  I think it was Deputy Butler who last year said he found that parents in Dublin City did take a pride in the accomplishment of their children who were able to talk Irish and to talk English.  I wish I could agree with Deputy Butler in that.  My experience as a Deputy in Dublin City is that the parents are definitely against what has become known as the system of compulsory Irish.  The reason they are against it is not that they are against the Irish language and not that they are in any way unpatriotic or anti-Irish, but merely the feeling they have&mdash;whether it is right or wrong, I am no judge&mdash;that the children are not being properly educated in a number of other subjects which they believe to be vital to the children.  I have frequently heard the complaint that the children are educated neither in Irish nor in English.  I merely express that viewpoint for the consideration of the <Col N="1170" /> Minister.  I know that there is no man in this Dáil who has more at heart the interests of both parents and children in this matter of education, and, in a very particular sense, the revival of the Irish language, than the Minister.</P>
    <P>Various suggestions have been madefrom time to time, designed to assist in the revival of the language, and one made here by a number of Deputies certainly appeals to me, that we should make an endeavour to extend the use of both the films and the printed word in this connection.  Most of our daily newspapers &mdash; which, incidentally, I might as well say, before the Chair pulls me up, are not under the control of the Minister&mdash;carry articles in Irish and endeavour to assist in that way. I should like to see some newspaper with the courage to come out as an entirely bilingual newspaper, with the Irish translation of the news either immediately above or below the English version.  It is necessary, if we are to succeed in reviving Irish, to get people to think in Irish rather than in English. The person who, like myself and a number of other Deputies, is not particularly fluent in the tongue, does not get that opportunity at the moment, but if there were some method such as I have suggested of enabling a person with a slight knowledge of Irish to see continually the Irish words in relation to the English words, it would very considerably encourage that person to speak Irish, to read Irish, to write Irish and to think in Irish.  I think exactly the same thing can be said in connection with the films.  Even the ordinary films, I think, could have superimposed on them by some sound machine the Irish language occasionally. I believe that as a minimum the Minister might see if it would be possible for him to ensure that some of the films, not merely the educational films but the ordinary entertainment films, carry sub-titles in Irish.  That also would assist in the revival of the language.</P>
    <P>There is a major question of policy, if you like, which must be decided and faced up to by this House, and that is as to exactly what we want to achieve. <Col N="1171" /> Is it to be an entirely and solely Irish-speaking country, or are we aiming at a bilingual country, because I believe that the method of approach would be somewhat different in each case?  So far as I am concerned, I believe that we should aim at a bilingual country. For many reasons, I believe it would not be feasible to have the English language completely removed from this country.  However, I never have been clear as to precisely what is aimed at and I think that many people who, for one reason or another, perhaps many of them for selfish reasons, are somewhat hostile and antagonistic towards the revival of the Irish language would alter their attitude considerably if it were made clear to them that what we were aiming at is a bilingual country and that it was not intended that we should endeavour completely to remove the English language, whether for commercial and business purposes or other purposes.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties which Deputies are up against in connection with this question was demonstrated by the very sincere attitude of Deputy Ó Briain, but an attitude which I think is unrealistic, if we are aiming at a bilingual country.  Deputy Ó Briain seemed to criticise the Minister for the fact that he did not introduce his Estimate entirely in the Irish language. As reported in column 918 of the Official Report of 20th April, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bhí mé ag éisteacht le chuid mhór de ráiteas an Aire, ag cur an mheastacháin seo ós cómhair na Dála.  Bhí sé níos fearr i bhfad i mbliana maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge.  Labhair sé cuid mhaith Gaeilge ag míniú an mheastacháin dúinn agus tá moladh tuillte aige mar gheall air sin ach lean sé le cuid mhór Béarla nach raibh gá ar bith leis, dar liomsa.  Bhí nós ins an Dáil ag Tomás Ó Deirg ar feadh na mblianta nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Oideachais, an meastachán Oideachais a chur ós comhair na Dála i nGaeilge ar fad.  Ní thuigim agus ní léir dom cén fáth go n-iompódh an tAire ar ais ar an mBéarla.  Cuirim é sin ós a chomhair don chéad uair eile a bheas sé ag <Col N="1172" /> caint ar mheastachán Oideachais i gceann bliana, má bhíonn sé ann.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know whether Deputy Derrig did in fact pursue that particular system, but I believe it was a bad system if he did.  I believe Deputy Ó Briain was quite sincere in his advocacy of introducing Estimates in the Irish language only, but I believe that that is unrealistic and that many people whom I have referred to as being hostile to the Irish language would accuse him of being bigoted in adopting that outlook.  Certainly, if we are aiming at a bilingual country as distinct from a purely Irish-speaking one, the Minister's attitude in introducing the Estimate in Irish and also in English is the correct one.  I should like to finish as I began by congratulating the Minister on the work he has done in the past 12 months and I hope that his work for the next 12 months will be just as successful.</P>

      <P>Certainly it cannot be on the ground that the Minister is asking for too much money.  Possibly, as the Minister interjected, one may conclude that it might be a political move to embarrass the Minister.  I could not, however, think that that was so.  If this Vote is to be referred back, I am sure the movers of such a motion would receive some support from every quarter of the House if the objective were to be an increase in the amount of the Vote, because in my humble view the Vote is altogether inadequate to deal with the problem of education. It would appear that the approach to the solution of the problem of education was based on proficiency in academics or, as some people would say, even in Irish.  That is a very false idea.  I am afraid our system of education is sadly lacking in refusing to recognise the necessities which face young children in life, apart altogether from their training in academics or in <Col N="1173" /> any particular subject with which the schools are at present concerned.  It is an extraordinary thing that in our schools no attempt is made to train children in subjects which will be of use to them in a practical way in after life.  It would not be too much to suggest that the Minister should consider the question of encouraging in girls' schools instruction in domestic economy and in boys' schools the development of their inclinations towards whatever trend or vocation their minds seem to develop.</P>
      <P>In addition to that, it is a reflection on our system to observe that our boys and girls are completely untrained and uninstructed in department and even in culture.  No attempt whatever is made to help the children to develop a responsibility in civics or in sociology. I think it is not too much to request the Minister to consider that attention should be paid to these matters.  Possibly this complete ignorance of deportment may be due to films, as a result of which boys and girls develop a selfish outlook on everything.  They totally disregard the feelings of others and, indeed, often of very old people. In practice, that brings a certain reflection on the teachers who are in charge of these children.</P>
      <P>Another matter which strikes me as worthy of note is the absence of night classes in this country.  True, in some districts there are technical schools which children who have left school can attend, but, generally speaking, no provision is made for a child or even an adult to increase his knowledge of any particular subject if he desires to do so.  These facilities could be afforded in night schools.  By night schools I mean not only schools for the ordinary man in the street but also night schools in the universities and even in secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cowan who referred to the difficulty teachers experience, when conducting large classes, in the matter of giving personal attention to backward children. That is obviously a most necessary consideration for any Minister because amongst those children who are backward <Col N="1174" /> there are some who are mentally defective.  Indeed, it may be only a very small degree of deficiency, but nevertheless such a child cannot keep pace with his fellows.  It is quite wrong to have children of that type in large classes.  In that respect, the matter could possibly be solved by the provision of experts who would visit the schools, interview the children and determine whether any of them are mentally defective and, if so, provide such children with the means by which they would be educated&mdash;at any rate to some degree&mdash;in order to enable them to earn a decent living for themselves when they grow up.  Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Ó Briain both enunciated their interest in this problem.  Their contribution every year is always interesting, intensely constructive and obviously sincere.  Possibly, by keeping at the Minister, year after year, they may hope to have some of the problems with which they are conversant, and about which they can speak with absolute authority, solved.</P>
    <P>It is rather a disgraceful thing to think that, as Deputy O'Rourke says, sanitary conditions in some of our schools, in this year of 1950, are no better than what they were 50 years ago.  It is also a reflection on our system of education that in these schools no attempt is made in respect of athletics and games for the children. These are just as important to the development of the child as training in academics or in anything else.  The physical condition of the child is so important that, unless it is catered for by the provision of amenities for athletics and games, it may fail under the strain which will come in after life. While Deputy O'Rourke and Deputy Ó Briain can speak with some experience, the Minister has not to go down the country to find evidence of the awful conditions which prevail in some of our schools, particularly in County Dublin.  I think it would be worth his while, if he has not done so, to visit these schools.  After all, we should provide institutions which will be worthy of the name.</P>
    <P>The Council of Education which the Minister has set up appears to be an <Col N="1175" /> excellent body, but it is rather regrettable that more representation is not given to parents.  Of course, the obvious answer to that is that many parents are on the Council of Education but, like every other matter in life, no one is a judge in one's own cause.  An expert in education may not see properly through the eyes of the ordinary parent in trying to interpret the needs of the children.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins in what he said in regard to the Irish language.  I think this compulsory system has been a failure and always will be a failure in this country.  The compulsory system has been responsible in some cases for a certain amount of racketeering on the part of some so-called protagonists of Irish who use it for monetary purposes in classes and in public and speak English in their homes.  I happen to know one or two of those people, but I also know another family who speak nothing but Irish in their home and they are not paid for teaching it or for advocating it.  It is quite wrong, in my view, in the case of a child who cannot learn Irish and cannot interpret it properly to condemn that child for ever because he cannot, through the medium of Irish, appreciate the value of other subjects.  The Minister is a realist; he is a great protagonist of the language; he is a great Gael; and I would suggest to him that he should do as he has always done, what he considered to be the correct thing to do, to take the bold step and to shake off the shackles of this impediment which has succeeded in retarding the educational progress of many of the children.</P>
    <P>If a child cannot appreciate properly the Irish language and cannot use it for learning other subjects, it is up to the Minister to provide for that child and give him an opportunity of becoming a decent citizen.  Compulsion is not a solution of the language problem.  If we could go back some 30 years, when we were all united, when a spontaneous enthusiasm took hold of the Irish people, when everyone spoke Irish and everyone who knew Irish helped those who did not, I say that, in 30 years, we <Col N="1176" /> should be what Deputy O'Higgins suggests we should be, a bilingual community. Of course, the cause of the lack of progress since then was due to circumstances which we all regret, but it is not too late to mend.  If we get back to our own natural degree of political thought and political outlook and forget those artificial divisions which divide us in this House and in the country, and unite, there will be no difficulty about the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I would like to join with other Deputies in congratulating the Minister, not only on his work now, but on the work which he has done for the last two years.  I hope he will continue that good work and that, in a year, probably, he will introduce an Estimate which will cover all branches of education. It is false economy to deny to our children instruction in those matters which are of such vital importance to them.  Instead of referring back an Estimate of this kind, on the grounds of economy or on the grounds of political technique, I would suggest that if possible it might be referred back on the ground that it should be doubled in amount.</P>

I see in the Book of Estimates that the Minister has, this year, restored the £3,000 for the heating and cleaning of primary schools.  While the total amount is entirely inadequate for that duty, at least it is an improvement.  I hope the time is not far distant when it will be in the power of the Government and within the finance of the State to employ a paid catetaker to look after the cleaning of schools in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last year, the conditions obtaining in rural Ireland in the cleaning of schools are undoubtedly very primitive and unhealthy.  The children have to take part in the cleaning, and surely, from a public health point of view, that is to be deplored.  If a caretaker were appointed, as in the case of technical and vocational schools, a good deal of that work would be done much better than the children could do it.  I hope that will come <Col N="1177" /> about.  The children in rural Ireland are entitled to better amenities than they have at present.  It is really a reflection on us, after so many years of our own Government, that such a state should exist to-day.  We are all anxious that prestige should be brought to this nation.  When visitors come from other countries and see the state of some of the schools in rural Ireland, where the real people of the nation are brought up and reared and taught, it is not a good thing for us. I hope that in the near future those complaints will be remedied and that there will be sanitary accommodation suitable to the needs of our children.</P>
    <P>I noticed recently that in reply to a parliamentary question by some Deputy who asked the number of schools built during the year 1949-50 the Minister said it was 49.  Of these 49 schools only ten have been supplied with proper sanitation.  I think that is an extremely low percentage and that better sites could have been found to provide proper accommodation with water supplies.  Certainly, ten out of 49 are not sufficient in these modern times when another Department of State promises a piped water supply to every farmhouse in rural Ireland.  I cannot see why if that is to be brought about there cannot be grants for a proper water supply for schools so that the children may be healthy in the surroundings where they spend most of their young lives.  If the Council of Education which the Minister has set up, and which is composed of very learned men, would consider those problems and try to solve the difficulty, it would bring a great deal of happiness into the lives of children.</P>
    <P>Some teachers have complained to me that they are not fully represented on that council.  I think there is only one teacher from rural Ireland on the council.  Teachers have suggested that there should be at least one woman teacher on the council and, say, a representative of each province&mdash;four teachers who know the conditions, the environment and the capabilities of the children under their control.  Rural children are in an entirely different position from children in the city schools.  Teachers in two to four-teacher <Col N="1178" /> schools have entirely different problems from those in the cities and towns.  They feel that their problem will not be fully reviewed.  I daresay the representative from County Monaghan is fully alive to all their needs and will probably bring them to the notice of the council.</P>
    <P>I would like to see a much larger grant made for manual instruction in technical schools.  Valuable work has been done in several parts of the country by the boys attending these schools and advantage has been taken of the schools.  If it is decided to raise the school-leaving age to 16 years, it would be admirable if the last two years were spent in technical schools so as to give the boys and girls of this country, some of whom undoubtedly, will be forced to emigrate, an opportunity of having some training and thus be able to take up better jobs than they have to accept at present.  Girls leaving the primary schools nowadays have very little training to help them to obtain other than the most menial jobs when they leave this country. They are sadly lacking in domestic economy and home training.  If they spent two years at a technical school it would be of great advantage to them.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the teaching of Irish in our schools.  One Deputy remarked that it would almost take another resurgence period to awaken the children to a sense of their responsibilities to the Irish language. In the past, those of us who are now old, had not the advantages that are available now for learning the language.  A great responsibility rests with those educated men and women who are now leaving our secondary schools and universities to preserve the language of the nation, and when they become parents, to transmit it to their children.  If that is done, undoubtedly, the Irish language will become alive in our country once again.  No compulsion, no Government, no teachers can force the people to speak the Irish language until they learn to love and foster it and have respect for it.  A good deal rests on the parents of young children.  If they encourage their children to <Col N="1179" /> speak and to learn it, it will be of advantage to the language.</P>
    <P>One Deputy referred to the amount of money that has been wasted on teaching Irish in schools.  I feel sure that the present Minister will not allow anything to happen to stop the teaching of Irish in the schools.  A tribute must be paid to the teachers who, in their middle years, started out to learn Irish in order to acquire proficiency in it and to teach it.  It would be a sad reflection, it would be criminal, at this stage of our history, if we, by propaganda or otherwise, were to discourage the use of the language. I feel certain that, as far as that matter is concerned, it is safe in the hands of the present Minister.</P>
    <P>I would be particularly pleased if the Minister could have the cleaning of schools in rural Ireland carried out under much better circumstances than are the case at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Pádraig Ó Cuinneáin</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá cúpla pointe ar mhaith liomasa tagairt a dhéanamh dhóibh fén Meastachán seo.  Tá mé sásta go bhfuil an tAire ag déanamh obair mhaith, thríd is thrid.  Tá na múinteoirí, leis, ag déanamh sár-obair cuid acu ar a luighead ar son na Gaeilge. Ach is ceart dúinn a thuiscint nach féidir leis na múinteoirí an Ghaeilge a thabhairt thar n-ais mar theanga bheo gan cabhair ón bpobal, agus go háirithe ón Rialtas.  Tá sé chomh tábhachtach céanna go ndéanfadh seirbhísigh an Rialtais&mdash;an Stát-Sheirbhís, an tArm, an Garda Síochána, na dreamanna a bhfuil cabhair airgid acu ón Stát, ar nós C.I.E., Bord na Móna, Bord Soláthar an Leictreachais, etc.&mdash;a gcion féin, agus go dtabharfaidis an dea-shampla do lucht gnótha agus don phobal i gcoitinne.  D'fhéadfaidís sin cabhrú go mór ie dea-obair na scoileanna, ach is eagal liom, in ionad bheith ag cabhrú le saothar na múinteoirí i gcúis na teangan, gur a chur ar gcúl atáid.  Ba chóir, um an dtaca so, go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó de ghnó na Stát-Sheirbhíse á dhéanamh i nGaeilge, go mbeadh Rannóg amháin ar a laghad i ngach aon Roinn Rialtais ag déanamh a gcuid oibre ar fad trí Ghaeilge.  Is eol dom go dtéann mórán daoine óga <Col N="1180" /> isteach sa tSeirbhís agus an Ghaeilge go flúirseach acu agus iad dúthrachtach i dtaobh í a chur chun cinn.  Ach in ionad dea-shampla d'fháil óna lucht ceannais sna hoifigí is amhlaidh a cuirtear droch-mhisneach orthu a mharaíonn an dúthracht sin leis an aimsir.  Sin ceann de na rudaí a chuireann saothar na scoileanna amú.  Caithfidh an Rialtas féachaint chun an scéal seo a leigheas nó ní bheidh aon toradh fónta go deo ar obair na múinteoirí ná ar athbheochaint na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>Nil oiread agus is féidir á dhéanamh, im thuairim, chun an Ghaeilge a thabhairt amach as na scoileanna.  Ní cóir go gceapfadh an Rialtas go bhfuil a ndualgas déanta nuair a chuireann siad an Ghaeilge ar chlár na scoileanna. Ba cheart sna fógraí a fhoilsíonn an Rialtas, agus dreamanna mar a luaigh mé cheana atá ag fáil deontaisí ón Rialtas, tús áite a thabhairt don Ghaeilge agus gan fógra ar bith uathu a bheith gan Gaeilge.  Ní féidir le haon duine a rá gur éagóir é sin.  Tá neart Gaeilge sa tír dá gcoimeádtaí á húsáid á húsáid í&mdash;sna scannáin, ar na páipéirí nuachta, ar an radio, agus sna heaglaisi, etc.</P>
      <P>Tá fás agus borradh fé scríobh na Gaeilge, fé láthair, ar cheart é a leathnú.  Tá cheithre nó cúig cinn d'irisí Gaeilge á gcur amach a thaispeánann go bhfuil an fás sin ann.  Éinne a léann na páipéirí sin tuigeann sé go bhfuil daoine óga ag éirí chugainn a bhfuil mianach maith iontu chun scríbhneoireachta. Is dóigh liom gur ceart don Aire féachaint le páipéirí oiriúnacha a chur ar fáil don aos scoile ar aon dul leis an obair atá na hirisí sin a dhéanamh do na daoine fásta.  Is dóigh liom, chomh maith, go bhféadfadh an tAire féachaint chuige go gcuirfí amach go líonmhar leabhair éagsúla don aos óg a bheadh simplí agus a mbeadh pictiúirí deasa daite iontu.  Cuir i gcás, aimsir na Nollag, nuair a bhíonn daoine ag ceannach féiríní do pháistí, dá bhfeicidís a leithéidí sna siopaí ceannófaí a lán díobh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Do réir mar chím níor tugadh cothrom na Féinne ar an gComhairle Oideachais do na scoileanna agus do na coláistí a ndéantar an mhúinteoireacht iontu tríd an nGaeilge.  De <Col N="1181" /> bharr na taithí atá acu is iad sin is fearr a thuigeann cad is ceart a dhéanamh. Is ait an rud é ach dá airde a téitear i gcúrsaí oideachais&mdash;agus i gcúrsaí riaracháin na tíre&mdash;is ea is lú an beann a bhíonn ar an nGaeilge iontu.  Is náireach an scéal é go gcaithfear bheith ag troid in aghaidh Ollscoile a thugas Ollscoil Náisiúnta uirthi féin ad iarraidh a ceart d'fháil don teanga náisiúnta inti.  Is é dualgas an Aire, mar ionadaí an phobail, beart a dhéanamh chun polasaí an phobail a chur i gcion.  Ní dócha go bhfuil in aon tír eile Ollscoil, ná Coláiste Ollscoile, a d'fhógródh gur cur isteach ar a neamhspleáchas agus ar a saoirse é a iarraidh orthu an chéim agus an réim cheart a thabhairt inti do theanga dhúchais a dtíre.</P>
    <P>Tá pointe&mdash;ná baineann go dlúth b'fhéidir leis an Aire Oideachais ach a bhaineann go dlúth le hathbheochaint na Gaeilge&mdash;ar mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh dó mar gur minic a luann daoine liom é, sé sin, a dheacracht agus a chostasaí atá sé ar dhuine a cláraíodh i mBéarla a ainm d'athrú go Gaeilge.  Gealladh anseo sa Dáil roint bhliain ó shoin go ndéanfaí beart chun an scéal sin a leigheas ach níor deineadh fós é.</P>
    <P>Deineadh tagairt do na scannáin agus don tairbhe dob fhéidir a bhaint astu ar mhaithe leis an nGaeilge.  Aontaím ar fad leis an gcaint a rinneadh ina thaobh sin.  Tá ní eile, áfach, ná fuil oiread tairbhe agus dob fhéidir á bhaint as ar mhaithe leis an teangain, is é sin, an drámaíocht.  Tá go leor á dhéanamh chun an drámaíocht i mBéarla a chur ar aghaidh i ngach baile, mór is beag, sa tír.  Ní fheicim dé chúis ná féadfaí foireann lánaimsire aisteoirí d'oilúint agus iad a chur timpeall ar fud na tíre le drámaí agus gneasa ilghné a léiriú.  Ba mhór an chabhair é sin le feabhas a chur ar chaighdeán na mbuíonta aisteoireachta áitiúla agus le ceárd cheart na haisteoireachta a thaispeáint dóibh sin, agus do na múinteoirí atá ag féachaint, ar chomhairle an Aire, leis an drámaíocht a chur ar aghaidh sna scoileanna. I dteannta tairbhe a dhéanamh don Ghaeilge mhúsclódh sé suim na ndaoine i ngach gné den drámaíocht.</P>
    <P>Duine nó dream ar bith atá ag obair ar son na teangan ba cheart <Col N="1182" /> creidiúint a thabhairt dóibh as ucht gur obair fhíor-thábhachtach don náisiún atá ar siúl acu, agus má baintear an úsáid cheart as na gleasanna nua-aimseartha uile atá ann ní baol ná go gcuirfear an Ghaeilge i réim arís.  Tá moladh ag dul don Aire as an méid atá seisean a dhéanamh agus ní bheadh sé macánta ag énnegan sin a thabhairt dó.</P>

      <P>Rinneadh a lán tagairt do nithe a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge agus b'fhéidir ná tógfar órm é ma dhéanaim tagairt dóibh san ar dtuais.  Déanadh tagairt don chló Rómhánach, do leabhra a chur amach, don nGúm agus do labhairt na Gaeilge, chomh fada is a bhaineann siad le hobair na scol.  I dtaobh an chló Rómhánaigh, ní chuireann an Roinn Oideachais leabhra i gcló in aon chor; is iad na gnáth-fhoilsitheoiri trádála a dhéanann é sin.  Nuair a chuireann siad mianach labhair le chéile cuireann siad fé bhráid na Roinne é féacaint an bhfuil an mianach go maith agus má thaithníonn mianach an leabhair leis an Roinn cuirtear ar liosta na leabhar scoile é agus cuirtear amach é.  Níl aon chath idir múinteoirí agus bainisteoirí agus clódóirí agus foilsitheoiri i dtaobh an chló Rómhánaigh.  Níl bac orthu aon leabhar a chur amach sa chló Rómhánach agus ni bheadh col ag an Roinn le leabhar mar sin, ach ní cuirtear leabhra mar sin chugainn. Ní mian leis an Roinn bheith ag brúgh isteach ar chlódóirí.  Más mian leis na clódóirí leabhra a chur amach mar sin tá an ceart sin acu agus ní chuirfidh an Roinn bac leo.</P>
      <P>Is dóigh liom go gcuireann an chaint a déantar ar an gcuma sin isteach ar obair na Gaeilge. Ní dóigh liom go mbaineann litriú, cló agus rudaí mar sin le beatha na Gaeilge ar aon chor. Níl na daoine atá i bhfábhar na Gaeilge ar aon fhocal i dtaobh an chló Rómhánaigh agus ní ró-mhór a chuireann rudaí mar sin isteach ar obair na scol. Is féidir a fheicsint más mian le foilsitheoir leabhar a chur amach sa chló Rómhánach, ó thaobh na Roinne de nach bhfuil aon bhac orthu.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dtaobh an scrúdú béil, ní dóigh liom go dtuigtear in aon chor cad iad na deacrachtaí atá ag baint le scrúdú béil, chomh fada agus a bhaineann <Col N="1183" /> le hobair na scoile.  Tá breis agus 400,000 páistí sna bun-scoileanna agus tá timpeall le 43,000 scoláirí sna méan-scoileanna.  B'fhéidir nach dteastaíonn ó na daoine atá ag lorg scrúdú béil go gcuirfí scrúdú ar gach páiste sna bun-scoileanna agus sna meán-scoileanna.  Tuigim nach é sin atá in a n-aigne, ach más rud é atá in a n-aigne go gcaithfí scrúdú a chur ar pháisti ag dul isteach i gcóir na bun-teistiméireachta, tá 30,000 páistí ag dul isteach gach bliain i gcóir na teistiméireachta sin agus 15,000 ag dul isteach ar an meán-teistiméireacht agus an árd-teistiméireacht.  Dá mbeadh orainn cigirí a chur timpeall chun scrúdú béil a chur orthu sin, bheadh 45,000 scoláirí ann chun scrúdú béil a chur orthu agus tá timpeall le 80 cigirí chun an obair sin a dhéanamh. Cad cuige a ndéanfaí é?  Dá mba rud é go gcaithfí é a dhéanamh agus marcanna a thabhairt de bharr na scrúduithe sin sa scrúdú i gcóir na bun-teistiméireachta taobh istigh de mhí amháin, agus an rud céana a dhéanamh i dtaobh na méanteistimeireachta agus na hard-teistiméireachta ní doígh liom go bhféadfaí na cigirí d'fháil chuige sin.  Ansin, dá mb'fhéidir iad d'fháil agus dá mb'fhéidir leo é a dhéanamh gan dul as a meabhair leis an méid sin oibre agus é a dhéanamh taobh istigh d'aon mhí amháin, ní dóigh liom go mbeadh na tuismitheoirí, na páistí, na múinteoirí ná na cigirí sásta gurbh fhéidir caighdeán cruinn a bheith i scrúdú mar sin.  Dá mba rud é gur ghá marcanna a thabhairt agus go mbeadh toradh as na marcanna san i dtreo go mbeadh teip nó pas á thabhairt do na páistí bheadh deacracht mhór ag baint leis sin agus ní dóigh liom gur féidir é a dhéanamh. I dtaobh labhairt na Gaeilge, ní dóigh liom gur gá é mar chuid den obair a dhéanann na cigirí sna scoileanna, is scrúdú béil í, agus tuigeann siad an bhail atá ar an Ghaeilge sna scoileanna.  Ní bail ró-olc í ach a mhalairt ar fad-bail mhaith í, is dóigh liom.</P>
    <P>Is é an rud a bhíonn ag priocadh daoine chun gearáin a dhéanamh i dtaobh labhairt na Gaeilge sna scoileanna <Col N="1184" /> ná go mb'fhéidir go mbíonn faitíos ar na páistí an Ghaeilge a labhairt taobh amuigh den scoil.  Is dóigh liom go bhfuil cúis leis sin.  Níl mórán Gaeilge á labhairt ag na daoine fásta agus tá a lán daoine agus níl aon tsuim in aon chor acu sa Ghaeilge. Ní maith le páiste bheith ait agus nuair ná bíonn suim sa Ghaeilge mórthimpeall orthu, ní maith leo sin a dteanga a chur isteach sa chaint.  Dá mbeitheá ag seasamh ar an sráid i mBaile Átha Cliath ag caint le cara agus ag caint as Gaeilge agus scata páistí timpeall, is gairid a bheidís ann gan bheith ag cur isteach focal&mdash;&ldquo;Dia is Muire dhuit&rdquo; nó ceist eigin a chur ort.  Tá suim ag na páistí sa Ghaeilge agus tá an Ghaeilge acu i bhfad níos fearr ná meastar atá, agus, dá mbeadh fhios ag na páistí go bhfuil suim ag na daoine fásta sa Ghaeilge, bheadh gríosadh ann dóibh an Ghaeilge a labhairt.  Pointe fé léith atá ann, agus, im thuairimse, thiocfadh fás agus athrú air sin agus bheadh i bhfad níos mó Gaeilge á labhairt ag na páistí dá dtuigeadh na daoine fásta a bhfuil an Ghaeilge acu go mba mhaith leis na páistí iad a chloisint.  Is maith leis na páistí an Ghaeilge a chloisint mórthimpeall orthu.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh an Ghúim is minic a cloistear gearán, agus deineadh roinnt gearán annseo, i dtaobh an Ghúim, go gcuireann siad moill ar an obair atá ar siúl acu agus go bhfuil a lán saghsanna leabhra nach gcuireann siad amach in aon chor. Tá deacrachtaí ag baint le hobair foilsitheoirí as Gaeilge.  I dtaobh an Ghúim, pé ar domhan é, nuair a thagann lámhscríbhinn isteach, caithfear an lámhscríbhinn sin a mheas. Ní dóigh liom go mbeadh an t-údar sásta go bhfágfaí an meas san ag Stát-Sheirbhíseach, agus caithfear an lámhcríbhann a chur amach go dtí léitheoir éigin taobh amuigh, duine ná fuil aon bhaint aige leis an Stát-Sheirbhís. Go minic nuair a thagann an lámhscríbhinn thar n-ais, bíonn moladh ag gabháil leis ón léitheoir, ag rá gur ceart athrú a dhéanamh anseo agus ansúd.  Tá cuid de na húdar agus ní bhíonn siad sásta le haon athrú a dhéanamh.  Go minic, is gá an lámhscríbhinn a chur amach go dtí léitheoir eile agus bíonn deacrachtaí ag baint <Col N="1185" /> leis agus bíonn moill ar an obair ón taobh sin.</P>
    <P>Ansin i dtaobh na gclódóirí, deirtear gur féidir le clódóirí, taobh amuigh de na clódóirí a bhíonn ag obair don Ghúm, leabhra a chur amach go tapaidh.  Is féidir.  Tá a ngléas féin acu agus tá na clódóirí féna smacht agus is féidir leo iad a chur ag obair, ach nuair a chuireann an Gúm leabhra amach go dtí clódóir ní bhíonn smacht ag an nGúm ar na clódóirí, agus má tá a lán oibre ag na clódóirí á dhéanamh i mBearla, is fearr go mór a bhíonn na clódóirí sásta an obair i mBéarla a chur amach, mar is fuiriste leo é, agus dá bhrí sin tá deacrachtaí ag baint leis an obair ón taobh sin leis.</P>
    <P>I dtaobh a thuille saghasanna leabhra a chur amach, is deacair leis an nGúm bheith ag dul amach ag tathant ar scríbhneoirí leabhra a chur le chéile agus níl an oireadh sin scríbhneoirí Gaeilge sa tír agus ba mhaith linn, ach tá a lán daoine ann agus is dóigh leo gur scríbhneoirí iontacha iad nach bhfuil mórán Gaeilge in aon chor acu agus is ó na daoine seo a thagann an chuid is mó den gearán. Tá beagán baint agam leis an obair agus gidh go mba mhaith liom an scéal d'iniúchadh níos cruinne, is dóigh liomsa gur ar na léitheoirí uaireannta, agus ar na húdair agus ar na clódóirí atá an milleán i dtaobh na moille atá ann. Is mar sin atá an scéal ó thaobh na Roinne agus táimid ag iarraidh gach is féidir linn a dhéanamh chun an scéal a leigheas agus leanfaimid den obair sin.  Ba mhaith liom go dtuigfeadh na Teachtaí go léir go bhfuil deacrachtaí ann agus nach bhfuil cumhacht ná leigheas ag an nGúm ná an Roinn Oideachais ar na deacrachtaí is mó is cúis leis an moill sin.</P>
    <P>Deineadh caint i dtaobh na Gaeltachta agus tuigim go maith go gcaithfear an Ghaeilge a choimeád slán ansin.  Táimid tar éis cigire fé leith a chur síos ann.  Tá 77 scoileanna i nDún na nGall agus cigire i mbun obair na scoile ansin.  Tá 80 scoil i nContae Mhuigheo agus i gContae na Gaillimhe agus iad go léir sa bhfíorGhaeltacht. Tá cigire ann i gcóir gach Fíor-Ghaeltacht agus cigire i gcóir Gaillimh agus Muigheo, ach sa Mhumhan, tá Gaeltacht agus Breac-Ghaeltacht <Col N="1186" /> fé chúram an chigire.  Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na múinteoirí i ngach ceantar ansin as ucht an chabhair atá tugtha do na cigirí san obair atá ar siúl acu agus as an suim mhór atá ag na múinteoirí san obair sin.</P>
    <P>Luas cheana go bhfuil níos mó ná obair na scoile fé iniúchadh na gcigirí. Bhí áthas ar chuid de na Teachtaí gur tugadh níos mór airgid i gcóir drámaí i mbliana.  Is é obair na gcigirí sin a chuir isteach im aigne é sin a dhéanamh. Do réir mar a raghaidh an fiosrúchán chun cinn, beidh fhios againn cad eile is féidir a dhéanamh.  Tá fhios agam gur féidir a lán a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh a lán rudaí fé bhraíd an Aire Talmhaíochta i dtaobh Dún Chuinn.  Cuireadh cigire talmhaíochta síos ansin agus cuir sé deich nó dhá cheann déag de na scéimeanna ar siúl i nDún Chuinn.  Bhí cigire ansin tamall gairid ó shoin, agus deir sé go mbeidh an ceantar sin ina shampla don tír ar fad i dtaobh cad is féidir a bhaint as talamh maith mar sin, nuair a chuireann na daoine sa cheantar chuige i gceart. Tá fhios agam go mbeidh toradh maith ar an obair sin.</P>
    <P>Luadh, leis, a thábhachtaí atá sé hallaí a bheith i gceantar mar sin.  Ba mhór an rud é dá mbeadh halla paróiste fé cúram lucht na hEagalise sna ceantracha sin, i dtreo go mbeadh an séipéal, an scoil agus an halla paróiste mar thrí tacaí do shaol na ndaoine agus cultur na ndaoine sna ceantracha sin. Pé rud is féidir liom chun cabhrú le muintir na Gaeltachta chun hallaí a thógáil sna paróistí sin, déanfaidh mé é.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh ceist i dtaobh cad tá ar siúl againn i dtaobh foclóir.  Tá roinnt duine ag obair ar an bhfoclóir agus, gidh go bhfuil a lán den obair déanta, nílmid réidh go fóill chun an foclóir a chur i gcló.  Dá mbeimis i ndon roinnt chúntóirí eile d'fháil chuige ní bheadh sé ró-fhada go dtí go mbeadh an obair i dtreo againn chun é d'fhoilsiú.  Is deacair linn, uaireanta, cúntóir d'fháil, go mór mór ó Mhuigheo, Corcaigh agus Ciarraidhe.  Táimis ag lorg cabhrach chun críoch a chur leis.</P>
    <P>Nuair a cuirfear an foclóir amach, beidh sé sa litriú nua, nó beidh saghas nua lithrithe ann a socrófar sa deire agus beidh sé sa cló Rómhánach.  Nuair <Col N="1187" /> adeirim go soerófar faoi chló, be mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil coiste beag ag déanamh scagadh deireannach ar na moltaí a tugadh dúinn i dtaobh an chaighdeáin nua agus táimid ag súil go mbeidh an obair sin críochnuithe acu sar i bhfad, agus tiocfaidh sé faoi bhráid roinnt daoine ansin agus is sa chaighdeán nua a clóbhuailfear an foclóir.</P>
    <P>Dhein an Teachta Ciot caint mar gheall ar leabharlann i gcóir scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht.  Ba mhaith an rud é sin, agus is fíor go bhféadfadh lucht na gComhairle Contae an-chabhair ar fad a thabhairt san obair sin.</P>
    <P>Deineadh tagairt dá lán rudaí nuair a bhí an díospóireacht ar siúl ar an Meastacháin.  Féachfaidh mé isteach ina lán de na ceisteanna sin agus, más féidir liom an obair a chur chun cinn in aon cheann acu, déanfad é.</P>
    <P>The general discussion covered a very wide range and I can undertake that the various matters mentioned here will be very carefully examined. There are some broad questions on which, perhaps, it would be well for me to concentrate.  There was a very considerable amount of talk on the question of responsibility for the conditions in the schools and the cost of schools.  That is a question we must stand well back from and take a good look at, to see where the responsibility for education should rest and what exactly we mean by education.</P>
    <P>I want to say how gratified I was by the general spirit in which the various matters were discussed.  There has been a certain amount of criticism of the situation and, perhaps, of my approach to it, but I appreciate that that criticism is brought forward with a pure educational approach.  I quite appreciate the spirit in which it was made and particularly the co-operative spirit in which practically all the criticisms and suggestions were made here. It is very important to take advantage of that spirit and to realise that it reflects the spirit outside and to try and catch the mind of the people in the matter and to harness that mind to something that will improve the situation with regard to our educational machine and encourage the people to think on constructive lines.  There has <Col N="1188" /> been so much confusion on this question of responsibility and cost, and there have been so many conflicting approaches in the matter, that I feel we ought to do something to try and see what we mean.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Standard</i> of 21st April there is a short account of an address given at the Christus Rex Society Congress in Belfast by the Rev. F. MacLarnon, D.D., Principal of St. Patrick's Academy, Dungannon, in which he stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not only behind the Iron Curtain, but in the so-called free world, the fundamental right of the family as the educator is either denied or ignored.  The modern &lsquo;democratic&rsquo; State with its pettifogging benevolism, feels that it must not only control and regulate education, but even enjoy a monopoly of education, by providing a system of State schools, to which all children shall go.  Those children who do not go to the State schools are the eccentric few, and they shall be made to pay dearly for such exclusivism.  This is a view that must be challenged, for it is unjust to the family's rights which are founded upon the natural law.  It is not the function of the State, as such, to educate.  The setting up of a system in which all citizens would receive a standardised education in schools built and run by the State was an invasion of the natural rights of parents.  The school should be an extension of the home, not an extension of Parliament.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means something, and we must particularly realise that it means something when we see the enormous sacrifices that the Catholic community in the United States are making to provide their own Catholic schools and pay every halfpenny of the cost of these schools from their own purses, and alongside that a system where the State provides everything, school, books and teachers, and when we see the sacrifices which are made by Catholics in Great Britain to keep complete control of their own Catholic schools.  We have not that danger here to contend with, and it is because we have not the danger that the State is going to take a purely State control over the schools, without sweeping <Col N="1189" /> religion out of them, endangering parental and Church rights in matters of education, that we are free to slip along a road of error and that I think, from a lot of the discussion that we hear here and a lot of discussion and suggestions made outside, we are cavilling.</P>
    <P>I do not want to blame Deputy McCann in any way, but just to take his speech as an example.  Deputy McCann says that the State should pay for the cost of all primary schools and the cost of technical schools in the City of Dublin.  Then we get a suggestion that our schools are unclean and badly kept and that we should turn to the State for assistance in remedying that condition.  The present position is that, according to the regulations, the State provides two-thirds of the cost of building a school, two-thirds of the cost of improving a school, and one-half of the cost of heating and cleaning up to a particular amount and gives other grants, but that it is the local responsibility to pay one-third of the cost of building, one-third of the cost of improvements, and one-half of the cost of heating and cleaning and that such requisites as are required, outside the small things, to carry on the work of the school should be provided either by the manager or the teacher.</P>
    <P>If the people in any particular parish want to take up the attitude that the State must provide for the building of schools, the equipment of schools and the cleaning of them, I say that you are completely surrendering and destroying any sense of Christian responsibility in relation to education.  As I showed by the figures I produced, last year we provided more than two-thirds of the cost; that we provided 83 per cent. of the cost of schools built last year and something like that figure for the year before.  Therefore the local contribution was only about 17 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let us try and get clear what we do expect the parents and the parish to provide for the institution that is the local school.  There has been discussion here as to the feasibility of having parish halls, and I consider the best way in which the life of a parish would be supported in its institutional life would be by the church and the school <Col N="1190" /> and the parish hall.  You have a parish hall in some places but not in others. In the absence of a parish hall, it has been suggested that the school sometimes was available as a parish hall in certain places, I think in Donegal, and that that practice stopped and the commercial hall came into being.  If there is not a hall, at any rate the parish ought to hold on to its church and its school and to its sense of some responsibility for maintaining them.</P>
    <P>When you hear the volume and the nature of the complaint that the State should clean the schools, put them in a better condition and build new schools, I think that is a breakdown of a fundamental part of the Irish character and I would hesitate very much to move any particular distance to surrender to that.  The State may have to help to a greater extent than it has helped, but let it be clearly understood that, before the State is called on for any more help, a sense of local responsibility has to be clearly defined and accepted.  But, if in response to a call that comes from certain places spread all over the country, we slither along the line of taking on the State responsibility for all these things that are put up to us because some outhouses are dirty, there is no water here, the roof of one school is falling in and there are not cloakrooms in another, and go along the line of relieving local responsibility of its burden of maintaining schools, I think we are undermining something fundamental in the character of our people, fundamental to the maintenance of our traditions, and that we are not only weakening parochial but parental responsibility.  When Deputies asked that there should be free education, meaning that every child who goes into a primary school is to be provided with books, pencils, paper, etc., I think it is absolutely an attack on the family.  It is as big an attack on the family as some of the attacks about which Dr. MacLarnon has spoken because it is more insidious and it is absolutely unnecessary.  I cannot conceive that the wages policy of the workers in this country is pursued on the lines that they do not expect to have to buy books and the ordinary <Col N="1191" /> school requisites for their children that, I have indicated, run from something like 2/6 or 5/- a year at the bottom to 12/6 on top, in the primary schools.  I would point out that certain grants are available to all schools at present for necessitous children, where they are required.  They have not been used to the extent to which they are available in all the schools. I do not propose to suggest that these grants should be increased in any way.</P>
    <P>I received, after a kindergarten course in Cork last year, a round-robin from the teachers attending the course saying that the course was beautiful and expressing thanks for it but that it would be twice as beautiful if they could get the materials in their schools to put the results of what they learned during the course into operation for the children.  It was a very apt and pointed presentation to make to the Minister for Education but I would point out that the Minister for Education does not provide these things.  It is the local responsibility.  I do not want to interfere with that responsibility until those who, more than anybody else, are concerned with keeping local responsibilities in evidence and active in these matters make very clear and definite representations in the matter.  The Church authorities have a problem there.  They have the problem of the cost of things at the present time, the difficulty of getting money, and so forth.  In so far as the Hierarchy envisage that problem and want additional State consideration of it, I am prepared to face these matters and to discuss them.  However, I do not think that, out of either any general complaint in the newspapers or general discussion here that, in my opinion, injures parochial responsibility, I should move in the matter in any way.</P>
    <P>The cost of schools is great and the number of schools which require to be improved or erected is great.  It would be very easy to have an estimate of that.  I appreciate the difficulties of managers when they feel that they are not able to get their plans pressed ahead as quickly as they think they ought, and I appreciate the difficulties of people who look at schools that are <Col N="1192" /> in a bad condition and feel that it is wrong that their children should have to attend such schools.  It is wrong, but I would point out that the wrong is a breakdown of local sense of responsibility at the present time.  That is a thing that has grown out of certain circumstances and it will have to be faced up to in time.</P>
    <P>From 1945 to date, the Department of Education made certain allocations every year for new schools.  In these years, on allocations made by the Department of Education to the Board of Works for the carrying out of schools, the Board of Works has accumulated £1,000,000 arrears in school building.  They increased very substantially the work they had estimated to do last year.  They overran their financial commitments.  I should like to see the Board of Works doing a lot more than it is doing and I shall do everything I can to see that the finance is provided for it.  However, as Deputy Dr. Brennan mentioned here to-day, the money which is provided in these Estimates, although it does not include the buildings, would not half cover even the necessary and vital things that it has been suggested in this debate should be done.  On the question of responsibility and cost, I want to ask for both some more consideration by Deputies on the spot as to what the sense of local responsibility should be and as to where the cost should rest.</P>
    <P>There has been a very considerable amount of talk about houses&mdash;the dirt of houses, the lack of care of houses, the absence of water and the absence of proper sanitary accommodation in even some of the new schools.  In every place where water is available, in any new school at the present time, flush lavatories are being put in with a septic tank or the most modern arrangement.  Nothing has been left undone at the present time to see that the outhouses of schools are in a decent and proper condition and are flushed in the proper way so as to make the outhouse as sanitary and as tidy and as clean as possible.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of playgrounds. I must say that I always find it very difficult to understand why, where in some counties, I think, an <Col N="1193" /> acre of land is provided with a labourer's cottage, an acre for a playground cannot be provided for a school. The site is the local parochial responsibility. Playgrounds would also be the same thing.  If you throw on a central authority responsibility for seeing that every schoolhouse from Tory Island down to Carnsore Point in County Wexford is provided with proper playgrounds, you are presenting a problem that cannot be faced.  But if it is faced by local responsibility then I think you would have an attack on that situation and that some areas would be examples to others.  At any rate, playgrounds are necessary.  But you will not get playgrounds by saying in 1950 that they have to be provided and paid for by the State.  I am suggesting that as one of the points that, in facing this in a constructive way, you would want to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I want to say a word with regard to the Dublin situation.  There has been a certain amount of criticism in respect of areas without schools and areas that have large schools, and so forth.  Comparatively recently I had to face the question of the districts in Dublin that were growing in a very rapid way without there being, beforehand, any notice from the city authorities or the planning authority that housing developments were going to take place in as rapid a way as was the case.  The ecclesiastical authorities were finding themselves in difficulties in that building developments were taking place in one direction in the city and, without very much notice, the development became much greater than it was originally planned to be.  Following consultation with His Grace the Archbishop of Dublin on the matter, I now have a committee consisting of a representative of the Archbishop, a representative of the Ministry, of the Corporation of Dublin, of the Office of Public Works, of the Department of Health and of the Department of Local Government, to take an urgent review of all the present housing areas and to keep a close preview of all developments that are taking place in the city, to see that there will be site accommodation and school accommodation available as the housing schemes develop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> Just to show what the problem in Dublin is, I have here a short list of schools in Dublin that are either being built or are ready to be built shortly or that are projected: Donnycarney, boys, 500; Donnycarney, girls and infants, from 700 to 800.  These two are nearly finished.  Rutland Avenue, boys, 500&mdash;these were recently opened; new school for girls in St. Bernadette parish, 750; Ballyfermot, boys, Presentation Brothers&mdash;plans are just ready for advertisement for 1,300 boys; Ballyfermot, girls' and infants' schools &mdash;site acquired&mdash;2,000 girls.  Negotiations are going on for new girls' schools in Crumlin.  Sites are reserved in Walkinstown, Crumlin, for three schools, boys, girls and infants&mdash;about 1,300 in all; site reserved for schools in Bluebell, Inchicore, and the Christian Brothers' schools in Crumlin are to be extended by about 400 places.</P>
    <P>This involved very considerable capital amounts.  In all these cases very considerable State grants are given.  It is very easy to complain about delay and difficulty in these matters but there has been an increase of population in the City of Dublin and very considerable transfer of population there and the matter is being attended to in every possible way.  I would like it to be understood that we have now set up a city committee to review systematically and to cover all these phases and problems.</P>
    <P>On the question of the size and classes in the city, I have to say again that this is still engaging my very active examination and attention. There are two periods in the year in which classes increase.  Classes increase in some ways from about April and increase in other ways, say, from 1st April to 1st July.  There are technical problems with regard to the organisation of the classes and the lack of accommodation that affect overcrowding of this particular kind but everything we possibly can do will be done.  There are financial considerations to it but I would not be held up by financial considerations if I could see a systematic and good way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>The question of the school-leaving age has again been referred to.  That is a very big problem.  It is a problem <Col N="1195" /> not only of accommodation on the one hand and of teachers on the other but a problem of curriculum.  From some of the discussion that took place here, I felt that a case was being made and could perhaps reasonably be accepted that the increasing of the school-leaving age in rural districts was very desirable and very feasible and that, if there were difficulties in the city, because of accommodation and so on, the school-leaving age could be extended in rural districts while you were waiting to deal with the problem in the city.  I do not see at the moment, at any rate, that that is so.  You have your fabric of primary schools throughout the country and you have an extending fabric of technical schools but you have to decide in what type of school the extended education of children will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The position, as I see it, in the greater part of the rural area is that the children in the higher classes in the national schools, say, 13 or 14 years of age, in their last year or two, are not able to get as good an education as they ought to be able to get.  Most of these schools are one-teacher or two-teacher schools and, where you have infants and higher classes there, you cannot feel that the older pupils are getting the attention that people who are depending entirely on primary education ought to get in their last years. There has been a certain consideration of the educational position by a small departmental committee that was set up by the former Minister for Education and, from their review of the matter, there is a feeling here, as there is in other countries, that primary education as such, stops at about 12 or about 12 plus and that, after that, the educational pathway bifurcates, some go along the practical line and some along the more academic line.  The arena of the primary school syllabus and what happens when children cross the threshold of the primary school, either to employment or to more academic studies or to more practical studies, is the arena that the Council of Education will have particularly to review and particularly to advise in respect of. <Col N="1196" /> I would not attempt to set out a plan for increasing the school-leaving age, even in rural districts, until there has been an examination of the primary syllabus and the age at which the three R's, that have been referred to in the debate, should stop and what should happen after that.  If it is decided that primary education, as a foundation to something else, stops at 12 or 12 plus, then you have to decide what is going to come after that and, in rural areas, you have to decide whether that is going to continue in the present primary school or in some other kind of institution.</P>
    <P>That is a very big problem from the Church point of view.  It is a very big problem from the finance and the State point of view.  It is a very big problem from the point of view of the training and provision of teachers.  I, therefore, do not see any chance at all of my being able to advise the House with regard to the extension of the school-leaving age until the primary school syllabus and the nature of any bifurcation that would take place from the primary school into a technical school or secondary school is reviewed by a council of people experienced in and competent to advise on what is the foundation of education that our children would require in our primary schools.</P>
    <P>Somewhat related to that is the primary certificate.  I do not understand what objection there is to requiring that, at the end of the primary pupils' school career, they would sit for a written examination in English, Irish and arithmetic.  It has been suggested that that is an educational outrage.  I must say that I am not able to understand that at all.  The children who go to the primary school go as infants. Some stop at the sixth standard. Others go to the seventh standard.  The primary school certificate regulations make it compulsory on them to sit in the sixth standard year for this examination. Deputy O'Rourke rather suggested that if they did not sit until the seventh standard year the greater part of the objection would go.  I would be very glad to think that there was something in that, but I understand that the only reason why the sixth <Col N="1197" /> standard year is made the year for the examination is that if the regulations prescribed the seventh standard year the children would have left school.  I do not understand when it is suggested that it is an educational outrage or an educational injury to require primary school children at the end of their school course to do that examination and I think it would be a very great wrong in present-day circumstances to deprive children of getting a school leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hickey particularly raised the question of scholarships and class distinction in education.  I do not know whether the only mark of class distinction in education is that some schools like the children to wear a uniform. If the uniform is not expensive I think it is a very good thing.  After all we look for good schools, clean schools, well designed schools and schools that will give the children in them a sense of dignity.  As someone has said, if you are brought up in a palatial school you will not be content to live in a slum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know a little more of what the difficulties are.  I would imagine that in our cities at any rate which are so liberally scattered with secondary schools, convent schools and schools of other varieties, class distinction cannot come in and I find it very difficult to appreciate the suggestion that the poor child cannot advance along the educational ladder.  A large number of scholarships are given from primary to secondary schools by the local authorities and a number of scholarships are given by local bodies into the universities.  The children of the less well off are safeguarded in the matter of these scholarships by the provision of the means test.  The means test varies very greatly in some areas and is very hard to understand.  I often thought I would like a little more standardisation and I might at some time appeal to the General Council of County Councils to see whether through their machinery they might be able to standardise these things a little more with regard to the means test and even with regard to the <Col N="1198" /> scholarships themselves.  I find it difficult to think that any promising child, particularly in an urban area, cannot get secondary education because of want of means.  The difficulty in regard to university scholarships is the number of them.  Four hundred and fifty-six scholarships from primary to secondary schools were awarded in examinations for the year 1948.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the total number of scholarships held in that particular year was 1,740.  It might be possible for local authorities to increase these scholarships.  Apart from the cost of technical education, the cost of education falls very lightly on local authorities in Ireland and I think they might get better value for their money and that the incidence of the money spent might fall in a more equitable way if a little more of the burden of education were shouldered by them.  The number of university scholarships awarded by county borough councils in 1948 was 100.  I do not know if it is fair to say that the City of Cork only gave two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of these facilities, I think, would be useful and desirable.  The State scholarships number 35 and they are entirely confined.  Five are given for Fior-Ghaeltacht pupils to the universities to enable them to pursue any course they wish.  Thirty scholarships are given on leaving certificate examination for the whole country but these are university scholarships that are tenable only in University College, Galway, where, I think, commerce, arts and science are at the present moment the only courses that can be pursued.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> The question was raised as to whether a proper curriculum was pursued in the secondary schools.  The secondary schools are privately run schools.  They pursue courses that are fairly wide and fairly open as far as Department of Education regulations are concerned, but I feel that the praise of the secondary schools' work and curriculum which we hear from time to time is not unmerited, and that the work of the secondary schools in this country is very satisfactory and very useful.  When we look back on the setting up of this State we see that those who took over the control and running of the Civil Service machine all came from our secondary schools.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is because I do not know any body of people who did a more important or more effective piece of work than the people who, when this State was taken into the hands of its own people, stood at the head of the Department of Local Government, the Department of Education, the Department of Finance and all the rest.  I do not think that any other country could show anything to equal the piece of work which was done then by men who for the most part got no education except what they got from Irish secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think our secondary schools have deteriorated since then.  I feel that if there are any further perfections to be introduced into the secondary school system, the Council of Education will find ways of either showing how it can be done or helping us to relieve that secondary school system of any shackles or inhibitions placed on its work by the State which may be damaging that work.  At present I feel that the secondary schools are doing very sound and satisfactory work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points were raised with regard to the technical school position, and, like some others of the speakers, I feel that perhaps, on the question of the provision of teachers, there is a <Col N="1200" /> difficulty.  On the domestic economy side, we are turning out, I think, 36 new teachers every year.  During this year and in future years, we will be turning out that number.  It may be that more are required, but I think that, if 36 new teachers are available this year, it will solve some of the present-day difficulty, and, if 36 are available next year, we may find that the pressure which exists at the moment will be relieved.  It is true that there is a considerable and rather constant wastage as a result of marriage, but that is not any great harm. What we want to do is to get clear how many teachers can satisfactorily be trained every year without overtraining and having teachers who have no work.</P>
    <P>On the mechanical side of things, I appreciate the case put up, not only here but elsewhere, that it is, and will be, more and more impossible to get effective teachers in whose hands our employers would be satisfied to see the training of their young people lie, unless there is a more satisfactory approach to the question of their remuneration.  It has been arranged in most cases that the maximum of the scale is paid to teachers of that kind, but it is a difficulty which will be kept clearly in mind and which will be kept fully investigated.</P>
    <P>I appreciate generally the reaction of the Dáil to the Council of Education, as I have set it up and framed it. I even appreciate Deputy Cowan's comment on it, because I think it may be helpful in the matter of perspective. I understand that Deputy Cowan would like to see a council of education with statutory functions, a council which would be set up by statute representing all statutory bodies of one kind or another, with parents thrown in.  I think it would be worth Deputy Cowan's while if he, as it were, threw his ideas into the form of a draft Bill, because I think that if he faced it in that way, it would help him to see more clearly what he thought he was moving towards and it might be useful for all of us to have a specimen of that Bill to which to relate our own plans; but I assure all those who are interested in laying a sound foundation for our educational <Col N="1201" /> system that what is wanted at present is the bringing together of experienced minds from the primary field, the secondary field and the technical field, so that they may enrich their own broad view of the educational problem by reason of the intermingling of their minds and experiences and get a unified outlook on what Irish education should provide in the primary, secondary and technical schools.  The foundation is the thing, however, that has to be settled first and that is the organisation, the syllabus and the approach to that syllabus in the primary schools.  I am perfectly certain that that is what has to be tackled.</P>
    <P>I appreciate very much, as I say, the way in which the council has been accepted, even with certain criticism of my approach to it, and, apart altogether from what the problem is, I feel that I can thank the personnel of the council and what they appear to stand for in the country for the reception accorded to the ideas I have presented. I feel sure that we will get there a unity of mind which will help us here to get a little clearer with regard to our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch and others spoke of the almost complete absence from our schools to-day of any instruction which would give the children a knowledge of modern Irish history.  I do not think we want it very much at all.  Deputy Lynch said, with regard to Irish, that what we wanted was opposition in order to have a strong development in favour of the language.  It is true that he said that as exemplifying a lack in the schools and said that he, having gone through the schools in modern times, did not know the history of the 1916 or pre-1916 period.  That may be a lack.  It is a lack in relation to his approach to the Irish language position. The Irish language movement did not start because there was opposition to Irish.  The Irish language movement started by people with an instinct for nationality finding out that we had the Irish language living amongst our people in the West of Ireland, a language that had come down from the very beginning, bearing the culture and bearing the genius of our race, both in its thought and in its expression.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1202" /> Anybody who went through the early days of the Gaelic League at that time has a sense of what it meant to him. These people might have learned a little Irish at school and might not have liked it.  There are plenty who did learn it and did not like it; but when they found the living Irish nation in the fastnesses of West Cork or the Donegal hills or the Connaught rocks, they found a Biblical people with a magnificent mind and a character that emerged from something great in the past.  They were Biblical in their stature, in their Christian approach and in their Christian philosophy.  It was because we fell among people of that kind, because the Pearses and the Hydes and the MacSwineys fell among people of that kind, that we had the Irish language movement and not because anybody was opposing Irish or fighting against the Irish language.</P>
    <P>It goes back to a tradition.  Somebody spoke here about the historical tradition of our race.  That is what we want to get at, and I do not think we will feed the historical tradition of our race and develop our strength of character to-day by brooding over 1920 and 1921, and by brooding over 1916 and all that happened in between, or over anything that happened as a result of our recent political developments. We have to go back to the things that are fundamental in our tradition and in our race.  It has been pointed out that the Irish race never went through any dark hour, whether it was a dark hour for a short time or for centuries, but there was an impulse for learning after it.</P>
    <P>It is pointed out that after the Danish invasion of this country had been crushed there was a linking up of Church and secular learning which blossomed in a bright way all through the 11th and 12th centuries.  You had a very bright period of learning with the Church and the secular learning in co-operation with each other.  Then the Normans came and again the nation was beaten down.  But you have it expressed in the words of an historian that Irish civilisation and learning triumphed because, although the monastic establishments were broken, secular learning rose again after the Normans had settled down <Col N="1203" /> here.  There was a tremendous uprising of secular learning and that kept the national spirit alive.  Then the nation was broken in the Elizabethan wars and you had the country completely under English rule from north to south by 1603.  Although all the property of our people was wiped out completely, we had in the 1620's and the 1630's the ecclesiastical refugees from the Continent coming to Ireland to remind the people that they were losing their national spirit because they were forgetting their national sense and scholars.  You had O'Clery and the Four Masters in the depths of the 17th century, with all the misery around, relighting again the fires of Irish learning.</P>
    <P>Then you come to the period in which we began to have our democratic struggle that ended in the setting up of this State.  From 1798 the democratic nation was gathering its strength and holding itself together in difficult times until the successful setting up of the State to-day.  While we were gathering political strength and coming to the present achievement, we were going through the Anglicisation which the Elizabethan wars thought to bring but failed to bring on the country. You even had it remarked that, through the language, our people in the 18th century had access to cultural minds which nobody depending on the English language could dream they had.  It was a harking back to the real sources of our national strength and mind.  We had a manifestation of that when the Hydes, the Pearses, the MacSwineys, the MacNeills and the others went into the Irish-speaking districts and gave us our modern Irish language movement.  It is to a period of learning we have to turn to-day and not to any mere considerations of 1913, 1914, 1916 or 1921.  That is an important period, but it is only important as a piece of the political history of our country.  These are manifestations of a strength that has its roots deeper than any mere political movement. What we have to realise is that, if we are going to be anything as a nation for ourselves or anything as a nation in the world that can be protected, it <Col N="1204" /> is to our individuality and spiritual strength we have to go back.  We have to go back to these things, to go back to secular and religious learning, and the binding of these things together as the roots of anything we are to-day or the roots of anything we can be tomorrow.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would deprecate the painting too clearly of modern Irish history in our primary schools at any rate, and I do not think that we want that particularly in our secondary schools at the present moment because we would be misleading our people. The very brightness of that story would mislead our people as to where our actual strength lies.  Our strength lies in a real grip of what our fate means, a real grip of where our national spirit comes from.  We must bring the people's minds back to what the Irish national tradition is and the Irish national tradition is that the triumph of our civilisation and our learning was greater than the triumph of our arms. We hear a lot too much of the triumph of our arms in recent years, while the real strength was the strength that gave us the Pearses and the MacSwineys, and their strength was not the strength of arms; they bore arms because there was deeper strength in them.</P>
    <P>In the same way, on the Irish language side of things, do not let us look for opposition.  If we cannot love the language for what is in it and make our people appreciate it for what is in it, then it is only foolish political nationalism, such as the nationalism that has brought Europe to what it is to-day, that will make us stand for the language just for a fight.</P>
    <P>Magnificent work has been done for the language in the schools and our teachers are very well equipped to do a lot more.  We would be foolish, as I say, to do anything that would show that the language was part of the political fight because, once we do that, then we throw one of the most sacred things that we have into the mess that can always be made of politics.  One of the things which has disturbed the language is that, to a certain extent, it has got into the political atmosphere rather than any other.  I am driven to <Col N="1205" /> say these things, not by way of criticism but in order to keep some of our younger people right.</P>
    <P>The question with regard to the position of Irish in the university and its relation to scholarships has been mentioned. That is being examined by a university committee and is a matter which will, at any rate, be settled satisfactorily.  Any problem to be considered can be considered at everybody's leisure.  But when I realise that 104 of our 413 secondary schools are doing all their work through the medium of Irish, I realise that it would be a hardship and militate against the successful and effective use of the Irish language in our secondary schools if students of these schools were prejudiced in going for university scholarships by reason of the fact that they had to turn to another language.</P>
    <P>Other difficulties that are in the way can be fully examined and fully expressed. On the question of scholarships, however, in subjects such as Latin and Greek, those who got the secondary education through the medium of Irish stand at least as high, if not higher, in the ultimate markings&mdash; when all marks that are given because the subject is done through the medium of Irish are eliminated&mdash;as others. Last year, in respect of the highest marks obtained in the leaving certificate examination in Greek, when the three, four or five marks in favour of those who did their work through the medium of Irish were deducted, I think that out of the first six places in the Greek list five were boys who had done their entire educational course through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>There was criticism of the decision in regard to the Roe Report.  All that I can say is that the fact that the Roe Commission was set up and made a report on the matters in question enabled very appreciable improvements to be brought about for the primary teachers.  Every principle with regard to pensions, the quality of payments, and so forth, that was enshrined in the Roe Report was accepted generally by the Government. The only limitations in carrying out the recommendations of the Roe <Col N="1206" /> Report were limitations imposed by finance.  In so far as there is a case to be made for or against, all I can say is that the representatives of the teachers' organisations who were aggrieved by the fact that the report was not fully accepted had the opportunity of meeting the Taoiseach and members of the Government and of having the full case explained to them. Therefore, I think that Deputies can afford to feel satisfied that everything possible was done and that that body was set up to make a report but that it would not have to be accepted either by the teachers or by the State.  It was very definitely understood that that was the position.  It was understood on the part of the teachers, on my part and on the Department of Finance.  I feel gratified that it has been possible to improve the position of the primary teachers to the extent to which it has been possible to do so.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked with regard to secondary teachers.  I have said that I received representations from the secondary teachers and that their applications are being considered.  I am not able to say anything about the matter because, naturally, with our Estimates printed, and so forth, anything that it may be possible to do for the secondary teachers will have to be done when the Minister for Finance is putting the final touches to his Budget.  I would hope that he would be able to say something then.</P>
    <P>A large number of the questions which were raised on this debate are questions which involve a very considerable amount of detail and I undertake to have them very carefully examined.  If Deputies at any time have any questions to ask, if they will put them down or communicate with me in any way I shall be glad to let them know how far we are making progress.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the National Museum and of the National Library. Dr. Thomas Bodkin was asked by the Taoiseach to examine some of these institutions and to give him a report, with suggestions.  The Taoiseach has now got that report.  It has been circulated, in so far as it affects various Departments, and certain comments <Col N="1207" /> and reports have been made thereon. The Taoiseach has not yet had an opportunity of completing the examination of either the report or the comments that have been made thereon but I take it that he will do that in due course and that when he has had an opportunity of doing so we shall see what is likely to be done as a result of it and it will then be possible to let the members of the Dáil know what has been done.  I appreciate what Deputy O'Reilly says with regard to the opening of the National Gallery on some nights during the week.  It is a pity that the National Gallery should not be open on one or two nights in the week.  If it is possible to make any arrangements to have that done, I personally would be very glad to see it done.</P>

I have particularly asked the representatives of the Comhdháil who met us, to help me with any suggestions for making short Irish films available.  I personally would be very glad to see a news reel made in the Irish language.  It is a matter that has been engaging my attention to some extent and will continue to engage it.

      <P>That the Dáil approves of the Agreement on North Atlantic Ocean Weather Stations, signed in London on the 12th May, 1949, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the Dáil on the 25th April, 1950.</P>
      <P>The agreement in question was drawn up at a conference held in London in April and May, 1949, under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  This conference was convened for the purpose of considering the revision and renewal of an earlier international agreement on the subject which was signed at London on the 25th September, 1946.  Invitations to attend the conference were issued to the Governments of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, Great Britain and the United States of America&mdash;states which were regarded as having an interest in international civil aviation in the North Atlantic region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aviation and meteorological experts agree that the establishment of ocean weather stations in the North Atlantic has been a notable advance in the development of international civil aviation in that area.  The meteorological <Col N="1212" /> data which they provide make possible improved meteorological forecasts which, in turn, are of great value for air services.  The stations also provide known points to which the captain of an aircraft threatened with a forced landing can direct its flight.  Aer Lingus derives appreciable benefit from the ocean weather stations in relation to its services. The regular and prompt receipt of weather data from these ships permits a higher degree of accuracy in forecasts and thereby facilitates Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The ocean weather ships also help in improving the standard of weather forecasting for other purposes.  This applies to forecasts issued to Radio Éireann for the use of the general public and to the Army and Air Corps. It will apply also, when the staffing position permits this work to be undertaken, to forecasts prepared for farmers and fishermen.</P>
    <P>The 1946 agreement made provision for the operation of 13 ocean weather stations.  The number of ships necessary to maintain a station varies from two to three, depending upon the distance to be travelled to base, the speed of the vessels, and other factors.  The new agreement provides for the operation of ten stations.  The practical effect of this reduction may not be considerable, since not more than 11 of the original 13 stations were manned at any one time.  The three stations removed from the original plan were those in the southern region of the North Atlantic, where island and mainland observation stations give greater coverage than elsewhere in the region. The rearrangement of the other ten stations has been made to secure the best results.  The revised location of the stations takes full account of Ireland's interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>The full text of the 1949 agreement is contained in a White Paper which was circulated to Deputies on the 20th April, 1950.  The agreement was signed by representatives of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Great Britain and the United States of America.  The Irish representatives in the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation signed the <Col N="1213" /> agreement in Montreal on the 27th June, 1949, on behalf of this country. To date, the agreement has been accepted by Canada, Great Britain and the United States of America.</P>
    <P>Article XV (3) of the agreement states that the agreement comes into force, as between the signatory Governments which have notified their acceptance, when instruments of acceptance have been deposited by Governments responsible for the operation of not less than 18 of the vessels referred to in Article I of the agreement. This condition was fulfilled on the 13th January, 1950, and the agreement consequently came into effect on that date.</P>
    <P>Article XVII contemplates that the agreement will remain in force until the 30th June, 1953, and that a conference will be convened before that date to consider the revision and renewal of the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Irish contribution under the 1946 agreement was at the rate of £5,000 per annum.  The Irish representatives made a claim at the 1949 London conference for complete exemption from contributing to ocean weather stations by reference to the extensive facilities already being provided for international civil aviation at Shannon and Collinstown Airports.  While acknowledging these services, the conference felt that Ireland should make some contribution. Following a review of the position, the Irish delegation indicated that Ireland was prepared, as a gesture of her interest in matters relating to aviation in the North Atlantic area, to make a contribution at the rate of £1,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The 1946 agreement represented the first successful effort to provide aviation facilities on a multilateral basis and was recognised as a good example of international co-operation.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £855,170 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1951, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission (44 and 45 Vict., c. 49, Section 46, and c. 71, Section 4; 48 and 49 Vict., c. 73, Sections 17, 18 and 20; 54 and 55 Vict., c. 48; 3 Edw. 7, c. 37; 7 Edw. 7, c. 38 and c. 56; 9 Edw. 7, c. 42; Nos. 27 and 42 of 1923; No. 25 of 1925; No. 11 of 1926; No. 19 of 1927; No. 31 of 1929; No. 11 of 1931; Nos. 33 and 38 of 1933; No. 11 of 1934; No. 41 of 1936; No. 26 of 1939; No. 12 of 1946; and No. 25 of 1949).</P>
      <P>The net Estimate for Lands for the present year (1950-51) represents an increase of £5,330 over the amount voted last year.</P>
      <P>The present Estimate follows closely the pattern of last year's Estimate. There are no new sub-heads or outstanding changes.  The greates disparities are: (1) an <i>increase</i> of £4,000 in sub-head H (3)&mdash;to meet deficiencies in the land bond fund arising from the revision of land annuities on land vested under Land Acts 1923-49; (2) an <i>increase</i> of £1,534 on sub-head A&mdash;to meet normal increases in salaries, etc., and (3) a <i>decrease</i> of £600 in sub-head G&mdash;to meet fees payable on warrants for collection of arrears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head I, which deals with expenditure on improvement of estates, is to remain unchanged at last year's figure of £354,800.  This figure was not fully expended last year on account of the unavoidable temporary hold-up of acquisition proceedings pending the passing of the Land Bill and also because of difficulty which was experienced early in the year in recruiting adequate labour.  The passing of the Bill will stimulate the output of improvement works and it is expected that the Estimate of £354,800 for <Col N="1215" /> improvements will be fully utilised this year.</P>
    <P>More than half the entire Estimate for Lands is allocated to sub-heads H (1), H (2), H (3) and H (4)&mdash; which are required to make good the deficiencies in the land bond fund. These deficiencies arise through the halving of land annuities and through other State aids to land purchase, namely, awards by the Judicial Commissioner from the Costs Fund and State contributions to vendors of estates, over and above the prices repayable by the tenant purchasers.  A slight deficiency also arises from the writing-off of annuities on lands which have been permanently submerged as a result of erosion.</P>
    <P>Some of the other sub-heads involve token amounts only.  These have been inserted to meet possible but unlikely contingencies.  The remaining sub-heads scarcely call for explanation as the changes this year are in no way out of the ordinary.</P>
    <P>During the prolonged debates on the Land Bill, I dealt very fully with the main activities and the present policy of the Land Commission.  I do not propose to hold Deputies up by making a long opening speech on this Estimate but it would not be right to let the occasion pass without giving the House details of the work done last year and of the prospects for the immediate future.</P>
    <P>It was very gratifying to me, during the recent debates, to hear that the whole House endorses the present policy of concentrating on the relief of congestion.  That evil is a hang-over from the bad times through which our country passed and it is akin to the problem of slums in cities and towns. Until congestion is substantially solved it will be held as a bad mark against our competence as a selfgoverning nation and it will be a constant source of complaints and censure both inside and outside this House.</P>
    <P>I have no time whatever for the pessimists who think that adequate progress can never be made for the relief of congestion.  Two years ago when I first came to the House with a Lands Estimate, I pointed out that <Col N="1216" /> the reserves of suitable land on hands of the Land Commission for allotment, had been exhausted and that it would take three years before adequate progress at land settlement could be achieved.  In general, that forecast is proving somewhat conservative.  I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that my expectations as regards land settlement progress for 1949-50, have been greatly exceeded.</P>
    <P>Last year, although the Land Commission were seriously handicapped by the delay in passing the Land Bill, they succeeded in bringing very substantial and permanent relief to a total of 1,250 congests.  That is the number of congests whose holdings were enlarged or rearranged during the year.  The livelihood of each and every one of these congests had been vastly improved and made secure.  They are no longer dependent on miserable patches of rundale or uneconomic holdings for a bare existence.  They can in future look forward to an economic return for their time and labour and to a decent standard of living for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>In all these 1,250 cases, comprehensive schemes of improvement works were carried out as part of the resettlement operations.  Wherever necessary, dwellings, out-offices, roads, drains, fences, pumps and so on, have been constructed or repaired or this work is in course of execution and will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>So that these and other similar congests could be given economic holdings the Land Commission migrated landholders to new holdings.  Their vacated lands have in most cases been absorbed already in enlarged or rearranged holdings.  In the remaining cases the vacated land has been let to congests nearby who have thus received the first benefits of land settlement and will get additional benefits through improvement works and final resettlement, with the shortest possible delay.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies who are not familiar with conditions in the congested counties cannot possibly have an idea of the amount of work and expenditure which goes into an average rearrangement scheme.  Apart from all the worry <Col N="1217" /> the inspector has in getting agreement amongst the tenants themselves to the proposed rearrangement, he has at the same time to visualise what the area will look like after the slum conditions have been eliminated.  He has to ensure that, in so far as is humanly possible, the holdings have to be in one compact rectangle.  Sometimes this is not possible, as in order to distribute the good land and the bad in a just and fair way it may be necessary to have the holding in two portions, but seldom more.  Then comes the task of constructing a suitable road or roads through the area, located so that the new dwelling-houses will be in the healthiest position and the most convenient from the point of view of the holdings.  He also has to advise on the lay-out of the out-offices.  Then the fences, stone walls, sod banks or wire and paling, as the case may be, have to be erected.  Drainage of low-lying wet areas has to be done efficiently, entailing the erection of culverts, bridges, etc.  While all this has been going on, the supervision of the erection of the new dwelling-houses and out-offices has to be closely watched, and 1,000 and one queries have to be answered and odds and ends of help given to the tenants who, in most cases, are themselves engaged in the erection of the dwelling-houses and out-offices.  This, I hope, will convey in a small way what one rearrangement scheme means and give Deputies an idea of the spade-work that the inspector has to undertake in such schemes.</P>
    <P>Altogether, upwards of 28,000 acres were allocated during the year in 1,800 allotments for various uses.  Of this area, approximately 24,000 acres are located in the congested counties.</P>
    <P>It is no mean achievement for any Department to have brought substantial and permanent benefits of this kind, which cannot be measured in terms of money alone, to so many allottees and their families.  Apart altogether from workmen to whom employment was given on improvement works, up to 7,000 deserving individuals in the allottees' households have benefited through these activities of the Land Commission.  While this is a very substantial achievement, I regard it <Col N="1218" /> only as a beginning and as an indication of what can and will be done in the future.</P>
    <P>When the Land Bill, 1949, is passed, the rearrangement of holdings will be carried out more quickly and I shall not be satisfied until there is a big speed-up in the settling of all uneconomic holdings, particularly those in rundale and detached plots.  This is the most pressing work that the Land Commission has before it.  Its fulfilment will clear away from our countryside blots which have remained with us far too long.  The problem is a big one and it will take time to bring a solution. Deputies who know the serious difficulties involved, will appreciate that real progress can only be made by persevering with a well-ordered programme. There is intense pressure to have too many cases handled at the one time; this is leading to confusion and it has compelled me to adopt a priority system which will deal with the worst cases first.  I hope Deputies on all sides of the House will continue their co-operation with me in securing that the energy of the Land Commission will be diverted to and helped along the path of relief of congestion.</P>
    <P>Every hour's time of every official on the staff will be needed to make headway against the vast amount of congestion still to be relieved.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier in this statement that land acquisition is held up temporarily pending the enactment of the Land Bill.  The proposed change in method of price-fixation has unavoidably thrown the acquisition machine out of gear.  At present an area of over 10,000 acres is held up and further progress cannot be made on these and similar cases until the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>During the past year the work of inspecting, valuing and instituting proceedings for acquisition and resumption was pressed forward to the utmost.  An area of 59,000 acres on 424 estates was inspected and valued.  Proceedings were instituted for 408 estates comprising 41,500 acres.  The reserve of useful land on hands of the Land Commission is still low but there has been a good intake into the acquisition machine and the passing of the Land Bill should make substantial areas <Col N="1219" /> available in the near future.  I hope also that the provisions in the Land Bill for purchase of land for cash will substantially increase the volume of land available to the Land Commission for migrations and rearrangement schemes.  The prospects for the coming year are bright but Deputies should not expect spectacular output for a little while longer as it will take some time to implement the Bill fully and to get the acquisition machine working at full blast.</P>
    <P>Good progress is also being maintained in the vesting of lands in tenants and allottees.  Last year 14,300 holdings and allotments and 1,900 rights of turbary were vested.  This output is considerable but it is barely sufficient as 85,000 other cases still remain to be vested.  It is essential to press on as quickly as possible with this work. Otherwise the machine will get clogged with new cases and will break down.</P>
    <P>Inspections into the use of allotments continued during the year and at present about 1,000 allottees are under observation.  There has been a marked improvement in the working of allotments and I hope this improvement will continue.  The Land Commission have no desire to deprive any allottee of his allotment but no other course is open to them in the case of an allottee who persists in misusing his allotment.</P>
    <P>The position as to payment of land annuities is very satisfactory.  The total arrears at 31st March, 1950, amounted to £197,200 which represents only 0.5 per cent. of the total sum collectable since 1933 viz. £38,564,154.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should say that it will be necessary to come to the House later in the year with a Supplementary Estimate to finance the operation of the new Land Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister needs to be congratulated on his tactic of bringing the land Estimate before the Dáil immediately after the discussion on the Land Bill. The land Estimate has mysteriously moved from the bottom of the class to the top, I suppose in the hope that all <Col N="1220" /> the Deputies will have exhausted their ammunition in the discussion on the Land Bill.</P>

      <P>If the Minister stopped we would get on far more quickly.  The Land Bill appears, somewhat like Hamlet, all over the Minister's brief and I expected it would.  With all respect, the Minister in his physical proportions reminds me of a famous individual, Tony Weller, and in his attitude on this Estimate I would not be surprised if he were a lineal descendant of that famous individual.</P>

      <P>In the case of Bardell and Pickwick the advice given by Tony Weller to the defendant is: &ldquo;Never mind the character.  Stick to the alibi.&rdquo; That is a good piece of advice, mind you, to give to a number of Deputies on the Government Benches.  I can imagine the Minister discussing with the Bardells of the Land Commission how to disembowel the Opposition and confound their knavish tricks.  I can imagine the Minister in his breezy way saying: &ldquo;Never mind performance. Stick to the alibi.  We can say we could not do anything because, after all, we were held up; we did not have the Land Bill.&rdquo;  I suppose if there was not that there would be something else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in Volume 114, column 2085 said that the increase in the Vote was due to the speeding up of land division.  That was last year if I may refer to it in order to drive home my point.  That was an amazing speed all right.  There was a preliminary inspection, of course, of 40,000 acres, a detailed inspection of 25,000 acres, and the subject of acquisition 45,000 acres, that is 110,000 acres.  He makes a speech about the tremendous acreage there was, glossing over the fact that the lands actually acquired at that particular time were 8,196 acres. Further on in that debate the Minister told Deputy Beegan in Volume 114, column 1122 that the division of land was completely and absolutely stopped during the war years.  Leaving out <Col N="1221" /> 1940 which was a war year when the Land Commission divided 38,637 acres when all activities of the Land Commission had ceased, by some peculiar operation of inertia, in the following five years, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, and 1945, 22,574 acres were divided every year.  These were divided during the war years when the Government was preoccupied entirely with the safety of the people and when multiple obstacles had arisen in every Department, and particularly in the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I always notice that, in the Minister's statements on Bills or Estimates, he seems to be preoccupied with battles which have been decisively won or irretrievably lost.  He is always swinging punches at opponents who have retired from the ring years ago, apparently without his being aware of the fact.  In his final statement on the Land Bill, which is the alibi, the Minister said that he proposed, in introducing the Estimate this year, to speak definitely on the policy of the Land Commission and that he would answer certain questions which I put to him during the debate on the Land Bill. We have the Estimate now and we have it under conditions that make a very definite change in the cost of Land Commission transactions.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned a large sum as being payable as a result of the halving of the annuities.  That sum will be further increased nowadays under the terms of the Land Bill by the fact that, in future, when market value is paid, when compensation for disturbance and for damage is paid and when the balance of the amounts due to the State are not to be collected, there will be a much heavier deficit in land bonds, however that deficit is to be met, and a much heavier burden on the taxpayer, and, if all this money which we see in the Estimate is to be increased, I am afraid it will completely eat up the Estimate and that we shall have to have Supplementary Estimates to provide for the real work of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>The Minister did promise to clear up policy and to answer any questions put to him during the debate on the Land Bill.  The questions I put to him then and put to him now are whether <Col N="1222" /> he agrees that, in view of the fact that the taxpayer has to bear such a huge added burden, the taxpayer has the right to ask how long more he will have to carry this burden, how much land is needed for the Minister's purposes and for how many years will there be a continuance of the present system before everybody is satisfied that congestion has been adequately dealt with?  The Minister insists in everything he says that he has given the Land Commission a new look in relation to congestion.  One would think that a migrant was never taken out of a congest county before, or that there was no distribution or rearrangement of land before, and that the main effort of the Land Commission was not, as it actually was, directed towards the relief of congestion from the very start. It has been said by some Deputies&mdash; wrongly, of course&mdash;that the Land Commission was set up to relieve congestion. Of course, it was not, but, once its main purpose, the transfer of ownership to tenants, had been served, the Land Commission's work was directed towards the relief of congestion, and that is the manner in which Land Commission activities were operated during the régime of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we must not look for anything spectacular for the present.  During the war years, with all our difficulties, the Land Commission divided 20,000 acres per year.  This year, the Minister has hardly exceeded that amount, in spite of all his promises.  I want to put it to the Minister that the reason he has not been able to increase the amount of land divided is that the pool of land at his disposal was too small.  Last year in spite of all his efforts, the amount of land purchased and acquired by the Land Commission was only 80,000 acres.  That is a very gloomy outlook, to my mind, for the coming year, up to 1951.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very glib when he was in opposition about what he would do and could do, and one of his ideas was to utilise the land annuities every year for the purchase and acquisition of land.  It seems to me that the real explanation of the Land Bill and the change in the method of <Col N="1223" /> land acquisition and resumption is that the Minister at last realises the difficulties of the Land Commission and the difficulties of his predecessors, and, when he realises the difficulties his predecessors had to meet, he should also admit the goodwill and honesty of purpose which he denies to these previous Ministers.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear that the relief of congestion is not something newly designed by the Minister.  It was the policy in the Land Commission long before the Minister ever expected to set his foot there.  Many congests were migrated from the congested areas into the better lands.  When the Minister says that migrants have been taken this year out of congested areas to make room for those who are left behind, I think that if he had done anything spectacular he would give us the numbers of those who have been migrated, the counties from which they have been migrated and where they have been sent to.</P>
    <P>This document which the Minister read is a much more literary production than last year's brief.  I had to complain of the statement made by the Minister last year, the shortness and the inadequacy of it.  The statement this year is a bit better.  There is, however, one magnificent insertion, a description of the work done by the inspectors.  It sounds to me like the rumblings of rearrangement.  I read some time ago a story of Rommel's campaign in Africa, the tremendous achievements he had made, his successes and the methods he used.  If some really good literary man would write the life of a Land Commission inspector in the congested areas it would be a story which would be far more spectacular, far more interesting, far more adventurous than anything written about Rommel.</P>
    <P>This is the most beautiful thing I have ever heard of.  I think we should make a picture of it.  At any rate, the Minister in tactics, if not in strategy, has at least equalled Rommel in bringing in his Estimate immediately after the Land Bill.  He knows how exhausted we are hammering against the stone wall of his rather recalcitrant <Col N="1224" /> mind.  I think that this document, no matter how it is written, is actually a confession of failure.  In spite of the fact that the Minister said that all Land Commission activity, all land division was completely and absolutely stopped during the war years, in spite of all the promises of the Minister and all the short cuts he has taken towards cutting red tape, he has hardly succeeded in this year of peace in dividing any more land than was divided in any one of the war years under all the difficulties and when, as he said, every activity was stopped.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not to be congratulated on the achievement of the Land Commission.  When he has got his Land Bill we expect him when he comes again to us, if he does come, to do far better for the congests of whom he says he is the friend.  I have quoted Dickens, and there are two other Dickensian characters, Codlin and Short.  I think Deputy Commons is Short if the Minister is Codlin, and that both of them are the absolute friends of the congests.  Beware of the Greeks and their gifts.  I am doubtful about the Minister and his success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to some extent with Deputy Moylan with regard to the Minister's introducing his Estimate after the Land Bill and the long discussion we had on land.  When a measure of that kind is going through it is usual to wander slightly from the path of the Bill and discuss congestion and land problems from A to Z.  Therefore there is not much that anybody can say on this Estimate without repeating what he said during the past month or six weeks.  The only thing I want to bring to the Minister's notice is that the pool of land which was created and held up, some of it for a long number of years, by previous Governments has been almost all divided up amongst congests.  In other words, the land that we had has now been divided up and, as far as possible, congestion settled in as many areas as possible.  Therefore, the problem now confronts the Minister of providing extra land, of creating an extra pool of land to deal with the problem that will face him.  Unless we have land to play around with, unless land comes <Col N="1225" /> into the hands of the Land Commission, it is so much humbug for any Minister or Deputy or Government to talk about the relief of congestion, which is supposed to be the big job of the Land Commission.  I am afraid that the pool of land coming into the hands of the Land Commission is coming in too slowly and that the efforts being made to speed it up by the system of compulsory acquisition are not satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give credit to the Minister for the efforts he has made to get land in another way under the system which he has introduced of getting it in the open market.  We can criticise the former system as being rather slow, cumbersome and awkward.  We can criticise those who administered it as not doing it in the manner we think they should.  We cannot see anything of the new system because it has not yet become law.  I would, however, say to the Minister in all seriousness that he will have to get more land by the new system of going into the open market than was acquired under the old system.  The old method of compulsory acquisition was not fast enough to make a decent effort to clear up congestion in the time that we should like to see it cleared up.  The procedure with regard to the acquisition and resumption was entirely and absolutely too slow.  As I have tried to point out many times, I see no reason whatsoever, when the Land Commission decide to acquire or resume any portion of land by compulsory methods, why a definite decision could not be reached within a period of 18 months or at least two years.  There may be reasons and there may be genuine cause for delays because the transfer of property is a very serious complicated matter and land legislation is very complicated and there may, therefore, be justification for a reasonable delay.  However, I see no justification whatsoever for some of the delays that have taken place and are still taking place in the Land Commission.  It is pretty annoying to Deputies on all sides of the House to have to put down questions to the Minister for Lands time and time again.  It is also very annoying to the congests, who are anxious to get land to relieve their problems, to <Col N="1226" /> receive the same repeated answers time and time again.  We are Irishmen and we are an impatient race.  We are easily stirred up and we are very easily antagonised.  If we do not get our rights the first thing we are inclined to do is to fight for them.</P>
    <P>That may have been a useful attribute and an ideal thing under an alien Government but I think we should never be forced to have to do it under a native Government.  Unfortunately, we have had to do it.  Both of the Governments which we have had in this country passed laws and these laws had to be broken in order to get the Land Commission into action&mdash; even then it was slow in getting into action.  I would, however, definitely dislike to see people ever getting the idea into their heads again that they would have to use force or threats or break the law in any way in order to get that to which they are justly entitled. If some of us who come from the heart of congested areas, or any Deputy, could go out and get the farmers from such areas in Ireland into a united organisation&mdash;bound together like, for instance, any of the trade unions&mdash;and demand their rights before a Labour Court and a labour tribunal, then I have no doubt whatsoever but that much more heed would be given to the problem.  The trouble is that everybody knows that that is impossible and that it cannot be done.  It has been tried time and time again in the past and it has failed.  Therefore the only hope the people in these congested districts have of airing their grievances is to elect representatives to this Parliament who will act on their behalf.</P>
    <P>While Deputies on all sides of the House sympathise with and do their best for these landholders I am afraid that the appeals they make often fall on ears that are heedless and deaf.  We have so many Land Acts and so much legislation through which the Minister and his officials in the Land Commission have to plod in order to prepare Estimates, in order to assess the amount of money that will be needed for administration, for the purchase of land and for the 101 other things which require to be done, that I am extremely doubtful that real progress <Col N="1227" /> can be made until some system of codification is introduced.  If we have to start out now and look for compulsory powers to acquire or resume anybody's land I am very much afraid that this Assembly would refuse to give such powers to any Minister or to any Government.  Strange as it may seem, I have a feeling that that is so.  When anybody seeks, compulsorily, to acquire or take over another person's property we immediately hear talk of socialism and communism, and I think people throughout the country would become afraid so that any Minister attempting to do such a thing would be very unpopular. However, we have a system here and we must utilise it to the best advantage.  That is the work that has to be done.</P>
    <P>It is now two years since the Minister took office.  We certainly did not expect him, in his first year of office, to do anything other than get a grasp of the administration of his Department. We expected, in his second year of office, that things would get livelier. Now, in his third year of office, we expect that there will be a definite acceleration and that much more work will be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Minister but not so much that there was very much acceleration last year as that what work was done was done in areas where it was very badly needed.  While we have problems in the constituency which I represent which have yet been untouched, I am glad to say that I have seen a noticeable change for the better in many areas.  Migrants who have been migrated from County Mayo to the Midlands and elsewhere&mdash;I do not know the numbers but I know that there have been migrations to counties where land is more plentiful&mdash;have been taken from areas which are definitely the worst in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties.  That did not happen heretofore. I am glad it is happening now and <Col N="1228" /> I hope it will continue to happen.  I hope that the worst cases will be given first consideration even though there may be a crying demand by people who feel they should be considered but who, nevertheless, are not as badly situated as those to whom the attention is being given.</P>
      <P>My big worry&mdash;I mentioned it yesterday&mdash;is the fact that we have made no effort to prevent aliens and foreigners from purchasing land in this country. We would, maybe, have some consideration if an Irishman were to step up and purchase a farm of 300 or 400 acres in the Midlands&mdash;such as that which was purchased by Prince Aly Khan during the last week&mdash;and use it for dairying, for tillage or for some sort of farming which would give employment on the one hand and which, on the other, would produce something which would be of value to this country. Everybody knows that the moneyed gentlemen who come into this country and purchase land do so for one reason only&mdash;to breed and rear racehorses and to carry on racing which, as we know, is the sport of kings&mdash;thereby giving very little employment and producing very few goods which are essential to the community.  The Minister would be well advised to look up the legislation which protects such people and which gives them the right to go into any county or even into the most congested areas and buy up land and register it as a stud farm&mdash;thereby enabling them to snap their fingers at the Land Commission and to prevent the Land Commission from taking over that land which would otherwise be available and of use to the community who have to live in small holdings all around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a very great fear that the pool of land at our disposal is getting smaller.  Everybody must admit that that is so.  The land that has been divided has taken so much away from the land which is now available.  In 1912, 1913 and 1914 it was possible for the Congested Districts Board to take over estates of, say, 15,000 acres and to make 8,000 or 9,000 of these acres available for the relief of congestion. Such large estates are not now available but we still have quite a goodly <Col N="1229" /> number of large farms which are not worked and which are unproductive. I refer to the type of farm which has been let on the 11-months system.  The individual who owns land and thinks it more profitable to go out of the country or reside in a town or city and carry on some other occupation, letting his land on the 11-months system, is the type of person who should receive the first attention of the Department. The Minister should deal with those who think so little of their land that they will not work it or take care of it or produce from it by their own labour. Unfortunately, quite a lot of farms are let in that way.</P>
    <P>In the western areas, where the poor unfortunate landholders got tired of the promises of relief for their problems, they pulled up their stakes and went to England or America.  They cut their connections once and for all with Ireland and with any prospect or hope of coming to reside here again.</P>
    <P>In the near future, when the Minister will have power to purchase such small farms at a substantial price, I hope he makes every effort to collect those small farms.  They will not add a big acreage of land but will definitely be of great use in dealing with congestion problems where people are hemmed in and hard pinched for a few extra acres. At first he should take over with the greatest speed possible the larger farms let on the 11-months system. That should be done by compulsory powers, without having to resort to the open market at all.  It is a well-known fact that the middle-sized farmer is the backbone of the country.  Deputies from all Parties have lauded the praises of the 30-, 40-, 60-, 80-, and 100-acre farmers, saying they are definitely the most prosperous and the hardest to break if ever an economic crisis comes.  We should set out to create as many of those economic-sized farms as possible and give the people an opportunity of earning a decent living on the land they have, or will then possess.</P>
    <P>No matter what else happens the land, or the farmer holding land, will accommodate only one of the family. If the average is four, only one can remain.  The other three must be provided <Col N="1230" /> for.  If the economic circumstances of the farmer are such that he can take care of his children, sons or daughters, as the case may be, when they grow up, there is a lesser burden thrown on the State.  It is human nature that everyone tries to provide as best he can for his own family.  If people are so well off that they can do so, that will be an easing on the finances of the Government, as there will be less call on the Government to help these people.</P>
    <P>We know that it is from the congested areas in the West most emigration takes place.  It is from the small holdings along the western seaboard that the ships going to England and America have been filled over the last 100 years.  We know the reason&mdash;that the parents cannot provide for their children, only one can remain and the rest must go.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make sure that compulsory powers are used to the utmost.  He should induce his officials to make decisions slightly faster and not have these terrible ten-, 15- and 20-year delays we have been used to for some time past.  We dislike being given the same answer to a question as was given in this House 17, 18 or 20 years ago.  I can assure the Minister that we do not like it and that we have no intention of taking this answer much longer.</P>
    <P>I put down many questions about land at the instigation of the people whom I represent, people whom I regard as my superiors and my bosses. When a person is told that in the case of one farm of land there is no change since the Deputy's last question, or in the second case, perhaps, that the Land Commission have decided not to institute proceedings for the acquisition of the land, we must know the reason.  That is what we are sent here for, to know the reason why the Land Commission has refused to institute proceedings to take over portion of a large farm or the whole of a large farm, settling with the owner by providing alternative land elsewhere or by paying compensation if he so wishes. These reasons we have never been given.  We asked for them and the Minister said that they were outside <Col N="1231" /> his control.  I would like him to get them inside his control and to inform the representatives of the people why decisions have been taken or have not been taken by the Land Commission in certain cases and on certain occasions.</P>
    <P>In the West and especially in County Mayo, we have waited very patiently for the acquisition by the Land Commission of a farm at Ballyhaunis which caused so much trouble and so much agitation a few years ago.  That farm is still in the possession of the owner, who walked in and grabbed it behind the backs of the people about three or four years ago.  I understand from the Minister that negotiations are in progress to migrate this grabber to the Midlands and divide the land which he will leave after him amongst the congested holders in the area.  I sincerely hope that case will be settled and that a decision will be reached by next November.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Minister that the patience of the people in that area is slowly wearing out and the patience of some of us who represent them is also wearing out; and if something is not done I am afraid he is going to have a packet of trouble down on his head which he will not like and none of us would like.  I know that the Minister is well-intentioned and has, perhaps, more sincerity in his intentions than anyone in this House.  I hope the decision will be given favourably and that the owner of the Cottage farm will be settled somewhere else out of the sight of the people of Mayo, where he has left such a taste and smell by the action he took some years ago.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a word regarding the size of the holdings the Land Commission are making.  In fairness to the present Minister for Lands, I must say that he has taken care that, wherever possible, decent-sized holdings will be given.  He is a great believer in the 30- to 40-statute-acre holdings, where these can be suitably provided in a farm that is taken over.  Let that work continue and let that size of holding be created wherever possible.  Let holdings of that size be given wherever possible.  If a farm that is acquired is not sufficient to give a certain number <Col N="1232" /> of holdings of 30 to 40 statute acres of reasonably good land, I would advise the Minister to reduce the number of holdings provided by at least one in order to ensure that what is given would enable the owner to make a comfortable living when he would settle down in it.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have adhered to a fairly standard design in the houses they provide.  They would be wise to alter the plans in respect of the houses they build in future.  In a progressive age, people would like to see a slightly better class house and a more attractive type of house than they have been used to.  I must say that some of the Land Commission houses were very good and very satisfactory but the Land Commission would be doing a very wise thing if they were to give a new look to their housing.</P>
    <P>When the Land Commission set out to divide a farm and to make a road through it, they do a very good job. In nine cases out of ten the Land Commission roads have been very good and satisfactory both in regard to foundations and width, but they seem to have a mania for suddenly stopping within, say, 100 yards or 200 yards of another thoroughfare, and thereby create a cul-de-sac.  That becomes worse and worse as years go on and is the cause of a headache to those who reside there and to their representatives. If the Land Commission, wherever possible, would continue the road they are making and connect up with another road, the local authority would be able to take over and put the road under contract.  That would mean that once a road is made the local authority, by the expenditure of £10 to £30 per annum, would keep the road surfaced and in good condition.</P>
    <P>The next matter is supply of water, especially in the Midlands, in Land Commission schemes.  It has been brought to my notice that pumps sunk by the Land Commission in some cases have not worked too well.  I do not know how true that is.  If there is anything in the complaint, I would like the Minister to examine it and to see what could be done to remedy that evil.  A scarcity of water is the most horrible thing a farmer can experience. <Col N="1233" /> The failure of a pump in the middle of a hot summer, that causes the farmer to drive his cattle five or six miles to water, is something he did not bargain for when he migrated.</P>
    <P>It used to be the practice, where a migrant was shifted from a congested area, for the Land Commission to give financial assistance to those remaining in the locality who had bad housing conditions.  I understand that that system is not carried on now, that the Land Commission will not advance, by way of free grant or loan, financial assistance except in very few cases. They used to advance ten times the valuation, or something like that.  I have been told that that system is not in operation now.  I would like the Minister to look into the matter and to give those who remain the same financial assistance, or almost the same financial assistance, as is given to the lucky individual who is migrated.</P>
    <P>A practice has arisen in the Land Commission of letting small patches of grazing to people who are left in congested areas.  While that may be necessary for a time, I would not like that practice to be continued too long because, when a person gets the grazing of a portion of land, later, when the Land Commission decides to rearrange the area, he is very often loath to part with the land on which he has spent money, on which he has put artificial manures and which he has husbanded.  He hates to see it taken from him and given to somebody else.  The Land Commission, when they move a migrant or rearrange an area, should get the area cleaned up once and for all.  They would then be able to stripe it and resettle it in one operation and there would be no need to let grazing for a period of three or four years.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Land Commission was very haphazard in its methods. It went into a congested area of seven villages, perhaps, and took a migrant from each, leaving not enough land to settle those left.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>They raised the hopes of the people who were left, to <Col N="1234" /> keep them from getting contrary or breaking the law.  That was the idea. The Minister has introduced into the Land Commission a system of cleaning up as they go along.  Even though those living in one end of the parish may be disappointed because the same progress is not being made there as is made at the other end, in the long run, it is the best plan.  It is less expensive, less troublesome and will cause less jealousy amongst those who are to benefit by land resettlement.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to adopt some system to debar persons from coming in and purchasing land for the creation of stud farms.  If he did that, he would be doing something very useful. He would get more land into the Land Commission pool.  He would be building up a reserve of fine fertile fields, which he must get to solve his problem.  When the Minister goes into the open market he will have a very good bidder against him when he has the Duke of Westminster or Lord Brockett or the Aga Khan or Prince Aly Khan.  Their resources are enormous and, if they want a suitable farm, I am afraid the Minister's official will have to stand back.  We are told the Aga Khan weighs himself every year in gold.  It is a very good investment to purchase land in this country and to get the benefit of the three F's&mdash; free sale, fair rent and fixity of tenure. Even the smallest and most humble Irish farmer has that.  That is what I want to point out to the Minister.  I understand that he has given it very close consideration and I hope that he gives it even more consideration.  It would be better perhaps if those fellows were kept out entirely, but I think if an example were made of a few of them it would be very discouraging for the rest who come in looking for something saying: &ldquo;We want it and we must have it by all means.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that even in the West of Ireland people are running very short of turbary plots. In the old days the only way the congested farmer had to make a few pounds a year was to cut turf and sell it in the town or to local people who had no turf of their own, which resulted <Col N="1235" /> in the wholesale extinction of turf banks over 50, 60 or 70 years.</P>
    <P>People in small holdings are in a sad plight with regard to turf and turbary plots.  In County Mayo in particular where Bord na Móna have left bogs and have decided to cease turf production I can assure the Minister that there are plenty of applicants who are very anxious to get a statute acre of bog to provide themselves with a fire.  We know that a system now exists in the West where people buy conacre turf plots which cost very much.  They used to be sold by the yard but now they are sold by the foot in certain areas.  That can be relieved by the Land Commission extending its activities in the acquisition of turbary for redistribution in plots amongst landowners.</P>
    <P>We are not giving the Minister the criticism we feel we could give him but as he has adopted a second system of providing land for the land pool all we can say at this stage is &ldquo;give the new Bill a chance&rdquo;, but if it has not made satisfactory progress by the next time this Estimate comes up then I can assure the Minister that his passage will not be so easy as it is now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>While I noticed that Deputy Commons met this Estimate with great glee and joy of heart I approach it very differently.  I felt very little joy because while the relief of congestion is foremost in the minds of the Western Deputies, we in County Meath expect a fair do.  Under the new Bill, however, and under the 1939 Bill I find that County Meath farmers' sons, landless men and workers are denied even an acre of land and I say to the Minister that he is building a great deal of trouble if he thinks that we are going to take these things lying down.  It is all right to say that in the national interests the relief of congestion is necessary, but I want the Minister to realise that very little land is available in the Midlands for the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Eighty or 90 per cent. of the land which was available for division has been divided over the past 30 years and the amount left for division is <Col N="1236" /> mighty small.  Even the migrants who came up in the past know that there are not 20 large farms in County Meath for division.  Most of them are 100 or 200 acres and if we divide a 100-acre farm in 30-acre plots we can have only three plots.  The congests from one parish in the West of Ireland would swamp the whole of Meath, Kildare and Dublin.  This problem will never be tackled in the way the Minister thinks.</P>
    <P>While I agree that this is a most important Estimate, the Minister has a most thankless task.  He comes from the seat of the congestion, from the county where the people are living on top of each other, and he views the question from that side, but I would like the Minister to come to County Meath and view the picture from our side.  He has never come to Meath to view the position there.</P>

      <P>There is no use in making a blind approach to the problem of land settlement.  The last Government did so and I hope that the present Minister will not do the same. A properly balanced economy is needed and you cannot make Meath and Dublin into agricultural counties. Gibbstown and Rathcarne are agricultural slums at the present time and the people who are most crying for relief are the migrants themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>You can do great harm when you think you are doing good by land division and I would ask the Minister to think before he goes headlong into it like a bull into a china shop.  I want him to realise that in the economy of this country a large amount of fair-sized estates and farms are needed.  If you divide all the land in Meath, Westmeath and Kildare as some people would wish I say that the economy of the country would be killed.  The people of the West who send their sheep, cattle and stores to our counties would find that they had cut off their nose to spite their face. They would find their market cut off and instead of sending their stores to <Col N="1237" /> us they would have to get out their currachs and fish in the sea as their little store trade would be killed.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his new Bill has made a fair effort to give justice to the landowners.  Under the Fianna Fáil Administration there was a great deal of confiscation of farmers' property. One person I know, who has since died, lost 200 acres and all she got was a £5 note.  I am satisfied that she was driven to an early grave because of the treatment she got from the Land Commission. The Minister, however, will give a fair and square deal to those people.  I want him to realise that if he tells people the truth and faces them honestly he will get a fair amount of land into his pool for the relief of congestion but he must face the people honestly and cut out compulsion.  In our county, his inspectors are like bloodhounds going around.  There is hardly a farmer, big or small, hardly a farmer with 30 acres, who has not an inspector sticking his nose in who wants to get some of his land.  He must get it, he says, because the local agitation is on.  There is no need for that.  There are a fair amount of Midland landowners with 200 or 300 acres. If they were approached in a proper way and asked to give with a good heart in the national interest some land for the relief of congestion locally or otherwise, the Minister would get that land with a good heart.  There is no use, however, in inspectors carrying on as they have been in recent years, saying that they are taking the land. They should meet the farmers as gentleman to gentleman.  The vast majority of people from whom land will be taken in County Meath are decent, straight, honest Irish farmers. I know some of them who, 40 years ago, were the sons of smallholders on ten-acre plots, and now they own 200 or 300 acres.  They work their land well and stock it well and give good employment, but notwithstanding that, Land Commission inspectors come and tell them: &ldquo;We must get some of your land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they were absentee landlords or wasters who did not work their land I would have no compunetion about taking land from them, but they are <Col N="1238" /> decent men who are working their land well, keeping the export trade going and bringing in the riches which keep the country going.  I do not want them sneered at by inspectors and land agitators.  I want to see justice done. I would say to the Minister &ldquo;call in some of your bloodhounds and look after their interests yourself.&rdquo;  We are not satisfied in County Meath with some of the inspectors.  They are there for the past 15 or 20 years and some of them are nothing more than &ldquo;besters&rdquo; and political hacks.</P>

      <P>We have asked for some of them to be removed but nothing has been done.  They are going around with a sneer now and saying: &ldquo;Our day has come; we will have our day.&rdquo;  I ask the Minister to think twice before allowing that to go on. Migration will take place whether we like it or not, but I should like to give the Minister a tip: give no man something for nothing.  There was too much of that in the past, when men, who gave up a rood or half an acre, got fine farms valued for £1,200 or £1,400 in the Midlands with cash given to them and horses, sows, ploughs, cows and so on provided for them, even to the extent of the sack of flour and oatmeal and a fire lighted for them and three or four loads of turf left in the backyard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have nothing against men getting these things, but I say it is a waste of public money.  If you must bring migrants to the Midlands in the national interest, I say bring up the larger type of migrant and give him a balanced farm in Meath, Westmeath or Kildare where he will be a national asset and do not bring up scores of small men who have to poke their way for years before they are able to find a balanced way of farming.  Many of the men who came to the Midlands from the West, the North and the South were good men.  Many of them had to feel their way and were more or less a laughing stock for a few years, but they fitted in eventually and made good farmers.  There is, however, too much waste of national resources in doing <Col N="1239" /> this kind of thing.  I should like to know what is the total cost of each migrant brought up to the Midlands from the time he is taken from his own holding and placed on his farm in Meath.  I suggest that it is enormous.</P>
    <P>There are many landholders in the West with farms of 200 and 400 acres, and indeed 500 acres in Mayo and other counties.  Why not take one of these people out and give him 70 acres, with a decent house, in Kildare, Meath, Westmeath or Dublin and then divide his land up amongst the small people in the West?  There is no use in telling me that you will relieve congestion by bringing up hordes of small people. Two or three parishes in Mayo or Sligo sent up to Kildare, Meath and Dublin, would dispose of all the land available there.  Along the Cavan border, in Meath and in Cavan, there is just as much congestion as there is in Mayo or Sligo and I ask the Minister to tackle that problem in the interests of the Midlands as he is tackling in the interest of the Westerners.</P>
    <P>We want justice and fair play and if he took farmers from the congested areas of Cavan and Meath and placed them on good holdings in Meath, Westmeath and Dublin, he would be doing a good national work.  But no, we see nothing of that kind.  The land of Meath for the people of the West. We are not going to stand for that. Over the past few years we had a great agitation in Meath for land division, an agitation which in many cases was an unjust, a false agitation carried on by men with glib tongues who never walked an acre in their lives, who held meetings of young farmers at the crossroads and said: &ldquo;We want this farm and we want that farm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the 1939 Act and the Land Bill, farmers' sons and labourers are debarred from getting land in Meath or Kildare, but there are scores of these young men who are being told by these agitators that they must get land. I agree they have done a good deal of work in the matter of bringing before the Land Commission certain farms which should be divided, but they have fooled a vast amount of these people.  I do not want to see anybody fooled and <Col N="1240" /> I want to know now from the Minister will one farmer's son in County Kildare, if he is a landless man who is eligible for land and willing to take land, get such land and will the cottier get a five-acre plot as in the past?  I am told by the Minister and by the Land Commission that not one of these people will get an acre, but we are expected to lie down and watch hordes of people coming in to take over the land of Meath.  That is unjust, and I urge the Minister to provide in his Land Bill for justice being done to many of these farmers' sons who have the ways and means to work a holding in the national interest.  We will not take this lying down and I say that whether the Minister likes it or not and whether he sits on this side or not.</P>
    <P>For years, we saw wasters of all types being planted on the land of Meath and Westmeath&mdash;not by the Minister or by the Government, but by Fianna Fáil clubs&mdash;and we saw all over Meath and Westmeath a large number of these people being evicted and thrown on the public road.  I do not believe in evictions, because I have heard too much about them, but they must take place at present in the national interest because wasters got land and houses and would not live in them.  You can see them from Monday to Saturday drinking beer in the publichouses&mdash;their lands set and their houses with straw and oats in them, and rats living on them, while they live miles away.  I believe that no Land Commission could stand for that. Something must be done and is being done and I stand behind the Minister in taking wasters away from good land.</P>
    <P>I do not blame the Minister or the Land Commission so much as I blame the Fianna Fáil Government during their 16 years of office.  Why did they pick such men and give them these national resources?  It was a public disgrace and we now see the results of it&mdash;evictions, drunken wasters, good for nothing, whose land has gone wild. In many cases, gates and piers have disappeared and some of the gutters have been torn off houses and sheds and sold to buy beer.</P>
    <P>However, the boys waved the flags and they had to be appeased.  Ireland <Col N="1241" /> did appease them, but Ireland has now to pay for it.  Let the Minister start on a different line, as I know he will. Let all these things be cut out and let every man get his farm on merit and let there be no dictation from this or the other side.  Give the Land Commission their job, tell them what to do and set them doing it and let land be given to the best type of people. Put in your provision to enable justice to be done in Meath, Westmeath and Kildare before you flood these counties with a vast number of migrants. I have no objection to migrants.  All my neighbours are migrants, good men, hard-working honest men, many of whom vote for me and some of whom vote against me.  They realise the position we are in and they say that it is not fair to our people into Meath and give none of our people the land. I say to the Minister: &ldquo;You are building a hornet's nest around your ears&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's ears will be warm every day, if he does not get something done.  I ask him to come down to Meath and see for himself what is going to take place, so that he may avert it.  In the case of a few farms divided in the past few months, not one Meath man got an acre.  Three or four migrants were planted on these lands with new houses and stables and given 30 acres. I have no objection to that, but I want to see fair play, and, if, we do not get fair play, I say, although I hate saying it, that the law will be broken.  I am sorry to have to say it.  The Minister is a genial, good and honest man and I know he does not want agitation and that he will stand for fair play.  We will stand for migrants coming into Meath if we get fair play.  We want the migrants and the local people to be friends as brother Irishmen should be.  They are at present friends and respect each other.  If there is no provision for what I suggest in the Land Bill which has gone through the House I think it should be put into it so that justice will be done to many of those people from whom we are taking land.  Many of these men work <Col N="1242" /> hard and honestly.  They may have 300 acres of land but it is fully worked and stocked and they are giving full employment.  If you break up the present economy you will be creating agricultural slums and you will have emigration, misery, poverty and unemployment as in the famine days.</P>
      <P>I know one man who may have about 400 acres and who has his land fully stocked and works it well.  He is one of the best employers in Meath.  That man has six sons.  He gave up some of his land last year and some the year before, and now he is told that he must give up more land.</P>
      <P>Is that man not entitled to give some of his own land to his six sons?  He is entitled to fix up his sons on his own land.  I say to the Minister that he should proceed cautiously and slowly and ask farmers for the land in the national interest and not send down inspectors to say: &ldquo;We are taking your land.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture and other Ministers stated that it is time to give the farmer a chance.  If you give the farmer a chance he will respond.  He has as national an outlook as anybody else.  If you look for the land in the proper spirit, I am satisfied that any man who has a fair-sized holding will give up some of it in the national interest.  If you pay him a good price for it you will make a friend of him and he will be friendly with those who get his land.  I have said enough, but I will say more before the year is out, I expect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us that he had divided 22,000 acres of land last year but, as Deputy Moylan pointed out, during 1940 the much abused Fianna Fáil Administration was responsible for the division of 38,000 acres and during each of the war years, when supplies of materials essential to the division of land were practically unobtainable, no fewer than 20,000 acres were divided in each year.  That was at a time when, according to the Minister, the activities of the Land Commission had been suspended.  It will take the Minister a very long time before he will reach the average acreage of land divided by Fianna Fáil during their period of office.  I know very well that the position with regard to congestion in County Mayo is very good, but County Mayo is not the only county in the west.  There are other counties there where there are congested areas practically <Col N="1244" /> as bad as any in Mayo.  There are only one or two such areas in my constituency, particularly Flagmount, where the valuation of the so-called holdings is only a couple of pounds.  A large number of these people some time ago expected to be migrated but, due to an adverse decision in the courts, the migration was held up.  That was a big disappointment to these people who were expecting to be relieved.  It would appear as if there is very little hope for them now.</P>
      <P>Coming to the division of land, I do hope that it is not the policy of the Government to blackball I.R.A. men with proven national service.  In the few areas which have been divided in my constituency in the last 12 months I notice that a number of very suitable applicants with proven national service, even though they possessed all the necessary qualifications, such as being resident on a small holding of a few pounds valuation immediately adjoining the estates which were being divided, being married men with large families, industrious and capable of working these holdings, were passed over in favour of men living much further off and who were much less suitable.  I do not know whether the Minister would be personally cognisant of these facts but I should like him to inquire into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy give the particulars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly will.  I have already taken steps in one instance anyhow, and I will have a little more information for him in the course of the next few days about another.  I know it is not possible for the Minister, even if he were so inclined, to interfere in matters of that kind.  I should like to remind the House, and particularly Deputy Giles who seems never to have read the Land Act of 1933, that, even if the Minister so wished, there are still certain reservations placed upon him.  Under Section 7 of that Act the Minister is precluded from interfering in such matters.  Yet we hear statements made even to-day that land was given to people, not by the Minister, not on <Col N="1245" /> the recommendation of a Deputy, but by the interference of a Fianna Fáil Cumann.  I advise the Deputy to read the Land Act of 1933.  Under that Act, even the Minister is precluded from interfering.  A Deputy is precluded from interfering, no matter what Party he belongs to.  Of course a Deputy can recommend a suitable applicant for consideration and the inspectorate staff of the Land Commission will be obliged to consider such an application.  I presume that that still holds.  But, so far as personal interference by the Minister is concerned, I think it would be impossible for him to interfere, even if he were so energetic and spiteful, along the lines so frequently alleged during the last 18 years.  I think it would be about time an end was put to that sort of propaganda which everybody knows to be untrue.</P>
      <P>In my opinion the housing provided for migrants and others who get divisions of land is entirely inadequate.  In some cases the houses are unsuitable. If I am not mistaken I drew attention to this matter last year or the year before when this Estimate was being debated.  In bog areas houses are being built with little fireplaces which are unsuitable for the burning of turf. That is particularly so in rooms in some of these small houses which are provided by the Land Commission. The Minister would do well to look into the plans and to have some alteration made so that the people who have turf at their doors would be able to use the fuel which nature has provided for them instead of expecting them to use imported coal.  I think that the number of out-offices provided, and the types of out-offices provided, are entirely unsuitable.  They are inadequate to enable a migrant or other allottee to farm his land in a proper manner.  For instance, a stable is supposed to be provided but no provision is made for even a farm cart because any of the doors in the out-office would not permit of a farm cart being pushed in.  It would not cost the Land Commission a great deal extra to make the door a few feet wider and thus enable the farmer to put in his cart and protect it from the weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> I want to refer to the question of fencing.  We see all over the country a number of sod-fences put up by the Land Commission&mdash;particularly where building materials are scarce.  Apart altogether from the waste of such land it is only a matter of time until the cattle on either side of such a fence level it to the ground.  With a little more consideration and thought the Land Commission could, when building these fences, plant thornquicks at the butt of the fences and, and even a single strand of wire would be suitable until the thornquicks would grow up. That could be done without any great cost to the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Apart from the division of land, another very important matter to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister is the provision of turbary.  In Clare, more bogs are available for division than there are lands to be divided.  There is a big demand, which is not confined to any particular area but which is general throughout the whole county, for the division of these bogs.  I hope that during the coming year the Minister will give some attention to the claims of these people&mdash;many of them are without turbary on their own lands&mdash;and, where possible, provide them with suitable turf banks.  We all know how difficult the position is in an area where there is no other source of fuel, such as timber and so forth, and how essential it is to provide the farmers and smallholders with a suitable bank of turf.  When Deputy Giles complains about migrants being brought from the West to the Midlands I might retort by asking him to keep some of his own people from buying up the large ranches in the Carran district in County Clare.  They have recently purchased some holdings to the extent of 400 or 500 acres.  He might be interested to know that some of his colleagues are protesting against that state of affairs.  I hope the Minister will bear that in mind when he is preparing his plans for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from a county in which, perhaps, there has been more Land Commission activity over the past 20 years than in any other of the Twenty-Six counties.  Nevertheless, there still remains a lot to be <Col N="1247" /> done.  We have a dual problem there &mdash;the problem of congestion and the problem of the land.  We have land there to be divided and we have congestion. Therefore, nine-tenths of my work as a public representative is Land Commission work.  Perhaps it does not sound very well, coming from me, to congratulate the Minister or his Department on the many things which were done, to my own knowledge, in my county within the past couple of years but, without fear of contradiction, I say that without a shadow of a doubt progress has been made.  I can see evidence of that progress day by day and week by week because my Land Commission work is decreasing. During my first couple of years as a representative in this House my Land Commission work was colossal.  It is, however, diminishing year by year and that, I think, is adequate proof that the activities of the Land Commission have been intensified within the past couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he has also taken over Galway, and I wish him the height of good luck.  Figures and facts speak for themselves.  When the Minister tells us&mdash;and I have no reason to doubt it as the matter has been exemplified in my constituency&mdash;that 1,250 holdings have been brought up to an economic level during the past year I would say that that is an achievement of which any Minister or any Department should be proud. While it may not seem well for me to be praising the Minister&mdash;as a member of the Party to which I belong&mdash;I assert that I would say that to any Minister, no matter what Party he might belong to and I congratulate him on the achievement.  He has, also, vested 16,200 holdings.  That is a record, as far as I know.  I do not think that ever in the history of this country such a large number of tenants have been vested in their land in a similar period of time.  I congratulate the Minister and also his Department and staff on the work they have done.  The Minister said that during 1949-50 he distributed 28,554 acres of land.  That is not a bad record.  When <Col N="1248" /> the Minister took office he had, first of all, to find his feet as a Minister. He found the Department in chaos. Everything was topsy-turvy there during the years of the emergency and work was at a standstill.  It took him quite a long time to get into his stride but I must say that since then he has done remarkable things in such a short space of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After all these bouquets, there are a few matters which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.  The first concerns unestablished outdoor officers in the employment of the Land Commission. I was surprised to learn that the number of such officers exceeds 50. Some of these men are, perhaps, over 50 years of age and I understand that once they reach that age they cannot be established&mdash;and when they reach 65 they are thrown on the scrap-heap without any provision being made for their future by way of pension.  I was surprised that a large body such as the Land Commission should have in its employment 48 or 50 men on its outdoor staff who are yet unestablished. I understand that that state of affairs has existed over the years.  I protest strongly to the Minister in respect of such a state of affairs.  I think it is a disgrace and a shame.  I must say that I was very irritated when I heard about it.  Why it is that men up to 50 years of age who have, perhaps, given 30 of the best years of their life in the service of the Land Commission, cannot, when they reach 50 years of age, become established?  When they reach 65 years they have, automatically, to retire and they are then in the position that they have no pension and that no provision whatsoever has been made in respect of their old age.  I appeal to the Minister in all decency and reason and common-sense to make provision for these men.  He should make representations&mdash;I presume to the Department of Finance&mdash;to see that these men are established without delay.  This might be more appropriate on the Land Bill, but the Minister might be courteous enough to give me a little information. I know four or five large farms purchased about a year ago by the Land Commission and the price fixed.  Some of the people had to have annuities redeemed, which brought the <Col N="1249" /> price down considerably.  In two or three cases, possession has not yet been taken.  In one case, the price was fixed last July.  The people who owned the farms formerly are anxious to know if they will still have to redeem the annuities.</P>

      <P>Deputy Giles seemed perturbed about the activities of the Land Commission in his area.  It is strange that none of the representatives in his area seem to be very active with questions in connection with Land Commission activities.  I think there cannot be a very acute congestion problem there.  There are hundreds of thousands of acres in the area which should be acquired for migration, to relieve congestion elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and his Department <Col N="1251" /> have given guarantees on various occasions that there would be no such thing as victimisation of local congests until the congestion question is settled in the area where land is divided.  If congestion in my county were fully solved and everyone had been brought up to the economic level, I would have no objection to a man from Mayo coming in but I would object to my grandfather from Mayo being brought in now to my county, where the congestion problem is so acute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>Just what the Deputy practised himself.  Regarding fences, houses and roads, more attention should be paid to them.  In the past, I had the sad experience of seeing some land division on the plains of Boyle.  Houses were erected there at that time, 16 years ago, and they are all tumbling down now.  The houses on the Warren estate are so bad that in some of them you would need to wear your overcoat, while the tiles are rattling on the roof.  There should be more supervision in the future.  At the time these lands were divided on the plains of Boyle, some of the tenants who were migrated&mdash;they seem sorry they cannot get back&mdash;were promised an adequate water supply for domestic use and for live stock.  For the last 15 years they have no supply of water, and I do not think that, up to the present, anything has been done to relieve the situation.  It was intolerable last year. I made an appeal on various occasions, to the past and to the present Governments, to relieve that want.  I have seen people driving cattle three or four miles to water.  The position was very serious last year, as the Department must know.  I would ask that the promises and guarantees to provide water be fulfilled.  The fences on many farms are crumbling away.  Like other speakers, I suggest that the Department should embark on some programme of planting whitethorn, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding letting for grazing of lands in the hands of the Land Commission, I asked a supplementary question some time ago and suggested that any letting for grazing or tillage should be <Col N="1252" /> advertised by a poster on the local church gate or in the public Press. Where the letting is of a big nature, 400 or 500 acres being let by conacre or for grazing, it would pay to advertise in the Press, and where the letting is small it could be done by the church gate poster.  Then people would be notified of what is happening.  Some things have not gone to my satisfaction, so far as the letting of some farms is concerned, and the most deserving people have not got them. There are some congests with a few head of cattle who need accommodation very badly.  In that connection, I would like to bring to the notice of the Minister and the Department that in many cases the rents charged for grazing on these farms are exorbitant.  I have seen as much as £4 per head paid for yearling beasts for six months, and as much as £6 per head for two-year-old beasts for six months.  I understand that the Land Commission is not looking for a profit on these transactions. It is too big a body and these are only infinitesimal matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not letting by auction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>No. £4 for a yearling beast and £6 for a two-year-old beast is exorbitant.  There should be a fixed nominal charge.  In my opinion, £2 for a yearling and £4 for a two-year-old beast would be reasonable in the case of a poor congest&mdash;perhaps a little severe.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the policy of the Department with regard to accommodation plots for cottiers will be in future but I have been informed recently that in the division of the Kingston estate, Kilronan, in the extreme north of County Roscommon, cottiers have got accommodation plots.  I would say to the Minister that in this matter he should be extremely careful.  There are cottiers who are deserving of allotments and who would give satisfaction and work them, but there are cottiers of another class who will never work them successfully.  The Land Commission are having difficulty with some of these cottiers in parts of County Roscommon and I know of cases where they have been dispossessed or where action is pending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1253" /> While I approve in general of giving plots and agree that a good man in a labourer's cottage should be entitled to five or six acres if he is adjacent to the farm or living on the farm that is divided, in the case of landless men another bogey arises.  I know the Land Commission does not regard them favourably as applicants for land. There are exceptions to every rule.  In my short experience as a public representative I have seen the Land Commission faced with considerable trouble from landless men who got land perhaps nine or ten years ago, on division. They were most unsatisfactory and proper care was not taken in the selection of them.  There is another kind of landless men, in whom I am interested. Take the case of a good thrifty honest working farmer bringing up four or five sons.  One of these sons may start dealing in cattle and may make some money.  I know of a few young men who have from £600 to £800 in their possession&mdash;not sufficient to buy an economic holding and stock it but sufficient to stock and work a holding.  Such cases should be investigated and men of that calibre should be selected as being suitable for land. There again, the Minister would have to institute very careful inquiries because there could be fakes.  It is too bad that such men as I have mentioned do not qualify for land.  I know them to be even more industrious and better men than some of the congests that have been migrated.  Landless men should not be placed too far down on the list for division of land.</P>
    <P>With regard to Land Commission roads, up to a point, I can praise the Land Commission as far as the construction and making of roads is concerned. They have made very good roads, well surfaced, but, like Deputy Commons, I think they could have continued the roads further.  In some cases they make a road to within 100 yards or 50 yards of a main thoroughfare and stop there, thus creating a cul-de-sac.  At present, there is no legislation&mdash;let us hope it will come&mdash;by which culs-de-sac may be maintained by county councils, with the result that no matter what representations are made to the county council or <Col N="1254" /> county manager, a cul-de-sac is ruled out.  These roads should be continued to the main thoroughfare and the county council, in time, would maintain them at public expense.  Deterioration has occurred in many of these roads.  I am glad to see that a little more money is being voted for rural improvement schemes but it is very difficult to get the people living on these roads to agree to a rural improvement scheme.  I would urge on the Minister the necessity for making these roads right through.</P>
    <P>In regard to turbary, I would like the Minister to step up progress in the division of land and allocation of turbary. In my immediate vicinity there are some very large tracts of bog and they are no man's land.  No one actually knows what his rights are, if he has rights, on these bogs.  That is a very unsatisfactory position.  There is in that locality sufficient bog to supply the needs of all the people in the district but some people have acres and acres while others have none at all. That position has developed down the ages, by people laying claim to tracts of bog, by establishing squatter's title by cutting turf on them for a number of years.  People whose valuation is very high and who, perhaps, have a couple of houses on their land, a herd's house and their own house, are not able to provide fuel for themselves or their herd.  It is a case of famine in the midst of plenty.  The turf is there but it is not equitably distributed.  I would ask the Land Commission to step up on that matter at once and to divide those bogs.  That situation is not peculiar to my county but is prevalent in other counties.  I think it is more acute in my county, especially that part of it that is in my immediate vicinity.</P>
    <P>I want again to refer to the unestablished officer.  I am sorry to have to repeat what I have already said but I feel very annoyed that a big body such as the Land Commission should be working on the cheap.  A State employee is entitled to some recognition when he has given 40 or 50 years of the best of his life to the State. These men, as I said before, are in the unhappy position that when they come to 65, if they are unestablished, they <Col N="1255" /> cannot get a pension.  They cannot be established after the age of 50 years, I understand.</P>

      <P>I understand that, up to a point, but, at the age of 65, they enjoy none of the privileges and perhaps the county home or the workhouse will be the finish.  Established civil servants are granted a pension.  It is cheap, mean and uncharitable, that these men should be asked to give 40 or 50 years of their lives to the State service without being protected in their old age.  They are thrown on the scrap-heap. I would ask the Minister to make representations to the Department of Finance to see that this injustice is repaired.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry gave notice to-day that he intended to raise the subject matter of Question No. 38.  He will be permitted to raise the matter of the increased revenue from motor taxation, its accumulation and allocation.  He will not be allowed to discuss the petrol tax, its accumulation and allocation on this occasion.  He may only raise motor taxation, its accumulation and allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down this question to the Minister to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government if, in view of the increased revenue from motor taxation and from petrol tax totalling over £2,600,000 since 1947-48 and consequent increased traffic and deterioration of roads, he will consider increasing the grants to local authorities for road improvement and repairs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently I shall have to drop the question of the petrol tax.  I may deal <Col N="1256" /> only with the increased revenue from motor taxation.  According to the figures I got here on the 19th April in reply to a question to the Minister, the revenue from motor taxation in the year 1947-48 amounted to £2,000,000; in 1949-50 it was £2,552,000 and in 1950-51&mdash;the Estimate was a very conservative one&mdash;it is £2,600,000.  As compared with the grants given by the previous Government there has been a considerable reduction.  In 1948-49 the grant was £4,622,000.  It has dropped from that down to £2,238,000 last year. Last year the Government received £2,552,000 into the Road Fund.  Of that sum they gave out £2,238,000.  I would like to know where the other £300,000 went.  At column 470 of Volume 115 of Dáil Debates of 9th May, 1949, the Minister for Finance stated that he had £461,000 &ldquo;which will be reduced to £161,000 by a contribution of £300,000&mdash;the same as last year&mdash;from the Road Fund.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The only allusion I intend to make to the petrol tax is to say that in 1947-48 it amounted to £1,514,925.  In 1949-50 it amounted to £3,213,000.  I understand the tax on petrol works out at about 2/2 per gallon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have warned the Deputy that I will not allow him to discuss the accumulation or allocation of the petrol tax.  It is in a quite different category from the road tax.  It is appropriated under the Appropriation Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to allude to it in the sense that there must be an enormous increase in wear and tear on the roads because of the increased consumption of petrol.  Judging by the Minister's statement, apparently the Minister for Finance this year intends to make a further raid on the Road Fund to the tune of roughly £350,000 as compared with the £300,000 he took last year.  Whether or not that is considered fair to the local authority, which is after all responsible for the upkeep of the roads, or to the motoring public who pay taxes on their cars for the pleasure of having their springs, etc., broken, is something that, in my opinion, creates a problem for the Minister, and I think that problem <Col N="1257" /> should be met by the Minister in increasing the grants he proposes to give to local authorities this year for the upkeep of the roads.  I said to-day that I thought the Minister had got enough out of the Road Fund.  If he had an extra £2,000,000 he should leave the Road Fund alone.  This move each year of collecting more money and leaving the roads to take care of themselves is bad.  In parts of County Cork the position is that the water-table is now in the centre of the road and not in the dyke.  According to the reply I got from the Minister to-day, there has been an increase in motor taxation in Cork County of some £70,000.  That does not represent a true picture by any means of what has actually happened.  The Irish Sugar Company has opened up a big line in Buttevant, and a whole fleet of lorries is travelling over the county roads, roads which were never built to take 20 to 25-ton lorries and their loads. The oil companies have increased their road travel considerably, so has Córas Iompair Eireann.  But all those companies pay their taxation here in Dublin and not in Cork.  Therefore, £70,000 does not represent a true picture of the increased traffic on the Cork roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reason for raising this matter is to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary the existing condition of affairs and the appalling conditions in which our roads will be if the present Government continues to cut the road grants.  The Minister stated that the road grant this year would be the same as last year.  Evidently there is to be no increase despite the fact that the wages of road workers have gone up by at least 6/- per week in the past 12 months.  There is very little good in a Government increasing a man's wages by 6/- or 7/- a week if the yearly income remains the same as it was before that increase was given and if the worker is told: &ldquo;I will give you an increase of 10/- or 12/- a week, but you will only get the same £150 a year that you got two years ago, and you can spend the rest of your time sitting in the ditch or walking around the roads to keep out the cold.&rdquo;  That is of very little use.  That increase will mean that <Col N="1258" /> there will be less work on the roads and less work done on the roads.</P>
    <P>The cost of road material has been increased by at least 10 to 12 per cent. during the past two years.  Every other cost, so far as the roads are concerned, has also been increased, but the Minister says: &ldquo;The amount we are going to give you is £350,000 less than came into the Road Fund this year and the balance is going to go to relieve us in the payment of salaries and pensions of teachers and civil servants.&rdquo; It is time that that attitude ceased.  There is no use asking the agricultural community or the ratepayers in general to bear any further burdens because, so far as I can gather from local authorities, and especially from the local authority of which I have the honour to be a member, and in which the majority is composed of supporters of the present Government, they are unanimously of the opinion that not another farthing shall come out of the rates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister persists in his attitude either of two things must happen.  The gap created by the increased cost I have mentioned must be filled by the ratepayers or the workers are going to be faced with an increased period of unemployment while the condition of the roads will deteriorate.  That is the only way in which the local authority comes into it.  I think it is a rather serious prospect for the local authorities who after all have the responsibility of keeping the roads in fair order.  Faced with that responsibility, they are met with a blank wall here from the Government which draws increased revenue out of the extra wear and tear of the roads and at the same time says: &ldquo;We will give you £400,000 less than you got in 1947-48 and we shall pocket the rest or we shall distribute it amongst other classes of the community.&rdquo;  Any way, it is not going to go where it should go &mdash;into the upkeep of the roads from which this revenue comes.  That to my mind is a wrong attitude and an unfair attitude.  My reason for raising this question on the Adjournment is to <Col N="1259" /> help the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister in forcing the Government to give them sufficient money out of the increased income to keep the roads in at least as good condition as they got them two years ago and that is not asking too much.</P>

I am sure he would benefit by it.  It would take some of the paunch off him.  I consider that it is time that the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary took a firm stand in this matter.  I think I have given them sufficient ammunition in my three questions and in my statement here tonight to enable them to get justice for the local authorities this year by preventing the Minister for Finance collaring £300,000 from the Road Fund as he did last year.</P>

      <P>In the first place I should like to say that it is a pity that such an important question was raised when there is such a limited time at the disposal of Deputy Corry and myself. I think he will agree with me that the question of the condition of the roads generally is something that might more suitably be raised on the Estimate rather than on a motion for the adjournment. I do not take exception to Deputy Corry's raising it in this way: I merely express the opinion that such a subject would warrant a longer and fuller debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that my sole reason for raising it on this way is that the Budget statement will be coming before the House prior to the Estimate.  Now is the time to say that this robbery will not be permitted.  It might be too late to say that when the Estimate is on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>In any case I do not think that Deputy Corry or any other Deputy should be as pessimistic as Deputy Corry appears to be about this matter because the fact is that the roads are not at all as bad as Deputy Corry suggests.  As a matter of fact, in some cases the condition of the roads has improved.  We took it on ourselves in the last few months to get reports from all over the country and so far as the roads are concerned we have been informed by the different county engineers that they have stood up well, generally speaking.  As a matter of fact some of them are much better than they were before the road <Col N="1261" /> restoration programme was started in 1947.  As a matter of fact, so far as county roads are concerned&mdash;and I think Deputy Corry will agree with this&mdash;the rolled county roads are improved; they are better than they were in the pre-war period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry's complaint is that the Minister for Finance is taking something like £300,000 from the fund this year.  I do not know where Deputy Corry gets his inside information.  Possibly he is anticipating the Budget statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Did he not take £300,000 last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>He took it last year and the year before, and in the last year during which the Fianna Fáil Party were in power the Minister took £300,000 as well.  This filching of £300,000, this appropriating of £300,000 by the Exchequer, was initiated by Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Corry did not raise any objection, or was not concerned about the roads when, during the whole Fianna Fáil régime, from 1932 to 1948, the Minister for Finance took £1,350,000 from the Road Fund. On another occasion he took £1,000,000, which was never put back.  Deputy Corry was not concerned about the state of the roads in County Cork during that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the practice since this State was established to devote the proceeds from motor taxation to the upkeep and improvement <Col N="1262" /> of the roads.  That is the practice that is being carried on now, the very same practice that Fianna Fáil engaged in and that the Cumann na nGaedheal Government engaged in.  Deputy Corry talked about money spent on the roads and he alleged, or would lead the House to believe, that less money is being spent on the roads.  He talked glibly about what the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government did during his last two or three years in office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry would try to give the impression that the Fianna Fáil Government got money from some place other than the Road Fund and made a generous present of it to the county councils.  Deputy Corry and the Fianna Fáil Party know that was not the position; they know that this money accumulated during the war years, that during the war years it was paid by the motorists who happened to have their cars taxed, and all the Fianna Fáil Minister was doing was saving up this money and, when the emergency was over, he merely released it to the county councils, as he would have done in the ordinary course of events if there had not been a war.</P>
      <P>Perhaps these figures will enlighten Deputy Corry, although I am sure he is already very well aware of them. During the past two years £10,800,000, practically £11,000,000, was spent on the roads.  In 1946-47 and in 1947-48, the last two years of Fianna Fáil Government, £7,500,000 was spent. During the two years previous to that only £3,000,000 was spent, and in the two years previous to that again there was only £1,700,000 spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see what grouse Deputy Corry has, or why he must be pessimistic about the activities of the Minister for Local Government so far as the maintenance and improvement of the roads are concerned.  He mentioned, incidentally, that the ratepayers are being asked to carry a colossal burden in connection with the upkeep and improvement of roads.  In that connection he will, I am sure, be interested in these figures.  In 1938-39 the Road Fund contributed £700,000 in respect of all roads and the local <Col N="1263" /> authorities contributed £1,325,000.  Last year the Road Fund contributed £2,346,000 and the local authorities contributed £2,294,000.  In 1938-39, the year before the war, the local authorities were bearing two-thirds of the cost of the work on the roads.  At the present time the local authorities are bearing the cost of less than one half of the work done on the roads.  That leads me to believe&mdash;and I am sure it will lead Deputy Corry to believe also &mdash;that more is being done by the Minister for Local Government now so far as work on the roads is concerned and so far as the all-in contribution to the cost of the work on the roads is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry will admit that there has been, even in the past nine or ten months, a certain sum spent on the protection and repair of roads from grants given under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  He suggested that a water-table was in the centre of a particular road in Cork.  If that was the position, I suggest he ought to have asked the surveyor for County Cork during the past two or three months to submit that as one of the schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry is still being pessimistic, but I think he will agree that in respect of the grants given under the Local Authorities (Works) Act there was relief given to the county councils to some extent in the matter of the protection of roads, especially roads flooded or subject to subsidence.  Those grants, coupled with the grants which have been given in respect of road improvement, maintenance and repair, represent a substantial <Col N="1264" /> sum which compares very favourably with the money that has been given, say, over the past 15 or 16 years.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Corry need have a lot of fear about unemployment in the rural areas.  He must admit, with regard to the grants given for works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, that a considerable number of men have been employed during the past nine or ten months and are at present being employed.  It is true to say in respect of road and drainage work that at the present time there are more men employed in those particular works than ever have been employed by the county councils of the 26 counties since the beginning of this State.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry adverted to the fact that the taxation revenue from petrol has increased over the past five or six years.  Granted, but I do not think he would seriously suggest that the Minister for Local Government or I, as his Parliamentary Secretary, could determine how that money would be allocated.  So far as the Deputy's comments are concerned, it would be wrong for him to try to represent to the country that the roads have deteriorated during the past two years. As I have said, £11,000,000 were spent on the roads in the last two years, the greater portion being subscribed by the State.  That expenditure now, compared with the expenditure of other years, represents a very big difference.</P>
      <P>So far as the main roads are concerned, it is not true that they are in a worse condition than they were when this Government took office, and that can be said in relation to the county roads.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 27th April.</P>
