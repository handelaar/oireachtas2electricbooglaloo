      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the statement attributed by a daily newspaper to the U.S. Attaché in Dublin that two U.S. Air Force Superfortress aircraft came to Dublin at his invitation, he will state the normal procedure for securing permission for foreign military aircraft to land at Irish civil airports, and if this normal procedure was followed in this instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The normal procedure for securing the necessary permission, under regulation No. 75 (1) of the Air Navigation (General) Regulations, 1930, for foreign military aircraft to fly over or land in Ireland is for the diplomatic mission in Dublin of the country concerned to apply for the permission through the Department of External Affairs.  The decision on the application is conveyed in due course to the mission through the same Department.</P>
      <P>This normal procedure was duly followed in the particular instance referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state the effect which the increases during the present year in the prices of bacon, eggs, bread, meat, flaked oatmeal, coffee, soap, wool and woollen goods have or will have on the current cost-of-living index figure.</P>

      <P>The latest available data for the interim cost-of-living index (essential items) relate to mid-August, 1950.  The index for mid-November is at present being computed.</P>
      <P>Comparing the index numbers for mid-August, 1949, with mid-August, 1950, the increases in the prices of the items bacon, other meat, flaked oatmeal, coffee, knitting wool and woollen goods accounted for a rise of 1.2 per cent.  A decrease in the prices of eggs was responsible for a decline of 0.1 per cent.  There was no change in the price of bread.  Knitting wool and woollen goods accounted for more than half of the increase of 1.2 per cent.  indicated above.  Expenditure on soap is not included in the interim index.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the decision to refuse an increase in <Col N="1201" /> the appeal of old age pension claimant, ref. g. 6944, Tuam, and if he will state what justification there is for the refusal in view of the fact that such a decision will not encourage small farmers nearing the age to qualify for a pension, to till the maximum amount of land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton) William Norton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Costello applied in August last for an increase in the rate of old age pension in payment to him &mdash;5/- per week.  It was decided by the central pension authority on the 4th instant that he is not entitled to an increase.  The reason for the decision was that his yearly means, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Old Age Pensions Acts, exceed £41 12s. 6d., which is the statutory limit for the next higher rate of pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this man resides on a holding the valuation of which is only £4 15s. 0d? Is he aware that he has two sons residing with him, making an effort to provide themselves with the necessaries of life, and that they till about one-third of their land? This man has been credited with a certain sum in the bank.  Is the Minister aware that the usual procedure in cases of this sort is to give the place to one son and whatever little is made on the farm is put aside for the other? The fact remains that this man has been unfairly treated by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am far from desiring to discuss this man's domestic affairs in the House but, as the Deputy has raised the matter, perhaps he will not mind me giving him certain information. The applicant is a widower with 20 acres of fair land.  The stock on the farm consists of a horse, a cow, two one and a half year old cattle, two calves, eight sheep, four lambs, and 30 fowl.  So far as tillage is concerned, he has two acres of potatoes, four acres of oats, two acres of hay, besides some vegetables.  He has a sum in the bank, but some of it was withdrawn prior to the first application.  The withdrawal of that sum was not reckoned for pension purposes.  The value <Col N="1202" /> of the holding, 20 acres of fair land, plus the stock, was calculated, and the central pensions authority are of opinion that his means from that holding exceed £41 12s. 6d. per year.  That calculation was made by the central pensions authority, which is a statutory body, and I have no power to direct them to find otherwise or to find in any particular way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the difficulties which parents are experiencing owing to the rise in the cost of many essential goods and services, he will consider introducing proposals for legislation to increase the rate of children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's next steps in the matter of social security are indicated in the White Paper issued on that subject.  When these proposals have been implemented by the enactment of the Social Welfare (Insurance) Bill, 1950, the question of improving the children's allowances scheme will be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that substantial demands are being made for increased wages to meet the high cost of living, and does he not think that increasing the rate of children's allowances would be a more equitable way of dealing with this problem&mdash;the general rise in prices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1203" />
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Wages in this country have to find their own level, in the way in which the normal equilibrium is found in every country.  This is something which ought not to be mixed up, and was never intended to be mixed up, in support of wage levels.  As the Deputy will appreciate, even if the allowances were increased there would be a considerable number of workers who would not benefit because it would not affect single workers, married men without children, or men with one or two children, all of whom presumably are entitled to make claims for increased wages to meet an increased cost of living.  These claims will have to be dealt with in some manner other than by an increase in children's allowances.</P>

There was criticism levelled against Fianna Fáil in respect of these lands and this policy has been allowed to continue in spite of the promises of the Minister and his Party to have lands such as these divided.

      <P>Regardless of the number of questions put down by a Deputy the Land Commission have very strict instructions not to rearrange a village until the rearrangement will be fairly satisfactory.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any reason to the House why in this case the Land Commission does not proceed with the acquisition or accept the owner's offer, especially in view of the fact that in July when the lands <Col N="1207" /> were about to be sold by public auction the Land Commission served a notice which unquestionably spoiled the sale?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that the Land Commission have the power, and I would not like to hear that they had the power, to prevent free sale.  They have no authority to do so, no authority by law.  It is open to them to examine the land for suitability and presumably these lands did not suit. If the Deputy knows these lands he will admit they are not an attractive proposition for the purpose of relieving congestion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected that a scheme for the allotment of these lands will be operated early next year.  The lands comprised the untenanted estate and the tenanted holding of the Reps. George Griffin.  The former was acquired on 5th January, 1949, and the latter was resumed on 25th July, 1949.</P>
      <P>It is not desirable or customary to make public the prices which vendors receive for property purchased in this manner.</P>

      <P>I do not think it necessary or desirable to have programmes designed specially for Irish listeners in Britain.  I do not believe that our people abroad would be attracted by programmes directed at them but rather by the programmes with a native atmosphere which they would hear if they were at home.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>While there may have been grounds for complaint in the past as to the quantity of fish available when, due to weather conditions, landings by our fishing boats were restricted, I do not agree that any scarcity of supplies has been experienced in recent months which did not also occur in neighbouring countries, as the Sea Fisheries Association have been importing considerable quantities of fish to make up the deficiencies in home supplies.  I do not accept the statement that prices are excessive, but they are fixed sufficiently high to render the inshore fishermen on our own sea coast economically independent. An opportunity to discuss fully these matters will be available when the Sea Fisheries Bill, 1950, is before the House for Second Reading, and I do not in the circumstances see that any useful purpose would be served by setting up a commission as suggested by the Deputy, as I believe the intensive development contemplated under this new Sea Fisheries Act will, within a reasonably short time, cater fully for our domestic requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of herring and whiting dumped by the Sea Fisheries Association during the week ended 18th November, 1950, was 1,740 stones.  The whiting was small and ungutted and was unsaleable due to <Col N="1214" /> the presence on the market of adequate supplies of better class whiting.  The herring dumped was unsuitable for kippering because of its small size and the freshing trade did not need it, as heavy supplies of herring were available during the week.  I understand that the dumpings referred to in the second part of the Deputy's question can be attributed to similar causes, and not to the fact that the fish was &ldquo;in bad condition and unfit for human consumption&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Instructions have been given that where surplus herring is left over when the market closes they are to be disposed of for human consumption direct or through hawkers gratuitously, but this procedure must be carefully supervised lest it might destroy existing commercial outlets for whiting and herring.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will realise that if fishermen bring to the market small whiting, ungutted, they are wholly unsaleable.  The fishermen who bring them know that, and they have been repeatedly told that, if whiting is to be sold in the market at a time of abundance, it must be of a certain size and it must be put on the market gutted, otherwise nobody will buy it. It is not possible to guarantee that whatever quantity of fish is put on the market on a given day will be accepted and paid for.  The best we can do in regard to shoal pelagic fish is to sell it to the best advantage we can, in the market available to us; and, in the case of edible fish, to see that it is passed out, if needs be for nothing, to the poor rather than be thrown back into the sea, while in regard to inedible fish, as some of the small ungutted whiting could be described, to pass it to the knacker for conversion into protein feed or potash manure for the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to take steps to ensure that when this situation recurs, as it seems to do annually, in times of glut, when these <Col N="1215" /> fish are produced by the fishermen, by the same amount of labour as they would put into the production of fish all of which could be sold, there will be some method whereby these men will be recompensed for their labour?

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Deputy that he, having intimate knowledge of this trade, does the industrious fishermen no service by staking a claim of that kind for fishermen who would go out with a seine net and rake in shoals of small whiting which they dump ungutted on the Dublin market, thus destroying the market for the hardworking fishermen who have brought in large whiting, prime fish and fat herring.  I am bound to inform the Deputy that when such fishermen go out with a seine net to bring in shoaling whiting in daylight and dump it on the market, where hard working men are trying to sell fat herring that they have fished and caught by night, my sympathy is with the hard working men.  For their herring I want to get a market and small ungutted whiting will go to the knacker, to be converted into meal and what it fetches those who caught it will get.</P>

      <P>I gave a general review of the progress of arterial drainage in the Estimates debate on Votes 8 and 9 in July last.</P>
      <P>At the moment, two major schemes, the Brosna and the Glyde and Dee, costing about a million pounds each and employing between them over 600 men, are in progress.  We expect to commence work early next year on a third major scheme (the Feale, County Kerry) and works on the tidal sluice at Clarecastle for the River Fergus are also in hands.  Meanwhile, survey and design work is proceeding in other catchment areas.  We have acquired very considerable mechanical plant of various kinds; substantial additions to this plant are on order and further large purchases are contemplated.  A large new repair workshop for the servicing of the machines has recently been secured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> The rate of development of the arterial drainage programme depends largely on the availability of experienced technical staff.  The staff has already been augmented by the recent recruitment of a number of junior engineers, and Civil Service competitions are being held for further senior and junior posts.  If the response is favourable, an early speeding-up of the drainage programme will still further result.</P>
    <P>In addition to the surveys and works in hand under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, arrangements are being made with the Minister for Agriculture for surveys on a number of main rivers and for certain special works with the object of facilitating the land rehabilitation project and of expediting the arterial drainage survey programme.</P>

The Deputy will realise that last summer was a very bad summer for surveys and the work may go into 1952 but it will be done in 1952.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to engineers, 16 temporary junior engineers have been recruited in the present financial year and Civil Service competitions have been advertised for seven senior and 24 junior posts all of which will be permanent.

    <P>No limit is placed on the amount of butter that may be purchased at the unsubsidised price, and the supplies available are sufficient for all purposes. The fact that butter is being exported has not created any scarcity.</P>

I also asked could he explain why institutions which previously provided free or cheap meals for the poor are now being asked to subsidise the poor because butter previously available to them is now withheld from them.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that when the extra allowances of butter were made available the ration was lower.

I have asked him to explain why patients going into hospitals now must bring their butter ration card with them and then they will get the butter ration, but the hospitals will get none for them otherwise?</P>

      <P>The Deputy appears to misunderstand the general tenor of a semi-official letter sent to the assistant county manager referring to the question of water and sewerage services for housing schemes in the North Cork area and inviting him to the Department to discuss the position if he thought it desirable.  At a subsequent conference it was indicated to the assistant county manager that, while it was necessary that grouped cottages should have piped water and sewerage services wherever possible, the council's housing programme could not be held up awaiting the provision of such services.  It was suggested that, in the case of housing schemes likely to be completed in advance of proposed sewerage schemes, arrangements should be made for the installation of temporary closets pending the provision of piped sewerage services so that completed houses would not be left unoccupied. The Deputy will, therefore, see that the Department's efforts have <Col N="1257" /> been directed to ensure that the carrying out of the council's housing programme or the letting of houses would not be held up by any temporary difficulties in regard to water and sewerage services.</P>

      <P>The rate of housing output throughout the remainder of the country approximates to that which has been reached in Dublin and I consider that the contributions to new housing which are being made by the rural and urban housing authorities outside Dublin should tend to encourage the local populations to remain in their own districts.</P>

These authorities have the matter under constant consideration and will continue to take steps to afford whatever relief may be found to be feasible.

      <P>The Local Appointments Commission <Col N="1264" /> did not recommend a candidate for appointment to the post of Medical Officer of Knocknalower Dispensary District.  The commissioners did, however, inform me on the 3rd August last that as a result of the competition held for the post, none of the candidates was adjudged to have a competent knowledge of Irish, which qualification was considered essential for the proper discharge of the duties of medical officer in that district, and that they were, therefore, unable to recommend a candidate for appointment.  They asked for my views on the matter, and having fully considered the position I informed the commissioners that a further attempt should be made to fill the post on the basis of the qualifications already declared and that it should be re-advertised on the existing conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies might have expected that five years after the end of the second world war it would not have been necessary to continue in being powers granted during the stress of the emergency; but, looking at world events and realising the experience since the end of the war in 1945, I think no one will question the necessity for continuing the Supplies and Services Act for a further 12 months.</P>
      <P>Until the war in Korea this year a number of commodities that formerly were in short supply had become more plentiful and a number of Orders dealing with these commodities had been revoked.  Since midsummer, the situation has changed and a number of powers which were no longer considered necessary may be required in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate it is possible that a number of matters will be raised which affect a variety of interests covered by the numerous Orders still in force under the Supplies and Services Act.  I do not propose, in introducing this Bill, to cover the whole ambit which these Orders dealt with or to cover the various matters that are provided for under the different Emergency Powers Orders.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Supplies and Services Act is to see that the people, in times of scarcity and in the difficulties created by an emergency, will have available adequate supplies of essentials and that the supplies will be at reasonable prices.  In recent months, considerable attention was focussed on the cost of living and on the effect of devaluation, in the first instance, and recently the effect of the Korean conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems caused by devaluation and the transition from peace-time economic policies elsewhere to rearmament have created not merely difficulties in this country but difficulties <Col N="1267" /> elsewhere.  In dealing with this matter, I want to refer, first of all, to the situation which has existed between 1947 and August of this year.  I want to deal primarily with that period in order to refute any possible suggestions or allegations that there was any rise in the cost of living or in the prices of essential commodities during that period.  I think it is vital that we should review the situation up to either the summer or the early autumn of this year and then consider the situation which exists at the present time or may exist in the future.  It is necessary to do that because of the references that have been made not only here but elsewhere and because of the attention which this question has had focussed upon it in the Press in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The effects of devaluation, which were forecast by a number of prophets so far as this country is concerned, have not resulted in the rise that was expected to flow from devaluation. Any rises that have taken place have occurred in recent months and can be attributed to the emergency preparations for the Korean conflict and the resultant preparations elsewhere. I think it is essential in dealing with this matter that the House should recognise that between mid-August, 1947, and mid-August, 1950, the cost-of-living index figure was kept stable.  The mid-November figure is not yet available and it would be premature at this stage to anticipate any changes.  It is, however, a matter of some achievement that, despite devaluation and despite the rises that occurred elsewhere, in this country in the last three years the index of retail prices, which is in fact the cost of living index figure, has remained static.  During that period considerable changes occurred in the economic condition of the country.  A number of developmental projects were started and the results of these projects and the improvements that flow from them are either apparent or have already been felt by the people.</P>
    <P>The effects which the rises in prices elsewhere have on our economy can only be measured by experience, but I <Col N="1268" /> hope to demonstrate to the House that the improvement which has occurred in our economic position has been achieved at a time when the cost of living has been kept stable and the prices of essential commodities maintained at the same level at which they stood in mid-August, 1947.  In any review of the economic position or of the situation up to date, I think it is essential to look at the increase in the national income which, in 1949, reached an estimated figure of £352,000,000.  The output of agriculture had been restored to the pre-war level and there had been an unprecedented rise in the volume of industrial production.  In 1949 the volume of production of those industries producing transportable goods was 8.3 per cent. over the 1948 figure and 18.6 over the 1947 figure.  The total number of persons employed in industries covered by the census of industrial production rose from 166,000 in 1939&mdash;there was a drop during the war years and in 1946 the pre-war level was again reached&mdash;to an estimated figure of 206,000 persons in 1949. At the same time, the total number of people in non-agricultural activities increased by 60,000 persons over the 1946 figure, so that not merely have we a higher level of industrial production but we have simultaneously with that the largest number of persons employed in industry since the State was established.  At the same time, the output per wage earner increased by about 11 per cent. over 1938.  During the past year exports of all kinds have increased in volume by 10 per cent. as compared with 1949, thereby almost reaching the 1938 level; and for the three months ended 30th September of this year the volume of exports generally was 4 per cent. higher than in the corresponding quarter of 1938.  The value in the volume of imports increased considerably. What I think is really significant is the fact that in the three months ended 30th September, 1950, the volume of imports showed an increase of only 5.6 per cent. as compared with the corresponding quarter of 1948, while the volume of exports showed the much bigger percentage increase of 26.3 per cent.  The yield from <Col N="1269" /> exports in 1949 was over 45 per cent. of the value of imports.</P>
    <P>These figures show the progress that has been made and the improvements that have been effected.  No doubt, if we are to achieve a satisfactory trading position, it is essential that we should increase these exports still further.  Since August, 1947, the cost of living index figure has remained the same.  Periodically there was a change of a point or two one way or the other but in August, 1947, and in August of this year the figure stood at the same level.  I think it is no harm to dwell for a moment on the cost of living index figure as a measurement of the trend in retail prices.  From time to time criticism is expressed as to the accuracy of that figure and its correctness as an indication of changes in prices.  I should say at this stage that the Central Statistics Office is responsible for the preparation of the cost of living index figure and, whatever imperfections may be attributed to that figure, it is the same index based on the same calculations taken on precisely the same basis as in August, 1947.  The index, as Deputies will remember, was altered that year by the then Fianna Fáil Government.  The index is compiled quarterly from an investigation of thousands of individual price quotations covering up to 100 different commodities from about 160 returns dispersed over 120 towns.  The commodities chosen are essential ones and the index may be regarded as a reasonably fair reflection of the price experience of consumers purchasing these commodities.  It does not purport to reflect changes in the prices of commodities not included in the index. From time to time criticism is made that the index does not include a number of commodities that householders or consumers buy, which may not be regarded as essentials but are nevertheless commodities constituting some part of the household requirements, if not the actual household budget.</P>
    <P>It may be of interest to know that the Director of Statistics compiled some time ago an index constituted on a broader basis, for the information of the Statistics Office, which included certain sundry items which were scientifically weighted; and the result, <Col N="1270" /> if those items were included in the ordinary cost of living index figure, would mean an increase of only one point.  Therefore, whatever criticism may be made of the index figure, I think its correctness as a reflection of the prices of the commodities it takes into account, gives an accurate representation of those prices and whatever variations in price may occur.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, the Government announced the decision to hold an inquiry which was described as a family budget inquiry.  A number of people reading that announcement were probably struck by the time at which it was announced and no doubt came to the conclusion that this decision was taken because the Government had some lack of confidence in the existing index figure.  I think it is well to say that as far back as 1934 a committee examined the question of the cost of living and recommended that a full survey should be undertaken every ten years.  Therefore, the decision to hold a family budget inquiry, taken on the initiative of the Central Statistics Office, is not unreasonable, and is overdue when we remember that the last family budget inquiry was held in 1922.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of my remarks on the index is to show to the House and to the country the stability which existed in the index and the prices it reflects, since 1947 until August of this year.  While the cost of living index figure here remained stationary, the British index has increased over the same period by 13 per cent.  The index there covers a slightly wider field, but is in effect a comparable index.  It is described as an index of retail prices and, in passing, I think it would be no harm if our index figure were so described, as although it is called the cost of living index figure, it is in effect an index based on retail prices.  In Britain, as I have said, the cost of living in that period rose by 13 per cent.  In September of last year, when the £ was devalued by 30 per cent. in terms of dollars, a number of people questioned the wisdom of this country devaluing in line with sterling.  Quite a number of prophecies were made as <Col N="1271" /> to the effect of devaluation on prices of goods here.  An immediate effect of that devaluation was that import prices of a number of raw materials and foodstuffs originating in the dollar area rose by widely varying margins, but in some cases extending up to the full 44 per cent.  The type of commodities affected by this change in price included wheat, maize, cotton, hemp and sugar; and the prices in some sterling area countries were also affected, where the articles had a dollar content.  At that time the Minister for Finance delivered a broadcast &mdash;on the 19th September, 1949&mdash;in which he mentioned:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The higher cost of dollar imports should not cause any significant rise in the cost-of-living index.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the case of wheat, which is the most important item affected, the rise, if there is to be a rise, is estimated at only 1 per cent. or one point.  Some increases may be expected in the cost of imports from Britain and other countries of goods with a dollar content, that is, goods produced from dollar raw materials.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have here some particulars which show how accurately the Minister's anticipations have been fulfilled. Between June, 1949 and June, 1950, the following increases took place in retail prices in various countries: Britain, 2 per cent.; Australia, 9; South Africa, 6; Denmark and New Zealand, 5; Canada, 4 per cent.  The index here of retail prices of essential items, that is, the cost-of-living index, in August last was the same as in August, 1947, and the index in Britain was 13 per cent. higher than in June, 1947.</P>
    <P>The following are comparative figures for Ireland and Britain in mid-August, 1950, as compared with mid-August&mdash; or, in Britain, mid-June&mdash;1947, the base in both cases being 100.  In Ireland, food now, 96; clothing 111; fuel and light, 102; rent, 109.  In Britain, food, 121, as against 96 here; clothing,120, as against our 111; fuel and light, 116, as against our 102; rent, 101, as against our 109.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1272" /> The stability of the Irish index as opposed to the British index may be attributed to a number of causes, but as the House will realise, the chief cause has been the rise of 21 per cent. in British food prices as compared with the fall of 4 per cent. in Irish food prices over the same period.  The striking divergence between Irish and British food prices is explained mainly by the fact that the cost of food in Ireland is largely a reflection of home markets maintained stable by subsidies and price control, while British food prices have been largely a reflection of import costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the list here, but the Deputy knows that the <i>Trade Journal</i> on page 176 gives figures which show that food for August of this year was 96, while on the righthand side of the page there is an account of a number of foodstuffs and the changes in prices.  At the same time, the wholesale prices of Irish agricultural goods increased by less than half of 1 per cent. between 1948 and 1949.  The increases in British retail food prices were mainly due to an increase of 30 per cent. in meat prices since April of 1949 and the effects of devaluation.  I think that an even more significant change has been the percentage increases between September, 1949, and July, 1950, in the case of imports and wholesale prices, and from October, 1950, in the case of retail prices here and in Britain. Here import prices increased by 12.2 per cent., while in Britain they increased by 22 per cent.  Wholesale prices increased here by 6.5 per cent. and in Britain by 12.2 per cent. and retail prices here and in Great Britain increased by 1 per cent.  These figures indicate the vast increase that has occurred in import prices, the increase that has occurred here and the still greater increase that has occurred in Britain and elsewhere, and the stability which it has been possible to maintain here despite the effect on the cost of living of higher import prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> I think it is very important in assessing the stability of the cost of living index and the stable economic conditions which have existed here that we should consider the gap that exists in earnings between 1939 and 1948, the gap between earning and living costs as a result of the increase in the cost of living.  It is estimated that the real earnings of workers in transportable goods industries declined by over 10 per cent. in 1940 as compared with October, 1938, but in October, 1943, real earnings had fallen by 28 per cent. as compared with October, 1938.  It was not until October, 1948, that real earnings recovered for the first time in a period of nine years.  It then became possible for workers and those engaged in industries producing transportable goods to look forward to some compensation for the difficulties created by the rise of the cost of living over the war years.</P>
    <P>The fact that it was possible to close the gap between earnings and the cost of living was no mean achievement when we were faced with the increased prices I have mentioned, the rising cost of imported commodities and the problem of the transition from emergency conditions to what up to recently were more normal conditions in which we had expanding employment and a reversion to normal economic activity.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, essential in considering this matter that we should recognise that at the same time as this rise occurred elsewhere the real standard of living of the people here had gone up because between 1947 and this year the supplies of a number of essential foodstuffs had increased, their availability had increased and at the same time the rise I have mentioned took place in industrial earnings.  Deputies no doubt have read the figures in the <i>Trade Journal</i> which show that the earnings to which I have referred have increased in recent years.  In the September <i>Journal</i>, page 178, the index shows that the average earnings of industrial workers to the base of 100 in 1948 had gone up in March this year to 106.7, and had increased in June from 106.7 to 107.5.  The number of hours worked has remained fairly constant between 1938 and June of this <Col N="1274" /> year.  This shows that whatever gap existed between earnings and the cost of living&mdash;and undoubtedly there was a substantial gap created by the stress of emergency conditions, by the effects of the rise in the price of almost every commodity and by the fact that during that period there was almost a complete standstill in wages&mdash;that improvement I have mentioned has continued right up to June of this year.</P>
    <P>Since the year 1947 the standard of consumption has also increased.  It is estimated now that it has increased by about 10 per cent. since before the war and while the cost-of-living index assumes an unchanged pattern of living, with the improvement in the supplies of various commodities and the rise in real earnings it must be obvious to Deputies that there has been a substantial improvement in the standard of living of our people.</P>
    <P>It is of course the aim of the Government, and I have no doubt the aim of everyone, to see that we reach higher standards in the future and we endeavour to the maximum of our ability to increase the standard of living of our people.  Despite the stationary position of the index figure it is obvious that the increased standard of living must result in people enjoying many goods which are available and which were in short supply in 1947 and in still shorter supply in the years before.  That situation has been maintained without any inflationary pressure and I think it is necessary that we should consider the inflationary effects which have occurred elsewhere. Deputies may not be familiar with the sudden deterioration in conditions in France, Italy and Australia.  A good deal of attention is being paid in the Press to the rise in prices in Australia and the possible effect that will have on our economy here.  In this country we have not merely succeeded in avoiding these serious consequences but at the same time we have embarked on a forward and progressive policy of development and reconstruction. In the present half of this financial year between September, 1950, and March next a variety of schemes financed both by direct State subvention and by local authorities will involve <Col N="1275" /> the estimated capital expenditure of £25,000,000.  Of course these figures are only estimates but it is expected that on work financed by local authorities and various statutory bodies close on 80,000 persons will be employed, both skilled and unskilled.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I think it is no harm to refer to the success which attended the loan which the Minister for Finance floated a few months ago. The capital investment programme is a substantial one.  It has involved large capital expenditure on a variety of schemes and in order to finance these schemes the Minister for Finance some few months ago floated a very substantial loan.  I do not at this stage propose to embark on a discussion of capital expenditure, as I think it is somewhat outside the scope of this Bill.  But the effect which large capital expenditure has on employment, on production and on the general economic condition of the country is obvious when we realise the magnitude of the expenditure, the variety of the projects on which the money is being spent and in particular the employment which it gives on various schemes of a productive nature.  The real achievement in the past few years has been the fact that, despite the impact of world prices, it has been possible to keep the cost-of-living index figure stable and the prices of essential commodities unchanged. I want the House to realise that I am dealing only with the situation up to August of this year.  I will come to the future later on and to whatever problems it may hold and outline the steps the Government has decided to take to deal with that situation, but I want Deputies and the public to recognise that, in so far as Government action has been responsible, we can claim credit for maintaining, despite a whole variety of factors &mdash;devaluation, shortages elsewhere, difficulties of supply, inflation in some countries and so forth&mdash;a cost of living stable in comparison with the rises in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether any Deputy saw the table published in the newspaper <i>Reynolds News</i> on 12th of this <Col N="1276" /> month.  I do not propose to read out all the items in that table, but, if the House wishes, I can have it reproduced in the Official Debates.  It covers a number of commodities, foodstuffs, and gives the cost in various countries and the amount of food involved.  It deals with the 2-lb. loaf and shows the cost in America, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain.  I will read the comparative figures for Great Britain and here, because, when this comparative table was published, it showed the cost of these commodities elsewhere and their cost in Britain, and in general the cost in Britain was lower than the cost in these other countries.  It is important to note that for the 2-lb. loaf, the price in Britain is 5½d., while here it is 6¼d. A quart of milk in Britain costs 10d. and here 7¼d.  A dozen eggs in Britain cost 3/6 and here 3/3½d.; 5 lb. of potatoes in Britain cost 8½d. and 9d. here; 3 lb. of flour in Britain cost 9d. and 7½d. here; 1 lb. of butter in Britain is 2/- and here 2/8.  Cheese in Britain is 1/2 and here 2/1¾d.; 1 lb. of sugar in Britain is 5d. and here 4d. Bacon in Britain is 2/6 and here the average of all cuts is 2/0½d.  There are no comparative figures for coffee, but tea in Britain is 3/4 per lb. and here 2/8.  Cooking fat is the same in both countries, 1/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The present price of tea is 2/8 a lb. for the ration which now is two ounces.  It was one and a half ounces up to May, 1948, and was then increased to two ounces, at an increased cost in subsidy of £400,000 per annum.  The total subsidy in respect of tea at present is £1,790,000.  If subsidy were discontinued, the retail price of rationed tea would be in the region of 6/- per lb., and, if it were possible to abolish rationing and to continue to provide tea at 2/8 per lb., it would cost an additional £750,000 in subsidy. Rationed sugar costs 4d. per lb.  If it were available freely and at the same <Col N="1278" /> price it would cost an additional sum of £3 million a year.  Bread made from 75 per cent. extraction flour and the equivalent flour are available at a subsidised price, and the subsidy in respect of bread amounts this year to £7,200,000.</P>
      <P>It may be of interest to Deputies to know the amounts of the various foodstuffs available.  They are as follows: 2 ozs. of tea; 3/4 lb. sugar; 1/2 lb. of butter and 4½ lb. of flour or its equivalent in 6 lb. of bread.  If subsidies on all these commodities were abolished, the cost would be 5/3¼d. per week, but, as a result of the subsidies and the differential price, the actual cost to the consumer is 3/5¾d. and the annual cost of the subsidies per head of the population is estimated at £4 13s. 2d.  Deputies will appreciate that, on the basis of our population, these subsidies impose a comparatively heavy burden on the people.  These subsidies are payable by all taxpayers, irrespective of their means, provided they are caught by any of the taxation proposals.  It is estimated that, on the basis of the present food subsidies in respect of flour, sugar, tea and butter, the subsidies per head of the population are the equivalent of the existing food subsidies in Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the tax figures here at the moment.  It is, I think, relevant to recall that, when this Government came into office, additional taxation amounting to £6,000,000 a year had been imposed. That taxation was designed to subsidise essential foodstuffs.  At the same time as that taxation was imposed, the ration of butter was as low, during part of that year, as 2 ozs., for a great portion of the year it was 4 ozs. and only for a very short period prior <Col N="1279" /> to the election did it go to 6 ozs. With the exception of six weeks, the ration has never fallen below 6 ozs. and has been 8 ozs. per head for the past 18 months.  At the same time, the ration of tea was 1½ ozs. and, since May, 1948, it has been 2 ozs., at the equivalent price, while the sugar ration has remained constant.</P>
      <P>Now, the important factor to take into account is that, despite the changes elsewhere, it has been possible here to increase the ration of a number of these commodities, and, over and above, to make available at the unsubsidised price, free and full quantities of bread, tea, butter and sugar.  It is, of course, essential to remember that in many of the other countries which I have referred to in this table, rationing is still in force, not merely in regard to these three essential foodstuffs, but including meat and a number of other commodities.</P>
      <P>I have given this picture of the stable economic conditions and the stable cost-of-living figure because I want the House to appreciate that, over the last three years, the Government has kept the cost of living stable and has succeeded in providing increased employment in industry and in expanding capital expenditure with the resulting increased employment which has flowed from it.  It has increased the availability of goods, of essential foodstuffs and of a number of other commodities at a time when many other countries were faced with difficulties which they could not prevent affecting a rise either in the cost of living, or in the commodities which people buy generally, and which we include in the list I have referred to as the sundry list taken by the Statistics Office.</P>
      <P>Now, since the start of the Korean war this year, a change has occurred. Circumstances have altered considerably and the future cannot be assessed as regards its effects on the prices of a number of import commodities.</P>

      <P>There has been that improvement in the income which the farmers' wives are getting, including those in the constituency which the Deputy represents.  I do not know whether the Deputy appreciates that improvement or not, or the economic significance of it.  If he does not, I am not going to try to educate him. The main problem which the House is confronted with is the situation which will face the country and which will face Europe and other countries in the future.  This Government has undertaken and has achieved up to the present a condition of affairs in which I assert&mdash;I want to reiterate the fact despite the changes that occurred last <Col N="1281" /> year, despite the difficulties that had to be faced and despite the changes in prices, in supplies and in the rise in the cost of a variety of commodities&mdash; we have kept up to now the cost-of-living index stable.  I say that because of the criticism that has been expressed here, and of the implications behind the attacks that have been made, in particular, on the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>I want to refute emphatically the suggestion that, up to now, there has been any alteration or any deterioration in the standard of living.  On the contrary, there has been a rise in earnings and an increase in employment, while we have also had increased supplies of a number of commodities, so that an improvement in the general standard of living has been maintained in circumstances which other countries have not been able to make.  I say that because I believe it is vital that, in any consideration of this matter, adequate credit should be given to the responsibility which the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the members of the Government have had in keeping conditions stable, and in improving the standard of living of the country as well as employment amongst &mdash;and the economic conditions of&mdash;the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the House, I know, is expecting to hear something in regard to the announcement that has been made to the effect that the Government has decided, as is provided under this Bill, to set up advisory tribunals.  The Bill empowers the Minister, under Section 3, to set up advisory bodies. Under the Principal Act, the Minister may, by Order, confer on those bodies the powers necessary to enable them to deal with whatever matters he refers to them for investigation.  The decision to set up prices advisory bodies has been taken because of the criticism which has been expressed against the system of price control, made by a Minister without any public hearing. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and myself recently met deputations from both congresses of the trade unions and from the Federation of Employers.  The most frequent criticism made there was not that there <Col N="1282" /> had been an alteration in prices or changes, leaving aside whatever changes occurred in the last few weeks, but rather that while those who make applications for wage increases are obliged to run the gauntlet of a public hearing before the Labour Court, prices are fixed on an investigation by officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce, held in the Department without a public hearing.</P>
    <P>I would like in that connection to say this, that the results which have been achieved by price control up to the present have been amply demonstrated. The system has worked reasonably well within the limits of such a system, and I think it only fair to pay tribute to the efficiency and the energy and the results which the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce have achieved over a number of years.  There has, undoubtedly, been a great deal of comment from time to time as regards the basis on which prices are fixed.  The basis in the past has been arrived at by either of two methods: either the price of the article was fixed or a target profit was fixed within which the company or industrial or manufacturing concern had to work.  The system was designed so that the target profit would enable the company to earn a reasonable return on the capital invested, and at the same time charge reasonable prices for whatever commodities were produced.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of that system of price control has been questioned.  It was never intended to deal with situations which we are likely to be faced with in the future or difficulties created by emergency conditions because it has this weakness, that if profits are fixed on the basis of an all-over target, those profits, although related to an individual concern, must have some regard to the selling price of the commodity manufactured and must take into account comparable selling prices and comparable sets of costings for other concerns making the same types of goods or engaged in similar work.</P>
    <P>The same difficulty arises in the case of protection.  One of the disadvantages of protection, particularly in <Col N="1283" /> times of scarcity, is that very often supplies of some goods may be available more cheaply elsewhere than they are available here.  But, in order to maintain stable economic conditions, protection has been provided.  Quite a number of firms are earning higher profits under the same rate of protection than other firms gain, as they are more efficient.  But the big problem arises&mdash;we have been faced with this problem and I have explained it in discussions with representatives of trade unions&mdash;that in this set of circumstances it would be possible to reduce the tariff or enlarge, as the case may be, the quota.  But the result of any alteration in the tariff will inevitably mean difficulties for the less efficient firms, and in this connection the least efficient is the criterion for the tariff, because otherwise the problem of unemployment and difficulties created by a reduction in tariff are such that the first people affected by it would be those for whom the tariff is imposed.</P>
    <P>I think it is only right to say to all concerned, manufacturers and workers, that protection, whether by tariff or quota, is a benefit bestowed by the community as part of a national economic policy for the protection of those manufacturers and employees engaged in whatever concerns are assisted by protection.  That benefit is one which should be highly valued by them.  While it may indirectly confer a benefit on the community at large, and in some cases does that, over a wide range of concerns this protection is a benefit bestowed by the community on those directly employed or on those manufacturers who are responsible for running the concerns. That protection or benefit bestowed by the community is something which should be highly valued and in no case can the community be expected to tolerate any abuse of that protection either by raising prices or by causing difficulties which result in people being thrown out of employment.  The benefit which the community bestows is one which entitles the country and the community to get the best value.</P>
    <P>It has been the experience since protection was imposed that a number of <Col N="1284" /> infant industries must be granted a period of time within which to compete with industries in other countries with longer industrial tradition and which had not the historical opposition with which this country was faced in industrial matters.  Allowing for the time and for the experience which must be gained by those industries, it is vital in the public interest that manufacturers, employees and the consumers&mdash;of course, in the last resort everyone is a consumer irrespective of his part in the community or in the economic fabric of the State&mdash;should co-operate together in order to achieve the result which protection is designed to achieve and confer the benefits which it is designed to confer on the community.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the fact that in the discussions with the trade union congresses criticism was voiced against the system of price control in the absence of a public hearing.  It was stated that the advantages of a public hearing could be enumerated under a number of headings&mdash;that it would act as a deterrent in the first instance to those who sought to charge excessive prices; that it would result in the public having the background and knowledge available on which prices were fixed; that it would enable the people to see the factors which operated to increase prices or the factors which operated in any variation in the prices of commodities, the effect of changes in the cost of raw materials, rises in import prices, increased transport or other charges, and, generally, to get a picture of the factors that had to be taken into account, including wages, profits, a return on capital invested, and all other factors which at present are taken into consideration by the prices section of the Department; that it would secure public confidence if these facts were placed before a tribunal holding its inquiry in public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the Trades Union Congresses did advocate the establishment of these advisory committees provided for in the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of discussion the congresses expressed the view that the method of price control at present in operation did not inspire <Col N="1285" /> public confidence because of the lack of information for the public, and indeed for the members of the trade unions. The Government therefore decided to establish advisory tribunals.  It is hardly necessary to go back on the history of price control and the various steps that were taken in the past to deal with it, except to say that, prewar, a number of efforts were made in regard to that matter.  The first Prices Act was brought in in 1932. Then there was a Prices Act of 1937 which established a prices commission. That commission had a very limited experience, because it was only a year or less in operation when the 1939 war broke out.  The prices commission at that time was established to deal with peace-time conditions.  Since then price control has been operated in circumstances of emergency varying in degree and intensity, but emergency conditions existed all the time since 1939.  Up to the last few months it did seem as if conditions were improving, but since the summer or autumn of this year that picture has changed.</P>
      <P>I should like to say in this connection that price control elsewhere has not been particularly effective.  I do not believe that price control can achieve everything that those who advocate it think it can or everything that all of us would desire.  There is no adequate substitute for free competition, but in the circumstances existing at the present time, in the emergency conditions which are existing, it is obvious that free competition cannot have full play or that goods cannot be made available in adequate supply in the immediate future.  In those circumstances the Government decided to establish under this Act a prices advisory body or bodies as the case may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedure this year was, more or less, the same as in any other year.  I thought I covered that.  Price control is carried out on <Col N="1286" /> two bases&mdash;on the basis of a selling price or on the basis of a fixed target of profit for the industry.  Some goods cannot be easily controlled because of their variety and because of the number of factors that make it difficult to fix a price over a whole wide range of commodities.  In these cases, or, at any rate in some of them, a target of profit is fixed.  That target takes into account the price at which it is expected the goods will be sold, the availability of the goods, the quantity that is expected, the effective wages and other costs.  After all these are taken into account, a margin is left which is available for distribution to the shareholders in the case of a shareholding company or to the owners in the case of a privately owned concern.</P>

It may be that the accounts will not supply full information, but, after a discussion on the accounts presented, the Department may either recommend that there should be a price change or that there should be no change, or suggest that after a period, if the firm wishes to do so, it can renew its application.</P>

      <P>Occasionally we get complaints from consumers.  The Government has decided under this Act to appoint an advisory body, and power is taken to appoint additional advisory bodies if it should be necessary.  The decision at the moment is that a tribunal will be appointed consisting of either three or five persons.  A definite decision has not yet been taken as to whether the number will be three or five but, if three, the body will consist of an independent chairman, a representative of consumers' interests and a representative of manufacturers' or distributors' interests.  In the event of a larger tribunal being appointed, there will be a representative of trade unionists' or employees' interests and there will also be provision for a second consumers' representative.  The decision is based on the criticism which was made of the system of price control&mdash;more from the fact that it was alleged that sufficient information was not provided as to the circumstances which surround the fixing of prices, rather than from any conviction as to its effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, as I have admitted, that the system which has operated does not enable either Deputies or the public to get information which they consider necessary, information as to the facts on which prices or price changes are based.  It is not contended, however, that any system of price control will be 100 per cent. effective.  It is quite likely that the import prices of certain commodities may change upwards in future.  The difficulties I have referred to may be accentuated and a number of difficulties not foreseen at present may occur but this decision is taken to establish an advisory body to advise the Minister who has the responsibility <Col N="1288" /> of fixing a price of any commodity on the assumption that those directly concerned&mdash;first of all, the consumer, then the manufacturers and distributors and the trade union representatives&mdash;will themselves bring to bear on this problem the intimate knowledge which they have of the workings of industries, and the effects which changes may have on these industries so that the public may be able to see on what basis prices are fixed.  In that connection I must say that it will be necessary to keep certain particulars private.</P>

I think the Deputy will realise that it is not possible for anybody functioning in this way, any more than any individual concern making application to the Department, to have information made public which may be of use to competitors and which may seriously interfere with the efficiency of that firm and with its capacity to work on proper lines.</P>

In taking this decision, it in no way derogates from the achievements over the last three years, achievements that I believe are recognised and it is only right to say that the trade union representatives that I had the privilege of meeting recently publicly expressed to the members of the Government that they met that they recognised that up to now conditions had been kept stable.</P>
      <P>This Government was formed in circumstances which a number of people expected would have since passed, circumstances in which it was expected that the Government itself would not be here at the present time.  Despite the gloomy prognostications and the arrogant claims made by our opponents and the doubts expressed by well-meaning friends, we have achieved results that I believe are a testimony to the ability of the members of the Government, to the foresight of the members of the various Parties who collaborated in forming this Government and, above all, to the people who elected the various Parties who, in turn, combined to elect this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot anticipate or foretell what may occur in the immediate future.  We can only undertake to work with our combined efforts to minimise any difficulties that may be met, to seek to alleviate, where <Col N="1290" /> possible, hardships caused by circumstances outside our control.  We do not claim that we have a solution to all our problems, or that we have a solution to all the difficulties that confronted us or that will confront us in future. We do claim&mdash;and the facts and figures I have given bear ample testimony to the fact&mdash;that we have secured remarkable achievements over the last two and a half, almost three, years.  They show that the policy which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has pursued of allowing, where possible, free competition and freedom from restriction to operate, coupled with increased industrialisation and an expansionist economic policy, both in agriculture and industry, has achieved results better than any achieved elsewhere. But we cannot and we do not anticipate that, as long as people like Joe Stalin and his satellites are free to affect world interests, we can prevent the impact of these events here.  We will endeavour to minimise them in so far as we can.  In order to do so, this measure is required and it is believed that the advisory tribunal or tribunals, as the case may be, will assist the Government and assist the public to face the problems of the future, will assist us to deal with conditions, however difficult, in the knowledge that up to the present we have done better than any other country, either in Europe or elsewhere and have done considerably better than our opponents, and even some friendly critics thought we would do in February, 1948.</P>

      <P>As this Supplies and Services Act is the main legal foundation for the ineffective efforts at price control that the Government is making, it was to have been expected that the Parliamentary Secretary would devote his remarks almost entirely to the problems of price control and not to other Government activities which are carried on under the authority of this Act.  In fact, as the House will remember, we were promised by the Taoiseach a statement on Government policy in relation to rising prices on this Bill.  That promise was given when Deputies who are sitting behind the Government were asking nasty questions about prices and the Government's inability to control them.  They have had the statement, and I presume they are now all satisfied with the policy of the Government in this matter and with the action they are going to take in future regarding it.</P>

      <P>It has been my experience, Deputy, that the Labour Party has always been satisfied with a committee. On almost any subject their opposition or animosity can be bought off by giving them a committee and the Fine Gael Party, knowing that, have decided to adopt the old technique in regard to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had that statement of policy.  If the Deputies behind the Government are not satisfied with it as a statement of policy in relation to price control, I am sure they will at least approve the change of tactics in resisting criticism of ineffective price control which the statement suggested.  Remember, a few weeks ago, the Government were taking a different line. They were excusing the rise in prices on the old ground that it was due to causes outside their control, to international conditions, to devaluation, to rising internal costs, and so forth, and seeking to justify their failure to check the rise by their inability to control these factors.</P>
      <P>Now they are on a new line.  There is no rise in prices.  The trade union representatives, or other public critics of the Government in relation to prices, the ordinary housewife, the ordinary worker who thinks he is paying more for a variety of goods ranging from bacon to whiskey, are only imagining it.  There is no rise in prices at all.  That was, I think, the main line the Parliamentary Secretary took.  He tried to modify it in one respect by suggesting that if there has been a rise in prices, then the recovery in employment and output, the rise in the standard of living since the termination of the war, should more than compensate them for the fact that the Government's measures of price control have not been as effective as they one time promised they would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is an aspect of this question to which I want to draw the attention of the House.  This is a matter upon which promises were made, specific <Col N="1293" /> promises, and they were made by every member of the Government and by the spokesmen of every Party in that Government.  And the promises were not to keep the cost of living stable, to prevent prices rising, to submit claims for higher prices for examination to some advisory committee. The promises were to bring down prices, to bring down the cost of living.  That-was claimed as one of the purposes for which this Government was set up.</P>
    <P>I know that Deputies opposite dislike being reminded of these things, but I suggest it is justifiable in political tactics to do so.  When the election was in progress which created the present Dáil, every Party now represented on the benches opposite criticised the Government then in office on this ground, that it had failed to bring down prices to the extent to which they could have been reduced by effective Government control.  They urged that the system of control then in operation was defective and that it was their intention so to improve it that an immediate lowering of prices would result.</P>
    <P>The system of control in operation to-day is precisely the same as that which operated in 1947.  What we are discussing here now is the continuation for another year of the Act that was in operation in 1947.  There has been no change in the system.  They promised further that if they were unable to lower prices to the extent they desired by improving the system of Government control, then they would do so by increasing subsidies on prices, and by one method or another they undertook that the cost of living would be reduced.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Lehane and Deputy Cowan have been showing considerable interest in this matter, and as they fought the election under Mr. MacBride's banner, I am going to remind them of the policy of the Clann na Poblachta Party as declared in a public speech made by the present Minister for External Affairs at Carlow, reprinted from the <i>Leinster Leader</i> of the 6th September, 1947, and distributed broadcast throughout the country.  It is a formal statement of <Col N="1294" /> the policy of the Clann na Poblachta Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Having referred to general, long-term plans, the statement sets out that &ldquo;it is essential that some immediate steps should be taken to deal with certain urgent problems that face the country&rdquo;.  Clann na Poblachta called upon the Government to put into immediate operation the following temporary remedies: (1) provide subsidies on all production on a sufficient scale to enable the producer to provide for himself and the agricultural workers whom he employs an adequate family wage, having regard to the present cost of living and our moderate requirements and (2) the subsidies provided should be sufficient to bring about a reduction of at least 30 per cent. on the existing cost of all food produced and consumed here, and should be accompanied by a strict control of prices.</P>
      <P>As I, on a previous occasion, when referring to this pamphlet, indicated, the further points have no direct reference to prices; they relate to the distribution of free fertilisers and things of that kind.</P>

      <P>A speech reprinted in pamphlet form as a statement of the Party's policy. I want to make it clear that I am referring to that speech because it was in one sense the most definite and certainly the most extravagant promise that came from any of the Deputies now sitting opposite during that election campaign; but every one of them knows they did specifically promise the people from whom they sought votes that by more effective price control or by subsidy they would reduce the cost of living, not hold it stable, not limit the rise, but that they would bring it down.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lehane, undeterred by the review of the position now given by the Parliamentary Secretary believes it is still possible. These promises were undoubtedly made; in many cases they were made irresponsibly, made by the spokesmen of Parties who did not expect to find themselves constituting any part of a Government.  We might forgive them on that account because irresponsibility in politics was not merely a development in 1947, but when the election was over and when to their surprise they found that they were able to combine with one another to command a majority in the House and form a Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is going to be surprised now when I remind him of what he promised to do at that time. I will admit that I was disappointed. I thought when the leaders of the various Parties&mdash;the Labour Party, the Clann na Poblachta Party and the Clann na Talmhan Party&mdash;said they were not going to enter into a coalition with Fine Gael, they meant it.  To my surprise they did enter into that coalition.  They formed that Coalition Government and then proceeded to set out what that Government, thus formed, was going to do.  Remember this, they proceeded to set it out in the realisation that they were going to become the Government, that they were going to have responsibility and power.  Consequently, while they did not altogether confirm the wilder promises they made before polling day, they, nevertheless, felt it safe to make a number of specific promises, one of which related to this question of prices.</P>
      <P>During the period of the negotiations which led to the formation of the Coalition Government, there were various statements issued by the different Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Just about that time. <Col N="1296" /> Then the various Parties were issuing statements to explain why they were departing from their pre-election pledges and coalescing with Fine Gael.  Each of them said they were doing so because they had secured undertakings that specific things would be done.  Clann na Poblachta, in a statement published in the <i>Irish Times</i>, declared that they were partaking in the inter-party Government because it would help them to achieve certain points of their policy, and they set out those points under ten headings.</P>

      <P>Number three is &ldquo;a reduction in the cost of living,&rdquo; and then, as I reminded the Dáil on a previous occasion, the Taoiseach went over to Radio Eireann and broadcast his intentions with regard to the proposed work of the Government: &ldquo;The average citizen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is primarily concerned with the problem of making ends meet, of trying to provide his family with food, clothing, education, and simple pleasures out of an income which cannot keep step with the rising cost of almost everything he needs. These economic considerations must take priority over all political and constitutional matters.&rdquo;  They did not take priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have now, as the best that the Government can offer in defence of its administration over the past three years, not a claim that the cost of living has been reduced, but the contention that it has not increased.  If there are any people who think it has increased then they are wrong.  It is true that taking a stand upon the cost of living index number the Parliamentary Secretary has to agree that since November, 1947, there has been an increase of 11 per cent. in the cost of clothing, and an increase of 2 per cent. in the cost of fuel and light; but these increases in the costs of these classes of commodities have, he claims, been more than offset by reductions in the costs of foodstuffs.  That is the claim made by the Parliamentary Secretary; the reductions in the costs of foodstuffs have more than offset the <Col N="1298" /> increase in the costs of other commodities with the result that the cost of living is to-day no higher than it was in November, 1947.</P>

Of course there has been an increase and it is quite preposterous to attempt to suggest that there has not.  That increase has taken place although the Government has got adequate powers of price control.  If there was any foundation for the suggestion made by Deputies before the <Col N="1299" /> election that prices could be brought down by some system of price control, then they have had available to them over the last three years the most drastic powers of control that human ingenuity could devise.  I think now, as I thought in 1947, that these powers are so drastic they should not be available to any Government in times of peace.  The powers which the Government is exercising in relation to prices were those taken under the Emergency Powers Act on the outbreak of the war. They give the Government the right to interfere in every citizen's private business, if the Government wants to use its powers in that direction.</P>

In fact last year when a Bill to continue these powers for another year was submitted to the Dáil the Parliamentary Secretary, on behalf of the Government, undertook to consider the possibility of enacting in the form of permanent legislation the powers the Government thought it desirable to retain and to get rid of this Bill altogether.  Like a lot of other promises made by the Government at that time that promise was not fulfilled.</P>

      <P>That may be so but I do not think the House would have hesitated at any time to give the Government increased powers if a case could be made for them.  I am suggesting that the case should be made, that it is not good enough that the Government should ride along on the basis of temporary emergency legislation and not turn its mind to the problems of the present and the future by framing legislation to deal with these problems, because this price agitation which exists at the present moment will not cease with the setting up of an advisory committee.  It will continue and if there is to be a more systematic method of investigation and, in particular, a method of investigation <Col N="1300" /> which will inspire public confidence, something that the present machinery does not do, by giving the public the information which will enable them to arrive at and form decisions concerning price trends, then something more than an advisory committee associated with civil servants holding arbitrary powers under emergency legislation is required.</P>

      <P>Do Deputies not recognise that this suggestion is merely to provide a facade behind which the Government can shelter or conceal itself?  In future, when there is a number of acrimonious parliamentary questions addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce about rising prices, it will be open to him to say that the advisory committee has the matter under its attention and that will be the end of the matter.  Deputies opposite will be stalled off with that reply and there is nothing they will be able to do about it, as it would be quite unreasonable to expect the Minister to urge the advisory committee to do anything except advise.</P>
      <P>The proposal to establish an advisory committee, however, raises a number of interesting points.  Deputy Cowan saw some of them and I think Deputy Lehane is beginning to grasp others.  Remember the Government's technique in this matter of price control up to the present has been quite simple.  I described it before.  Whenever prices were rising, because of higher costs of materials, higher wages or other factors, and they could do nothing about it, they decontrolled the articles concerned.  They evaded the responsibility of authorising a higher price, by revoking the Price Control Order applying to the class of goods affected.  Whenever prices were falling in any event, falling because of a reduction in the cost of materials or lower production costs following increased output, they made a new Order fixing a lower price and patted themselves on the chest about their successful effort to bring down prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a parliamentary question here of the Taoiseach, to ascertain the number of Order which have been made under the authority of the <Col N="1302" /> Supplies and Services Act since last year, decontrolling various commodities, releasing them from the survey of the Department, releasing them presumably from the attentions of this advisory committee.  I was given a list of 30 of such articles.  As I mentioned, they ranged from bacon to whiskey and I say here now that on every occasion on which an Order of that kind was made in relation to practically every article on this list, within a month of the Government deciding to decontrol these articles, the price went up; and I say that the reason why they were decontrolled was that the Government knew that if they did not decontrol they would have to sanction higher prices.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What is to be the position of the advisory committee in relation to these goods?  Their prices are going up.  The increase in their prices is provoking a large amount of the public discontent to which Deputies have been referring.  Will the advisory committee have any <Col N="1303" /> function at all in relation to a commodity which is not still subject to a price control order and if it is to have a function in relation to it, what will it be?  The fact is that the Government has thrown in its hand in this matter of prices.  They thought for a while they could get away with the defence that international factors were too strong for them to control. Realising now that that defence is not placating the public discontent, they have decided upon this device of putting in front of their price control machinery the fake of an advisory committee.  Setting up advisory committees will not increase one iota the powers the Government now have to extract information, to regulate prices, to control profits, to insist upon the abandonment of trade practices which are affecting prices.</P>
      <P>There has been a lot of talk here about rings, about restrictive trade organisations which limit the number of those who may engage in particular industries or trades; and we have had repeated assurances from the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Parliamentary Secretary that the matter was having their attention. This time last year on the Supplies and Services Bill introduced in 1949 we got an undertaking&mdash;another undertaking&mdash;that the Government's proposals for legislation in relation to trade rings and restrictive organisations would be submitted to the Dáil. We have not seen them.  How long do Ministers think they can fob off criticism in the Dáil or public discontent by making promises of that kind with no intention of keeping them?  That was all right during their first year in office.  It seemed to work reasonably well during their second year; but surely in their third year they must have felt that the device was wearing a bit thin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if Deputies opposite fully realise how far they have departed from their original ideas and principles. On the first occasion that the present Minister for Finance came to this House to speak as such, announcing Government policy, on March, 9th, 1948, he said that the Government had three main objectives&mdash;one of them <Col N="1304" /> was to increase production&mdash;a rather desirable objective and one that was not likely to offer much difficulty in view of the fact that wartime scarcities and emergency problems were passing.  Then he went on to say, as given in Volume 110, column 222 of the Official Debates:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We want first of all to ensure retrenchment over as wide a field as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he added that their second objective was to reduce the cost of living. He assured the Dáil that he had not merely got a decision from the Government authorising him to seek energetically methods of realising these objectives, but that he had got the approval of each individual Minister in the Government.  He added on that occasion that a factor in the heavy burden of the cost of living to which people have had to submit for many years past was the amazing increase in the cost of Government spending.  In so far as that speech represented a formal statement of Government policy, the policy accepted, we were assured, by each individual member of the Government, its main objectives were first of all to reduce the volume of Government spending and secondly to reduce the cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance may be ill &mdash;I hope he is not seriously ill&mdash;but he was engaged to address a dinner on last Saturday night and a speech was prepared for him to deliver at that dinner which in his absence was delivered instead by the Minister for Defence.  It was a speech which bore all the evidence of having been carefully prepared, and I trust it was approved not merely by the Government but by each individual member of the Government.  In that speech it was obvious that the Minister for Finance intended to render an account of the results of his efforts and the efforts of his colleagues to achieve the objectives which they set before themselves in March, 1948: to reduce the cost of living and to lower the heavy burden of Government spending which affected the cost of living.  He was compelled to admit in that speech of last Saturday that he had failed in <Col N="1305" /> both of these objectives.  He pointed out that public spending for noncapital purposes had outpaced the rise in money incomes&mdash;the rise to which the Parliamentary Secretary was referring to-day&mdash;and he went on to add that when the upward trend in prices, social services and debt charges is considered it is difficult to see how the tax burden can be eased.  Having thus disposed of his undertaking to reduce the tax burden and the level of Government spending, he turned to that other question of prices and having conceded, as the Parliamentary Secretary does not, that prices are rising&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I concede that there is a recent rise.  I made that quite clear, and it is to meet that situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of this recent rise which the Parliamentary Secretary acknowledges and the burdens which that rise may mean to ordinary folk, the Minister for Finance thought it desirable to refer to that also.  He pointed out what is true: that a particular class&mdash;I do not doubt that he was referring in that phrase particularly to the workers and to the leaders of their organisations&mdash;can of course maintain and even better their position by securing more money for themselves, and he added a phrase the full significance of which it is not easy to appreciate that &ldquo;any such moves will receive no favours from the Government.&rdquo;  What that means he will have to explain himself, but in case Deputies have any doubt as to what is meant by it, I will quote a further sentence from his speech.  He said that the situation calls for sacrifices of various kinds. They were not the words he used, and the words he did use were:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the acceptance by both employers and employees equally of some disimprovement in the standard of living if prices internationally continue to rise.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that that declaration of Government policy by the Minister for Finance had the approval of the Government and of each individual Minister to the same extent as the original declaration of policy in March, <Col N="1306" /> 1948, because if at the end of three years of coalition administration, three years attempting&mdash;if they did attempt &mdash;to fulfil their promises to lower the burden of taxation and reduce the level of prices, the most that they can hold out to the workers of this country is the immediate prospect of some disimprovement in the standard of living, and if the only policy they now have to offer is to urge upon the representatives of the workers that they should voluntarily accept a disimprovement in the standard of living, then it is a sufficient commentary upon their administration.</P>
    <P>Can we get from the Government any frankness in this matter?  Will they even now deal with these issues honestly?  Will they come to the Dáil and to the public and say: &ldquo;When we promised in 1947 before the election to reduce the cost of living, when we put in our ten-point programme that one of the aims on which all coalition Parties had agreed was a reduction of the cost of living, we did it in ignorance; we did it not knowing how effective the price control of the previous Administration had been, or realise how potent were the forces that were pushing up prices.  We now confess that we cannot control them; we withdraw that promise and we undertake instead to achieve what is in our power, that is to restrict whatever rises in prices international or internal conditions may necessitate by ensuring that there will be no duplication of costs or any undue profits.&rdquo;  Will they admit that when they promised to reduce the burden of taxation and the level of Government spending, even if the Minister for Finance at that time thought it practical policy, his colleagues in the Government whom he consulted gave their assent with their tongues in their cheeks because none of them really intended to reduce the level of Government spending and the consequent burden of taxation?  The failure to control prices, to prevent a rise in prices up to now, the accelerating rise that is now in progress, is perhaps the Government's greatest failure.  It is, I think, no answer to the criticisms that have been expressed among sections of the public of the apparent indifference of the Government to that increase <Col N="1307" /> that generally economic conditions in the country are better now than they were in the war.</P>
    <P>We never hoped during the seven or eight years in which the war emergency continued to be able to increase employment or output or even to preserve the pre-war standard of living. But we did not promise to do these things either and we were able to go during the war, as we did on two occasions, to the public and justify to them the restrictions we had in operation, the unpleasant, unpopular restrictions, on the ground that they were necessary to prevent a further deterioration in economic standards or the cost of living and we got approval from the public for these measures because we were able to face them honestly and give a frank explanation of our motives.  Is it any answer to the charge that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his Parliamentary Secretary have failed to exercise their powers of price control efficiently to refer to the Government's capital development programme?  If the theories of economists are right, it must have an inflationary effect upon prices, but, on some occasion, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary or his Minister will explain to the Dáil what has happened the capital development programme for which their Department is responsible. We passed here a Bill to set up a new Córas Iompair Éireann, a new organisation that was going to indulge in substantial capital expenditure upon the renovation of the railways.  Have they sought one penny of capital money for investment purposes since they were established?  We passed a Bill early this year to give the Turf Board more money and to empower them to build houses for their workers, authorising the giving of grants to the board for the building of houses for their workers.  Has one house been built? Has one scheme for the building of houses yet been approved by the Department? The rural electrification scheme is proceeding at less than half the rate which the Electricity Supply Board reported in January, 1948, they hoped to achieve.</P>

In January, 1948, the board submitted an estimate of the progress they thought they could make.  Has that estimate been realised?  These are projects that directly concern the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Parliamentary Secretary and perhaps they might turn their attention to them rather than to trying to hide their failure in regard to price control by referring to the number of men employed by county councils on various work projects.</P>
      <P>As a protest against the Government's failure to use properly the powers given them by the Supplies and Services Act during the course of the past year, as a protest against their coming to the Dáil now to request a continuation of these powers and as a protest against their failure to secure the enactment by the Oireachtas during that period of permanent legislation for the regulation of prices, for rationing, for exchange control and building control, we propose to vote against this Bill.  It is true that the Parliamentary Secretary devoted the whole of his remarks to prices, but there are other aspects of Government administration which are directly relevant to this Bill, other powers which they use under the authority of this Bill, which cannot be ignored.  Will somebody tell me why we are still rationing petrol?  Is there a Deputy who has succeeded in getting the proprietor of a garage to take a petrol coupon from him this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says &ldquo;yes&rdquo;&mdash;he had to force it on him.  He knows as well as I know that there is not a garage at which you cannot buy all the petrol you want without being asked for a coupon.  Why then are we incurring the expense of maintaining in the Department of Industry and Commerce an organisation staffed by civil servants who could be more usefully employed, incurring expenditure for the printing of rationing cards and issuing public <Col N="1309" /> notices in order to maintain this farcical system of rationing in operation? Is there some logical explanation of it?  Would anybody outside a mad-house think of it?</P>
      <P>The justification which the Government offer for the continuation of the rationing of bread, tea and sugar, despite the fact that supplies of these commodities are abundant, has already been debated here.  I think this system of differential prices is undesirable. Not every Deputy shares that view, I know, but I would strongly urge Deputies that they should press upon the Government to get away from it as quickly as possible.  If it does mean more money for subsidies to make tea freely available, to increase the supply of bread at the subsidised price, I see no objection to voting it here.  I would much prefer to vote money for that purpose than for some of the purposes for which the Government seeks it.  It is preposterous for a Government that fails by £12,000,000 to balance its budget to justify on the ground of economy, the maintenance of this discriminatory system, which says to those who are well-off: &ldquo;You can have unlimited supplies,&rdquo; but which tells those who are less well-off that they must be rationed in the quantity of goods they can get.  I have already pointed out to the Dáil the anomalous fact that this country, which went through the whole of the war up to 1946 without bread rationing, with bread and flour supplies uncontrolled, is now the only country in the world, five years after the war is over, in which bread is rationed.</P>

We had a system of enforcement, which may not have been completely effective, and we had numerous prosecutions for evasion of our regulations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  These are matters of administration which might perhaps be more usefully discussed on the Estimate for the Department. Why are we maintaining exchange control with greater severity apparently than the British, in view of the fact that we have voluntarily abandoned, under this European Payments Union agreement, the benefit we might otherwise get from the surplus which our trade with these European countries creates?  If there is any justification at all for voluntarily agreeing that the benefit of our trading surplus with these countries will go to Great Britain, that the British deficit with the union will be reduced and that eventually <Col N="1311" /> gold and dollars will flow into the British Exchequer because of our surplus, should we not at least get some benefit in a withdrawal of the restrictions imposed upon our citizens who want to spend money in these countries, either in the purchase of goods or for travel?</P>
      <P>I do not profess to understand the Government's policy in that regard.  I have tabled questions to try to get some information about it.  I have not been very successful yet, but I will keep on trying.  It does seem to me, however, that the Government have taken a major decision on financial policy, and that when they went into the European Payments Union as an appendage of Great Britain, as a tag-end of the sterling area, they were committing themselves for an indefinite period ahead.  If that is so, then it is time also that this business of exchange control should be brought before the Dáil in the form of proposals for permanent legislation to limit, as well as to define, the powers which the Minister for Finance will exercise in relation to it.</P>
      <P>I disapprove of this control being still exercised under the very wide powers of the Supplies and Services Bill.  I think these powers are far too wide to give to any Minister to exercise without being accountable to the Dáil, and, if there is to be some permanent form of control, then it should be more precisely defined in legislation.  That is another reason why I am going to object to the Government seeking to continue this Emergency Act instead of facing up to its responsibilities and transforming into permanent legislation the powers which it thinks it needs and the requests for it which it can justify here.  But our main objection is because of the Government's failure to control prices, their refusal to face up honestly to the problem of prices and, particularly, of this new device of theirs of pretending that they are doing something by setting up advisory committees to conceal their incompetence.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass, in concluding his speech, told us that the main reason why his Party was voting against this measure was the Government's failure to control prices.  I would ask Deputies to give even 30 seconds to an examination of the logic of Deputy Lemass in making that statement.  Because of the Government's failure to control prices, he wants to deprive them of the machinery whereby they may, if encouraged by criticism or otherwise, proceed to act differently in the future. The Deputy objects to letting a little fresh air and daylight in on matters of public concern by the inclusion of Section 3 and if that section is to be operated in the manner described by the Parliamentary Secretary, I cannot for the life of me&mdash;perhaps I am wilfully obtuse, though I do not think I am&mdash;see any logic in the Deputy's attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am no uncritical supporter of this inter-Party Government.  Many of the things which this Government have done I have criticised here and elsewhere, and while, in general, they will have my support, I will still keep to myself that right of criticism.  But, surely, if you are criticising a Government for their failure to be sufficiently active and alert in so far as price trends are concerned, it is illogical, to the greatest possible degree, to seek to deprive them of the powers whereby they can control prices.  Maybe there was some point in Deputy Lemass's <Col N="1313" /> observations that went over my head. I know that he has a very low opinion of the limited intelligence that exists over on the Government side of the House, but, in default of that, I must say that I find it difficult to understand why Deputy Lemass should advance to the House as his reason for opposing this Bill his dissatisfaction with the Government's failure to control prices when they have these powers.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the type of historical review, covering the last three years, to which Deputy Lemass treated us is the most helpful or the most constructive way of approaching this measure.  With a great deal of Deputy Lemass's strictures I have a certain amount of sympathy, but unfortunately for Deputy Lemass there was not, I think, one single criticism which he made which could not have been levelled with equal if not greater strength against the Administration of which he was a member.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass referred to a speech made by the leader of the Party to which I belong during the course of the general election campaign. I make Deputy Lemass a present of this.  I believe still that in so far as essential commodities are concerned, that is essential foodstuffs, clothing, fuel and light necessary for the workers, the cost of these commodities could still be reduced by 30 per cent.  At least, let me put it this far, that in the condition of affairs that existed in 1948 or 1949 it was still possible to reduce them by 30 per cent. Admittedly, it might have been necessary substantially to subsidise them to a greater extent than we are doing at present.</P>

      <P>If it is <i>ad rem</i> on this Bill, I would, perhaps, be prepared to argue that with Deputy Childers who shakes his head as to its advisability. The Deputies opposite, Deputy Lemass in particular, taunt this Government and the Deputies who support this Government with its inter-Party character.  We know it is an inter-Party <Col N="1314" /> Government.  We know that the policies to which, say, the Deputies of the Fine Gael Party give their adherence are not identical with the policies which, say, the Deputies of the Labour Party or the Clann na Poblachta Party may support.  From the inter-Party character of this Government Deputy Lemass always seeks&mdash;now it is one Party, to-morrow it is another Party &mdash;to drive one or other Party into a position of illogicality, into a position of having departed from its own policy.</P>
      <P>Of course the policy which this Government are operating at the moment is not the policy which the Clann na Poblachta Party would operate had we control.  I am equally sure that the policy which this Government are operating at the moment is not the policy that Fine Gael would be operating had they complete control.  But what annoys Deputy Lemass is that in 1948&mdash;he referred to it himself&mdash;when the Minister for Finance came along on 9th March and made a statement in the House Deputy Lemass got up and waved his finger over at these benches, particularly at the Labour Party and Clann na Poblachta Party, and warned us about this awful fellow McGilligan, this fellow with the axe who had a mania for retrenchment, and said that no matter what he did we were going to be as mute as mice and as helpless as little children and the awful man with the axe was going to come along and lop off all our heads.  For little children and mute little mice we did not do a bad job of work in bringing this great exponent of retrenchment around to a point of view where he saw there was a little to be said for our outlook also and, as a result, you have a programme of capital expenditure and development which surpasses what the most progressive Deputies on the benches opposite would have dreamed of in their wildest dreams.  I should perhaps apologise to the House for touching upon these matters inasmuch as they are not strictly relevant to this Bill.  They were, however, matters to which Deputy Lemass adverted at considerable length and I feel entitled to reply to his observations and remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary in introducing this measure referred <Col N="1315" /> time and time again to the cost-of-living index figure and, by implication, Deputy Lemass jettisoned the cost-of-living index figure as a thing absolutely without value as any pointer to or indication of the cost of living now. I am inclined to agree with Deputy Lemass in that view of his.  It comes perfectly all right from me to say that, but it comes very badly from Deputy Lemass who was there when that method of arriving at a cost-of-living index figure was evolved.  I should like to say to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the House that I believe the index figure as at present arrived at does not give any real indication as to price trends or as to the relationship between what goes into the worker's envelope on a Friday night and what his wife has to budget for for the week.  I think the cost-of-living index figure is a fake.  I think it is valueless and that the sooner we arrive at a new method of computing rises and falls in living costs the better.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the fact that in Britain it was on a slightly broader basis.  I know that even in Britain, although alleged to be on a broader basis than we have here, a journal like the <i>Economist</i> has no hesitation in describing it as an index figure which reflects neither the cost of living nor the level of retail prices.  If that is true of the British figure, and it is essentially of a broader character, with what greater force can we urge here the necessity for the evolving of some new method of giving this necessary information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Even on a broader basis here it would only mean a rise of 1 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point I am dealing with at the moment. I am merely dealing with the unsatisfactory nature of this method of watching trends in prices and living costs. Demonstrably, to my mind, it is unsatisfactory to have a cost-of-living index which at a time of rising prices, as has been admitted by the Minister for Finance, by the Taoiseach and, I think, by the Parliamentary Secretary himself, does not reflect those rising <Col N="1316" /> trends in any way.  I am quite prepared to admit that, even if we were to broaden it to the extent to which the British broadened it, it would only means an increase of 1 per cent.  I think that a greater broadening is necessary if it is to mean anything. There must be nothing more aggravating or irritating to the average housewife than to be told, when she knows that the cost of living is rising, that the index figure is still at 100.  I would seriously urge on the Parliamentary Secretary and on the Minister, were he here, the desirability of some new approach to the method of computing the cost of living.</P>
      <P>This Bill, of course, except for Section 3, is merely a continuation of the powers which the Dáil voted last year. I was not able to get quite clearly from Deputy Lemass whether the gravamen of his objection was to Section 3 or to the continuation of the powers at all. Judging him on the note on which he sat down, I think that we are forced into the position that, even if Section 3 were not in the Bill, Deputy Lemass and his Party would oppose it. On the other hand, he did devote a considerable portion of the time he was on his feet to a criticism of Section 3 <i>per se.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say this to the Parliamentary Secretary.  The section as it appears in the Bill is, to my mind, a little vague, a little bit wide, and a little bit naive, one of those sections which might nearly slip through the Dáil without anybody noticing it were it not for all the pother we had about this matter in the Dáil and elsewhere during the last ten days.  I think it would have been preferable to have included in the Bill an indication as to the scope, extent and authority of the proposed tribunal and perhaps a schedule regulating its procedure, the method of appointment of its members, and dealing with all the details that should normally be dealt with when setting up a body of this nature.  The section merely empowers the Minister to set up an advisory tribunal.  I regret that the Government did not see fit to introduce legislation setting up a body with definite statutory powers, something a little bit on the lines of the Labour Court, to which <Col N="1317" /> body it would be necessary for any manufacturer or wholesaler to go, before being permitted to increase the price of any commodity or manufactured article.  After all, in practically every instance the worker who, feeling the effects of present-day circumstances, wants an increase in his wages is compelled to justify before a tribunal his claim to that increase. Some of us feel that what is sauce for the working goose should be sauce for the manufacturer, wholesaler or employer gander, and that there would be nothing unfair in asking the Dáil to set up a body to which it would be necessary for the manufacturer, the importer, the wholesaler or any person dealing in any commodity whatever to go before the public could be charged an increased price for any article or commodity.  The Government has not seen fit to do that.  I regret that my approach to Section 3 has to be, broadly speaking, that half a loaf, or perhaps even quarter of a loaf, is better than no bread.</P>
    <P>There are certain matters to which I hope immediate attention will be paid.  The price of flour and bread is one of them.  I think it is a great pity that there has been such a long delay in letting the Dáil have the report of the Commission of Inquiry into flour milling.  I think, perhaps, that some of the questions that have been discussed under this general heading of the cost of living might have been more intelligently discussed if we had been in possession of that report. However, we have not got it, and all I can say is that I hope we shall not have to wait much longer for it because there is an inclination on the part of the public, perhaps unfairly, to draw certain inferences from the failure to produce reports which they consider long overdue.  No reference was made either by the Parliamentary Secretary or by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition&mdash;I say advisedly the Deputy Leader of the Opposition&mdash;to the failure of the Government in so far as controlling prices to examine the profits of the monopolies responsible for the present high prices of fertilisers, cement and of course of flour.  I am not surprised that Deputy Lemass did not make any reference to <Col N="1318" /> these matters.  I would hope that, in his reply, we might hear something from the Parliamentary Secretary concerning them.</P>
    <P>It, perhaps, again has not strict relevance to the Bill before us, but inasmuch as the whole field of prices and profits has been surveyed by Deputy Lemass, I do feel inclined and entitled to refer again to a matter to which I have already referred to-day, namely, the fact that the balance sheets of many firms show exorbitant profits.  I make no apology for reminding the Minister for Finance, through the Parliamentary Secretary, of the undertaking he gave to this House some few years ago that, when satisfied that extravagant profits were being made, he would seriously consider the reimpositon of the excess profits tax.  I do not know whether that is a matter to which the Parliamentary Secretary will be able to refer when replying to this debate, but I think it is germane and relevant to the matters we are discussing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the tribunal itself, we may make all the fuss, and have all the pother and all the feigned indignation of Deputy Lemass but, in the final analysis, the judgment of this House and the judgment of the general public will to a very large extent be governed by the personnel of that body.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce gives an indication to the House and to the people by the sort of personnel which he appoints to the tribunal that he is seriously concerned in having provided for him practical, reasonable and balanced advice, then I think that the body or bodies envisaged by Section 3 will meet with public approval.  Let me say that unless such a tribunal contains amongst its personnel a representative of consumers or a representative of the workers, then, to my mind, it is doomed to failure in advance.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the question of an independent chairman. If the person appointed as chairman is someone who is really independent and not a political appointee, I believe the proposed tribunal will meet with public approval and acclaim.  It is on the personnel of the body which he appoints that the <Col N="1319" /> Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister will be judged.  I think it is a pity that we did not get a little bit more information as to the composition of the body envisaged under Section 3. Section 3 is so wide that it empowers the Minister to appoint any form of tribunal or any number of them.</P>
    <P>As I understood the Parliamentary Secretary's opening remarks&mdash;he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;the Government's attitude in this matter is that one body of either three or five persons will be appointed and, from time to time, subordinate to that body, other committees of investigation may be set up.  Am I generally correct in my assumption as to the intention?  The section, of course, leaves us in the position that we have to guess at these things, but I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary that that is so. The plea which I would press on the Parliamentary Secretary with the greatest urgency is that he should have regard to the personnel of the major tribunal which he sets up.</P>
    <P>As one who is often critical of the Government, I feel that in justice to the Government I should say that Deputy Lemass completely ignored the improvement in wage levels and social services that has taken place during the last three years and, to a minor extent, I suppose, it can be claimed that that improvement, that rise in wage levels, has been a contributory factor in the rise of living costs.  In fairness to the Government, that should be said.</P>
    <P>With regard to the differential prices of commodities like bread, sugar and butter, I think that a grey market of that kind is open to criticism where the rationed quantity made available is insufficient but where the quantity of the ration is generous and where the commodity is subsidised, a reasonable case can be made for that grey market.</P>
    <P>With regard to bread, I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that, while in urban areas the ration of bread is in the main sufficient, throughout rural Ireland it could with advantage, and I think without undue cost to the central Exchequer, be increased somewhat.  I do not know <Col N="1320" /> whether that is a matter that has received any consideration.  I know that special areas at special times in the year can get an increase in the ration.</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  The Deputy cannot come in here like a nanny-goat and say &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and expect to mislead people in this House.  We are not all fools.  I would urge upon the Parliamentary Secretary that the case for an increased bread ration for rural areas is a strong one and one that has such justice and force behind it that the cost to the central Exchequer would not be sufficient to entitle the Department to refuse it.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House further on this matter.  To my mind, it is an unwise policy for the Government or any member of it to adopt an ostrich-like attitude, to stick their heads in the sand and say that there has been no increase in the cost of living.  Every Deputy, every member of the public, knows there has been an increase in living costs, that prices have risen steeply and are continuing to rise.  It is our job to attempt to check them.  It certainly is not our job to ignore the existence of these unpleasant facts.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the machinery proposed in Section 3 is the best possible machinery that we could have got.  I think we could have got machinery which would have been more effective but, at the risk of being repetitious, I say that to a large extent, practically 100 per cent., the success or otherwise of the body or bodies envisaged will depend upon the personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One factor in this whole question of rising prices and high living costs that has not been referred to either by the Parliamentary Secretary or Deputy Lemass&mdash;I would say advisedly omitted by both of them, probably for political reasons&mdash;is the inevitable conflict that there is between the interests of the <Col N="1321" /> producers in the agricultural areas and the consumers in the urban areas.  I believe that conditions have so improved for the agricultural community under the present Government and the prices being obtained by them are so good and so advantageous to them, that urban workers are paying and are being asked to pay for the benefits accruing to the farming community. All of us want to see a healthy agricultural industry and a prosperous farming community.  My appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary is&mdash;and I would address it in the same words whether it had reference to bacon or butter, whiskey or beef&mdash;do not allow the urban workers to be penalised in order to provide too good a price for the agricultural community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that Deputy Lehane finished on that note. My main objection to this Bill is on behalf of the rural community, the farmer who is compelled to work at a wage that has been laid down here repeatedly, to cover his capital outlay and labour, of £3 10s. a week, and the agricultural labourer who is working for something less.  For what?&mdash;In order that a Bill of this description might be brought in, artificially to depress the conditions of that class of the community, while leaving every manufacturer profiteer, be he inside or outside this country, to fatten on our sweat.  That is happening.</P>
      <P>We have Deputy Lehane here making pious commentaries.  The only reason and the only justification for the rationing of bread in this country should be a scarcity of bread.  Is there a scarcity of bread?  If there is a scarcity, why is there in this country a white loaf for the rich man and a black loaf for the poor fellow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You have here a class in the community that Labour pretends to represent &mdash;the rural community.  I admit point blank that the present ration of bread is sufficient for the townsman, the white-collar worker, but take the poor devil who has to go out on his land on a frosty morning, like this morning, and do two hours' work before he comes in to eat his breakfast. He comes in to face the ration provided by this benevolent Government. If he wants more he can go to <Col N="1322" /> the black market set up by this Government and buy white bread at double the price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely presenting the situation as it exists in the country to-day.  I am giving the facts.  Down in my part of the country last week I had a complaint from a baker whose production has been reduced by 700 loaves a week, and this is in a little district.  That means that the people in that district will be compelled to purchase in the Government black market and, mind you, they are not white-collar workers, they are ordinary agricultural workers or ordinary farmers who have to go out into God's own air where they get an appetite that some of them cannot satisfy. That type of man is left short of bread. This works both ways.  The city baker has more than enough and he is being used to crush out the rural bakeries, to drive them out of existence, because we have city bread vans going out to the country and if you want an extra loaf you can get it from them.  I say that this Government black market is profiteering at the expense of the poorer classes.</P>
      <P>We hear shouts about prices going up.  What have the Government done to reduce prices?  Let us take sugar as one instance.  What did the Government do to keep the price of sugar within bounds?  When they found that the cost of production of beet had gone up and when a case for that was made to the sugar company and admitted by the sugar company, what did they do? When a recommendation was sent by the sugar company to the Department of Industry and Commerce, what was the reply?  The reply was to the effect that the previous Government was far too generous with the farmers and they added: &ldquo;You shall not increase the price of beet.&rdquo; As a result there was a reduction of 6,000 acres of beet and this Government had to go out to the niggers in Cuba and the natives of Formosa and pay £12 a ton more for their sugar than what it could be produced for here by Irish farmers and the workers in our sugar factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1323" /> That is the reason why the cost of living has gone up in this instance.  The Government paid to the foreigners £480,000 more than they would have to pay for the same quantity of sugar produced here.  As Deputy Connolly pointed out to us last night, we have 387,000 males, 100,000 females&mdash;that is, farmers and their families and their relations&mdash;and 100,000 labourers engaged in production on the land of this country.  They form what I would call the most depressed class.  Now we are going to have a Control of Prices Bill. For what?  To compel these people to produce food for the benefit of the town and city workers at less than the cost of production.</P>

      <P>Thanks to the efforts of your Government, there is a better market for the bacon now, because it is going over the Border to the Orangemen at twice the price your Minister for Agriculture could get officially from John Bull.  There is an unofficial black market there.  The Minister has introduced two prices for butter, 3/6 and 2/8.  We hear of demands on the agricultural community by the same Minister, that they must produce the milk at 1/- a gallon&mdash;so as to reduce the cost of living, I suppose.  He made a fake case here and it was upset by questions submitted by Deputy P.D. Lehane.  We found to our amazement that one question was addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and another one to the Minister for Agriculture, and it was pointed out that the total quantity of butter produced in 1949 was 20,000 cwts. less than would give the official ration to our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time there was a campaign further to depress the agricultural community by reducing the price of milk by 2d. a gallon.  That is only one item.  The Minister is responsible for something else.  He was such a good salesman that he sold our butter at 95/- per cwt. less than the price that the Danish Minister for Agriculture got for his butter in the same market.  The average price for Danish butter from January to June of this year on the continental market was 436/- a cwt. <Col N="1324" /> Compare that with the price that was given to me last week by our £2,550 Minister for Agriculture and then you will understand the reason why we have one price for the rich and another for the poor even in the case of butter. There is no attempt to control anything that the agricultural community requires.  The agricultural community is blistered with every impost.  It has no protection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane referred to artificial manures.  The moment that anything required by the agricultural community passes Roche's Point every middleman battens on it and fattens on it in order to swell the price the unfortunate farmer will eventually have to pay for it.  If anyone wants to find out the import dues charged on these articles one need only look at the list in the local harbour board and one will find there that the board charges the agricultural community 2/9¾ per ton on artificial manure and 9d. per ton on coal.  One will find every item that the agricultural community requires charged up there.  Every interest is represented on the harbour board except the interest of the agricultural community.  That is why you have a position where every other interest takes the load off its own back and throws it on to the poor fool who has no voice to speak for him.  There is a charge of 2/9¾ on a ton of rock phosphate worth £3 and 9d. on a ton of coal worth £6 10s. and 3/- on a ton of wheat worth £25.</P>

      <P>It is not, but he invited the comment.  That condition of affairs persists in relation to every item where the Government steps in to control. The only effective control they carry out is to control the price of food produced by the agricultural community here.  That is why I say the agricultural community is a depressed class. That section of our people could get a better price in any country in the world than the price they are getting here. If the Government does not take steps to ensure that agricultural produce here will get the same price as that obtaining in the world market we shall have nobody left on the land except the old age pensioners and the cripples. Unskilled labour to-day is paid at least double the wage of the skilled agricultural worker.  The shoneen behind the counter gets double the income the farmer gets out of his farm.  It is only when the article has left the farmer's hands that the price is doubled and trebled to the unfortunate consumer.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill it is the intention of the Government to keep the agricultural slave in bondage for another 12 months and to ensure that his earnings will be less than the wages paid to the Formosan and the Cuban.  That is the purpose of this Bill.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary inform us when he is concluding as to what attempt was made to control the price of agricultural machinery?  Will he infrom us whether or not any attempt was made to control the price of fertilisers?  Will he tell us when he intends to provide somebody who is prepared to market our surplus produce on the world market at at least the cost of production? Will he tell us when we are likely to reach a position where we will not be compelled to accept 25 or 40 per cent. less than the price paid to Denmark or any other country for commodities similar to those we produce? That is the information I want from the Parliamentary Secretary.  Will the Parliamentary Secretary let us know where exactly we stand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no justification whatever for a one-sided control of prices.  If there is to be control, that control should govern everything.  It should govern what the farmer has to buy as <Col N="1326" /> well as what he has to sell.  Let us have an end to the game being played under the protection of this Bill.  Will we have another commission to add to the Emigration Commission, the Unemployment Commission and the Industrial Development Authority?  Legislation governing that authority was passed here last week.  The only thing that body has succeeded in doing up to the present is preventing the development of Irish Steel in Cobh.  That would give employment to 300 people and ensure a supply of steel should we find ourselves in another emergency.</P>
    <P>Then we have a commission on flour. I would like to hear something about that.  I would be very anxious to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary, or someone over there, the result of that commission, whether it was put before them for their approval that there should be a rationing of bread in this country, and that a special white loaf should be produced, not for the use of the unfortunate £3 a week agricultural labourer or his brother, the £3 10s. 0d. a week farmer&mdash;they could not afford it&mdash;though they are the very class of the community who require extra bread, who should have, if there was to be any distinction in the loaf, a cheaper loaf if at all possible, instead of the dice being loaded against them. That is what I should like to hear from this commission on flour, when they are brought to light after the next general election with all the other commissions.  It is a grand excuse.  I make no bones about it in relation to any Government.  Every time they are in a hole or a corner, they set up a commission and the boys do the talking until the air changes.</P>
    <P>I can see no justification whatever for this control, unless it is control, and control from the start.  I want to know what control the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is in charge of this Bill, is going to exercise on the farmers' fertilisers.  I want to know what instructions he will send down to the Cork Harbour Commissioners, whether he will demand an explanation from them as to why there should be only 9d. a ton harbour dues on coal coming into Cork and 2/9¾ on a ton of the farmers' fertilisers coming into <Col N="1327" /> Cork, why there should be as high dues on fertilisers as on Canadian wheat. These are the questions I suggest he should be asked now, in order that if we are to have price control the farmer may have some share of the burden taken off his back, to enable him to meet at least some of his costs.  I do not think I am looking for too much.</P>
    <P>They start when the thing lands on the quayside and there is a fine from each additional drone that lights on that cargo from the moment it arrives on the quays at Cork until it reaches the farmers' field.  But let us start at the other side and take the farmers' produce and examine how the drones fatten on the farmer from the time the produce leaves the farmers' haggard until the time it arrives on the tables of the consumers.  There is good work for Deputy Davin's economic panel there&mdash;let him get to work on it.  In that way, we may be able, if we do not reduce, at least to have some control over the cost of living.  I certainly have a definite objection to this coming in on top of one section of the community, who have been put in a special reserved class known as the depressed class in this country. Since what they have to buy they have to purchase at the world market price, they are entitled to the world market price for what they produce as well.</P>
    <P>We hear of extra prosperity.  I am sure there is a lot of fat in it.  I have given one instance here of the manner in which the Department of Industry and Commerce dealt with the beet growers' demand for an increased price.  I am sure, A Leas-Chinn Chomhairle, it will not surprise you to learn that a costings commission, set up to look into the cost of the production of beet two months ago, found that it had gone up by 4/6 a ton since 1948.  If the cost of production of beet has gone up by 4/6 a ton since 1948, what has been the increase in the cost of production of milk since 1946, since we had costings here?  Despite the boast of the Parties opposite that they increased the farmers' cost by 20 or 25 per cent. since this Government came in, how is it that the price given to the farmer for his milk is the very <Col N="1328" /> same price as obtained in 1947 and how is it that when we have plenty to export or can sell agricultural produce on continental markets, we can only sell at 95/- a cwt. less than the Danish Minister succeeded in getting for the same produce for his own people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to follow Deputy Corry into some of his weird and rather extraordinary arguments. There are certain facets with regard to the cost of living to which I would like seriously to direct the Government's mind.  Deputy Con Lehane possibly struck at the real kernel of the problem when he said that, even though the index figure for the cost of living may have been static, we all know that many items essential in the normal cost of living, have increased remarkably in price.  It may full well be true that much of the increase in prices indirectly results from extraneous matters, such as was suggested, the delayed effect of devaluation; but one concrete fact emerges from the whole thing and it is that, to the normal person living in this community, to the normal person throughout the length and breadth of this country, in the general picture there has been an increase in the cost of living.  It may full well be that whoever conceived the idea of an index figure, and the range of items to be included in the assessment of that figure, had some queer notions of his own.  I believe that there are many essential items in use in the normal household necessary to the well-being of the normal family, that are not included, as they should be, in the index figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite true that in the welter of his nonsense Deputy Corry accidentally arrived at a little truth.  An effective effort must be made to balance the control of prices, and there is a good deal of substance in the contention that many of the items which are available to the farmer to help him in his drive for production are too costly, and that there is too great a margain of profit for the in-between man or middle man, as distinct from the producer or farmer when it comes to certain types of agricultural implements and machinery.  That is a <Col N="1329" /> problem that can be tackled.  It is a very considerable item in the production costs of the normal small farm in the country.  It may be truly said that farmers in the main are paying larger prices for inferior implements and that is something which must be tackled before you can get the goodwill of the agricultural community in a drive for the reduction of prices on the other side of the scale.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment believe that Deputy Corry believes the ranting nonsense he went on with here about the &ldquo;depressed agricultural community&rdquo;. He made that typical Corryish statement which may better be described as codology that there was nobody on the land but old aged pensioners or cripples.  I must say that I was tempted to ask Deputy Corry to which category he belonged because he did not show evidence of being an old age pensioner or a cripple except, possibly, mentally.  That half-mumbled utterance from that tower of wisdom from Galway was uncalled for.  The position is that there is a very strong argument to be advanced that as between the price paid in the yard or farm to the farmer for much of his produce and the ultimate cost of that article when it arrives in marketable form to the consumer the margin is too great and that there is room for pruning there.  That is where the real problem of the cost of living exists and I am absolutely convinced &mdash; and I am not afraid to state publicly that I am convinced&mdash;that there are many sections of the community engaged in trade and commerce who have succeeded in getting away with a lot. It may be that the Prices Commission in the Department of Industry and Commerce accepts certain figures from firms, but knowing as I do the general standard of life, way of life and activities of some of these allegedly oppressed industrialists and manufacturers, I hesitate to believe that they are working on the slender and miserable margin of profit that is at times suggested.  I am thoroughly convinced that there are tremendous loopholes and that tremendous advantage is being taken of these loopholes which exist in the costing system and the price control system in this country, and I sincerely <Col N="1330" /> reget that this Bill is not bringing in what I might consider the most effective type of machinery to remedy that.</P>
    <P>There is one appeal which I would make in a very earnest way to the Parliamentary Secretary who has taken on his shoulders the responsibilities of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I would ask him whenever this tribunal is set up to make it effective and make it effective immediately. Let it take the course of calling a halt and putting the onus on the people who want to increase prices to justify in no uncertain way the increase they claim. In fact I might be so radical as to suggest that he might call a halt by giving them a peremptory instruction to reduce by 10 per cent. the prices of their commodities and then let them try to justify a claim to get back the old prices.  This is a matter that needs very drastic action.</P>
    <P>One of two situations arise: either there is a genuine necessity for an increase in costs, and if there is it is due to the House and to the country that we get full and complete information about what causes the necessity for that increase, or if that position does not exist it is patent that there must be a very solid basis for a reduction. I do not believe in the theory of having wages and prices chasing each other and I do not believe that the trade union people or their leaders who are in this House want the position of trying to keep wages chasing prices.  I think that what they want is what I want.  They want to see price broken so that a fair wage will give a labourer the chance of a decent livelihood.  I think the prices can be broken, but unless the tribunal envisaged in the Bill gets executive powers and unless its personnel are men of tremendous calibre I do not think they are going to do the job.  It is a job that will have to be done on a basis that is fair to the community at large.  It is no good to try to suggest that the agricultural community are getting too much out of the kitty and that they are battening, as was suggested by Deputy Lehane, on the rural population.  The position is that there is an artificial inflation in the costs of agricultural <Col N="1331" /> production due to the excessive profits that can be made by supplying various raw materials, machinery and instruments which are necessary to the farming community in their drive for production, and that that unjustifiable increase is reflected in the price the farmer has to fix for his produce.  If you break prices, thus lowering the costs of production, you will have no difficulty in getting the goodwill of the farming community and in getting them to reduce consumer prices for their primary produce.  You have got to break the in-between profits.</P>
    <P>It is true that there have always been various types of historical in-between men between farmers and consumers.  In the main, they are a parasitical type of being and are, in the main, very little removed from agency commissions.  I think there are too many agents and sub-agents between the farmer and the consumer. We have to tackle costings on the basis of trying to bring as near as possible to each other the primary producer and the consumer and, if we can do that, we will have brought about a very effective breaking of prices.</P>
    <P>I am convinced, from my experience of a wide range of articles, that between factory and consumer, between farm and consumer, there is a gap of, in many cases, 150 to 200 per cent.  That is being dissipated on what have been aptly described by Deputy Corry as the drones, whether they are styled manufacturers' agents, distributing agents, wholesale agents or whatever they like to call themselves in polite parlance.  These are in between the people who are producing and the people who are consuming, and, if we can bring about a reduction of that gap, we might be able to stop, very effectively and very suddenly, rising prices.</P>
    <P>The initial fault and the whole difficulty, I think, lies in the system of price control.  It is not direct enough; it is not effective enough; and, when it finds breaches, it is not drastic enough.  Where a trader, manufacturer or wholesaler is found by this tribunal to be battening on the difficulties of an <Col N="1332" /> international situation, that tribunal should have powers drastic enough to eliminate him from future participation in the industry or business in which he may be operating.  We had a lot of talk on a recent Bill about the prerogative of mercy, but this is one activity in the life of the community in respect of which I would exercise no prerogative of mercy, where the facts are found and proved.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Government to see to the elimination of that type of trader and to hold him up, as the scarecrow is used to frighten crows, so that those who want to tread the path of the blackmarketeer and racketeer will have a staring, glaring example of the consequences that may ensue.  I firmly believe there is sufficient honesty and decency in the general run of all sections of the community that, if a conscientious and straightforward effort is made, we can do something effectively to control and possibly to break prices; but we will not do it unless we find some way of attacking the various middlemen who batten on those on both sides of the fence and unless we get some kind of clear perspective of what reasonable costs are, getting away from the system, as we must be doing at the moment, of accepting, in many cases willy-nilly certain submissions made to our costings department.</P>
    <P>Any of us who have the responsibility of homes and families know perfectly well what the impact in the recent twelve months of increased costs has been in respect of household utensils, blankets, clothing, and so on, items which some extraordinary genius decided should not be included in the items on which the cost of living index is computed.  There are two things the Government must do, and I hope will be done.  They must produce some practicable and intelligent range of articles which have some relation to the cost of living as it affects the normal family. They must work out a range of rational and reasonable articles and then get an index figure on that basis.  Secondly, let us have all the tribunals necessary &mdash;two, three or four tribunals&mdash;but give them sufficient power to get after the huge gap between the primary cost on the farm or in the factory and the <Col N="1333" /> ultimate cost to the consumer.  That is where all the damage is done in the matter of prices, and that is what has to be tackled.  It is in that direction that the price control section or these tribunals will have to direct their efforts, and until that is done on a concrete and practical basis, which will allow for a reduction in the cost of the primary commodities necessary for the agricultural community in their drive for production, I do not think you can ask for the goodwill or co-operation of the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's speech was devoted mainly to prices and price control, and possibly rightly so, even though the Bill permits of a much wider discussion. The cost of living is such a pertinent question at the moment that it was only right for him to devote such a large part of his speech to it.  I compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on making a good job of a very bad case in his speech, but he made the good job of that bad case only in relation to prices up to mid-August of this year.  He insisted and maintained that, between mid-August, 1947, and mid-August, 1950, prices had remained at the same level, and that there was no increase in the cost of living.  I entirely disagree with what he said in that connection, but it really does not matter in this debate, because we are discussing current and future prices and the most effective methods of controlling them.  The Parliamentary Secretary summed up adequately the function of the Minister and his Department when he said that their responsibility was to see that there were adequate supplies of essential commodities available, and available at reasonable prices.  I submit that in most cases they have failed to do what the Parliamentary Secretary set before them in that summing up of their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, I had occasion to put down a question about the increase in the price of whiskey.  I am not suggesting for a moment that whiskey is an essential commodity, but my question was bound up with the question of price control.  The licensed vintners' associations got together in Dublin, <Col N="1334" /> Limerick, Cork and, I think, other centres, and decided to increase the price of whiskey by 2d. per glass.  The reason they gave was that the cost of production had increased so much that it merited an increase of 2d.  I made inquiries, first from the Parliamentary Secretary, and his answer was that, since it was not an essential commodity, they had no means of assessing what the increase in the cost of production was.  I went further afield and I satisfied myself that the increase in the cost of production of whiskey amounted to something around 1d. a glass.  By the time that increase was reflected in the retail price, in the price the consumer has to pay, it had doubled itself.  The reason I take whiskey as a case in point is that it is possibly the most recent concrete case we have.</P>
    <P>What I fail to understand is, that when there is an increase in the cost of production, why that increase should be more than doubly reflected when the commodity in question reaches the consumer.  What justification is there for an increase in the middleman's profit or an increase in the retailer's profit when the only reason for the increase is that it has cost the producer a little more to produce the article?  Surely the middleman or the retailer had no more work to do when the whiskey, or whatever commodity might be, was being produced for a slightly lesser sum.</P>
    <P>I believe that the same story could be told of many articles that have increased in cost lately.  Admittedly, world conditions will have a bearing on the cost of production of a lot of essential and non-essential commodities in this country.  Goods are probably becoming scarce abroad and, consequently, dearer.  If these goods are essential for us then possibly there must necessarily be an increase in the cost of production.  But if the Department of Industry and Commerce considers that a commodity is an essential one, and that an increase is necessary at the source, why does it sit idly by and allow every middleman to take his chip of the increase, so that by the time the article reaches the consumer the increase in cost is more than it should be?  If there is to be any effective <Col N="1335" /> system of price control, surely that is one of the outstanding questions which should present itself to any prices commission.  I mention this particularly because people in many parts of the country have mentioned to me the instance that I have given of whiskey, and other instances as well.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, when he was driven for argument to base his claim that the cost of living had not increased since mid-August this year, had to have resort to <i>Reynolds News</i>, an English newspaper, of what repute I do not know.  Nevertheless, I do not think <i>Reynolds News</i> will convince any housewife in this country that the cost of living is lower here than it is in any other country.  Neither will she be convinced by the statistics produced from the Office of Statistics in the Taoiseach's Department, or by the tenor of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech this evening.  Any housewife who reads the newspapers to-morrow morning, or who is given the gist of what the Parliamentary Secretary had to say here this evening, will naturally reply: &ldquo;If I got the chance of going to Leinster House I would tell him with good effect how much the cost of living has increased.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary quoted, for example, that bacon cost 2/6 per lb. in England, while the cost here was 2/0½ per lb.  It is only fair to him to say that he said the 2/0½ per lb. was for the average cut.  I do not think any housewife, or anybody who has occasion to buy bacon or who knows anything about the sale or purchase of bacon, will agree with the Parliamentary Secretary's contention.  He also claimed that steak cost 2/6 a lb. in England, and that the cost here is 1/9 per lb.  I think that there again he said that was the average price.  I do not buy steak normally, but I do buy it in its cooked form in restaurants here and there.  If my steak costs the restaurant or hotel proprietor only 1/9 per lb.  I suggest to the Prices Commission it is one of the things which they should give a high priority to in their programme for investigations.  If the steak which they serve to me costs them only 1/9 per lb.  I know that by <Col N="1336" /> the time I get the bill from the waitress the total is 5/- or 6/-.  Therefore, there is something for the new Prices Commission to investigate there.</P>

      <P>I may have a cup of tea with it.  There is another commodity, the price of which is causing great concern to the consuming public.  I refer to wool.  I admit this is a commodity in which world shortages and world prices must have a serious effect on this country.  Nevertheless, it must be remembered that we produce a fairly substantial quantity of wool ourselves, possibly not as much as we require for our own needs.  I would say that, if all the wool produced here was kept here, the enormous increase in the price of woollen goods, and the unfortunate position that has arisen in regard to the amount of labour employed in producing woollen goods, would not be as serious as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the present time, 200 workers in the Blarney woollen mills have lost their employment as a result of wool shortages.  I will readily admit that all the wool used in the Blarney and Midleton mills, and in other mills throughout the country where there is a good deal of unemployment at the moment, is not home-produced wool. Nevertheless, they use as much native wool as they can get.  I think it is a severe indictment of the Government that, when wool prices were soaring abroad, they deliberately permitted wool to be freely exported.  It is understandable, I suppose, that they should have allowed large quantities of wool to be exported during the recent local elections.  I submit that it was the Government's responsibility then, instead of currying favour with the farmers by claiming credit for the enhanced prices which obtained for wool, to have foreseen the inevitable consequences of a wool shortage in this country. I can certainly say that the 200 odd workers who have been dismissed in the Blarney mills will not readily acquit the Government of the responsibility in the matter.  These 200 <Col N="1337" /> workers were employed in what is known as the preparatory process. Their employment was terminated only comparatively recently, but sooner or later, indeed I am sure very soon, their dismissals will be reflected along the line, from the preparatory stage right up to the stage when the finished article is produced.  If there is not sufficient wool prepared for use in the later stages of production, the employees engaged in the final stages of production are bound to be affected.</P>
    <P>I think that the Government have a serious responsibility in this respect. They freely permitted the export of this wool which would have kept Irish workers in employment over the winter months.  It is understandable that the farmers, the producers of the wool, would expect to get as good a price for it as the farmers in England were getting, but, to quote the Parliamentary Secretary, it is the duty of the Government and of the Department of Industry and Commerce, to preserve a fairly level economic balance between all sections of the community.  In this respect they failed miserably.  Unless something is done for those workers in the way of conserving whatever little wool remains in the country at present, I am afraid that unemployment amongst them will spread to a considerable extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass referred to the unnecessary bread rationing which is being maintained at present.  Not only is it being maintained, but, as a result of announcements made by the Government, I understand it is being more rigidly enforced from now on.  One can understand that if there is a rationing system you might as well abolish it as not enforce it.  There is, however, one significant change in the system which threatens the employment of a large section of workers, particularly rural workers.  I refer to the change in the rationing of wheaten meal flour.  When rationing was introduced in 1946 or 1947 there was only one bread and flour coupon.  With that the purchaser could go to his baker and get either white bread or wheaten meal bread, white flour or wheaten meal flour.  As a result of representations made by the <Col N="1338" /> wheaten meal millers, a concession was given by providing a separate coupon in respect of wheaten meal flour and I am sure it was given after due consideration by the Department.  Having some knowledge of the case made, I agree it was given in the best interests of the economy of the country.</P>
    <P>In October a new and more severe system of enforcing bread rationing was announced, and the special coupon for wheaten meal flour was abolished.  As a result of this wheaten meal millers anticipate that they will be put out of business in a very short time.  There is at present some scare, possibly not without justification, that bread will be short this coming winter.  Consumers knowing this will naturally lodge their coupons with the biggest concerns they can find in order to ensure that they will get some type of bread.  The bigger millers are permitted to mill wheaten meal flour as well as 75 per cent. extraction flour, but they do it only as a side line, whereas wheaten meal millers depend for their livelihood on it.</P>
    <P>If the public are driven to lodging all their coupons with the larger concerns, the production of wheaten meal will eventually practically cease. The wheaten meal millers made representations to the responsible Department on their own behalf and on behalf of their employees to ensure that there would be a continuance of the special coupon for wheaten meal flour, but apparently it has had no effect so far. I understand the excuse given to them was that, since the system was in operation, it would only cause confusion to change it.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that it is going to cause ten times the confusion if it is not changed, because the wheaten meal millers, who were supposed to find alternative means of livelihood out of foodstuffs when the subsidy on wheaten meal was threatened, find now that there is no such alternative livelihood and if some special provision which will ensure the consuming public of getting supplies of wheaten meal specifically is not made, the wheaten meal millers will have to go out of business and there will be widespread unemployment amongst our rural population, because <Col N="1339" /> wheaten meal mills are usually situated in rural areas.</P>
    <P>When this question of wheaten meal first came up the threat was that the wheaten meal subsidy was going to be withdrawn and that wheaten meal flour would have to compete with the 75 per cent. extraction flour at its economic price, thus giving the 75 per cent. extraction flour the benefit of the full subsidy, a competition which was hopelessly one-sided from the start and in which the wheaten meal flour was going to come out second best.  As a result of various representations made by the wheaten meal millers and the case made by myself and Deputies on the other side of the House in the Dáil, and possibly from genuine conviction in the Department itself that the Department was wrong in envisaging the abolition of the subsidy, the subsidy was maintained.</P>
    <P>I was prepared to give credit to the Minister responsible, the Minister for Agriculture, that he saw that his proposals were wrong then and that he genuinely dropped the idea of abolishing this wheaten meal subsidy.  But I think this is a very left-handed way of making his point by throwing the wheaten meal flour production into such a state that it is bound to fail under this new rationing system.  It would have been honest of the Minister to admit openly that he was wrong in contemplating abolishing the wheaten meal subsidy and he would have been admired for it.  But this underhand method of gaining his point when he saw his arguments could no longer hold water in regard to his original attempt to abolish the subsidy, if it is persisted in, will result in the production of wheaten meal ceasing, put the mills out of business and cause widespread unemployment throughout the rural community.</P>
    <P>I might say that not one worker in my constituency will be affected.  I am talking in the interests of one mill outside my constituency and, generally, in the interests of wheaten meal millers and, what we always subscribe to but seldom put into operation, maintaining people on the land in reasonable comfort and, if possible, in industrial employment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1340" /> There is one other matter I should like to refer to.  Strangely enough, there are throughout the country honest traders who try to give foodstuffs, wearing apparel and other things to the people at a reasonable profit to themselves.  The producers and the manufacturers, however, from time to time insist that these articles should be sold at their prices and not at the price that the trader wants to sell them at and at which he estimates he will make a reasonable profit.  I have one case in point where a trader bought from a manufacturer a fairly large quantity of a certain article which he had on hands for a period. He was selling it off at a reasonable rate of disposal and at a reasonable profit.  In the meantime, the cost of production of this article went up and retailers were circularised to the effect that from then on the retail price of this article would be a certain amount, which was an advance of about 20 per cent. on the original amount.  The trader concerned replied to the manufacturers that he had a certain quantity of these articles on hands and that he proposed to sell them at the old rate of profit and the old retail price.  He was promptly warned by the manufacturers that unless he sold these articles at the current retail prices they would cease to supply him with any of these articles in future.  I think that is another instance of which the Department and this new commission should take note.</P>
    <P>I believe it is happening in several instances that traders who are happy and delighted at the prospect of getting a reasonable profit out of an article are told by their suppliers, be they wholesalers or manufacturers, that unless they sell these articles at their price they will not give them any further supplies of these particular articles.  That is a case in which the honest trader who is trying to do decently by the public is prevented from doing so.  I am sure that if the Department, the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary looked further afield they would find several instances of such underhand methods.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech <Col N="1341" /> to which I should like to refer, that is, his claim that in October, 1948, real earnings had at last come hip to hip with the cost of living.  If that is the case, the cost of living has since then easily outstripped real earnings.  Goodness knows, earnings are fairly high at present in most occupations.  That only goes to show the utter failure of the Government to cope with the rise in prices and consequently with the lowering of the standard of living.  Unless, as Deputy Lemass suggested, they face this problem honestly, and not unashamedly maintain before the public in Dáil Eireann, in answer to various parliamentary questions, and in speeches outside the House, that they have kept the cost of living down to the same level as when they came into office, I am afraid that particular bubble will burst sooner than most people expect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>The cool audacity which characterises Deputy Lemass's utterances in this House amazes one.  In the course of his speech to-day he said that it was preposterous to suggest that there has been no increase in the cost of living.  Deputy Lynch, in his innocence, blindly followed his leader. He not only refers to the rise in the cost of living but also to what the index reflects, and questions the accuracy of the statistics which the Department have supplied in that regard.  I wonder does he ever pause to realise for a moment that Deputy Lemass is not merely a Deputy, but an ex-Minister, the former Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in the happy position of not having to carry his sins of omission or commission on my soul and I am free, therefore, to deal with the number of articles which enter into the calculation of the cost of living index.  But is it not a remarkable thing that the index we are discussing is the one which was put into operation by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce?  The particulars upon which it is based are those which he authorised as Minister and to which his Government gave sanction.  The number of articles that are taken into account in formulating the index, the method of weighting <Col N="1342" /> them, the method of eliciting prices and the machinery that gives us the final index figure, are all based upon, and had their original source in, the decisions of Deputy Lemass and his Government when they were in office.</P>
    <P>One is quite entitled to reject the index as a guide.  A great many people do, but may I ask whether the person responsible for giving us that index in its present form are entitled to reject it.  Regardless of what the index shows to-day, the ordinary man in the street, with all his lack of knowledge, his lack of access to the official information available to Ministers and Deputies and his background of inexperience, may feel somewhat doubtful in taking the index as his guide but is the former Minister and the present Deputy in that position?  I do not mind in the least and I do not think anybody else does, if Deputy Lemass to-day rejects his own index and rejects the principles upon which the index has been formulated.  Alternatively, is it correct to say that the index was properly formulated and that the principles were properly applied then but that it is being dishonestly calculated to-day?  There have been suggestions made outside the House by critics of the index in which they base their criticism either on the principles governing the index or suggest that it was being manipulated for official purposes.  What line does Deputy Lemass take?  Is the index satisfactory in principle and dishonest in practice or is it honest in practice and unsatisfactory in principle?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the same question should be addressed, not merely to Deputy Lemass, because he was the former Minister, but also to every member of Fianna Fáil because it was their Government acting with their authority that introduced this index in 1947.  At a time when the question of the cost of living was a burning topic and more and more use was being made of available statistics by organisations to argue their case, there was this deliberate change in the system of calculating the index.  It was challenged at the time and criticised, and we were told that it was a temporary expedient and that it would be replaced by a more satisfactory one <Col N="1343" /> later.  Whatever its limitations were &mdash; and everybody recognises that an index that includes only some 60 per cent. of the items in the former index must have certain limitations&mdash;it was presented to us by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce as a reasonably accurate and dependable guide and we were told that the principles on which the index would be formulated would be honestly and accurately employed by the responsible officials.  As I say, a member of the ordinary public might be quite entitled either from lack of understanding or from pure cussedness or exasperation to say that he is sick and tired listening to the index being held up to him as a guide as to how the cost of living is moving up or down, but for the former Minister who introduced this index as a guide, and for the members of his Party who gave him authority to introduce that index and stood over it from time to time when they were in office, to come along now and suggest that no matter what the index shows, it is altogether preposterous, as Deputy Lemass says, to suggest that there has been no increase in the cost of living, is carrying audacity a little too far.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch was even more innocent. In the course of his reference to the question of price control he dealt with the recent increase in the price of whiskey.  He was amazed to find that an increase of a penny in the cost of production turned out to be twopence when the glass was served over the counter.  He suggested that something should be done about it. He thought it outrageous that because the cost of producing a given quantity of a particular product increased by a certain figure the middlemen were entitled to more money although they were handling the same quantity.  Deputy Lynch very conveniently forgets that shortly before that Deputy Lemass pointed out that the present system of price control, the machinery and the principles upon which it is operated, are the same exactly as they were in 1947.  The principles, the machinery and the method of application are those laid down by Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> Everybody knows that one of the difficulties in regard to price control is the question of the middlemen.  Everybody recalls that, when Deputy Lemass introduced his control of clothing prices, within a period of about six months he had to readjust the profit margins that he was allowing at that time to the middlemen because nobody can keep up with the middlemen, they are like rats running in and out of holes.</P>
    <P>Whatever is the defect to-day in dealing with the middlemen, whether it be in relation to the type of case mentioned by Deputy Lynch or the other case mentioned by Deputy Collins, the weakness in the price control machinery, whatever weakness it is, is what has been inherited from the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass says that, so far as power to control prices is concerned, this Government&mdash;and presumably the same applied to the previous Government &mdash;have to-day powers so drastic that thoughtful men are doubtful whether a government should hold those powers except in situations of actual emergency, and whether they should be permitted to operate them under ordinary peaceful conditions. These are the powers which were available and of which Deputy Lemass has had experience over the period from 1939 to 1948.</P>
    <P>He goes on to state, and again emphasises, that we are to-day dealing with the same machinery as the 1947 machinery.  Finally, he puts his finger on the kernel; he says that, despite these drastic powers, so drastic that it is questionable whether a Government should be allowed to operate them except in periods of extreme emergency, despite the fact that the machinery and at least the officers operating the machinery, whatever ministerial changes may have taken place, are the same as in 1947, the public have no confidence in the machinery.</P>
    <P>It is amazing how Deputy Lemass, in 1950, suddenly wakes up to something that for ten years has been told to him inside and outside this House by the members of the Labour Party, that never since 1939 has there been <Col N="1345" /> confidence by the masses of the public in the machinery for controlling prices, either under Deputy Lemass or, with all due respect, under the present Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary. That is not raising the question as to the sincerity or the desire of the holder of ministerial office now or before 1948 to operate that machinery.</P>
    <P>The ordinary people of this country have had a sad and bitter experience. When this present period of emergency broke out in 1939, there was a suggestion made at that time that power should be taken and applied immediately to effect control of all commodities so that if there were upward movements they would be controlled and subject to direction by the Government and its representative bodies. When finally that advice was taken, it was already too late and the control started to operate at the top of the pyramid.  Month after month, year after year, the man with family responsibilities has found overnight increases of 2d. or 3d. in the cost of articles.  He did not know why.  He did not understand it.  All he saw was the result.  He was assured by the Government, whether it was the previous Government or this Government, that the increase was necessary and justified, that it had been carefully checked by the responsible Department exercising price control and that he could rest assured that that increase would not have been permitted if there had been any way to prevent it.  But the increase went on and after a while he noticed that those who were selling the commodities which seemed to be subject to automatic, inevitable increase, almost by the act of God, were the only gentlemen in this country who were always able to meet the increased price and still put a little bit away.  Is it any wonder that, whether it be under Fianna Fáil or under an interParty Government, so long as we have this type of price control machinery, we should get a statement made to-night by a former Minister, by a Deputy of this House, that the public have no confidence in this machinery that has been operating for ten years? Of course, it has no confidence.  Why should it have confidence?  Why should anybody have confidence in something <Col N="1346" /> that he knows nothing about, that operates behind the closed doors of the Department?  Without in any way casting any reflection on the sincerity, the honesty and the hard work of the responsible officials, nobody knows exactly how it evolves, how it works or what the reasons are that bring forth the results.</P>
    <P>It has been said on many occasions that an ordinary worker who wants an increase of wages has not merely to go before his employer and have the secrets of his household and private life, if necessary, exposed to examination and cross-examination, but may also have to go into a public court and submit himself and his private life to that type of examination and, after waiting weeks or months, he may be told that he is entitled to an increase in his wages.</P>

      <P>But the gentleman who owns a particular type of factory in this country, whose factory only exists because the ordinary consumer here is prepared to pay twopence, 6d., 1/-, or 5/- more than the price at which he can buy that produce from outside sources, whose factory is dependent for its existence on the goodwill and the readiness to sacrifice of the ordinary consumer, can go to a Government Department in privacy and confidence with an assurance that nobody will know anything about his secrets, his business methods or his book-keeping, except a very small limited number of officials who are pledged to secrecy. He can make his case there for an increase in price and, if within the principles and methods laid down, he can carry conviction, he can get the authority to make the increase.  The unfortunates who are about to pay that increase and who have been maintaining that gentleman in a life of ease and affluence have just got to sit back and believe what somebody tells them as to why this gentleman, who has already got far more money put away than they will ever earn, will get a little more out of their meagre means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised that our people put up with this imposition for the past ten years.  I often wonder how it is <Col N="1347" /> that even to-day they remain so patently quiet and patient.  I am glad that at last there has been a realisation that if price control is to be maintained &mdash;and there seems to be no doubt about that&mdash;these ordinary consumers should have some opportunity of knowing how it operates, knowing the arguments made for an increase in price, and that they should have some access to the manner in which the machinery is operated and is being applied.</P>
    <P>I say without fear of contradiction that, despite Deputy Lemass's reminder of our election promises, so far as policy on the question of the control of prices and the cost of living is concerned no Party here has the record the Labour Party has.  Whatever may have been our differences we have tried to maintain a certain consistency in our approach to this matter.  It is not to-day that the Labour Party has demanded that price control should operate in public.  It is not to-day that the Labour Party has pointed out &mdash;it pointed it out to the present and to the last Government&mdash;the very quality that has been lacking in our price control machinery, on which Deputy Lemass put his finger.  I refer to that lack of public confidence, that lack of conviction and of assurance in our whole system of price control.</P>
    <P>It is not to-day the Labour Party has said it is purely a matter of equity that if an ordinary worker who seeks an improvement in his income has had to make his case before an advisory tribunal appointed by the previous Government under the Control of Wages Act, or before the Labour Court to-day, it is only just that the manufacturer, the wholesaler or the retailer who is making a living out of our system of protective tariffs and out of the willingness of Irish consumers should also be obliged to make his case for an improved income in the same open way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass reminded the Labour Party and others of some statements that were made in 1948.  We should be reminded of them, and not only by Deputy Lemass, and we should be honest enough to admit where we have not been able to measure up to our <Col N="1348" /> promises.  So far as the members of the Labour Party are concerned, we made statements in 1947 and 1948 that we believed the cost of living and prices could be reduced.  We still stand over that and we still believe that if, instead of operating the Fianna Fáil price control and Fianna Fáil prices for the past two years we operated on our own principles and got some recognition of the difficulties we are now facing, then possibly the Parliamentary Secretary, instead of having to argue that the Government have maintained the cost of living on a level basis for two years, might have been able to take the credit of saying that there was a break in the price level.</P>
    <P>It is never too late to come to the repentance stool and the fact that we are trying to face the situation to-night will be welcomed, not by the members of political Parties but by the people, the men who maintain families and the women who have to carry on family life.  It is about time we gave some little thought to them and that we attempted to deal with this problem as a human problem and not as a question of figures and principles.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the general position since 1948. Speaking, not merely as a member of a Party associated with the Government but as a trade unionist, I would be ungrateful if I did not appreciate what has been done and what is being attempted.  I suggest it is well not to forget this, that those of us who carry responsibility on behalf of the wageearners can still look back to the month of October, 1947, when we were told by the leader of Fianna Fáil, the then Taoiseach, that either we found ways and means by agreement with employers of limiting our wage increase or the Government would take power to do it for us.  We already had experience of what happened when we did it before.</P>
    <P>When, in the ordinary course of debate, it was asked if there was going to be control imposed either voluntarily or by law on the wages of the mass of wage earners in this country who had already put up with seven years of wage control and galloping prices, and the Government were asked if, even at the eleventh hour, <Col N="1349" /> they would give an undertaking that, even if it were impossible to prevent the cost of living going higher, they would give an undertaking to see that the wage earners would receive some compensation to meet a rise in the cost of living, the Taoiseach of that day said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;.  He also said there would be no commitments, and &ldquo;We will not bind ourselves in any way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We still remember that, and we are appreciative of the fact that when there was a change we were able to come in and voluntarily, without any threat of statutory action, and by the ordinary recognised and established methods between worker and employer, make our adjustment in wages.  We enjoyed them at least for the major part of two years without having seen them wiped out by further increases in prices, as happened in 1947 when, under Fianna Fáil, we got increases and within nine months the cost of living went up by 24 points. We were then worse off than when we started.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to come in and criticise and to remind us of election promises.  I suppose if we asked Fianna Fáil what could be done in the present position, what is the remedy, we would be told that they should be let back.  Suppose we said: &ldquo;You are right; all the Parties in the Government have failed to keep their promises; they have not been able to reduce the cost of living and satisfy the people, and what is your solution?&rdquo; we would be told: &ldquo;Get out and let us back.&rdquo;  That, from their point of view, is the only solution, to allow back into office the same group who held office for the seven years of the emergency, and let them develop their system of price control.  They laid down the principle and they saw it operating, but I say that during those years they almost wore out the long-standing patience of the masses of the Irish people.  With that experience in our minds we are obliged to listen to the dishonest kind of statement we got to-night by an ex-Minister who was blatantly criticising and attacking the very index figure that he formulated, the very figure that is being <Col N="1350" /> operated by the same officials who operated under him.</P>
    <P>I feel that in his introductory speech the Parliamentary Secretary was too anxious to try to show us the bright spots.  I think we must be realistic and face the situation as it is to-day. It is correct that up to the early part of this year there was a relative stability of prices and of the cost of living.  Workers and salary earners had made a positive gain in the sense that they had secured adjustments in their incomes and there had been no corresponding rise in prices.  But I do not think it is correct to say that the change has only taken place since August of this year because there had already been changes in prices, not only in commodities but also in services, as early as the spring of the year.  Anyone who was following the general development both here and abroad realised quite well that following devaluation in October of last year, irrespective of whether the effect would be instantaneous or delayed, it would be felt eventually in this country.  The only thing in which we were fortunate was that we actually had a delayed effect.  Possibly we are also unfortunate at the same time in that the delayed effect of devaluation has come now alongside of the general worsening of the international situation because of the Korean conflict, the growth of armaments and the general war preparations taking place in a number of countries; and that latter effect is reacting upon the former.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, it was quite clear that whatever the position was the effect of devaluation would eventually be felt here.  My criticism is that as early as October of last year there were men and women and organisations here that realised what would happen and sought consultation with the Government so that preparations might be made in advance to meet whatever developments would take place and to ensure that we would not make the same mistake as was made in 1939 of waiting until we were overwhelmed in the vortex of the famous spiral&mdash;the spiral of prices ever going up and wages trying to catch them.  Unfortunately our suggestions for consultation were <Col N="1351" /> not acted upon quickly enough and it is only now in the autumn of 1950 that we are trying to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I feel that the Government and the Parliamentary Secretary ought to be congratulated on the most significant change suggested in the Bill now be fore the House.  I refer to the setting up of a tribunal.  Deputy Lemass describes this as another anonymous committee for the purpose of buying off the Labour Party.  Sometimes, listening to Deputy Lemass, I become very confused as to who is buying off whom.  I do not know where I am. One time it is Fine Gael buying off the Labour Party; another time it is Labour buying off Fine Gael; another time it is the Farmers buying off Clann na Poblachta.  The whole trouble is that Deputy Lemass and Fianna Fáil are not able to buy off anyone.  That is what is worrying them.</P>
    <P>Whether it is a committee or a tribunal is not the important fact at the moment.  The important fact, and we want to be clear on this, is that certain powers have been sought in the Bill to establish an advisory tribunal. It will be accepted that the final decision must lie with the Minister and the Government.  But we do not want to make the mistake again of having a tribunal or a committee which is not representative of the people it is serving. It cannot very well be anonymous since it must be composed of men and women who are known and who have got certain reputations.  I am not now thinking of political figures or members of political organisations.  If there is to be a consumers' representative, then that representative must be a consumers' representative.  In my opinion, that means an ordinary housewife who goes out every week and spends her money under present-day difficulties.  If there is to be a workers' or a trade union representative, that does not necessarily mean an official; it must be someone who knows the run of his own industry and a little bit about his employer.  In other words, we do not want people, who, because they possibly, like myself, think they know a little about figures and economics, are more easily fooled than the man-in-the-street. <Col N="1352" /> It will be far better to have people on this body who lack, perhaps, economic knowledge and an understanding of industry, but who have the persistence and the determination to keep on asking: &ldquo;Why?  Why?  Why?&rdquo; and who will not stop asking &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; so long as they are not satisfied that they have received a satisfactory answer which will enable the ordinary man-in-the-street to understand why there has to be an increase in the price of a particular commodity.</P>
    <P>Even if we have the right type of people on the tribunal, it still must operate in the full glare of publicity. We have reached a stage where it is no longer possible to carry the slightest conviction to any section of the community, whether they be wage earners, salary earners, employers or manufacturers, and we have passed the stage where there can any longer be any confidence in machinery unless it operates in public.  The Parliamentary Secretary has suggested that certain of this body's activities must be heard in private.  I am not altogether convinced that that is correct.  I do not know why any manufacturer should feel that his ordinary accounts and costings are of so valuable and so secret a nature that, if they become known to another manufacturer in the same street, he will be put out of business within 24 hours.  We are not dealing here with patents or special manufacturing rights.  We are dealing with ordinary accountancy and the compilation of costs and there can be no great advantage to me, as a manufacturer, in knowing that my costs, my rent, or some other form of overhead represents such a percentage of my total costs and that that percentage is either above or below that of my fellowmanufacturer down the street.  I cannot gain any advantage from that knowledge unless I can bring my costs down below his costs.  If the publication of accounts and costs will help to make manufacturers use them as a means of coming lower and lower, it will be all the better.</P>
    <P>I think the general activities of the tribunal should take place in public and I think it should be made clear that if any individual or organisation comes before that body seeking an increase <Col N="1353" /> in prices and wants their case to be heard in private, the onus will be put upon them of proving the necessity for such a private hearing and the onus will have to be exceptionally heavy and difficult to discharge.  Not only that, but if for any reason there has been such a private hearing I do not think it is sufficient to permit such private proceedings to be carried on between the members of the tribunal even with the expert advisers they will have available to them from the Department. I think that associated with those private hearings there should be some expert cost consultant available for the purpose of applying his knowledge for the benefit of outside interests. That should be a body enjoying the confidence of the organisation outside but certainly available there to give assistance to the members of the tribunal, to examine and cross-examine for the benefit of the public, so that the public will know there is somebody sitting in there checking and rechecking all the information coming before the tribunal, somebody other than and in addition to the members of the tribunal and the officials of the Department.  We must remember that, even when we establish a tribunal like that and even when we have representatives sitting on it of consumers and workers, and even though they work in full public view, the very fact that at times they have to grant increases in prices will start difficulties for them. Therefore, we have to protect them in every way, so as to ensure that not merely is the public represented through its members on the tribunal but in the proceedings there is complete opportunity to check and recheck all along the line, not merely by the members of the tribunal but by those who are coming forward if necessary to oppose a particular application.</P>
    <P>There is the other factor.  If the tribunal is going to operate and, we hope, at least do part of the work which will be awaiting it, what is to be the position with regard to the principles that will guide the tribunal?  I think that, in regard to our present price control machinery, the fairest criticism to make is not to criticise the honesty or sincerity of the officials <Col N="1354" /> operating it, but to pity them and sympathise with them because they have to operate machinery on the basis of certain principles and within certain limitations, that almost automatically lead to the kind of results that we get from the price control machinery and which are objected to by so many people.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has pointed out to us that there are two main lines of approach to price control. I think it would be much simpler to put it this way.  A manufacturer makes a particular product and charges, say, 4/-.  Then we have to take the wholesaler and on that product we have to guarantee him his couple of shillings, and then the next wholesaler or the sub-agent takes it over and we have to guarantee him something.  Finally, the retailer gets it and he has to get his guarantee.  All this is piled upon an article which originally cost 4/- and by the time the unfortunate consumer gets it, as Deputy Jack Lynch has pointed out, it probably costs 8/-, 10/- or 12/-.  Nothing is added to the value of the article, no additional service is rendered except the simple one of distribution, but somewhere along the line a whole group of middlemen have managed to get in.</P>
    <P>I understand that the cost of distribution in this country in recent years has represented something like 17 to 20 per cent. as an addition to the cost of manufacture.  Therefore, roughly, out of every 25/- we are spending on products, we are paying something in the way of 5/- to a group of gentlemen to hand those articles to us from the manufacturers.  That might have been a very excellent system in the good old days when, as the Parliamentary Secretary said, competition was operating. There is no competition to-day.  There is a cast-iron circle&mdash;it is better than a gold one and it is far better to-day to be a middleman than to be a manufacturer. If the tribunal is to be able to do its job and if our efforts to control prices are to be effective, we must face the problem that this community and this economy cannot afford to pay anything up to 20 per cent. of the cost of articles merely for their distribution. Whether it be machinery and necessary articles for the farm, whether <Col N="1355" /> it be consumer commodities, or whether it be services, the public are entitled to get them at the lowest price consistent with a fair and reasonable return for the necessary labour required to manufacture and distribute them.</P>
    <P>When I think of some of the simplest cases you come across, of a gentleman holding a quota for a very essential article of clothing, to be manufactured into garments for men's wear, and without even a warehouse or an office, merely a little bag by his side to carry a few samples, he can draw 17½ per cent. on every £1 worth of the stuff he sells, then I think we must be living in a madhouse.  The manufacturer giving employment, paying fair wages and giving decent conditions, is solely dependent on that peculiar quota system; and if he is to continue in production and keep his people in employment, he has to go to that middleman, holding the quota with no staff, no premises or anything else except his share in the quota, and pay 17½ per cent. in order to get sufficient cloth to keep his factory working and keep his employees at work.  We are told that if we interfered with that we would interfere with the whole system and fabric of industry and commerce, creating all kinds of difficulties and putting people out of work.  At the moment, the complaint is that we are putting so many people out of work that they have to emigrate.  I think that, for a change, we might try putting the right people out of work and putting the right people into work.  The people who should be sent to work are that big mass, which must be considerable, of ladies and gentlemen who have managed to get in between the bricks and the wall and are battening on the manufacturer, battening on the worker and battening on the consumer, and are doing better than the whole three put together.</P>
    <P>We have also to face the problem and it is a serious problem, established from the trade union point of view, that we are all not only committed to building up Irish industry because we believe in it, but even whether we believe in it or not we are still committed to it, in the sense that we have <Col N="1356" /> gone so far along the road that, even if we wanted, we could not reverse the wheel.  Those of us who do believe in it and believe in the system of building up Irish industry by protection, whether by tariffs or by quotas, have to face the other problem and be honest about it, that very often one of the major problems in dealing with that question of prices is the problem of trying to establish a balanced relationship between prices and the maintenance of employment.</P>
    <P>Again, this is the kind of thing which causes disquietude and lack of confidence among the mass of the people. I believe myself that any body of Irish men and women, if they knew the whole facts, if they had the whole picture presented to them, would in general have no objection to paying even slightly more for a particular product than that for which they could get the imported product, if that product was to be manufactured here and would give employment to Irish labour.  If they do fail to understand that, I do not blame them in the least, when they see increase put upon increase in the price of Irish manufactured articles, being manufactured behind our tariff walls and our quota system, for reasons that they scarcely ever know about or hear about, and certainly do not understand, and when the manufacturers of those articles seem to be in an exceptionally prosperous and wealthy condition.  They do not always understand that that increase is very often the price of keeping men and women in employment.  I think they should be made aware of it and that, just as we have a tribunal here which it is proposed will deal with the question of prices generally, either before that tribunal or in some other way, when the question comes up, particularly of increases in prices of products made behind the protection of a tariff or a quota, it should be possible to bring the whole of that case before the public.  The public should be made aware if on the one hand in order to maintain employment in that industry a case is made for an increase in the price of the product manufactured, and if on the other hand the increase is not to be granted for various good and suitable reasons they should be told <Col N="1357" /> that that may result in unemployment, so that the public may know whether the balance should come down on one side or the other.  Gradually we may be able to build up a public opinion which will take a stand on the basis that we are prepared to pay a higher price for Irish manufactured goods in order to keep Irish workers in employment. If that is too heavy a burden the public would then have to face the alternative of having no Irish industries and if there is no employment for our own people the workers who also form the consuming public will know what the problem is and why that solution is being applied.  It is unfair, however, and it is asking too much of our people, especially after their experiences of the past ten or 15 years to ask them to maintain indefinitely their faith in the need to build up Irish industry in the face&mdash;to put it in a very mild way&mdash;of the abuses we have seen and experienced during past years.</P>
    <P>Finally, as far as this tribunal is concerned there is one important question to which no one has adverted, except Deputy Collins in an indirect way.  If we pass the Bill as it is now before the House, with power to appoint the tribunal and if, as the Parliamentary Secretary indicated, this tribunal is established as quickly as possible, are we going to be satisfied just with doing that?  Are we to sit back and wait for the tribunal to start operating fast, rapidly and effectively, I hope, but nevertheless having to take each application, each case as ordered and having to spend some hours or even days on each case while leaving these gentlemen completely free to add another little bit to prices day after day?  The Parliamentary Secretary was largely following the examination of about mid-August.  I suggested there were increases before that.  I was trying to jot down very roughly some increases which I could call to mind and I have 27 items. They are various commodities, food and clothing, all of which have increased in price and most of them within the last two or three months. I do not think it would be unfair to say that in three months from the date on which the tribunal is established it would not have reviewed all these <Col N="1358" /> prices, but I could well say that within three months there would be such an increase in prices that it would take ten tribunals to catch up on them.</P>
    <P>I therefore suggest that not merely is it a good thing to establish the tribunal but that as an essential and necessary addition if the tribunal is to operate effectively the Government should consider imposing full control, stand still and freezing of all prices and that any subsequent increase in prices should be through the medium of application to the tribunal which must make a recommendation to the Minister. This was suggested ten years ago and was rejected.  I think it would be lamentable if it were again rejected, because experience has proven that when you are dealing with this kind of problem you either grasp the nettle very quickly and firmly and put up with some difficulties and problems which arise because of that, or you fail to grasp it and find that the nettle becomes so big that you are destroyed by it.  That is the situation you are facing to-night.</P>
    <P>It is quite correct to say that in the light of the general situation outside the country we can look forward, however unpleasant it may be, to a continual rise in the prices of our basic raw materials and imports.  Even if the Korean conflict comes to an end to-morrow, as far as American economy is concerned there will be no change.  So long as that American economy is operated on its present basis prices will continue to rise, and small countries like this one which depend on imports for many of their basic raw materials will be squeezed tighter and tighter, not merely with regard to supplies but with regard to prices, and there will be an increasing problem to meet them.</P>
    <P>We are facing that problem and that is the kind of situation which gives a happy hunting ground to all the people who delight in raising prices without justification, without explanation, and with complete indifference to their effect on the mass of consumers or on the economy as a whole.  It will be completely inadequate, completely ineffective, and a complete negation of what we are trying to do here if the Government along with passing this <Col N="1359" /> Bill does not take power immediately to freeze all prices in order to make it possible for the tribunal to carry on with its work.  If that were done I would say that more even than the establishment of the tribunal, more even than the tribunal being representative of the consuming public, more even than a complete revision of the principle of price control, it would inspire the mass of the people with a belief and confidence that something was going to be done to ease their present difficult condition, and the increasingly difficult problems they have to face.  I do not mean to say that the present time in the industrial world is not one of very great effort&mdash;I am not proposing to make a trade union speech&mdash;but I am pointing out that after all the efforts which have been made to try to deal with the situation, wage conditions and prices are not coordinated. Having failed to do that we have a flood-tide of wage claims flowing into the employers.</P>
    <P>It has been said a little earlier that the trade unions would prefer to see prices kept down than the problem solved by their having to look for more wages.  I can assure not merely the House but the people outside that nine out of ten workers would prefer that solution, but they are getting no choice in the matter.  If we had a freezing of prices it would not merely have a steady influence on industrial workers in general and help to bring about some understanding of this problem, but I think it would also restore that confidence which is so much lacking at the moment particularly amongst the industrial workers.  I think it is not possible to find any other solution than that except increased wages and salaries.  A public tribunal operating in public is one proof of our conviction that public confidence is the most important thing in price control. Secondly, in order to ensure that public confidence I think we must show that we are earnest and sincere in this matter by telling the public that until that machinery is operating they will be protected against further increases by a standstill.</P>
    <P>We will be told that putting a standstill <Col N="1360" /> on prices creates many problems, particularly in regard to imports, that there may be a shortage of a particular commodity and we cannot expect an importer to take a gamble on buying that commodity, if he is buying on a rising market, and is going to find himself faced with a standstill on prices. It is always interesting to find how many technical arguments there are for not doing things, but, when we look at the reverse of the medal, the position is quite different.  In the past few months, we had the amazing spectacle in this country of the price of the pound of wool in Australia going up to 18/- and 20/-, and the blanket 12,000 miles away, which never saw an Australian sheep, going up by £2 or £3 the same day.  Wireless telephony has nothing on it.  It is almost like a button being pressed in Medbourne, and, as a blanket is being bought in Dublin, the pounds, shillings and pence being ticked up here.  That has been going on steadily week after week, and everybody knows that, in the first place, many woollen articles, the price of which has been increased, never had any Australian wool in them, and, in the second place, that even the wool that has increased in price will not be available in this country for manufacturing purposes for another two years.  The price, however, has gone up.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we must not have a standstill on prices in order to safeguard the importer, but, when nothing is imported, when the stuff is already in the country, lying under the counters, the prices can go up and there is no protection for the consumer?  I think, and the ordinary man in the street will agree, I am sure, that all these people who have been making and selling things to us in the past ten years have had a good enough time to be able to take a rap now in their turn, and if, in order to deal with prices, we have to have a standstill and a freezing of present prices and if that is going to pinch somewhere, let it pinch those best able to bear it.  Even if it does create problems in regard to employment and the continuation of employment of small sections of workers, I have no doubt that a way can be found of giving support and <Col N="1361" /> sustenance to these workers and these workers whose employment may be affected by such a standstill will be the first to say that it was the proper thing to do and that they stand over it.</P>
    <P>I finish on that plea to the Parliamentary Secretary, that he will take back to the Government the suggestion which has been made, not merely from one side, but which now has general support, that we take our courage in our hands and say that, as from a certain date, all prices are frozen and the machinery to deal with any further price increases is the machinery established by this House.  I think that is the proper way.  This Dáil represents the people of the country&mdash;not the Government&mdash;and if there is from the members of the House an indication, speaking on behalf of the people, that such a course is called for and justified, the Government should say that they have no alternative but to follow that course.  If difficulties are created, let us who are members of Dáil Éireann, and who speak for the people, accept the responsibility, as I have no doubt all of us are prepared to do, if necessary.</P>

      <P>The interesting thing about this Bill is that all it does is to provide for yet another advisory body, as has been pointed out already. For the moment and for the purpose of this debate, I am quite prepared to admit that an outside consultative body may in certain circumstances have a certain value, but all the advisory bodies in the world will not solve a practical problem, unless there is somebody there who is able and willing to make a decision and to do something. We have had the spectacle of a Government who came into office on the high tide of promiscuous promises in all <Col N="1362" /> directions and who, on achieving power, set up a multitude of advisory bodies, but who to-day can only show, after almost three years, just a drift wherever the tide of the time took them.</P>
      <P>They talked about emigration and there was an Emigration Commission but there has been no action.  They talked about rents and now at this late hour we have a Rents Tribunal, but, as yet, no action.  They talked about industrial development.  An Industrial Development Authority has been set up but we have very little evidence of action and while time is running out, in regard to certain fundamental aspects, the development of a basic industry in relation to chemicals and fertilisers which we were promised and put off with almost a year ago, nothing has happened.  So, too, it is with prices.  Whereas the cost of living was to come down, we find ourselves to-day with nothing happening but a Bill giving us yet another advisory committee.  One may very well ask Deputy Larkin, amongst others, what is going to happen.  Let me read the Bill which is very short.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me read it, to call the bluff.  Section 1 simply refers to the Principal Act.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 merely continues the Principal Act and sub-section (2) enables the Government to declare the expiry date.  In so far as there is anything new or operative in this Bill, we have it in Section 3, which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Minister may from time to time by Order provide for the establishment and constitution of bodies of persons to advise him in relation to all or any of the powers conferred on or delegated to him by virtue of the Principal Act and any such Order may contain such ancillary and supplementary provisions as the Minister thinks proper.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That gives power to a Minister to set up another body.  There is not a line in the Bill as to what the force of that body's report will be and not a line empowering the Minister to take any <Col N="1363" /> action, beyond whatever powers he has at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any section dealing with filibustering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 deals merely with the repeal of the temporary Continuation Act of 1949 and Section 5 is the Short Title and Construction. I think I am entitled, as other Deputies are entitled, to ask, in face of a problem which one must admit has developed&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary has admitted that it has developed; I note that he used the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; and perhaps he would go further than many Deputies in his description of the present situation &mdash;what is going to be done, if anything?</P>
      <P>The mere setting up of an advisory body does not solve any problem and does not get anything done.  It does not, in fact, speed the work, because every body you set up, whatever the case or counter-case with regard to it, every independent or separate body through which a problem has to flow represents, of necessity, a certain amount of time spent in the flowing of the problem to the point at which a decision must be taken.  At present there is the Department.  If the Minister and his colleagues are serious about it, when a problem arises, they have all the elements within the Department for marshalling the information available, and they have their contacts, political and otherwise, through their supporting Deputies and through all the organs of information at their disposal to get an all-round picture sufficiently clear to make a decision.  If they are in earnest, the machinery, so far as getting information is concerned, is already available to them.  The introduction of any semi-judicial body or advisory body to advise on it must, of necessity, mean a certain consumption of time.  I do not use the word &ldquo;loss&rdquo; because there may be a case in certain circumstances for such a body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I am making here now is that no powers are given to the Minister to do anything under the Bill, and there is no statement or promise that <Col N="1364" /> anything positive will be done under the Bill.  We have merely the machinery for setting up yet another advisory committee, in the operation of which there will inevitably be a certain consumption of time.  As far as we here are concerned, there is nothing to show that that consumption of time in facing these problems will be compensated for in any way by a more speedy attack at any other point.  I think that is a fair and objective criticism of what is proposed here.</P>
    <P>I, in company with others, was somewhat disappointed in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening statement here to-day.  Many of us thought that the Government proposed to do something positive, and, naturally, we were interested to know what the line of attack would be.  We thought from statements made by the Taoiseach and the intense vocal activity of some Government supporters in this House in regard to certain things, that probably the Government was about to tell us that it was going to do something in contradistinction to setting up another body which would tell us what it might do.  We were very disappointed to find that, in the whole time consumed by the Parliamentary Secretary in opening this matter to the House to-day, he was more concerned with the presentation of what he thought to be a case in justification of the Government's record over the past three years than he was in making any reference to a problem which is growing to-day, and which will probably mount to proportions, if it has not already mounted to proportions, which will demand its being faced.  Now in such circumstances it is difficult to understand why the Parliamentary Secretary took the approach that he did.  In that he did take that approach and did make certain statements, it is my intention to follow him a little closely on the ground which he covered in order that certain suggestions of his may be weighed in the light of all the evidence, and not merely the partial evidence, which he adduced himself.</P>
    <P>But apart from that I think it would be a very good thing, soberly and objectively, <Col N="1365" /> to see what the problem is. We can very well do that by going back a little and seeing how the problem mounted.  In doing so I am tempted to make certain comparisons. I am tempted to think that when similar problems arose under other Governments in the past these problems were faced and decisions were taken, whether they were unpopular or not, but at least the Governments discharged their responsibility to the people by assessing these problems and by having the energy and the courage to make a decision.  One is tempted to feel, perhaps, that the weakness I speak of is inherent in all Coalition Governments and is not a phenomenon which is unique to the one that we have in this country.  Yet one is tempted to study the evidence objectively, and to come to the conclusion that the power of decision is wanting in this Government, wanting in a Government in this country at a time when forces in the world and conditions here are drifting when serious control of the helm is necessary, when some display of character and positive thought and direction are necessary rather than acquiescence in the drift of the times.</P>

      <P>You want people who know their own minds.  Has the Deputy ever heard the story of the man and the ass?  Well, a moral might be drawn from it in this instance. However, the trouble is that one of the weaknesses of coalitions is an inability to make up their minds to face the problems, the tendency to try and please everybody which is impossible. That is the story of the old man and the as, and the Deputy knows that he lost both his wife and the ass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let us take what the Parliamentary Secretary said.  As I have said, we were disappointed that he should take such a line.  The problem is too serious merely to approach it on the basis of saying: &ldquo;We were justified in the past&rdquo;, or on the basis of scoring what you might call political debating points over somebody else. For that very serious reason alone, I was tempted not to go back over what the Parliamentary Secretary said.  I <Col N="1366" /> would not go back on it except for this, that there is a very useful lesson flowing from these facts.  I was about to say, when Deputy Davin attempted to put me off, that at least when the previous Government was faced with the problems it had to face in 1947, it had the courage to make a decision and did get the results.</P>

      <P>We did, but with honour.  As a supporter of that Government, I shall feel proud every day that I am in public life that at least we did our duty.  Now, let me come back and look at this problem.  During the time that the Parliamentary Secretary was speaking I took a number of notes.  To use his own words, he &ldquo;reiterated the fact that despite the changes in prices we have kept the cost-of-living index stable with no alteration in the standard of living&rdquo;. I am going to take now the records in the <i>Trade Journal.</i>  Perhaps I had better explain that there are two methods of approach when considering this.  One is what one may call the official approach.  That would be on the official index figures.  There is another method of approach which the man in the street may more easily understand, and that is the day to day announcements of price increases.  I propose to deal with both.  It may be no harm if these things are put on record in the House if only for the purpose of reference over three years, and if we are to go on the line the Parliamentary Secretary was talking about.  But before I do that, may I say that this index has come in for a great deal of criticism. It has been criticised by some and to some extent it has been lauded by others.  It has been invoked in his aid by the Parliamentary Secretary, and it has been criticised by others as not representing the real trend.  What are the facts?  This was an index which was struck for an interim period. There is another thing which might easily be forgotten, and it is that there was an Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill which aimed at doing something positive anyway.  It was there ready.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government which the Deputy supports had three years to put something similar or better into operation when they came in. They had that interim cost of living index figure which was meant to be interim.  This Government was very ready to throw away a number of things when they got into office.  They started by throwing turf workers out of employment and by playing around with the tourist board and other things.  The point is that the Government which Deputy Davin supports could equally well have changed the cost of living figure if it suited.  It would be a much more simple job, and would have fewer repercussions on the community, than many of the irresponsible changes, backwards and forwards, which have taken place in the last three years.  Anyway, in regard to that interim figure, there is this to be said, that it does reflect generally a trend; it reflects it in what one may call a smoothing out way as people drawing graphs smooth out a curve or exaggerate one.  It is an index which is smoothed out, the variations in which are not pronounced with regard to what one may call its base.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, if they are carefully studied they will give you an indication. The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that it remains steady.  I say, and I am going to prove it, that all the figures show is that you drifted all the time, that where the drift was favourable you got the benefit of it, but where the drift was adverse you got the adverse effect as well.  The unfortunate thing for the country and for the Government, if you like, certainly for the country, is that under the present unhappy state of affairs in this world the over-all trend of the drift is adverse and the Government have drifted along and done nothing about it.</P>
      <P>I invite the Parliamentary Secretary's close attention to the table on page 176 of the <i>Trade Journal</i> for September, 1950.  What do we find? We have a sequence of figures.  If Deputy Davin wants a little bit of amusement or perhaps instruction he might take down this series of figures, one after the other to see the progressive growth.</P>

      <P>Sometimes it is not a bad rôle to take when you want to get the facts out and to call the bluff: November, 1947, 97; August, 1947, 100 &mdash;action by the Fianna Fáil Government held the rising costs and pegged it in November, 1947, at 97; February, 1948, 99; May, 1948, 100; August, 1948, 99; November, 1948, 99; February, 1949, 99; May, 1949, 99; August, 1949, 100; November, 1949, 100; February, 1950, 100; May, 1950, 102; August, 1950, 100.  Look at these figures for all items.  There is an over-all rise.  In other words, there is a drift.  The same thing is shown in regard to food: 96, 97, 100, 98, 97, 97, 97, 99, 98, 98, 100, 96.  I do not want to read all the figures.  I wonder whether it would be in order to have such a table incorporated in the Official Report.  Clothing is rising progressively.  From 100 in November, 1947, it has risen progressively to 111 in August, 1950.  Deputy Cowan might get these figures.</P>

I think that on that the Parliamentary Secretary can hardly claim that the Government have held anything.  An interesting set of comparisons will arise in taking certain items.  We might start with 1947.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, October or November.  This is the December volume of 1947, page 147.  In that you have a table and as the Deputy should know&mdash;he talked enough about it at the time&mdash;there was a very steep rise in the cost of living and in certain essential items, from February to August, 1947.  A certain problem quickly developed with the taking off of the Standstill Order and other factors and, as I say, some definite action was taken by the Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="1369" /> in that regard.  That is shown in this paper.  It is shown, for instance, that between August, 1947, and November, 1947, in bread there was a decrease of 9.9 per cent.; flour, 26.1; oatmeal, 0.1; potatoes, 7.9; tea, 44.7; sugar, 33.4; very substantial decreases.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to continue to take these figures right through the years. The next set of figures is for March, 1948, page 2 of the corresponding <i>Trade Journal.</i>  Bread and flour continued to be held in February.  There was a slight increase in the price of oatmeal, more than offsetting the decrease in the previous month.  There was a decrease in the price of potatoes and no change in the other items.  We can claim we held the cost of living in these essentials, held them in November, held them in February, and passed you over a stable cost-of-living index as indicated by these.  The next figure is May, 1948, on page 63 of the same journal.  Bread and flour again show no change.  Oatmeal and potatoes are up significantly.  There is a 7.5 increase in oatmeal and 8 per cent. increase in potatoes.  Of course both are to some extent seasonable.  You will see potatoes coming down again in the course of the year.  Oatmeal will noticeably come down for a short period, on account of the Minister for Agriculture's bloomer about oats. Anyway, you have tea with no change. You still have the benefit of the Fianna Fáil Budget.</P>
      <P>Now I am coming to the figure for mid-August, 1948.  Bread was up slightly, flour no change, oatmeal no change, potatoes a seasonal drop and the others no change.  That is what the Parliamentary Secretary is claiming credit for.  Now we come to page 183, to mid-November, 1948. Bread is up again by 0.2 per cent., flour no change, oatmeal is down, potatoes down and the rest no change; in other words, going with the drift.</P>

      <P>In March, 1949, bread is shown to be up, flour no change, oatmeal and potatoes down, tea no change, sugar no change, because, of course, the black market in unrationed sugar and tea does not appear in the index.  That dishonest device was not thought of; it was left to Deputy Davin's supporters exclusively. The next one is mid-May, 1949. According to this index, there is a .5 per cent. decrease in bread, flour no change, a slight decrease in potatoes and oatmeal, tea and sugar no change. The next one is mid-August, 1949: bread no change, flour .1 per cent. down, oatmeal .6 per cent. down, but potatoes are up by 97.1 per cent.  I think that was a bad year for potatoes.

Tea and sugar no change.&rdquo;  The next is mid-February, 1950: &ldquo;bread no change, flour no change, oatmeal is up 18.8 per cent., potatoes are up 2.6 per cent.&rdquo;  Tea and sugar are sidestepped for during this period the blackmarketing of sugar was so successful that it was providing a subsidy for the rationed sugar.  Then we come to mid-May, 1950: &ldquo;bread no change, flour no change, oatmeal up 4 per cent., potatoes up 34 per cent.; tea, sugar no change.&rdquo;  That brings us to the present figure.  All that picture reflects accurately what has been happening over that period.  Before I come to meat and some of these other things that have been dealt with, here is what it means.  Where there have been certain fluctuations in regard to potatoes, for instance, the Government has taken them as they came.  We next come to February last.  The situation <Col N="1371" /> is practically the same but, as I have already pointed out, when ironed out with the index, these figures, as summarised in the table, show an increase in food prices.  Take the question of meat.  Meat is a good example&mdash;bacon is another&mdash;where the Government did nothing but just let things go on without attempting to face up to the problem.  They continued to compare the figures for beef, mutton, bacon and fresh pork with the 1947 figures.</P>

      <P>Pigs heads came down a little for a while.  My purpose in dealing with these figures is simply to show that, within its limits, this index does reveal that the cost of living has gone up, that it has been drifting up.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Cowan in that.  I am coming to something else which will be more to the Deputy's liking.  The point is that the Parliamentary Secretary went to great lengths to deal with the index to-day to prove that the cost of living had not gone up.  I say that, going through the figures, it is clear that the cost of living has been slowly creeping up, that it reveals a reactionary tendency and that if this index is an index of anything, it is an index of the inaction and the inabliity of the Government to face up to this problem.  I am not so dishonest as to suggest that the Government can work miracles.  I know that this is a very difficult problem, that it is not as simple as some Deputies would pretend, but it cannot be dealt with by pretending that the problem is not there, as the Parliamentary Secretary tried to do, or by pretending that here is an effort to find a solution as Deputy Larkin does.  It is a very difficult problem, like all social problems because even if you think you have an ideal solution, there are always some intractable factors to militate against that solution.  That is all the more reason why a Government which is alive to its job should take cognisance of the information provided by its own statistics and should be in <Col N="1372" /> a position to do something to halt this drift, instead of coming here at this late hour merely to present this continuation Bill with the mechanism to set up another advisory body.</P>
      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Cowan has gone out because I have something here that might interest him.  It has been the foolish habit of somebody with whom I am acquainted to post in day by day into a little file-cover cuttings of various items relating to the cost of living in the past few years.  I found it particularly interesting to turn them over from day to day and watch the trend.  Having done so, I find it very hard to understand to-day how an intelligent Deputy like the Parliamentary Secretary can come here and tell us that it is only since August that this problem arose, that everything in the garden was lovely up to August, that something may be happening now but that he does not know quite what, as he has not got the mid-November figure.  I will be excused if I suggest that to make a statement of that kind is to overtax the credulity of Deputies in this House, and I certainly think it is a little bit too much to expect the ordinary housewife in the city to swallow it.</P>
      <P>Another thing occurred to me in going through this file.  Breakfast is a good indicator.  We in this country associate tea, sugar, milk, bread, butter, bacon, eggs, and porridge with the breakfast table.  If we take these items, it is interesting to observe the trend.  I am not going to touch on milk as I know there is a special problem there.  I do not think the farmer is very pleased about the present situation but, as I am not a farmer and do not understand his problem, I shall pass from it.  Tea has become plentiful at black market prices and I know that in this city a lot of it is consumed.  The sugar ration is inadequate and sugar, which is a necessary of life for the breakfast table, is being consumed off the ration at a high price which pays the subsidy.  In other words it is eye-wash to suggest that there is a subsidy on the rationed sugar at all, because as I understand the figures, the profits from the unrationed sugar practically pay the whole subsidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1373" /> If you pay a subsidy on rationed sugar and then sell sugar off the ration at a price which pays the subsidy on the rationed sugar, it boils down to the same thing, and it is all eye-wash to suggest that the rationed sugar is subsidised at all.  Tea and sugar therefore are not bright spots on the breakfast table.  I am nearly afraid to mention bacon and eggs.  Frankly I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary knows what the circumstances really are.  I know that housewives in the city are not able to provide many of these commodities for the breakfast table.  Eggs at 5/6 a dozen are out of the question in many homes.  Oatmeal has gone up and out goes porridge. Even bread has increased in price since the Government came into power.  It <Col N="1374" /> might be a good thing if the Government reflected, at breakfast, that breakfast for many people in the city constitutes a very big problem.  I should be more sympathetic to them in their efforts to deal with this problem if it were not for the dishonest approach and the dishonest talk that supporters of this Government&mdash;the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Davin and others&mdash;indulged in before they secured office.  I move the Adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until Wednesday, 29th November, at 3 p.m.</P>
