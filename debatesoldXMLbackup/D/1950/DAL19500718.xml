      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Defence Council is still in existence and, if so, if he will state the names of its members and whether he proposes to add to their numbers and if he will further state the date of the council's last meeting and the date of its next meeting.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to the Defence Conference and not to the Council of Defence, which is a statutory body set up to assist the Minister for Defence in the administration of the business of his Department.</P>
      <P>The Defence Conference, which consisted of representatives of the different Parties in the Dáil, was set up during the emergency to consult and advise on matters of national defence.  The dissolution of the conference took place in May, 1945, following agreement between the then Taoiseach and the various Parties in the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state how many meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee referred to by him in his reply to the recent debate on the Estimate for his Department have been held in each of the calendar years 1948, 1949 and 1950 (up to July 1st).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in accordance with principle and general practice of governments to refuse to disclose in public even the functions or the composition of Cabinet committees.  This principle is founded upon the collective responsibility of the Government and upon the fact that the internal arrangements which may be made by Ministers for discussion among themselves are essentially a domestic matter and no concern of Parliament or the public.</P>
      <P>In exceptional circumstances and on a particular occasion, I mentioned, during the course of my reply to the debate on the Estimate for my Department on the 14th instant, the fact that a Cabinet committee had been established by the Government in October, 1948, and, in reply to the inquiry addressed to me by the Deputy after the conclusion of the debate on that date, I supplied him, from recollection, with the personnel of the committee. In view of the general principle and practice to which I have referred, I am not prepared to disclose any further details such as those requested by the Deputy in regard to the functioning of this&mdash;or any other&mdash; Cabinet committee.</P>

      <P>The prices used in computing the interim cost-of-living index (essential items) are those returned at each quarterly date from 120 towns and villages.  The weighting pattern of expenditure from which the index number is computed is based on the expenditure of family income on the various items of food, clothing, fuel and light and rent of the whole class of which the head of the family is a non-agricultural employee, whether gainfully occupied or pensioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The value entered for the item &ldquo;Net receipts in respect of tourism, travel, etc.,&rdquo; in the Balance of International Payments statement is the difference between (a) the expenditure of extern passengers in this country and (b) the expenditure of Irish residents abroad.  Up to and including the year 1948 this figure was somewhat conjecturally estimated according to the method explained in the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin</i>, September, 1948, pages 114 <i>et seq</i>.  For 1949, however, the estimate was based on the results of the passenger card inquiry, which yielded a net figure of £28,000,000, the difference between (a) which was estimated at £34,000,000 and (b) which was estimated at £6,000,000.</P>

      <P>During the period January-May, 1950, household coal was imported from Great Britain, Poland, Belgium, Western Germany and the Six Counties.  The c.i.f. prices per ton were:&mdash; Great Britain, £4 10s. 6d.; Poland, £5 0s. 5d.; Belgium, £5 10s. 0d.; Western Germany, £5 6s. 6d.; and the Six Counties, £5 13s. 4d.</P>

      <P>The national average price per hundredweight for household coal, as ascertained in the mid-May, 1950, inquiries for the computation of the quarterly cost-of-living index was 7/1½d.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether the Land Commission are aware of the congestion that exists in the Lewin and other estates in Kilshanvey and Kilconley, County Galway; and, if so, what steps are now being taken to acquire some of the large farms in that area for the relief of the uneconomic holdings in the locality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The question as to the particular lands to be acquired or resumed is a reserved function of the Land Commission and depends on the suitability of the lands for the purposes of the Land Commission and whether they come within the scope of the powers of acquisition or resumption conferred under the Land Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he is just refusing to give information regarding a particular farm when a Deputy asks a question about it?  I have asked the Minister to give particulars regarding a certain farm and the Minister gives me a sort of general reply that it is the Land Commission's business and that I should not poke my nose into it.  He said something tantamount to that.  I think that is a wrong kind of reply to get from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The question the Deputy puts is a rather foolish one. <Col N="2070" /> The first part of it is &ldquo;whether the Land Commission propose to acquire&rdquo;.  The Deputy's memory surely is not so short as not to remember the debate in Committee on Section 12 of the recent Land Bill when he, as well as others on that side of the House, were most particular that the Minister should not assume any of the powers that were previously conferred on the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands whether the Land Commission have as yet acquired the lands at Cloghnanower, Record No. 9934, owned by Mr. Tobias Laffey, Emlaghfad, Ballymote, County Galway; and, if not, if he will state the cause of the delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>A final decision has not yet been reached by the Land Commission Court in regard to the acquisition of these lands.  The case being <i>sub judice</i> it would be inappropriate for me to attempt to answer the second part of the question, as any such attempt might be interpreted as a criticism of the court in the discharge of its functions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands why the Land Commission refused to allocate a parcel of land on Kingston estate, Keadue, County Roscommon, as a playground for the local school, situated about 50 yards from the estate in question, in view of the fact that the Reverend Manager of the school made application for the parcel about five years before the lands were divided, and if he will state whether it is now the policy of the Land Commission to refuse applications for land for use as playgrounds for school children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The application for a site for a playground was fully considered. The school in question is 170 yards from the nearest point on the estate, not 50 yards as stated by the Deputy.  To get from the school to the estate it is necessary to round a blind corner and cross the main Sligo-Cavan road, which is subject to heavy motor traffic.</P>

      <P>On the 18th February last, I received a copy of a resolution passed by the Public Assistance Committee of the Kerry County Council which represented that the financial commitments involved in the provision of water supplies for the rural population were such as made it impossible for either the individuals benefiting or the local authority to cope adequately with the problem, and that the question of the provision of water supplies in rural areas should be dealt with on a national basis and financed out of central funds.  I informed the council of my proposal to introduce, in the financial year 1950-51, a scheme to assist farmers to provide supplies to piped water in their dwelling-houses and, on the 25th May last, the secretary to the council wrote stating that the scheme was to be brought before the council at their next meeting.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy refers to the fish marketing activities of the Irish Sea Fisheries Association. The gross profits, with the net profits shown in parentheses, on wet fish trading for the years 1948 and 1949 were, respectively, £20,988 (£8,093) and £14,785 (£255).  In addition, the association purchased, at prearranged prices, shellfish gathered mainly in Connemara and at Cromane, County Kerry.  On this side of its operations, after making allowance for overheads, etc., the association's trading showed a loss of £2,905 in 1948 and £1,356 in 1949.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Net profit is the difference between the cost of the fish, plus the overheads, to the sea fisheries association and the amount received by the sea fisheries association for that fish when they market it.  My object is to reduce that margin to the lowest possible level, consistent with prudence, so that the fishermen will receive from week to week as near as I can go to the total receipts realised for the fish marketed by the sea fisheries association on their behalf.</P>

      <P>As the reply to the Deputy's question involves a lengthy <Col N="2078" /> list of commodities, I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate the statement with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>DOLLAR ALLOCATIONS, 1949-50.</P>
      <P>Allocations of dollars to importers are made by the issue of exchange control permits which enable the applicants to arrange the appropriate payment to their suppliers if the proposed transaction is implemented. The total amount of dollars so allocated to importers for the purchase of goods originating in the dollar area during the 12 months ended June 30th, 1950, was $90.3 million.  Of this amount allocations to the extent of $52,000,000 were issued under procurement authorisations received from the Economic Co-operation Administration under the E.R.P.  In order to obtain dollar reimbursement from E.C.A. in respect of payments actually made under these allocations it is necessary for my Department to submit individual claims to E.C.A. Washington in respect of each shipment, supported by the shipping documents and certain other vouchers and certificates.  There is thus a time-lag between the payment made for the goods by the importer and the receipt of reimbursement from E.C.A.</P>
      <P>The amount of reimbursement received up to the 15th July, 1950, on foot of the dollar allocations of $52,000,000 made under E.C.A. procurement during the 12 months ended June 30th, 1950, was $40.4 million of which $3,000,000 was paid as grant aid and the remainder as loan aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that excessive prices are being charged by traders for tomatoes and I see no reason to fix a price for home-grown tomatoes.  Variations in the prices of these tomatoes are normal in relation to quality and supply.  A price of 1/4 per lb. has already been fixed for imported tomatoes, and I am satisfied that this is sufficient to keep prices of the home-grown product within reasonable limits.  It would be impracticable to enforce an Order controlling the prices of home-grown tomatoes on the basis of adding a percentage charge to the market price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the retail price of tomatoes varies according to supply and demand, and also according to quality, size, etc., and it is not practicable to fix a retail price for each grade or quality.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently received a request from the Carlow County Council for a ruling in connection with the letting of a cottage at Kilcoltrim. There were five applicants for this cottage and the circumstances of each applicant appeared to entitle him to consideration for a cottage.  The applicant selected provisionally was recommended by the acting county medical officer as the person appearing, in her opinion, to have the greatest degree of urgency of need for alternative accommodation. It is understood that the successful applicant, his wife and seven children&mdash;two of whom are stated to be suffering from tuberculosis&mdash; occupy a converted out house consisting of a kitchen and small room which was reported as unfit, overcrowded, damp and in bad repair.  I do not propose to interfere in the decision of the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is correct to say that the county council are satisfied with the decision of the county manager.  Is it not correct that the council resented it and that the <Col N="2092" /> people in the district resented it?  This house was allocated to a man who had already two rooms, while there was another applicant recommended who had no room at all, whose wife and family were in the county home.  In these circumstances, I think the Minister should alter his decision and interfere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The information supplied to me was that there were five applicants. The one who was allocated the house was as described.  He had a wife and seven children who were living in a converted outhouse comprising a kitchen and a small room. Two of the children are suffering from tuberculosis.  The dwelling was reported by the local medical officer as unfit, overcrowded, damp and in bad repair.  The man was an agricultural labourer.</P>
      <P>The next applicant was an agricultural labourer living with his wife and five children in a one-roomed house reported on by the same local medical officer as being unfit, damp and badly thatched.  The acting county medical officer stated that this applicant also needed a house badly.</P>
      <P>The third applicant was an agricultural worker living with his employer. His wife and three children were in the county home for some time, but are now living with his wife's sister. His need is reported by the local medical officer as 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>The next applicant was an agricultural worker living in one room in his father-in-law's house.  The house is reported on by the same local medical officer as being fit but overcrowded, and the need for a house is also given as 100 per cent.</P>
      <P>Another applicant was also an agricultural worker then living in a house consisting of a kitchen and two small rooms.  There are four in the family.</P>
      <P>These are the circumstances in which the decision had to be made, and I consider that the recommendation of the medical officer is reasonable in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>With regard to the question of extending the loan period, I would point out that the repayment period for loans for housing purposes was extended from 35 to 50 years following the extension of the subsidy period by the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.

Plans are being prepared for a further 160 houses on sites acquired by the council and a compulsory purchase Order for sites to accommodate 51 cottages has also been made, giving a total of 419 cottages in course of erection or being planned.  In addition, the council are examining the possibility of acquiring sites in Glencullen, Rathmichael and Ballybrack.</P>

Twenty-nine of the applicants have been accommodated in the houses completed up to the 31st March last, leaving 570 approximately to be considered. <Col N="2095" /> These applications have not all been fully examined as to eligibility for rehousing and the figure cannot, therefore, be accepted or regarded as a correct index of the housing needs.

      <P>To delete sub-section (4) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sundays and such half-holidays, Church holidays and public holidays as may be allowed to the worker by arrangement with his employer shall not be reckoned as holidays for the purposes of this Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment is for the purpose of removing any ambiguity that might arise and to provide that if an agricultural worker has habitually received certain holidays, these holidays will not now be described as the six statutory holidays which he is to receive under this Bill.</P>

      <P>It seems to me that both this amendment and the sub-section which it proposes to substitute are entirely unnecessary.  Section 3 provides that the agricultural worker shall have an annual holiday consisting of six consecutive working days.

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that there is a need for it in this way.  If an agricultural worker at the present time enjoys a holiday on a bank holiday or on a Church holiday and if the employer proposes to give him his week's holidays in the week in which that very holiday falls, he will not be getting anything beyond five extra days; he will not be getting the six required by this Bill.  Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that he will get his six additional days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (7).</P>
      <P>The sub-section which I propose to delete reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a worker, instead of taking holidays which he is to be allowed under this section, remains at work with his employer's consent, the employer shall be deemed to have allowed the holidays to the worker if he pays him holiday remuneration in respect of them, in addition to wages.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I think this sub-section is liable to vitiate the whole Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide farm labourers with much needed holidays, but in this sub-section there is the danger that a custom may arise whereby, instead of being allowed holidays, the agricultural worker may be paid what is termed holiday money instead.  With the passage of time, there is the further danger that even the payment of holiday money may fall into disuse and stop.  In fact, it is quite certain that advantage will be taken of the sub-section by employers who have not very much scruple in regard to the treatment of their workers; they will take advantage of it to evade their responsibilities.  They will hold out promise of payment in lieu of holidays to the workers and will not pay at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel the Minister should accept this suggestion, that the sub-section weakens the Bill inasmuch as it allows an avenue of escape for unscrupulous <Col N="2102" /> employers and will enable them to deprive their workers of what they would be normally entitled to under the legislation, and that is six days' holidays.  The principle of the sub-section is bad.  In a holidays Bill there should be no ambiguity.  It is intended in this Bill to provide the workers annually with holidays on six consecutive days.  The sub-section provides that the employer may make payment in lieu.  We consider that a very bad thing.  We do not think there should be any alternative left to the employer.  It may be that many employers will operate this sub-section in the spirit in which it is intended, but there is a danger, indeed a certainty, that a number of them will take advantage of the sub-section to avoid giving any holidays, and there is further a strong danger that the worker might not even be paid in lieu of his holidays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask Deputy Dunne not to press the amendment for this reason: I do not think it is a good principle for Oireachtas Eireann to tell the people habitually what is good for them.  The very essence of freedom is that each one of us may dree his weird according to his own preference, provided he does not trespass on his neighbour's rights.  Sometimes it may be desirable to limit a man's or a woman's freedom to dispose of private property so as to ensure that a capricious use of that private property will not seriously injure a neighbour's rights.  Subject to that, it seems to me outside the province of Oireachtas Éireann to tell a man that he must go away on his holidays even if he does not want to.  I quite agree with Deputy Dunne that you must take effective precautions to ensure that when that choice falls to be made by the working man it will be truly a free choice and not only nominally a free choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evil that Deputy Dunne envisages is that in practice the freedom of choice will be destroyed and the working man will be told tacitly that he had better not go away on his holidays and, that having been established, the next step will be that the working man will be <Col N="2103" /> told tacitly that he had better not look for holiday pay in addition to the week's wages he has already got.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne and I and most other Christian men in this country were brought up to believe that one of the sins crying to heaven for vengeance was to deprive a labourer of his hire.  I am not prepared to accept as a tenable hypothesis that ordinary men who are employing their neighbours are coldly and deliberately going to damn their souls for the purpose of defrauding a workman of one week's holiday pay, with the knowledge that unless and until they make restitution of that week's pay that they have stolen, there is no absolution available to them.  If you steal your neighbour's property, not only must you repent your act, but you must restore what you have stolen. But if, in addition to stealing a workman's wages, you withhold from him what is his due, the sin is far greater.</P>
    <P>Are we in this House to legislate on the assumption that the higher law has ceased to be effective amongst our people and that we are blandly to substitute for it the vigilance of the Agricultural Wages Board, in the belief that their activities are much more likely to secure compliance?  I do not accept the suggestion that the express law of God has ceased to be effective.</P>
    <P>I do say that it is quite possible that an ignorant man might fall into the design that has occurred to Deputy Dunne's mind as a possibility.  I admit that there might be individual cases of that type, that an ignorant man might lose sight of the fact that he owed his workman a week's holiday pay and that in withholding it he was sinning against justice.  If that should arise, the Agricultural Wages Board is there to remind him of his duty and if they should falter there is the trade union movement.  I do not want to see the trade union movement supplanted by the Legislature.  In every decent free democracy in the world, there is not only room for, but need for, an honestly operated autonomous trade union movement which will say to the Legislature: &ldquo;There are certain spheres of economic activity into which we do not <Col N="2104" /> ask the Legislature to enter at all.  Our <i>raison d'être</i> is to be there as a bargaining organisation for employed men.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>By and large, if a working man is unable to get fair treatment from his employer, it works best that, instead of rushing off to the Gardaí and bringing into operation the statute law, he should go to his trade union branch secretary and ask him to direct the attention of the employer to the terms of the contract of employment, and in a friendly, neighbourly way, the worker can bargain with him.  I do not believe that we are dealing with a state of class war.  I know there are short-tempered farmers, short-tempered agricultural workers and short-tempered trade union officials; but, if there are, there are commonsensical men in each of these categories too.  If you bring an individual citizen into headlong collision with the panoply of the State, the proceedings may terminate in the police court. Common sense suggests that, instead of resorting to that extreme procedure, the trade union official can go and have a roaring row with a farmer, and if the farmer kicks him off the premises his colleague, another trade union official, can go to the farmer and say: &ldquo;Do not mind that fellow; he is daft, and it was good time you kicked him off the premises,&rdquo; and he can settle it up in two ticks by acting reasonably. If it is the farmer who is the unreasonable party, the man can return and say: &ldquo;Look, no one wants fight; but if you try to throw me off, you can do so, but you will not throw off the Agricultural Wages Board.  I want to get this matter settled up without any threats or fighting, but the Act is there, and if you want to act unreasonably and refuse to discuss the matter with anybody, the resources of civilisation are not exhausted.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would prefer that the powers of this Act never had to be used.  I do not want to believe that there are a dozen farmers in Ireland who, if their attention is drawn to the fact that to withhold an agricultural worker's wages in this context infringes, the obligation to pay the labourer his hire, would hesitate for one moment to pay <Col N="2105" /> over what is due.  I will not subscribe to the doctrine that that is true, and for that reason I will ask Deputy Dunne on this occasion not to take so disillusioned a view of his own neighbours but to assume with me, until the contrary is proved, that our people have still sufficient respect for a higher law as to make it certain that it is unecessary to butterss that higher law up with the Agriculture Wages Board or the pious resolutions of Oireachtas Éireann.</P>

      <P>The Minister has dealt exhaustively and devastatingly with a whole lot of arguments that Deputy Dunne did not make.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision about the amendment for this reason.  This legislation creates a new situation, and it will require a new approach by farmers.  There are many farmers who will bristle a little at the very idea enshrined in this Bill. I think Deputy Dunne is unduly pessimistic in thinking there will be any effort made by farmers to pocket the holiday money that should be paid in lieu of the holiday period not given; but I do think&mdash;and here I join issue with the Minister&mdash;that it is the function of this House to encourage people to act in their own interest.  I believe it is not in the interest of farm labourers or any other class of workers willingly to deprive themselves of an annual rest, even so to deprive themselves with a view to augmenting their annual income to the extent of the week's pay.  I do not think the Minister should encourage that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Legislature could, quite properly, coerce people into acting in their own interest.  I know the Minister disagress fundamentally with that philosophy, but, be that as it may, I would ask him to remember that this measure will create a new situation.  Our farming community are not the least conservative element of our population.  I believe that Deputy Dunne is right in apprechending that there would be <Col N="2106" /> among farmers a desire to say: &ldquo;Well, I will pay you the extra week's wages, but do not go off on this new-fangled holiday idea.&rdquo;  If that developed, it could be bad.  I do not think it should be encouraged and if Deputy Dunne's amendment precludes that situation arising, it is a good one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in favour of the amendment for a totally different reason from that given by the Minister, although I agree with a great deal of what he said.  From my knowledge of the working of the holidays on the industrial side, it is very often a great benefit to the individual worker that he can elect to take his holidays in the form of money.  I do not want to be taken as in favour of that happening, but I would like to put this to the House and to Deputy Dunne.  There are certain cases&mdash;perhaps through illness, perhaps through dismissal, perhaps through the farmer himself going out of business, or seasonal changes taking place in working &mdash;where it may be to the farm worker's advantage to collect his money, say goodbye to the employer and, if he likes, go home and have his holidays. But if you preclude him being paid money in lieu of holidays, there may be occasions on which it will be very much to the detriment of the man himself.  That is a side of the question I would like to put before the House.  In certain circumstances it would be to a man's advantage to get the money and, in faact, the only way in which he could get that holiday would be if he worked for six months, at the end of which period he would be entitled to half his holiday period. He can go home and, before he gets another job, he is at least assured of being paid for three consecutive days' holidays.  If we pass this clause he will not be entitled to get those holidays, and I do not think that is a situation this House would like to see. I mention that matter because it is a fairly common occurrence on the industrial side where men are in a type of employmnet which is not regular throughout the year.  It is an advantage to them to enable them to collect <Col N="2107" /> their money and then take their holidays; and they do take their holidays, even for a shorter period than six days, and go on excurisons and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the sub-section is weak.  I think it is quite unnecessary for the Minister to legislate in the form he proposes under this Bill.  Might I remind him of the fact that the sub-section as it stands is in conflict with existing legislation? Section 11 of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall not be lawful for any industrial worker during any period of annual leave to do for reward any industrial work.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And sub-section (2) specifically lays it down that if an industrial worker in fact acts in contravention of that section he shall be liable to a penalty, in the first case, of a fine not exceeding £10, and on all subsequent occasions to a fine not exceeding £25.  The Act of 1939 lays it down that the worker cannot do something we believe to be against his own interests; yet this Bill provides a way out in the contrary direction.  I think the section would be excellent without that sub-section. If it becomes evident that there is a tendency as between the employer and the worker to do what it is alleged they will do&mdash;that is for the employee to stay on working and get paid for it &mdash;I think it would be better to wait until that abuse shows itself to introduce legislation to combat it.</P>

      <P>There is one problem that arises under this section in connection with the worker who is living on the farmer's premises.  If that man is compelled to take a holiday whether he likes it or not, there is the possibility that his accommodation will be required for a substitute worker and he will thereby be compelled to pay for accommodation out of his weeks's wages. I think his holiday might prove a very slim one as a result of that.  I <Col N="2108" /> think complete freedom should be given to the worker to choose as between taking payment or taking his holidays.</P>
      <P>There was another matter that arose in the discussion on this Bill last week. Some members of the Labour Party pointed out that workers might like to take their week's holidays for the purpose of working for themselves or procuring other employment.  That would imply that an agricultural worker has the right to work during his holiday period either for himself or for someone else.  That would put his employer in a very absurd position, because the worker would be compelled to leave his employer but would be free to work for someone else in the same locality. It might be possible to obviate the difficulty by making it possible to have an exchange of workers under which farmer A's workers could go to work for farmer B and farmer B's workers could go to work for farmer A.  In that way, the Bill, as Deputy Dunne proposes to amend it, would apply and the position would arise that the agricultural worker would still be working the whole year round.</P>

      <P>As one who was a worker for 25 years, I know that the position will arise where, in some cases, the employer will not keep his employees two months because at the end of that period they would normally be entitled to take a day off.  The employee would not be kept on that long by the the employer.  He would be finished long before seven weeks would be up.  He could not go to work for another employer.  Deputy Cogan is wrong in that.  If a man is on holiday and goes to work, he is liable to be fined and so is his employer.  It is no use saying, therefore, that the agricultural worker could work for another farmer.  If this is allowed to go through, abuses will creep in because you will have many men who will not take a holiday at all, and many who will not be paid by their employers if that concession  is left.  The employer <Col N="2109" /> will evade his duty and the worker will be unable to say anything about it because he will be afraid.  I think it would be better to make the conditions the same as those that obtain where industrial workers are concerned; the holiday must be taken and the worker may not seek other employment during the holiday period.  From the point of view of employment, that would be the more satisfacatory position, because then the farmer would be compelled to employ those registered at the labour exchange as substitutes for those workers who are on holidays.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputies&mdash;and I bespeak this degree of collaboration&mdash;that the purpose of the Government in bringing in this Bill is effectively to provide that agricultural workers will get six consecutive days' holidays in the 12 months.  Therefore, so far as the Government is concerned, they will see they will get them.  I would suggest to Deputies, who are solicitous that the powers taken are insufficient to achieve that purpose, not to assume that the Governemnt would allow the situation to continue if it appeared that abuses of the kind envisaged by the Deputies were beginning to develop and the powers taken under this Bill proved insufficient to abate them.  Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the paralledl of the industrial workers' holidays Act.  I can remember the Deputy was a little to the right of where he is now sitting when that Act was passed, and I was still further to the right, and I remember his and my arguing it, indifferent to the views held where I am now standing, as to whether an industrial worker should be prohibited forom participating in any work of an insurable kind during his holiday.  I think I carried conviction to Deputy O'Sullivan's mind by putting the case that, if he were spending his holidays ith relatives in the country, it would be a hard thing if a wages board inspector should arrive during the week when he was helping his relatives in the hayfield, and were to ask him if he were getting paid for the work, because if he were, he must drop the hayfork.  He eventually agreed to limit the restriction that it was proposed to impose saying that he <Col N="2110" /> was not to engage in other work if he was on holidays from industrial work.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Cogan has pointed out, when you are dealing with agricultural workers and agricultural conditions you just cannot even attempt meticulous precautions of that kind, because such activities as Deputy Cogan mentioned could be engaged in if there was a conspiracy to defeat the Act by one farmer swopping with his neighbour.  Both agricultural workers could have a holiday within the meaning of this Bill, and yet, in fact, the situation sought to be remedied by the deletion of Section 7 could be effectively defeated.  If an agricultural worker, Deputy C. Lehane notwithstanding, says, within his heart: &ldquo;Oireachtas Éireann thinks it is good for me to have a holiday, but Oireachtas Éireann be damned, this is a free country; I am going to get my holiday pay from the farmer and I am going to earn a little on the roadside,&rdquo; I do not know that any legislation which this House can properly pass should deprive him of that freedom.  I think if Deputies would look at the matter from my point of view, (1) that from a profound sense of respect for the right of the simplest agricultural worker to run his own life in his own way within the four corners of the law and, (2) from the point of view that the majority of our people, the vast majority of them, have more respect for the law of God than they have for the law of the Oireachtas, they would find there a powerful, irresistible dual argument founded on fundamental principles against this modest amendment.</P>
      <P>I ask the Deputies of the Labour Party, at least, to give this a trial. Should any abuses be generated by anybody in this country, the resources of this Oireachtas are equal to dealing with them, but let us not assume that every abuse that it is possible to think of is bound to arise if we do not put handcuffs on every neighbour that we have in this community.  I want to put handcuffs on nobody that I can help. If any man in this country can doublecross me once if I have not got the handcuffs ready, and if he tries it a second time, then shift me and find somebody else.</P>

      <P>The Minister, I think, has confused some Deputies by his explanatory statement in connection with this amendment.  He has painted the Irish farmers and agricultural workers as God-fearing men who would not attempt to do anything worng.  He has pointed out that the farmer who would deprive the agricultural worker of his week's holidays would be actually robbing him of a week's pay, and that it would be such a terrible burden on his soul that he could not possibly leave this world in peace, when his turn came to depart to the other one.  Unfortunately, for the agricultural workers, they believe that the farmers belong to the employing class, and so they feel that they have to look to the laws which are made for the protection of workers.</P>

      <P>I have been in both from time to time.  At present we are dealing with agricultural employees, and I hope that what I have to put before the Minister will be of help to him.  As regards the relations between employers and employees, I have had some considerable experience of them, and I would point out, for the benefit of the Minister&mdash;this may seem to be an argument against Deputy Dunne's amendment&mdash;that there is another angle to this question.  I think there is this point to be considered, that if everyone were as God-fearing and as righteous as the Minister seems to think, it would hardly be necessary for us to be sitting here at all.  We would not even want a Government. Everyone would do what was right, and it would not be necessary for us to be making laws, rules and regulations. But unfortunately that is not the position.  Human nature being what it is, it is necessary that laws, rules and regulations should be made, and that there should be a Government to control industry, agriculture and every other activity.  The Minister has explained that both himself and Deputy O'Sullivan were on the Right, but that he was a little further Right than Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister went more on the right road when he introduced this Bill to give holidays to agricultural workers, but it seems to me a pity that he left an open door to enable anybody to slip through it. Those who have been interested in negotiations and agreements between workers and employers over the last quarter of a century know thoroughly well that, in the initial stages, when those aagreements were arrived at, there was the incentive, on the part of a number of employees who were on friendly terms with their employers, not to enforce the agreements in full as far as that was possible for them to do.  The employers' representatives were always faced with the proposition that there were employers anxious and able to pay, saying: &ldquo;I do not mind paying, provided everybody else engaged in the business has to do the same.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister, to Deputy Cogan and to other Deputies who feel that the sub-section should be included and that Deputy Dunne's amendment should not be accepted, that you will have this position created: that a farmer, who is anxious and willing to give holidays to his workers, will feel that both his workers and those responsible for introducing this measure will be impeding him in the progress of his work by compelling him, because he is honest and willing, to give the holidays while his neighbour is not doing so.  He will say: &ldquo;I am not giving John a holiday, but I am going to pay him instead.&rdquo;  This is a new measure introduced by the Government.  What I fear is that, human nature being what it is, agricultural workers who have never got a holiday will find it hard to believe that this Bill has been passed and will be very timid in making the demand for holidays on their employers.  That is why I say it is an awful pity that the Minister should have left this open door in the Bill.  Mr. Dillon, a farmer down the country, may be very anxious to give a holiday to his workers, but he will hesitate to do so unless he is sure that Mr. Smith, a farmer across <Col N="2113" /> the road, is also giving a holiday to his workers.  The fact that, instead of a holiday, the worker is going to get paid, will, I think, act rather as a deterrent in the case of the man who is prepared to give the holidays.  In my opinion, this open door that I have referred to is going to defeat the whole object of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Words are lightly spoken and in this context it seems to me that the spinning of two many words about a simple matter can confuse the issue. I suppose I have had as much experience of the relationships existing between agricultural workers and employers in this country as any other Deputy in this House and while the Minister may put forward the proposition that these relationships are such that any interference with them would be an unhealthy thing, I would draw his attention and the attention of other Deputies to the fact that agricultural workers in this country have at the moment £3 per week, an insufficient wage, not a living wage, but a great deal more than what they had before the Oireachtas started to interfere in the relaionship existing between the farm labourer and his employer.  Before the establishment of the Agricultural Wage Board things were very much worse relatively than they are now. Before agricultural workers were organised in trade unions, the conditions of these workers in the areas in which trade unions now operate were very much worse than they are now.  I do not see for the life of me why agricultural employers in this country should welcome this Bill with open arms.  I had experience within recent years of seeing long drawn out strikes and lock-outs on very simple matters such as on the question of a half holiday in the week for agricultural workers.  I think that a kindly description to apply to the general attitude of Irish farmers to their employees would be to say, as has been said hee, that they are not the least conservative class in the country.  That is the kindliest thing that could be said of them.  I agree that it is quite natural that owners of land should be conservative because of their roots in the soil but when you are dealing with a conservative people you <Col N="2114" /> have go to take every precaution to see, when applying a progressive measure of this kind, that the people with whom they are dealing are protected to the last degree.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken of the eternal law of the labourer being worthy of his hire.  If we, as a nation, accepted that Christian concept and, more than that, put it into operation, there would be no need for trade unionism or no need for any interference between the employer and his worker.  It is because of the ignoring of these fundamental principles that there is need for legislation such as this.  There is need for trade unionism because the Christian law of the labour being worthy of his hire has been ingnored.  In how many cases do we see the labourer robbed of his hire and not being sufficiently paid?  It would be interesting to hear how may cases were reported to the Agricultural Wages Board in one year of employers who did not pay the minimum wage.  The Minister would be astounded to learn of the numbers of areas in the country where agricultural labourers do not get the minimum wage and are afraid to admit that they do not get the minimum wage because of a fear of dismissal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, in this matter I could argue, as against what the Minister has said, that we are merely trying to put into practice in ordinary life the fundamental Christian concept of the labourer being worthy of his hire by seeking to ensure that the agricultural worker shall be in a ssecure position from the point of view of getting his holidays.  I have stated before, and I want to repeat it so that I shall not be misrepresentaed in the matter, that I know there are employers who will operate this Bill in the spriti in which it is intended.  Equally, I know that there are employers who will do everything in their power to defeat its ends. I do not see the possibility of a conspiracy arising to defeat it, as Deputy Cogan has tried to suggest.  If what the Minister has stated is true, that the employers who would seek to defeat the ends of this Bill would represent only micrkosacopic section of the community, we do not anticipate a situation <Col N="2115" /> in which we shall get two neighbouring farmers trying to defeat it, but I can quite see the possibility that the entire Act may be nullified by this provision.</P>
    <P>I could not quite follow the view put forward by Deputy Dockrell that if the worker were entitled only to three days' holidays, and if he ceased his employment, he would not receive his holiday pay if this sub-section were dropped.  I cannot quite see that.  It is quite a common thing in industrial employment for a worker to leave his employmnet after six months and then receive his holiday pay along with his wages.  He has got holidays then until he gets the next job, so that Deputy Dockrell's argument would have no application in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that if the section were left as it is, it might be given a trial to see what would develop, and that he would take steps to correct any abuses which might occur.  I would ask the Minister how long it would take to discover whether or not there were any abuses under the Act, and how would anybody go about discovering whether there were abusess or not?  I think that the best cure is prevention and, with that in view, I believe the Minister should afford the House an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon this amendment, so that we shall know exactly what the Oireachtas has in mind in connection with it.  I would say from my knowledge that by far the greater percentage of agricultral workers would infinitely prefer to have this protection written into the law than left out.  Freedom is a very  relative thing.  The man who is employed by the farmer is free to work for him or not to work for him.  He may be dissatisfied with the wages and conditions, and it is said that he is free to leave the job, but, if he leaves the job, he will possibly strave.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that to talk in fine words of freedom is sometimes to talk unrealistically.  A man who is working in a job at £3 a week and who is dissatisifiled may be said to be free to leave that job and get something else, but if he cannot get other employment, which is the case generally speaking, there is not freedom and he must continue in the job he is at.  That is my view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is too much talk of interference on the part of the Oireachtas with relationships between employer and employed in this country. I do not agree that the Orieachtas should either be invited to, or itself assume, the right, to interfer or usurp the functions of trade unions, but in this particular context, as one who has had very considerable experience endeavouring to organise agricultural workers, I would say that it is going to be quite a while before every agricultural worker in Ireland will be fully protected by trade unionism in the same sense as the industrial worker is now protected.  The present postion of industrial workers whereby they have attained a pretty satisfactory measure of protection has been achieved by the continual effort and sacrifice of trade unionists over the past 50 years.  With agricultural workers the job of organising them has only more or less lately begun.  Anybody who knows the problem will admit that it represents an entirely different proposition to the organissation of industrial workers, so the organisation of them is not going to be something that can be effected in a short time.  I myself am not prepared to wait for 20, 30 or 50 years to secure these simple advantages for agricultural workers if it can be done speedily through the Oireachtas. I think that the Oireachtas should anticipate the advance of organisation among them at least to this limited extent.  We are asking for a very simple thing and while I can appreciate <Col N="2117" /> some of the arguments put forward by the Minister against this amendment, I would repeat the importance of the right of the last farm labourer to whom he referred when he stated that in his view there would not be 12 agricultural employers or farmers in the country who would seek to evade the implications of the Bill.  If there is only one farmer, if there is only one farm labourer, that farm labourer has equal rights with the 150,000 who will benefit by the Bill and this is the protection we should give him.  I would ask the Minister again to consider this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the great mistake Deputy Dunne is making is to attempt to equate agricultural workers with industrial workers.  He must realise that agricultural workers have an entirely different problem from industrial workers.  In the first place their standard of remuneration is lower.  Deputy Dunne may say that that is something that can be remedied by legislation or by trade union action, but it is not going to be easily remedied because the income of the agricultural worker, £3 upwards, is somewhat more than the income of a very large number of farmers and any facile means of raising the whole standard of income of agricultural workers is not within easy reach.  I think that will be admitted.  When we realise that the income of agricultural workers is low we must realise the importance to him of the additional £3 a year for working during his annual holidays. We must recognise that there are many workers who will utilise their annual income and there is a good deal of work such as beet cleaning and weeding which the men will avail of their annual holiday to do.  If Deputy Dunne and the Labour Party took their stand on the view that agricultural workers should not be permitted under any circumstances to work either for themselves or for anybody else during the annual holidays they would, be taking their stand on strong ground, but they have not taken that stand.  Members of the Labour Party have stresssed that they could utilise the week to secure their winter firing and to do work of that kind.  That is a form of work <Col N="2118" /> which would benefit agricultural workers to a great extent.</P>
      <P>Once you concede the right of workers to work during their annual holidays I think you must accept sub-section (7) which simply acknowledges that right and makes provision for them being paid by thier employers if they choose to work for themselves, for somebody else or for their present employer. The suggestion that this particular provision would be difficult to impose is not, I think, sustainable.  Agricultural workers generally have succeeded in extracting whatever money is due to them by statute under the Agricultural Wages Act.  It is generally true to say that if they fail to do so they can go to their respective trade union or branch of the Labour organisation or local representative who will take up their case.  When this Bill becomes law they will have statutory rights to payment in lieu of a week's holiday and I think that can be readily enforced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely Deputy Dunne misconceives the whole point of the thing when he says that if there is one agricultural worker left in Ireland who stands in peril of having his rights withheld, it is the duty of Oireachtas Éireann so to legislate, however Draconian that legislation may be required to be, in order to ensure that that one exception shall not be for a single moment challenged in his right. Such a doctrine in legislation would make the work of Parliment quite impossible. Surely the sensible rational approach to this is that this House means that agricultural workers ought to have six days' annual holiday.  If worker and employer, employer and worker, mutually agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is it reasonable to ask Oireachtas Éireann to go on record by its legislation as saying: &ldquo;That may be true in theory, but in Ireland it does not work?&rdquo; I hope to go on record as saying that most of the Deputies and the bulk of our people were born on small fams and I will be no party to legislation which enshrines the propositon that every man who works for a farmer in this country is certain to be robbed if he cannot invoke the criminal law against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Dunne is fair when he says that £3 is the wage of agricultural workers in this country.  £3 is the statutory minimum below which agricultural wages may not fall in any part of Ireland, however remote, however poor, and that is a very different proposition.  I do not believe that 5 per cent. of the agricultural workers in this country are in receipt of only £3 per week.  I do not attribute that to the virtue of farmers; I attribute ilt to the fact that you could not keep any agricultural workers to-day if you offered them only the minimum wage, because they will find plenty of peopel willing and eager to bid more for their services.  I think it was a mistake to paint the picture that we have accepted in Dáil Éireann as a proper level of payment for all agricultural workers £3 a week, with appropriate adjustments in special areas.  I have taken occasion to say so from a public platform in Mullingar and in this House.  The statutory minimum of agricultural wages has nothing to do with a situation wherein the agricultural industry is relatively prosperous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be no party to any recorded suggestion that the farmers of this country must be assumed to be ready <Col N="2120" /> to rob their working men and, by fraud, deprive them of what they have a right to.  I do not think my friends of the Labour Party have any reason to press upon me such an avowal.  In many regards, perhaps, my views are more radical than theirs.  I heard with admiration Deputy Dunne speak of the traditional conservatism of the Irish farmer.  Am I to dwell on the notorious conservatism of the trade union official? I have met in the Transport and General Workers' Union in Engaland shellback Tories beside whom the leaders of the Tory Party would tremble.  I remember once meeting a candidate of the Labour Party in the course of a political compaign and, before the end of our acquaintance came around, he was imploring me not to be reckless or precipitate but to have a little patience in my desire for reform.</P>
    <P>Conservatism is an admirable thing; so is radicalism.  Deputy Dunne has spoken, rightly, with emphasis and with full appreciation of the gravity involved in any strike, because when men go on strike it means great suffering and it is not likely to be borne for long on account of the sufferings in which the participants themselves are involved. But, remember, strikes have taken place in the course of legitimate trade disputes between farmers and their men.  I have known sstrikes to take place in the course of trade disputes between trade union members and their executive.  It is not only conservative, crusty old farmers who are the occasion of trade disputes.  So long as men are free in a free society there will be strikes and it will be the duty of sensible neighbours to come between the parties and try to restore understanding and goodwill and to prevent a strike begetting a feud.</P>

I am asking him now not to press upon me the duty of going on record as accepting the proposition about the people from whom he and I came.  He would upbraid me sternly if I were to ask him to go on record as accepting the proposition that every trade unionist in this country was potentially a rogue.  I do not ask him to subscribe to that proposition, and I must ask him not to ask me to subscribe to the proposition that every farmer in this country is potentially a rogue.  If there are rouges on either side, the resources of civilisation are not exhausted when their activities come to light.  Pending that, I for my part assume that they are not rogues and I am not going to ask Oireachtas Éireann to assume that.  I am conscious of the weaknesses of human <Col N="2122" /> nature amongst farmers as amongst every other class, but I am not going to go on recond as declaring that the farmers of this country are all potentially rogues.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to sub-section (7) the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, before the end of the year in which the holidays are to be allowed or, if the employment terminates during the year, before it terminates&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is again for the purpose of clarification, to ensure that if a worker elects to remain at work and to take his holiday pay, there shall be no ambiguity about the period in which there is a statutory obligation on the employer to give him pay to which he is entitled.  Otherwise, it would be very difficult to determine at what stage a default took place because, on being challenged with default, the employer might protest the pious intention. Under this amendment it is possible to say that the payment must be made before the end of the year or is deemed to be in default.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8, which is in the names of Deputies Desmond, O'Sullivan, Kyne and my own:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 26, to insert before &ldquo;not&rdquo; the words &ldquo;his ordinary weekly rate or.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not think there should be any difficulty about this.  It is merely to provide that where an agricultural worker is in receipt of more than the minimum rate laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board, he shall be paid for his holiday period at that rate.</P>
      <P>That is the purpose of this amendment. I do not think there can be any objection to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised in connection with this amendment, the effect of which I have found some difficulty in discrening, that its introduction into the Bill in this form would creat an ambiguity.  It is not clear what the amendment has in mind.  If it is the intention to provide that a worker who is receiving more than the minimum rate of wages should also receive more than the minimum rate of holiday remuneration, the amendment is unnecessary because the circumstances which led to his getting higher wages should also apply in relation to his holiday remuneration.</P>
      <P>The amendment, as worded, would be impossible of application as some workers are engaged on an hourly rate, others on a monthly rate and many are paid partly in cash and partly in benefits in lieu, such as board and lodging.  So that, I am advised that the amendment simply does not fit and, for purely administrative reasons, I must ask the Deputy not to press the amendment as I believe its insertion would upset the machinery of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister has said that if there is a case of an agricultural worker paid a rate of wages abouve the minimum laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board, that rate of wages will apply for his holiday period, whether he is paid on a weekly, monthly, or yearly basis or whatever the basis is. I take it that would be the position under the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the passage of this <Col N="2126" /> Bill by Dáil Éireann does impose a burden on the agricultural industry and Dáil Éireann does that with its eyes wide open, believing that it is a proper minimal share for the employed workers on the land of the increasing income to be derived from the land. But agriculture is entitled to say, and I think I have a duty to say it, that while it is ready and willing to bear all its due share and perhaps a little more of the burden of expense that falls upon the community, and that it accepts gladly the duty to provide at no little cost this added amenity for those who work upon the land, there must be a limit to burdens placed on agriculture for the benefit of other sections of the community without any reference to the limit of the burdens that agriculture is able to carry.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The farmers are entitled to protection just as the manufacturers are protected.  The Government should deal with the surplus the farmers produce by exporting it, even at a loss.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that this Bill imposes an additional burden on the farming community.  As far as the farmer Deputies are concerned, however, they are prepared to accept this Bill because they realise that the burden it envisages, spread over each week of the year, does not amount to a very formidable sum.  It is necessary, however, to remember that there is a limit beyond which these burdens cannot be pressed.  As I have already pointed out in this House, the average income of the farmers is between £3 and £4 a week. Before the passage of this Bill the minimum wage of an agricultural worker was £3 per week: a few pence are added to that sum, under this Bill &mdash;3d. or something like that, spread over the whole year.  Therefore, that indicates the narrow margin which exists between the average income of the farmer and the average income of the agricultural worker, as amended by this Bill.  I have indicated that the average income of the farmer is between £3 and £4 per week and we must realise, therefore, that while there are a very large number of farmers who have a much higher income than £3 or £4 week there are, too, a very substantial number of farmers who have a much lower income than the average and who, therefore, with the passing of this Bill, will have a lower standard of remuneration than that of their agricultural labourers.  In <Col N="2129" /> dealing with agriculture it must be remembered that we are not dealing with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not dealing with agricultural now.  We are dealing with agricultural workers' holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that, in connection with this Bill as it applies to agriculture, we are not dealing with the big employer who drives up to his office in his high-powered car. We are dealing, in the main, with small or medium-sized farmers&mdash;men who are really agricultural workers just the same as the men they employ and who, in many cases, have a lower income than the income of those people whom they employ.  As has been said, it is a terrible thing that an agricultural workers has never known what it is to have an annual holiday.  That position will be changed now with the passage of this Bill.  However, even after the passage of this Bill there will still be tens of thousands of small and even medium-sized farmers who will not know what an annual holiday is. As a matter of fact, the probability of their having an annual holiday will be further restricted by the enactment of this piece of legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what has been said by some people who have no connection whatever with agricultural to try and put the farmer in the dock as somebody who is trying to exploit these workers, I think it is necessary to point out that the farmer is a manual labourer just like his worker.  He shares in the same toil and possibly his work is even greater and heavier than that of his employee.  I hope that this Bill will result in an even better relationship between the farmer and the farm worker than has existed in the past and I hope that future conditions will enable the farmer&mdash;even in the worst conditions which may possibly come about in the country&mdash;to comply with the terms of this Bill when it becomes an Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that the passing of this Bill represents the imposition of an extra burden upon agriculture.  The Minister's statement indicated, however, very clearly, that it is a burden which agriculture can carry.</P>
      <P>Agricultural workers look upon this measure as a step in the direction of a better life for themselves and for their families.  The Bill is at least 25 years overdue.  I think that agricultural employers will have to realise that the men they employ are equally important in agriculture with themselves and that the privilege of ownership of land is a privilege accorded to human beings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I will relate it to this stage by saying that agricultural employers, in their attitude to this measure, should appreciate that in carrying out the terms of the Bill and providing holidays for their workers they will be doing no more than what is expected of them by the nation.  The Minister deserves credit for having introduced it.  We disagree with him on some points, but we must admit that this is a progressive measure.  It is the first, I hope, of many similar steps that will be taken to improve the lot of this most depressed section of the community, because agricultural workers are undoubtedly the most depressed section economically. Perhaps that has sprung from the fact that the industry generally has been depressed, but, now that the industry is on the road to recovery, the agricultural workers will expect from their employers treatment of a kind which will enable them to live a better and a fuller life.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (6) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) (a) Sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947 (No. 33 of 1947), and sub-sections (1) and (3) of Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1949 (No. 13 of 1949), shall not apply to any instrument giving effect to the purchase of a house in respect of which a grant under this section may be made to the purchaser when the house is occupied by him and in lieu thereof such stamp duties shall be chargeable as would have been chargeable if those sections had not been enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) Paragraph (a) of this sub-section shall have effect if, but only if, the instrument contains a statement such as is referred to in sub-section <Col N="2132" /> (4) of Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, or sub-section (4) of Section 24 of the Finance Act, 1949, whichever is appropriate, and there is endorsed on the instrument a certificate under the seal of the Minister for Local Government that a grant under this section will be made to the purchaser when the house is occupied by him.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (6) of Section 6 of the Bill, as drafted, unintentionally removed all liability for stamp duty on houses purchased with the aid of grants.  It is the intention of the Government that houses purchased under Section 6 of the Bill should be liable only for the reduced duty of 1 per cent., which applied to all house purchase transactions since 1891.</P>
    <P>The effect of the amendment will be to exempt houses purchased by Irish nationals with the aid of grants under Section 6 of the Bill from the higher rate of duty, that is, 5 per cent. <i>ad valorem,</i> which is at present applicable in the case of purchase transactions for completed houses.  The normal stamp duty of 1 per cent. which applied before the passing of the Finance Act of 1947, will be chargeable in respect of these houses.  The position of non-nationals will not be affected and they will continue to pay the higher rate of duty applicable to them irrespective of the fact that they may qualify for payment of a grant under Section 6 of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, I had an <Col N="2133" /> amendment down which was ruled out of order and I could not move it.  I am merely asking the Minister to make this measure retrospective, even if he would give a date from the beginning of this year.  I have knowledge of at least the case of one young man who finds himself in certain difficulties under this measure.  I sent the Minister particulars of two or three cases.  The particular man to whom I have referred entered into a contract.  He could not wait for this Bill, although it was promised 12 months ago, and he signed a contract last March for the purchase of a house.  So far as I know, he will not get a grant on that house because he entered into his contract three months too soon.  He was in a hurry.  I hope the Minister will try to do something for him.</P>
      <P>These young people were responsible, through their agitation, for bringing this measure forward.  Deputy O'Sullivan and myself and others continuously brought forward the question of market value.  Those who agitated succeeded in devising a new method of valuing houses.  That is a step in the right direction and we wish to congratulate the Minister in regard to it.  In fairness to the young people who purchased houses within the last six months under the promise of this Bill, I suggest they should get the benefit of it.</P>
      <P>I sent particulars to the Minister's Department of one struggling young man who signed a contract in March. I understand he will not get the advantage of this Bill, but I trust the Minister will reconsider this matter and give some benefit to what I might call the crusaders, the men who are really responsible for this Bill, because of their agitation and the way they drew attention to many grievances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects of the case presented by Deputy Byrne to which I would like to refer. On this section we would like to appeal to the Minister for some measure of retrospection in so far as the grant is concerned.  The latter portion of Deputy Byrne's remarks covers an extremely important point.  It concerns people whose homes are in the course of construction and the point is <Col N="2134" /> whether the words in this Bill, which sets out that certain things shall take place as from the passing of the Act, shall apply to the new valuations. With Deputy Byrne I would like to add my voice to this request.  We could point to certain hard luck cases where people were deprived of the grant under the last Act, through technicalities which we are glad to see the Minister is now about to put right.  If the 1948 Act were worded as we would like, what would have been the effect on the grants?  How many have been deprived of the grants in the way Deputy Byrne suggested, and what was the total amount involved to the Exchequer? It is a difficult question, as the Minister is faced with a heavy bill. On the other hand, if a certain amount of discretion were allowed to meet certain cases, the House would appeal to the Minister in that way.  The Minister can, without any charge on the Exchequer, ensure that people who are now buying or building their own homes will have the full effect of Section 27, which sets up the new machinery regarding valuation, applied as from the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>A number of people are buying their own homes now.  They had to apply for loans in the ordinary way when plans were submitted and a provisional valuation was given, but many of them have got no money whatever in respect of the loans.  Certain difficulties would arise if they had.  In so far as no money transactions have taken place at all in those cases, I appeal to the Minister to allow the machinery of Section 27 to operate retrospectively. In other words, people who started, say, some six months ago, to build homes or entered into contracts, and who have received no money, would be given the advantages of Section 27, in so far as the revised form of valuation is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the case made to the Minister, for reasons set out on the Second Reading and for the reasons advanced by Deputy Alderman Byrne and Deputy Alderman O'Sullivan.  Quite a number of people who purchased houses had a very harsh valuation imposed on them.  That may have been <Col N="2135" /> due to the interpretation of the 1948 Act.  I myself was on a number of deputations in regard to it and while I appreciated that the officials concerned were interpreting the Act, I felt that the interpretation caused a very severe hardship to many young people who were purchasing their houses and trying to make a start in life.  I was hoping the Minister might be able to leave the door open, whereby any of those people might reapply for the improved valuation. Some of them may not want to reapply, as they may have got over their difficulties, but some may still be in a difficult financial position, not having got the amount they expected, owing to the way the valuation was made.  If the Minister could leave the door open, to the extent of reopening those cases, it would relieve the hardship on those people.  They may not be 50 per cent. and certainly would not be 100 per cent. of the cases.  They entered into the plans for building their own houses and found when they entered into the contracts and had the house constructed what they had in mind regarding the grant was not achieved.  I support the appeal of the two Deputies who have spoken before me on this matter.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister to clarify the position in relation to tenants who have applied for a loan under the Small Dwellings Acts and whose loans at the present time have not been granted.  I take it that these people are in a position to refuse that loan and reapply for a loan under the present Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree to a certain extent that most Governments find it difficult to make a retrospective date. If the Minister adopted the principle of the 1948 Act, which went back to the 1st November, 1945, making a portion of the new grant available to such cases, that would be fair.  The 1948 Act was retrospective regarding a certain portion of the grant.  If that were applied in Section 6, to the person who purchased the house since a certain date, and was given a portion of the grant, not the full grant, as under the <Col N="2136" /> old Act, it would meet the case reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel this is developing into a discussion on Section 27 rather than on Section 6.  The Act of 1948 is still operating and can be availed of.  The gentleman spoken of by Deputy Byrne can get in under this Act if he has not purchased before the day the Act is passed.  A house standing, that has been erected but has not been purchased or occupied, can come under the provisions here.  The acid test is whether he has purchased and occupied it.  If the house has been built but has not been sold, because of the absence of the grant, that house could be purchased and occupied and would get the grant.  The 1948 Act is operating as before.</P>
      <P>Local authorities can operate the new terms with their clients once the Act is passed.  That is dealing with the provisions of Section 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Deputies must be assured so that they will not in any way mislead those who have purchased houses within the last three to six months.  I understand that if the loan has been completed as recently as last week on the lower valuation based upon the market value, under the Bill as it stands the case cannot be reconsidered. I would like to have that point made clear so that people will not come along subsequently believing that their case can be reconsidered.  The position is, as I know it, that if a loan is completed. on the market value based upon the auctioneer's value of a second-hand house and if the money was advanced last week the municipality has no power under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, under the new Bill or under any other Act to reconsider the position.  That is the reason why we Dublin Deputies should know the full position and that is why we are asking for guidance on the matter now. Any man who got his loan a month ago and whose loan was £100 less than he expected cannot ask for an increased valuation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that in the circumstances indicated by the Deputy it would be possible for the local authority to issue a new loan&mdash; that is, an additional loan on top of what he had already got.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps my point is less contentious.  There are a number of people affected who have not completed any transaction in connection with the loan at all.  They are merely in the preliminary stages; they have got a provisional valuation based on the architect's plans.  They are working on the basis that they will get 90 <Col N="2138" /> per cent. of that but nothing has actually been paid to them in respect of their loan.  Is it quite clear that there will be no hitch following the passing of this Bill and that their case is open to revaluation along the lines suggested in Section 27?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 7 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) A housing authority may, in accordance with a scheme approved by the Minister, make, to a person erecting or purchasing a house in respect of which a grant is made under Section 16 of the Act of 1948 or Section 6 of this Act, a grant not exceeding the amount of the grant under such section.</P>
      <P>(2) For the purposes of this section a housing authority shall have the like powers of borrowing as are conferred on such authority for the purposes of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is in substitution for amendment No. 4 on the printed sheet <Col N="2140" /> which is not being moved.  The principle in the amendment standing in the names of Deputy Spring, Deputy Flynn and Deputy O'Sullivan is accepted. The first amendment was defective as it only covered houses qualifying for grants by reason of their being purchased on or after the passing of this Act.  There will be another case, of course, that under Section 16 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, in which a person may contract to have a house erected for himself for his own occupation.  That is being covered. The applicant for a grant can choose either system.  The housing authority may make a contribution to either type.  The amendment now proposed revives a power which local authorities possessed between 1924 and 1931 to contribute towards private enterprise housing.  In that period about £170,000 was paid by local authorities.  If a local authority wishes to aid housing, it should be allowed to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  Paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) provides that grants may be made only where:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister is satisfied that the proposed reconstruction is necessary in order to prolong the life of a house or to arrest or prevent deterioration or that it will substantially improve the amenities of the house.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What I am anxious to ascertain from the Minister is this.  If a person gets a loan of £100 to make some addition to his house, will he be informed that, if the house is improved, it will be subject to revaluation, or will he get a guarantee that it will not be revalued, because if it were it would mean an increase in his rates?  In the case of tuberculous patients, people occupying a house can get a grant of £100 to make an addition to it to provide accommodation for the tuberculous patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am anxious to know, in view of what has happened recently, if there is going to be a revaluation of houses in respect of which grants are made under this measure.  In such cases, can a person's next door neighbour, or someone in the area, make a complaint and get the houses revalued?  In the Clontarf area, which I represent, that has happened.  I see that danger in connection with grants given to prevent houses going into decay.  The person who owns the house, in order to prevent that happening, may make application for a grant, not knowing that the valuation commissioners may come along and revalue the house thereby making the owner liable for an increase in rates.  I think, in view of the fact that this section is intended to save a lot of old property from going into decay, that the position should be made clear to the owners of such property. In my opinion they should get a guarantee that their houses will not <Col N="2142" /> be revalued.  As I have said, that sort of thing is happening in the Clontarf area where neighbours and others are writing in and are getting people's property revalued.</P>

The fact is that tradespeople, and others, in towns throughout the country occupy <Col N="2143" /> houses the valuations of which are much in excess of £12.  I think that even a valuation of £18 would be a very low figure to fix.  The number of people occupying houses with a £12 valuation is very small indeed.  I know the number of such houses in Galway, where a general revision was carried out, would be very small indeed. I think that tradespeople, and others, who occupy houses with a higher valuation than £12 should be entitled to get these reconstruction grants.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister has moved this amendment. Certain powers were given by us under the Sanitary Services Act which we passed in 1947.  The Minister is now taking additional powers to compel people to make use of public sewerage <Col N="2144" /> and water systems.  Provision was already made whereby a local authority would provided the sewerage and water system for a certain number of feet beyond a public drain or water pipe. It could compel a person to install the remaining pipe and mechanical appliances, and could charge that person with a loan over a period of 30 years at some nominal rate of interest.  This amendment will give an opportunity to the Minister of insisting on the joining up of a great many premises throughout the country.  You have hundreds of such premises in villages throughout the country which are not yet joined up with a public water or sewerage system, and persons who do that will now be able to get the full grant.  I congratulate the Minister on having introduced the amendment because I think it is going to make a great difference.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add to sub-section (1) the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or a grant for the reconstruction of a house is made by the Minister under Section 7 of this Act and no grant for such reconstruction is made by the housing authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Bill as at present drafted provides <i>inter alia,</i> for rate remissions in respect of new houses for which a grant is made under Section 6 of the Bill.  The Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, Section 44, granted rate remissions in respect of new houses and reconstruction for which grants were paid under that Act.  It is considered necessary to extend the principle of rate remissions for reconstructions under the new Bill (including cases of second grants) in cases where no grant for such reconstruction is made by the housing authority.  Under Section 7 of the Bill it will be optional on all housing authorities to make grants for reconstruction.  In the four county boroughs and the borough of Dún Laoghaire, a State grant will be paid only if the housing authority also pays a grant.  If the housing authority in these areas pays a reduced grant, the State will also pay a reduced grant of equivalent amount.  In the other areas&mdash;all rural areas and the urban areas other than the four county boroughs and the borough of Dún Laoghaire&mdash;the State may pay up to one-third of the cost of the work or £80, whichever is the lesser, even though the housing authority refused to pay or pay a reduced grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of rate remission for reconstruction cases is being confined by the amendment cases where no grant is paid by the housing authority.  The provisions of Section 44 (3) of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, are being applied.  Under this sub-section <Col N="2147" /> where a grant is made in respect of the reconstruction of a house, the valuation of the tenement, consisting of or excluding such house, shall not, on any valuation or revision of the valuation thereof coming into force within seven years after the completion of such reconstruction, be increased on account of any increase in the value of such tenement arising from such reconstruction.</P>

      <P>This amendment is designed to give the benefit of the remission in connection with the normal amount of taxation that would be collected under the income-tax code.  It would be an encouragement to people who are applying for these grants if they got that remission as well as a remission of rates.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 15 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (2) (c) of Section 19 <Col N="2148" /> of the Act of 1948 is hereby amended by the insertion of the words &ldquo;only at such rent and&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; where it thirdly occurs therein.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to secure the insertion of the phrase &ldquo;only at such rent and&rdquo; which occurs in sub-section (c) Section 20 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, in Section 19 of that Act.  In regard to public utility societies availing of the grant, the sub-section provides that such societies will let such house or houses only at such rents and subject to such conditions as may be approved of by the Minister. In the previous section of that Act which deals with houses built by housing concerns such as house-building companies or private contractors, the words &ldquo;only at such rent&rdquo; have not been inserted.  It is in order that that particular provision should be made operative in respect of houses built by housing concerns or building contractors, that I am moving the amendment. Where a grant or subsidy is being made available to housing concerns for the building of houses, the Minister should have some say or some control in the matter of the fixation of rent level of such houses.  I would like to know if the Minister would consider accepting the principle of that amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I am not in a position to accept that amendment. The Deputy is attempting to impose a specific obligation on the Minister to control rents in regard to houses eligible for letting grants under Section 19 of the 1948 Act.  The Deputy probably feels encouraged in his proposed amendment by the fact that in Sections 20 and 21 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, the Minister has a specific power to control the rents in the case of capital grants to public utility societies erecting houses for letting to members of the working classes or to agricultural labourers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the absence of a specific power to control rents for the purpose of letting grants under Section 19, the Minister in dealing with appeals from persons aggrieved by decisions of local authorities does in fact take into consideration the rent <Col N="2149" /> charged and he has been advised that he is within his power in abating or refusing a grant where he considers the rent is excessive.</P>
    <P>There is no necessity for this amendment in law as Section 19 (2) (c) taken in conjucntion with the regulations gives both the local authority and the Minister wide powers expressed as &ldquo;subject to such conditions as may be so prescribed.&rdquo;  Regulations are being made for the purposes of Section 19 and specifically cover the point raised by the Deputy.  It is unnecessary to attempt this in that respect.</P>

      <P>At present there is a certain difficulty in so much as a person with a valuation of £35 can get a grant of £80 whereas a person with a valuation of £35 5s. 0d. gets no grant at all.  It is proposed in the section to increase the limit to £50 but you have the same difficulty in the new section because it means that a person with a valuation of £50 can get an £80 grant whereas a person with a valuation of £50 1s. 0d. is entitled to get nothing.  I wonder would the Minister consider on the Report Stage or in the Seanad amending that section so as to have a sliding scale and so as not to have that particular anomaly.</P>

There should be some difference in the case of the reconstruction of a holding.  This is the first time it has been extended to urban areas and I think you will find it equitably balanced.</P>

I would be glad if the Minister would consider having this retrospective to 1948, so that the man who reconstructed a house in 1948 or 1949 and had over £35 valuation would be given an opportunity to qualify under this Bill.</P>

Following that we may have to do something better.</P>

      <P>This amendment is intended to establish definitely that local authorities will be enabled to use lands for the purposes of this section which were not necessarily acquired under the section.

      <P>An architect or law agent might hold &mdash;we have had difficulties now and then &mdash;that 12 or 14 houses could go on an acre of ground.  A local authority might decide that they should have a playing ground, a playing field, a civic centre or a public hall.  This clause here would permit of that being done or at any rate will not prevent it if a law agent or architect of a local authority insisted that under the Act they are to build houses and houses only?  What is going to happen if they want to put aside three, four or six acres for a playing ground, playing field, civic centre or a public hall?  I would ask the Minister to see if there is any doubt there.  Personally, I do not think there would be a doubt unless you came across a finicky architect or a finicky law agent who held that you would have to put up houses and nothing but houses.  Provision should be made so that if a local society wanted to provide any of these amenities some ground could be allotted for the purpose.</P>

      <P>This section empowers a local authority to acquire land either compulsorily or by voluntary agreement and also empowers the Minister to make a grant for houses erected.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the date mentioned here, namely, 1952.  This is the middle of 1950, and if a local authority were to set out to acquire land compulsorily they could not do it by 1952 no matter how hard they worked.  The Minister will not be called upon to make very many grants under that section unless he extends the date beyond 1952.  It takes a considerable time to acquire land, and land could not be acquired, either compulsorily or by agreement, and houses erected on it before 1952.</P>

      <P>We approve of this section which does confer a very important power on a local authority.  It rather reminds me of reading the history of the free cities of Germany where the corporations bought up all the land within ten miles of the centre of the city with a view to ensuring orderly development and providing people with land for houses.  In this case, the Dublin Corporation are able to enter on an already overcrowded area to purchase land and, in certain cases, they may be bidding against private interests who do not require assistance of that kind. In other words, the power conferred by the section will have to be used very carefully or it might create inflation in land values, on the one hand, and, equally, it might interfere with the possibility of orderly planning on the other.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows as well as I do how far the town planning of Dublin is being disregarded because of the urgency for obtaining sites.  As I said, this is a very important power which should be used with the very greatest scruple by a local authority or they may be making a situation already serious very much more serious.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne is concerned about the possibility of overcrowding and provision being made for playgrounds.  A housing authority, in the exercise of their power under Section 16, can control the number of houses per acre and see that the provision of playgrounds forms part of the development.  I think it is unreasonable to suggest that private persons or public utility societies should be more forward in the providing of amenities than a local authority.  The local authority can see that there is no overcrowding.  I have not the least idea of being drawn into a financial debate by Deputy McCann. I discussed the matter on the Estimate for my Department and Deputy McCann has had assurances with regard to the provision of money for the continuance of housing.  I would not pay one fraction more for money than <Col N="2155" /> Deputy McCann.  However, we are not discussing that now.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers may be assured that the powers he referred to will be used reasonably and with caution.  There is no intention whatever of making any unreasonable use of the powers taken.  Certain powers are necessary and, under the control of the Minister, they will have to be used with reason and caution.  We do not want, however, to have the people who are carrying on the housing drive restricted in their operations.  The section will have to be interpreted in a reasonable and fair way so as not to inflict any hardship on anyone.  There is no fear at all of the overcrowding that Deputy Byrne suggests, because that can be controlled by the local authorities themselves.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 18, but in Part III, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where houses have been condemned by a sanitary authority as unfit for human habitation, tenants or occupiers of such houses shall not be dispossessed therefrom until the sanitary authority have provided a suitable new house for such tenants or occupiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain areas people find it very difficult to get accommodation when their houses are scheduled for demolition. In most cases, they cannot avail themselves of the new houses which are being provided.  My proposal is to allow them to remain in their present houses until an alternative arrangement is come to.  In the case of houses which are scheduled for demolition, we have cases where the tenants cannot afford to avail of the new housing arrangements and if they are deprived of these houses, there is no alternative housing accommodation in the districts.  I suggest that, pending some satisfactory arrangement being made, these houses should not be demolished but reconstructed in <Col N="2156" /> such a way as to enable these people to remain in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the amendment as I consider it absolutely unnecessary.  Under Section 14 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, a local authority cannot make a clearance order or an improvement order, unless the authority is first satisfied that the persons being displaced can be given suitable accommodation, provided or secured by the local authority.  It is most unlikely that any authority insists on demolition without alternative accommodation being made available, either by the local authority or by other parties.  I suggest that Deputies who are members of local authorities should cast their minds back and ask themselves if they have ever known of a case where a local authority insisted on demolishing a house without providing alternative accommodation.  I have not known any such case and I have a long experience.  They are bound under Section 14 of the 1931 Act to see to it that suitable accommodation is available before making a clearance order and hence the Deputy's proposal is not necessary.  The protection is there already.</P>

      <P>On 24th February of this year, we issued a circular stating that local authorities could fix dates for evacuation of condemned houses which would coincide with a time when alternative accommodation would be available. There was some misinterpretation by local authorities as to the use of the powers of demolition and this circular was issued to make it clear that the local authority could fix the dates for the evacuation of such houses to coincide with the time when alternative accommodation was available, so as not to have these people left, as is suggested by the Deputy, homeless.</P>

There are cases to my own knowledge&mdash;and they are not too uncommon&mdash;where dwellings were condemned as being unfit for human habitation and where adequate alternative provisions were not made.  I must say, in fairness to the local authority, that normally the application of the law is intelligent and that the regulations are intelligently interpreted, so that cases of grave hardship are avoided, but the Minister would be under a complete misapprehension were he to imagine that no such cases occur, as would appear from what he said.</P>

My colleagues in the corporation may have had the experience I have had of ringing up the housing authority of the corporation and saying: &ldquo;Did you hear that such and such a house is being condemned as unfit for human habitation and that the tenants are to be evicted?&rdquo; and of getting the reply from the official: &ldquo;We are not evicting them. We have not compulsorily acquired that house which is owned by a private landlord who is getting these people out.&rdquo;  I sympathise very much with Deputy Flynn.  When a house is condemned by a sanitary authority, whether a private landlord's house, as it is in most cases, or otherwise, which has not yet been acquired by the corporation for reconditioning or demolition, the public authority says the house is condemned and puts the people out.  I have known them to be put out and to go to the workhouse.  I ask the Minister to consider the point in connection with other amending legislation at a later date.</P>

Deputy Dockrell and those of us on the Dublin Corporation know that, whenever the Dublin authority decides to go ahead with a demolition order, alternative accommodation is always provided, and, in many cases, exceptionally good accommodation.  Recently we had to demolish certain houses and we housed the people in Captain's Lane in newly-built corporation houses.  I do not think it would be fair to allow the House to think that the position described by Deputy Byrne, in fact, arises.</P>

That is the actual position.  I am not too sure but I think the corporation have legal authority, if the owner of a tenement house in the City of Dublin does not carry out instructions to have repairs made to the House, to go in and repair the house and to surcharge him.</P>

What Deputy Fitzpatrick imagines takes place does not happen nor does what Deputy Byrne suggested happen.  If the Dublin Corporation has to condemn a property owned by a private individual, the moment it is condemned, the house is taken over by the corporation and the corporation actually collect the rents and proceed either to repair <Col N="2160" /> or demolish the house.  The tenants are provided with alternative accommodation. I think the Minister need not be too seriously impressed by what is suggested.  I think Deputy Dockrell will confirm that in the matter of condemned dwellings we do always give alternative accommodation.</P>

      <P>(3) In this section the expression &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; means premises containing two or more dwellings.</P>

    <P>The definition of &ldquo;multiple dwelling&rdquo; in the Act of 1948 has been found to be <Col N="2162" /> defective in certain respects.

      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Act of 1949 is hereby amended by the substitution, for paragraph (b), of the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b)  a condition as to the number of dwellings which may from time to time be provided in the premises;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remedy a difficulty which housing authorities have experienced in working Section 12 of the Act of 1948. Under Section 12, a housing authority is empowered to grant a permission for the use of premises as a multiple dwelling or, in plain language, for the letting of a house in flats or rooms.  The licence may contain a condition limiting the number of separate dwellings which may be provided in any premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a housing authority find that a house has been sub-let into, say, six separate dwellings, they may consider that five is the maximum number that should be permitted in the house.  They inform the landlord that five is the maximum number that should be permitted but, as it would be unreasonable to require one of the tenants to leave immediately, they grant a licence, limited in its operation to a certain period, for six dwellings.  If, during that period, a tenant leaves the premises, and the landlord allows a new tenant into the premises in his place, when the time comes to renew the permission, the housing authority will still have to give permission for six dwellings. This amendment will enable a housing authority to attach to a permission a condition that the house may be let in six flats so long as the six <Col N="2163" /> tenants in occupation when the permission was given continue in occupation. A new permission will have to be obtained if one of those tenants leaves the premises; in this permission the number of dwellings into which the premises may be divided may be reduced to five.</P>

There is provision where it is a question of transfer of land but I can see no provision for the transfer of the liability for houses. There is no provision in this section.</P>
      <P>There is one other matter.  In the case of houses under the Labourers Act, if the occupier does not take advantage to purchase under the Labourers Act, 1936 (No. 24 of 1936), this section does not say what is to happen from that on.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 24 which stands in the name of Deputy Major de Valera:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 20 to insert a new section as follows:-</P>
      <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 17 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931 (No. 50 of 1931) shall be and is hereby amended by:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  deleting all words from &ldquo;on the ground that&rdquo; to &ldquo;has not been complied with&rdquo; inclusive, and</P>
      <P>(b)  by inserting in paragraph (b) of the said sub-section after the words &ldquo;complied with&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or that having regard to the existing use made of the land to which the order relates and to any other suitable land which is available, the acquisition authorised by the Order is unjust, unreasonable or inexpedient.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister would indicate now if he is going to accept the amendment or not.  I do not propose to argue the legal side of the matter.  It proposes to delete from sub-section (3) of the 1931 Act a phrase which is left in paragraph (b) of the same sub-section.  There is also the purpose of adding under sub-section (b) the safeguards that it was intended to have under sub-section (3) but which are difficult.  It puts on the back of the individual his interpretation of the law.  Deputy Cowan said just now that something was clear under the law.  The problem of the layman is that nothing is ever clear under the law and that is why we have all this legislation and litigation.  I am not prepared to argue the legal point.  Before pressing the matter I wonder if the Minister has had an opportunity of getting opinion on the suggested emendations and if he can indicate at the moment what he proposes to do about the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes to give the courts a jurisdiction over a number of matters which are at present within the jurisdiction of the Minister. At present, an aggrieved individual, can appeal to the courts, on the grounds that the acquisition of the land by the local authority has not been carried out in accordance with the requirements of the Housing Acts and regulations made thereunder.</P>
      <P>The amendment however proposes to confer on the courts a much wider range of jurisdiction than exists at present.  It would enable the courts in fact to hold a second inquiry on the lines followed by the inspector.  For example it would enable the courts to challenge the decision of the local authority that a specified number of houses was required in their area.  Its terms are so wide that before the court could arrive at a decision it would have to hear evidence on the extent of the programme and the financial commitments of the local authorities themselves. There is no doubt that a comfusing body of case law precedents would grow up which would take many decades to crystallise into general principles.  A general slowing down of the operations of local authorities would result which having regard to the existing housing needs would not be in the public interest.</P>
      <P>In the past and at present the Minister's administration of the powers entrusted to him have been uniformly exercised with an equitable balance between private rights and public interest.  I suggest the amendment would not be helpful at the present juncture and would be really harmful to the local authorities in their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to hear what the Minister had to say and it is obvious that he has a distinct brief on this matter.  The Minister must remember that we are now reaching a stage where the local authorities are, faster than ever, acquiring all classes of properties for the purpose of the building of houses.  The rights of the owners of these properties are gradually being more or less dealt with by the Minister rather than by a court of law.  For instance, take the position <Col N="2168" /> where there is a definite legal right on the part of the individual, the holder of a particular class of property which is going to be acquired.  I do not suggest that I will press this amendment, but I should like the Minister to say that he will consider the matter for another stage.  It is true that, where the local authority seeks to acquire, they have the Minister to decide and the aggrieved party must accept the decision.  But the aggrieved party can still go to law under the existing Acts, and do everything the Minister has said this amendment will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, will the Minister give us some explanation of sub-section (3)?  Will it apply only to houses that will be erected and let in the future, or will it apply retrospectively to houses that could be deemed to be let under the Housing of the Working Classes Act?  This is an important matter.  It is one on which the local authorities would need to be informed immediately.  Will the Minister also indicate what is the necessity for this section and if it means the bringing in of rural authorities as housing authorities under the Working Classes Acts which they were not previously?  I hope there is no effort in this section to hand across the baby <Col N="2169" /> from the urban to the rural authorities, asking the rural authorities to carry the urban baby of building.  We saw indications for some time that there might be an effort in that direction. We hope this is not the section that will put the burden on rural authorities of providing the buildings for the urban authorities.  I would like to hear from the Minister if sub-section (3) will be retrospective in respect of houses already let.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The building covered by this sub-section would not come under the Labourers Acts, but would come under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.  I might say that under this section it is intended to provide chiefly for working classes other than agricultural labourers living in town commissioners' areas and non-municipal towns.  At present these classes are excluded from consideration as the housing accommodation is normally provided under the Labourers Acts and the dwellings must, therefore, be let to persons coming within the extended definition of agricultural labourer. This position, in effect, precludes a large section of the working classes from consideration even though the families may be living in dwellings which are unfit for human habitation, or are otherwise qualified for new houses as member of the &ldquo;special classes&rdquo;, that is, families suffering from tuberculosis or living in one-roomed dwellings, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section will remove this anomaly and will enable rural authorities to provide for all sections of the working classes in need of housing accommodation. The suggested financial assistance is the same as that paid to rural authorities for operations under the Labourers Acts; that is, 60 per cent. of the annual loan charges up to £300, plus the appropriate Transition Development Fund grant.  The proviso in regard to lettings made before the passing of the Bill is intended to cover cases where doubts existed as to the qualification of the tenants to be regarded as coming within the definition of agricultural labourer; that is, lettings to soldiers, Guards, pensioners, etc.  The proviso prohibiting purchasing facilities is intended to cover cases of houses <Col N="2170" /> provided in town commissioners' areas and non-municipal towns for persons other than agricultural labourers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that there have been thousands of those types of houses erected in non-municipal towns over the past ten or 15 years, but those houses will not rank any more under the 1936 Act.  They cannot be purchased by the tenants.  I am afraid this Bill does not make that clear. Sub-section (2) talks about making it retrospective.  In non-municipal towns people were taken out of condemned houses and I suggest they are entitled to purchase their houses if they desire to do so.  Is it not a fact that a great number who were not agricultural labourers, purchased under the 1939 Act?  This section does not set that out clearly.  If they are tenants can they purchase under the 1936 Act in the future or does this section apply only to houses that will be erected and let?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Where there is a transfer from a rural authority to an urban authority and where a cottage becomes part of the urban area and has to comply with quite different health laws to those which existed in the rural area, either the tenant continues as a tenant of the urban authority and the urban authority is then forced to give the amenities required under its health laws, as distinct from the rural health laws, or alternatively, if the tenant should purchase he becomes liable to equip the house which the sanitary requirements need under the urban health laws.  There is hardship both ways.</P>
      <P>When the urban authority takes over and has to spend money&mdash;we have had experience of that around Dublin City, at Islandbridge and so forth&mdash;we have to put in certain sanitary amenities and we immediately impose on the backs of the people an additional rent.  If the person opts to buy, unless he fulfils the obligations of the public health laws in the urban area he cannot do so, and if he does buy he has to spend a considerable sum.  Will the Minister indicate what would be an equitable way of dealing with that problem?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, where the urban area is extended and takes in a number of rural area cottages.  The urban area cottages have to comply with certain health laws and sanitary requirements. If a tenant buys a cottage he has to instal all these requirements at his own cost.  If the local authority, in observance of its own laws, puts in these facilities, they put an additional rent on the backs of the tenants who were taken over by the urban authority without being consulted at all, because it is an extension of the boundary.  Could the Minister consider some equitable way of dealing with that point?  I do not know if he could by way of an extra grant.  I feel that the members of the Dublin Corporation will admit that this is and has been a rather difficult problem for a number of years, where we are gradually getting in cottages from rural areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25.</P>
      <P>Before Section 22 to insert a new section as follows:-</P>
      <P>22.  Where a cottage provided under the Labourers Acts comes within an urban area within the meaning of Section 19 of this Act, the Labourers Act, 1936, shall continue to apply to the cottage until its transfer to the urban authority under the said Section 19, notwithstanding that the cottage is no longer in a county health district.</P>
      <P>The need for this new section is to clarify further the position in regard to the preservation of the rights of tenants under the Labourers Act, 1936. The effect of Section 19 of the Bill will be that cottages vested prior to transfer will continue to remain under the control and management of the county council.  In order to provide for circumstances where tenants have not exercised their rights under the 1936 Act at the date of boundary extension or where the local authority have not prepared a purchase scheme, it is proposed under Section 19 (2) that that cottage shall not be transferred to the urban authority until 12 months have elapsed since the cottage has come within the urban area, and that the tenants of cottages which come within the urban area shall thereupon be informed as to their rights under the 1936 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the tenants fail to exercise their rights within 12 months after the boundary extension, the county council may transfer the cottages to the urban authority and the right of the tenant <Col N="2173" /> to purchase under the 1936 Act cannot be exercised subsequently.  If, however, the tenants desire to avail of their rights under the 1936 Act within 12 months from the date of incorporation in the urban area the county council shall thereupon proced with the vesting of the cottages.  In order to enable the council to proceed accordingly, it will be necessary to enact the new section, as the 1936 Act refers only to cottages situate within a county health district.  The section will preserve the powers under the 1936 Act for cottages included in an urban area until such time as they are transferred to the urban authority.  (The question of transfer would normally arise only in circumstances where the tenants failed to exercise their rights to purchase.)</P>
    <P>Section 19, taken in conjunction with this section, provides a protection for the tenant where the county council wish to hand over a cottage to an urban authority.  The protection is limited to a period of 12 months. There is, of course, no obligation on a county council to hand over the cottage to the urban district council and if they retain the cottages the rights of the tenants to purchase are preserved permanently.</P>

      <P>The case I was making before&mdash;which is related to Section 19 and 21 and definitely related to this amendment No. 25 to Section 22&mdash; applies here also.  An urban authority in extending its boundaries takes in a certain number of cottages.  The Minister wants to give the occupant of such a cottage protection to the extent that he will retain his rights, but he is omitting to see that the moment the rural cottage dweller becomes an urban cottage dweller, he has different liabilities imposed on him.  That has particular reference to the sanitary requirements of the urban area as compared with the previous requirements of the rural area.  I am wondering how the Minister is protecting that rural cottage dweller, who will have to pay an increased rate&mdash;apart from whatever difference there is in rates&mdash;or if he opts to buy the cottage will have to spend a good deal to make it comply with the urban sanitary requirements. <Col N="2174" /> I am wondering where the Minister is helping him there.</P>

      <P>I am afraid that question is outside the scope of the Housing Bill.  It is a matter for the council deciding on the borough extension and would be discussed at the inquiry.  I do not see how one could expect any Housing Bill to give protection for every possible borough extension that might take place in the near or distant future.  This gives protection in regard to labourers' cottages.  There will be plenty of people in rural areas brought in through extensions who will not be tenants of labourers' cottages at all but may be farmers or small holders.  I cannot see how you could arrange in this Bill to give them protection for such altered circumstances when they come into urban life as visualised by the Deputy.  There will be counteractions on the other side, I presume.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 15, to add after &ldquo;Acts&rdquo; the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Provided always that where an allotment has been in the continuous occupation of an allottee or his immediate relatives for a period of not less than 12 years such allottee shall not be disturbed except upon payment of compensation to be agreed upon by the local authority and the allottee concerned, or, in the event of a failure to so agree, to be determined by arbitration&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During the war period we had occasion to examine in a fair amount of detail the question of allotments, particularly in Dublin, and we found that in many areas the number of allotments was barely sufficient for the emergency. We found areas where people had allotments for a considerable number of years and where land had been further utilised for allotments purposes as a result of special measures taken by the Dublin Corporation to find suitable places where the people could produce food during the emergency. Encroachment inevitably took place as a result of housing activity and as a result of the Dublin Corporation taking over housing sites.  Now there are a considerable number of people, not only in Dublin but in other parts of the country, who had allotments for years and years to the great benefit of themselves and their families; they have what might almost be called &ldquo;squatters rights&rdquo; in connection with these allotments.  If the Minister wants to preserve the social principle of encouraging the use of allotments, he might consider accepting an amendment whereby if a person is in possession of an allotment over a period of 12 years he will be entitled to some sort of compensation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unnecessary as there is provision for compensation already available. Tenants of allotments under the <Col N="2177" /> Labourers Acts are required to be Cottier Tenancies (Section 13 of the Labourers Act, 1883).  In the case of such tenancies compensation for disturbance is provided for in Section 82 in the Landlord and Tenant Law (Amendment) Act, 1860 (Deasy's Act). The provision is there for compensation to the allottees and it is, therefore, unnecessary to have this amendment.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;and by the substitution therefor of the following:&mdash;&lsquo;The schemes shall avoid all interference with lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with a residence provided that the protection extended by this section does not extend beyond 75 yards of the residence in question.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We feel that, while this affords local authorities a valuable means of securing housing sites that would otherwise not be available, the Minister is going rather far in not providing some sort of protection for owners of demesne lands.  There, again, we face a certain difficulty.  We go in for town planning and for the creation of a sort of orderly extension of housing in various areas.  At the same time, very frequently the Minister&mdash;I might say both the present Minister and his predecessor&mdash;because of pressure to erect houses is compelled to take land which has the effect of creating disorderly and unattractive conditions, not only for the public generally but also for the individual landowners.  The object of this amendment is to preserve to some degree the privacy of people who have houses on lands that have been acquired for building purposes.  It seems only reasonable that they should have some measure of protection. <Col N="2178" /> This amendment seeks to give them an area of 75 yards within which they cannot be interfered with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accepting this amendment.  I consider that the laying down of a specific condition of this kind in legislation stating the extent of the protection to be afforded would be neither desirable nor equitable to landowners or local authorities.  There are many cases where a greater area than 75 yards should be conceded as a protective belt.  In other cases, the area could be less.  So much depends upon the circumstances, which include considerations other than distance, that it would be impossible to concentrate in any single formula the reasonable protection which ought to be given. There is nowhere else in the housing code a specific circumstance which would confer a protection and it is considered that the amendment proposed would, even if accepted, be inadequate to give just treatment in special cases.  The owner of the demesne land may confidently take his place with other landowners who rely on the sympathetic consideration given by the Minister to all cases of hardship and pleas of injustice which come before him as a result of the local inquiry. He can rely in addition on his right to appeal to the courts.  I think the application of this amendment would be very difficult, if not impossible.  I can cite cases where a demesne house is so situated that the application of this 75 yards rule would completely debar local authorities erecting houses, even on lands outside of the 75 yards. The application of the 75 yards fixed rule would be impracticable.  I do not think it would be either necessary or desirable.  The people who so seek to be protected should take their place with the other landowners in relation to the Minister and local inquiries.  I cannot see my way, therefore, to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 24 purports to give a certain specific amount of protection to the power of a particular type of specified building or residence. The Minister is wrong when he says that the amendment suggests a fixed distance of 75 yards.  The amendment <Col N="2179" /> suggests no such thing.  The amendment suggests only that there shall be protection given, but not exceeding 75 yards.  Even if the owner wanted more the amendment suggests that he should not get more.  There have been cases where grave hardship has been inflicted because of residences being rendered useless to their owners since too much land was taken away from them close up to the residence and the residence remains there with practically no privacy, out-offices or anything else.  This amendment merely underlines what is inherent by implication in Section 24.  It does not say that you must give the owner 75 yards.  It merely says not exceeding 75 years.  It That is quite a different argument from that advanced by the Minister in his rejection of the amendment.</P>
      <P>The Minister has resisted the amendment on the grounds that he is entitled to 75 years in certain cases.  The amendment admits that and says so.  I think this amendment will give the owner of property, whose lands are being acquired but whose house is not being acquired by the local authority, some additional protection.  Obviously the residence becomes more and more unsuitable if the local authority can define up to the last inch what it wants to acquire.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The scheme shall avoid all interference with lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with a residence provided that the protection extended by this section does not extend beyond 75 yards of the residence in question.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The protection goes right in up to 75 yards.  That is the reading of that, 75 yards in every direction from the house. The acceptance of the amendment <Col N="2180" /> would make it utterly impossible for a local authority to operate this provision and, in many cases, would not give the protection that is necessary or desirable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did misread Section 24, but, having done so, I am convinced that it makes the amendment all the more necessary.  In this section the Minister is introducing something new as regards the rights of local authorities in the matter of the acquisition of property or bits of property.  The proposal in the section is not to take over a whole parcel.  I think the Minister ought to leave some rights attaching to the residual part, even if it means that he may have to consider a distance of 75 yards from the house itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy says that he misread the section.  He certainly misquoted the amendment.  The amendment means that a local authority cannot go within 75 yards of any house, whether it is taking the house or not.  Deputy Briscoe made a case in respect of a local authority that was taking land near a house, but was not taking the residence.  The amendment, as drafted, would cover a case where the residence was being taken&mdash; that you could take the residence, but that you could not take 75 yards of the land around the house.  That may not have been intended.  In fact I think it is clear that it was not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers any of these questions relating to the acquisition of land which is near a residence, the more one is driven to the conclusion that each individual case must stand on its own legs, and that it is impossible to legislate for the necessary land to be acquired by a local authority in such a way that specific instances will be ruled out of individual consideration.  In my opinion, the best way of dealing with it is to rely on the good sense of the local authority that is dealing with individual cases.  So far as the local authority of which I am a member is concerned-the Kildare County Council&mdash;we frequently come up against this question.  If we were to take land in a particular spot, we know that we are going to interfere unduly with the residence of the person who lives in or adjacent <Col N="2181" /> to that land, and so we always go away from that land if we can possibly do so.  We always avoid taking sites on such land if we can at all do so.  It is only by giving the local authority credit for exercising a reasonable interpretation of their desire to get sites as well as a reasonable interpretation of the amenities of the people living in the neighbourhood, that you are going to get a sound result.  You are not going to get that sound result by tying up the local authority, one way or another, in a strait-jacket.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I managed to misread the section and to misquote the amendment, as Deputy Sweetman has said, because it had brought about the line of argument that I wanted to get.  In this Bill we are introducing a completely new form of acquisition.  I think Deputy Sweetman will admit that, prior to the introduction of this Bill, if a local authority wanted to get land it either bought the land or acquired it compulsorily, subject to arbitration and the payment of compensation.  It took the whole bit, and offered back, if you like the residence.  That gave security to the owner, because if his property was, from his point of view, being destroyed he had the option of getting out and of making the best bargain he could, or of buying the back, as cheaply as he could what he wished to retain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I say this new <Col N="2182" /> approach is a very dangerous one, because you are now not giving the owner the right to get out on the best bargain he can make.  You are now introducing this new system whereby you can say to the owner of the property: &ldquo;We are not going to take your house because it is too big or because it would be useless to us, but we are giving you back as much of the land as we like, up to your hall-door&rdquo;.  As Deputy Sweetman has said, you are leaving the owner with a house and 75 yards of land on every side of it. A lot of these houses may be fronting the public road, and the 75 yards of land may be at the side or the back of the house.  We object to the section because it is a new form of compulsory acquisition.  In my opinion, it takes away the fair basis that was there heretofore so far as an owner's rights to compensation were concerned.  I am surprised that Deputy Sweetman, who is a legal man, does not see what is implied in the section.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the Minister, to Deputy Briscoe and to Deputy Sweetman, I am inclined to agree with the point of view put forward by Deputy Briscoe.  At the same time, I think that the amendment goes too far.  I am of the opinion that the section itself is all wrong.  In my opinion, if the Minister withdrew the section and if Deputy Briscoe withdrew the amendment, I think it would be much better for all parties concerned. At the moment, local authorities have the power to say what is right in matters of this kind.  I agree with Deputy Briscoe that it would not be fair to take all the land running right up to the hall-door or bedroom window of any man's house.  If you take a man's gardens, or the field around his house, and if you will not give him compensation for the house, that, I <Col N="2183" /> think, is not fair.  There is no value in the house once the gardens and the lands surrounding it are taken.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing in Section 24 to delete the words &ldquo;the scheme shall avoid all interference with the demesne and amenity of residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken, or with any home farm, or lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with such residence&rdquo;. Why should the Minister delete those words?  In my opinion this section is a little bit objectionable.  The amendment may not be the amendment that would meet the requirements of individual cases.  The local authority ought to have the power to use their judgment to go in and act fairly.  Certainly, if the gardens and lands surrounding a house are taken, the owner of it ought to be entitled to some compensation in respect to the house because, without the gardens and lands, the house is of little value to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to facilitate the building of houses, and to encourage and assist local authorities to build houses for the people who are badly in need of them.  Section 6 of the Act of 1883 was passed almost 70 years ago when the rights that were then considered <Col N="2184" /> were not the rights of workers, but the rights of the demesne owners.  That was the time when the British Parliament, who made the law, was controlled, not by people who were interested in the workers, but by people who were interested in demense preservation.</P>

      <P>That section has been found by our local authorities and by the Minister, who is endeavouring to build houses for the people, to be an obstruction and, very properly, in 1950 he proceeds under Section 24 to remove that obstruction to house building. As the Minister has said, Deputy MacEntee desires to preserve a circle with a 75 yards radius around these particular houses.  He wants to say to us here in Dublin: &ldquo;No matter what your housing needs may be, you will build no house within a circle having a radius of 75 yards from the particular type of house protected by the Act of 1883.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can read and that is the purport of the amendment.  The amendment limits this protection to 75 yards.  The Minister wants to wipe it out altogether. If this Housing Bill is so urgently wanted, surely we must remove obstructions of that kind?  As the Minister has said, this Bill will be operated by the local authority. Deputy Briscoe, Deputy Byrne and many other Deputies are members of local authorities and those members of local authorities will exercise the powers given under this Bill with discreation. If inquiries are to be held in regard to compulsory acquisition, it is a reasonable assumption that the arbitrator will act on reasonable lines. That being so, I do not think that anyone needs to have any great worry that the personal interests or rights of the particular individuals will be unduly interfered with.  If it is necessary that the property of these people should be acquired to build houses, <Col N="2185" /> compensation is provided and the method of compensation and the procedure to obtain compensation are provided under the law.  I would ask Deputy MacEntee to withdraw this amendment and to allow this obstructive provision in the old 1883 Act to be removed in the way the Minister proposes.</P>

I can quite understand that Deputy Cowan disapproves of this somewhat belated attempt to protect the rights of private property, no matter who the owners may be.  First of all, Deputy Cowan has approached this amendment as if it were going to apply in the centre of the city where there is no such demesne.  It could possibly apply in Dublin if the boundaries were being extended or in Dún Laoghaire if it were proposed to take over land on which this type of residence might exist.  What I object to is that whereas when the local authority were taking over the whole property, compensation was heretofore fixed on the basis of the total value of the property including the house, now the local authority is going to be in a position to go to a man and say: &ldquo;We are not going to take your house but we will take the land and compensation will be paid for the land so acquired.&rdquo;</P>

Deputy Sweetman must know how these acquisitions have been carried out in the past and I want to warn him with the utmost sincerity of what will happen under this section if my interpretation of it is right.  The local authority will now come along to a man and say: &ldquo;We are going to take your bit of land but you can keep the house and we shall negotiate with you on that basis.  We are going as far as we like up to your back door or to your front door.&rdquo;  The Deputy has only to go out to parts of Dún Laoghaire and Monkstown and he will see what has happened with these old type of demesne houses.  The old house is still left there and has perhaps been converted into some kind of small hospital and all around are built these smaller types of houses.

      <P>I give Deputy Briscoe credit for all sincerity but I suggest that he has mixed up different principles.  There is first the principle of acquisition and secondly the principle of compensation.  The position heretofore has been in regard to demesne lands that no matter what compensation you offered there was a complete and absolute bar prohibiting acquisition.  That complete and absolute bar is now being removed.  So far <Col N="2187" /> as compensation is concerned, forget you are dealing with demesne land.</P>
      <P>The position as I understand it at any rate, is that if you are taking only portion of a man's land he is entitled to put forward when you come to arbitration for compensation, not merely the intrinsic value of the blades of grass or the square of land that is being taken, but in addition to that the fact that his removal from ownership of that square of land, is going to interfere with his utilising the remainder of his land. That principle, as I understand it, has always been accepted by arbitrators. If that is so, that principle is not affected in any way in this amendment of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>That principle is not affected in any way by the ministerial amendment.  The ministerial amendment provides that now you can go in and take half a man's field if it is not demesne land; taking half may mean that the other half is no use and that it is no longer an economic unit and, therefore, the compensation for the particular half should be increased.  That has been considered by arbitrators up to now and now the situation is that you are putting the demesne land into the same position and if a local authority acquires demesne land near a man's house in consequence of which the value of the house is diminished, that diminution, as I understand it, is enabled to be taken into account in fixing compensation on the land so acquired and so long as that principle is there, that diminution of the value of the residue can be taken into account.  I am afraid that the whole of Deputy Briscoe's argument falls to the ground. I think that has always been there and this amendment does not affect it.  All the amendment does is to say that demesne land can be considered in the same way as ordinary non-demesne land is considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that Deputy Sweetman's argument is correct, let us see where that leads us. Under the section the Minister or the <Col N="2188" /> local authority has power to destroy altogether the amenities of a residence which is inhabited largely because of the amenities which surround it and which, if it were not for those amenities, would not be inhabited at all. Deputy Briscoe has referred to instances of that here in the City of Dublin and the suburbs and in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire where because of the fact that lands immediately adjoining and contiguous to a house have been occupied, the house has been left derelict for a number of years until some way of using it for institutional purposes was thought of. How is that going to help the housing problem?  Certainly it is not going to lighten the burden of local authorities because as the position is, local authorities may encroach so deeply upon the private gardens surrounding a house and may build, so to speak, up to a man's door so that the house becomes at once a white elephant and is of no saleable value.  Therefore, on Deputy Sweetman's argument, the local authority must, at the public expense, at the expense of the rate-payers, because it has encroached so deeply on what might be regarded as the normal amenitsies of a residence as to destroy its whole value, compensate the owner as if it had bought the residence from him.  Is that not where Deputy Sweetman's argument leads us and is there any justification in the public interest for placing local authorities in that position?</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that Deputy Cowan should take exception to this amendment and so warmly support Section 24 in the form in which it is because we know that Deputy Cowan is the avowed enemy of the property owner.  We know that he regards the man who lives in a house with a garden as a public enemy, but do the people of the country as a whole take that extreme attitude to a person who has a house and garden?  All we are asking for is that reasonable protection should be afforded.  I think it is necessary because if Deputy Cowan and those who are with him have their way and secure control of local authorities&mdash;they are setting out to it now &mdash;how do we know&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should be glad to know where I have been personal.  I heard Deputy Cowan referring to Deputy MacEntee; referring to what Deputy MacEntee wants to do.  Surely I am entitled to point out what Deputy Cowan's avowed purpose is in public life.  He wants to take over the land of Ireland and divide it among the people who support Deputy Cowan. That is Deputy Cowan's avowed policy; but leave that to one side.  Deputy Cowan is so ashamed of his policy that when it is mentioned, he immediately takes umbrage and suggests that it is a reflection on Deputy Cowan's personal character.  If I were in the position of advocating a policy which I thought unmentionable in public, I would keep my mouth shut and turn my mind to some more rational and acceptable course in public life.  However, I am not surprised that Deputy Cowan should welcome this because this does mean that if a certain Party secures control of local authorities and wishes to abuse the power which has been given to it, it may use the amendment of the existing law which the section proposes in order to carry through, not a housing policy, but a policy of expropriation without adequate compensation.  They may drive out, if they like, and render more or less homeless, people who live in houses surrounded by a garden.  It may not necessarily be a large house but may be a modest residence which a person has built or purchased because of the fact that it is surrounded by a certain amount of territory.  I can see Deputy Sweetman shaking his head but this section does say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the deletion of the words &lsquo;the scheme shall avoid all interference with amenity of residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken...&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2190" /> I am leaving out the word &ldquo;demesne.&rdquo; If a man has a demesne of 1,200 acres surrounding his house or a home farm of 200 or 300 acres and if it is necessary to take a reasonable portion of that for the purpose of providing houses for the people, none of us is going to get up here and say that the local authority would not be justified in doing so, but this would allow any lands to be encroached upon.  The section goes on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;or with any home farm, or lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with such residence.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, no.  &ldquo;Such residence;&rdquo;&ldquo;such&rdquo; being the word relating it to &ldquo;demesne.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy is misleading himself.  He is certainly misleading the House.  The section reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The scheme shall avoid all interference with . . . amenity of residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Leave the word &ldquo;demesne&rdquo; out.  We will not raise any issue regarding demesne lands.  All we are asking is:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The scheme shall avoid all interference with &lsquo;amenity of residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken, or with any home farm, or lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with such residence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what we are anxious to preserve. As the section stands, it would mean that a person who occupies a residence&mdash;it does not matter what size the residence is if he occupies it&mdash;and portion of the land surrounding it is proposed to be taken, all the land could be taken right up to the hall door.  I do not think there can be any question of that so far as I read the section.  I think that most fair-minded Deputies will agree that that is not reasonable.  After all, if a man has built up his home, if he has reared his children in it, if he has made the garden&mdash;and it takes a long time to make a garden&mdash;if he has beautified the site, surely we are not entitled to take <Col N="2191" /> the last rood or the last square yard he has?  Under Section 24 as it stands that could be done.</P>
    <P>All we are saying is that the law ought to provide some protection against arbitrary acts which would either wholly depreciate the house if unoccupied or which would permit a man to be virtually driven out of it. That is what we are trying to secure by this amendment.  If some people think that 75 yards on either side of the residence is too much, perhaps we can come to a reasonable compromise.  I think, however, that the principle which the amendment endeavours to give effect to as a reasonable protection for a man who has lived in a house, made his home there, and whose people may have lived in it for generations should be accepted.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee has missed one very important small word in Section 24 which reads: &ldquo;The scheme shall avoid all interference with the demesne and amenity of residence.&rdquo;  It does not say &ldquo;with the demesne or amenity of residence.&rdquo; I think Deputy MacEntee, now that I have put the point to him, will agree that the effect of these words &ldquo;amenity of residence&rdquo; is merely to amplify the word &ldquo;demesne&rdquo;; that all that the section deals with is &ldquo;the demesne&rdquo;, which is part of the demesne lands and, &ldquo;amenity of residence&rdquo; which is the garden inside the demesne and the residence thereon, and that it only affects, not the small house to which the Deputy referred, but a residence and amenity on a demesne and that the amendment which the Minister is including can only affect demesne lands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is necessary to get back again to what the section actually proposes.  There has been such extravagant language used by some Deputies that you would think the local authorities were all modern Oliver Cromwells, that expropriation was to be undertaken.  This is only meant to enable a local authority to get on with a reasonable house building scheme.  Experience in recent years has shown that they have been handicapped by inability to make a reasonable approach in order to get some land.  Nobody expects a local authority to have the right to take over a whole demesne or estate.  In recent times, if one of these places had not been adjacent, they would have been building houses on the hill tops. The powers sought will be operated in a reasonable way and the same rights will be vested in the owners of demesne lands as in any farmer or any other landowner.</P>
      <P>I can see the point that Deputy MacEntee is aiming at in his amendment but, even if it were accepted, it would not cover the point he wants to cover.  As I mentioned, there are demesnes on which the house will be adjacent to the village street.  Under this amendment, the 75 yards mentioned would preclude the building of houses on the village street.  If we were to visualise local authorities making drastic and excessive use of their powers, we would have to be very cautious, but we are only seeking to remedy something which has been found to be a grievance and a hardship on local authorities.  We are allowing the same protection to the owners of demesne lands as is allowed to the ordinary farmer.  In fact, Deputy MacEntee's amendment would apply not only to demesne lands but to every residence in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> We believe that these powers will not be abused; that the local authorities will show their usual discretion in dealing with the matter.  If they do not, there can be a public inquiry and there is a right of appeal to the courts eventually.  In my opinion, that law has been too long in operation.  When you are engaged, as we are, in trying to house the people, is there any justification for this anachronism being allowed to continue?  It dates back to 1883 and has been preserved up to now. The tolerance which has always been shown by our people is a guarantee that the elected representatives will not go further in using the powers given under this Bill than is necessary to carry on housing schemes without inflicting any hardship on the owners of demesne lands.</P>
    <P>The compensation provided for is ample and what has been visualised by Deputy Briscoe is utterly impossible. I cannot see it arising.  He believes that a local authority can take over an entire demesne and build cottages right in front of a derelict house.  That is only a figment of the imagination. Even if you left the 75 yards mentioned in the amendment all round the building, it would not be in a much better position.  What will happen is that reasonable opportunity will be afforded to local authorities to secure portion of demesne lands suitable for building adjacent to local amenities.  If local authorities are inclined to go too far, provision is made for preserving the rights of owners.  I think they are perfectly safe without the amendment. I feel that the amendment would not afford any additional protection, but would definitely handicap and hinder the operations of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what protection the Minister suggests a person who might be aggrieved by this matter would have.  Is it the inquiry the Minister would propose to hold, because, if so, it might quite easily happen that the protection would be purely illusory?  Everybody knows that before that inquiry is held proposals to acquire the site have been sent up to the Department, that the question whether the site is suitable has already <Col N="2194" /> been discussed in the Department. There are few Ministers who have the time to examine exhaustively the evidence which may be adduced at an inquiry, and if it is agreed that a housing scheme on a particular site should go ahead you may have this matter settled by the Department before the inquiry is held and then it may be exceedingly difficult for anything to be done to extend the protection to the private individual.  If that is the sort of protection the Minister is holding out to this House or to people who happen to live in houses with gardens&mdash; and I must emphasise that that is at stake here&mdash;the protection is, as I have said, highly illusory and I think we should have in the statute some definite bar.</P>
      <P>It is all very well to talk of demesne lands extending, in some instances, up to the village street.  In how many cases is a demesne of such restricted area that, even if it did extend to the village street, the land which it was proposed to acquire for housing purposes would not be more than 75 yards from the residence?  There may occasionally be, throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, one or two places where the house might be within 75 yards of the village street at one particular point, but surely if that is the type of village we are considering, just as acceptable sites could be found elsewhere than on the village street. I thought the whole tendency, when we were trying to plan housing schemes and particularly housing schemes for workers who have large families, generally of young children, was to keep away from the village street and to try to secure sites which could be laid out as residential areas, but with such remoteness&mdash;while not being unduly remote&mdash;from traffic that children would not be in danger of life and limb.  Our whole idea was to try to get them off the main traffic routes. Now we are told that in the generality of cases, houses for workers in the rural areas must necessarily be built along the village street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Sweetman, Deputy Harris and other members of the Kildare County Council can point with pride to some of their most recently carried <Col N="2195" /> out housing schemes and I do not think that any one of them was along a main road or a village street.  They were set back a considerable distance from the road, and not merely have the districts been made safer for children but the general appearance and amenities of the houses have been very greatly improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That deals with the question of erecting houses along the village street.  I think they are very rare and exceptional cases and surely land is not so scarce in rural Ireland&mdash; and it is rural Ireland we are dealing with now&mdash;and in areas outside the boundaries of the county boroughs that you could not secure quite suitable sites and afford, by statute, the sort of protection which we are asking the House to extend to the person who owns a house and&mdash;let me repeat it&mdash; a small plot of land, a garden of two or three acres around it.  That is really the principle at stake.  If the Minister thinks 75 yards too great, we would be prepared to meet him, if he wishes to reduce it to 50 yards, but, in this instance, there should be some minimum left to the person who owns the residence.  The point is that, if the person wants to sell the residence and land, nobody would object, but this is a case of a local authority being empowered to step in and acquire a man's land, despite his reluctance to sell.</P>

      <P>It was felt that the terms of this section are a bit loose.  A great deal of trouble was experienced in the administration of the last Act by the drastic depreciation of valuations.

It is suggested that a house is valued in relation to the cost price but I would suggest to the Minister that it should be made perfectly clear what he means by &ldquo;cost price&rdquo;.  I am quite confident as to the meaning, but I think he should give a certain direction to the local authorities who will be administering this Act.  It could mean, first of all, the cost price of the structure. It could mean the cost price of the structure plus water charges, site works and loan charges.  It is said here that it would include the cost price, &ldquo;if any, of the legal and other incidental expenses&rdquo;.  I think it would be better if that term were clarified.</P>

He represented that the words &ldquo;and other expenses incidental thereto&rdquo; might be interpreted to relate to the word &ldquo;legal&rdquo;, whereas they are intended to relate to the &ldquo;reasonable cost of building&rdquo; (line 7).  The matter was discussed with the Parliamentary Draftsman who is satisfied that no change is necessary.  It would not clarify the sub-section.  The intention is clearer at the moment.

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to what I consider is an injustice to people who make applications for loans under the Small Dwellings Act.  Dublin corporation, in some cases, are to blame for some of the injustices that were done to such applicants through the excessive rents they asked for sites.  I would ask the Minister if any applications come to him again for sanction for rents for sites, that he would see to it that a £12 10s. rent is not forced from the unfortunate person who is building his house under the Small Dwellings Act. I hold that £7 10s. for a terrace house and £10 for a corner house is a full rent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming on to that. I asked the Minister a question some time ago as to the difference it would make in market value if a corporation were to charge £7 10s. as against £12 10s., the rent which they charged to about 100 tenants quite recently.  The Minister agreed that it would make a difference of £100 on 20 years' purchase. It made a remarkable difference in the advances that had to be made to the unfortunate tenant because the ground rent was taken into consideration in relation to the market value. I maintain that, in the case of houses under the Small Dwellings Act, ground rent should not exceed £10 so far as the municipality is concerned.  In some cases they were charged £7 10s. and in others £10, but I was amazed to see a charge of £12 10s. being imposed.  To be fair, when I protested&mdash;and others of my colleagues protested also&mdash;they reverted to the £7 10s. and £10, and I would like to know if there is any possibility of amending or altering the leases of the people who had to pay £12 10s. for their sites to Dublin corporation. I think the Minister should fix ground rent so that the people would get full value.</P>

      <P>Rents for corporation <Col N="2200" /> sites vary from £8 to £12, according to location, size, etc.  There is no question of a fine for these sites and the ground rents are reasonable in comparison with privately owned sites. In connection with a matter under discussion previously about the operation of the loans, I would like to say that I feel that the question of the date of operation of the provisions of this section is, as I said, a matter for the housing authority.  There is nothing in the section that would prevent a housing authority from reopening negotiations in respect of loans which have already been granted, but if a new mortgage was involved it would, perhaps, present certain difficulties. They will have to have regard to the circumstances of each case and to the fact that there is need to conserve their resources for future borrowers. I would like to say, however, that where negotiations for a loan are not completed at the date of the passing of the Bill, I would consider it reasonable for a housing authority to consider appeals for revised application in respect of that loan.  These are matters that I think have been adverted to.</P>

      <P>Before Section 29 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A local authority may and, if the Minister so requires shall, establish <Col N="2201" /> a Board of Appeal for the purpose of advising such local authority as to the merits, or otherwise, of applications for increases in the market value of houses, as determined in accordance with the provisions of Sections 27 and 28 of this Act, such Board of Appeal to consist of not more than three members who are conversant with the building industry and who are not employees of such local authority.</P>
    <P>It was felt that an appeal board would be essential.  Under the old Act, local authorities had a right to appoint an appeal board of three.  This amendment suggests that an appeal board be created wherever necessary and it is felt that the appeal board should consist of three qualified surveyors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that some step of this kind is essential in present circumstances because there has been very considerable hardship caused in and around the City and County of Dublin by virtue of the level of valuations which has been arrived at by the valuers.  I understand that at the moment there is some provision whereby a form of appeal board can operate but when you consider the fact that the existing valuer or valuers compose part of that appeal board it would appear that it is not the most satisfactory kind of board for this purpose.  If the Minister could consider in some way or other meeting this amendment it would be a very progressive step.  The tendency has been, over the past few years, for valuers to undervalue&mdash;to some extent at any rate&mdash;houses which are under construction.  That had a beneficial effect inasmuch as it has brought down the price of houses but, on the other hand, persons who have been availing of the loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Acts have been suffering by virtue of such undervaluation. Accordingly, I think it would be a good thing if some protective steps were taken, as suggested in this amendment, whereby, when a house is valued at a certain figure by existing valuers, and is deemed by the applicant seeking the loan to be such as not to afford him an opportunity of availing <Col N="2202" /> of the loan&mdash;as frequently happens &mdash;the applicant will have another avenue of appeal.</P>

      <P>As mentioned by the mover, there is nothing in law to prevent local authorities at present from setting up these appeal boards. It is considered, however, that it would be unwise to give statutory effect to the constitution of these boards on the grounds that it would lead almost certainly to an inflated number of applications&mdash;some reasonable, some unreasonable&mdash;for appeal. We are going to have a different type of valuation from what we have had up to now as far as &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is concerned.  The local authority will be at pains to secure a competent man to give a reasonable estimate of the cost of building.  It is within the discretion of a local authority to appoint an appeal board if they feel like doing it.  I do not think it would be wise to give statutory effect to the constitution of these boards for the reasons I have stated.  If there is machinery of that type statutorily constituted, people will be trying to make use of it unnecessarily.  After all, the local authority has discretion in regard to the appointment of such a board.  I think the statutory appointment of such a board would defeat its own ends and I am not, therefore, prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37 which stands in the name of Deputy Major de Valera:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 30 to add a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where a local authority is entitled to the immediate possession of any house and where any person is in wrongful possession of such house by reason of trepass to or upon the same, the provisions for summary recovery of the possession of a building conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, shall apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister knows what lies behind this amendment.  It is for the purpose of trying to cheapen the cost of legal proceedings for the local <Col N="2204" /> authority.  There have been cases which could not be tried in a certain court, although the actual value of the case should have been there, but had to go, maybe, to a circuit court.  The Minister is aware of the purpose behind this amendment and I think he himself would be anxious to avoid costly litigation to the local authority in cases of the kind which the amendment seeks to cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions for summary recovery of possession under sub-section (2) of Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, enable such proceedings to be taken in the District Court.</P>
      <P>The sub-section applies only to proceedings under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts.  It does not apply to proceedings under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
      <P>Section 13 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, makes the tenant of a labourer's cottage a cottier tenant, subject to a summary form of jurisdiction applicable to cottiers.</P>
      <P>It is not clear what the amendment is aimed at.  It may be designed to apply summary jurisdiction to cases of recovery of possession under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts to which summary procedure does not apply.  It is not considered desirable to introduce a summary jurisdiction procedure under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may, however, have a point about squatters in houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts and the Labourers Acts.  The present procedure for getting rid of them involves proceedings in the Circuit Court as the matter relates to ejectment on the title.  The Courts of Justice Acts, however, reserve jurisdiction in questions of title to the Circuit Court, and it would be undesirable to change this principle in a Housing Bill for a particular type of case.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think we ought to carry on with the law as we have it and I am not inclined to accept the amendment. The matter will be examined, I might say, in consultation with the commission in connection with rent restrictions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>After Section 30 to add a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>An Order for the recovery of possession of a dwelling-house or cottage provided by a local authority under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts or the Labourers Acts and of which a local authority is for the time being the landlord shall not be made unless the court considers it reasonable to make the Order.</P>
      <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill I gave the Minister an instance with which I was personally concerned on the day on which I spoke.  The position is that in the past 30 or 40 years the local authorities have become the biggest landlords in the country &mdash; some tens of thousands of houses are owned by local authorities.  Under the Acts governing these houses, notice to quit could be issued by the local authorities and proceedings brought in the District Court or in a summary court.</P>
      <P>The very fact of the notice to quit being issued meant that the local authority was entitled to obtain a decree for possession and the summary court or the district justice could not inquire into the merits or inquire as to whether or not the local authority had good grounds for bringing proceedings. All the summary court or the district justice could do was simply to give a decree for possession on the grounds that notice to quit had been served by the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was not too bad in the old days when the local authority had to make up its mind whether or not it would bring proceedings.  In that case, the occupant of the labourer's cottage or the local authority house had protection, because the local councillors would have to meet and pass a resolution to eject the particular individual from his house.  If such matter were on the stocks, the person concerned had a right to interview the local councillors, put his case, and the merits of his case were, in fact, argued <Col N="2206" /> by the local authority before proceedings were brought.</P>
    <P>To that extent he had some protection, but the introduction of the Management Acts introduced a new feature into this legislation.  It deprived the individual of whatever protection he had under the local authorities as previously constituted and, under the Management Acts, the power of eviction is given to the county manager or city manager and the local councillors have no say in it.  If the county manager or the city manager decides to evict a person on some information that may be given to him privately &mdash; and, unfortunately, I have come across instances of that happening &mdash; he directs a notice to quit to be served.  It is served and the person is brought down to court. He has no defence and the district justice has no option, however grievous a wrong may be done to the individual, but to give a decree for possession.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already a case which came to my knowledge a couple of weeks ago in the City of Dublin where an individual and his son, under 16 years of age, had some difficulty with a caretaker.  The caretaker of the flats sent a letter to his superior saying: &ldquo;Serve a notice to quit on this family.&rdquo; That letter was written on 6th April and on 14th April the notice to quit was served by an official of the corporation, and was alleged to be under the authority of the city manager.  That very decent man, who has been living in a corporation house with his family for over 30 years, was brought to court and, on evidence that the notice to quit had been served and possession demanded, the district justice, although he was most sympathetic, had no option but to order an eviction.</P>
    <P>No person could stand over that.  It has also arisen in many cases through the country in connection with proceedings to dispossess occupants of labourers' cottages from their cottages, and practising solicitors who very often come into court to try to put up some kind of front for the unfortunate person, know they have no case going in.  The district justice knows they have no case, but very sympathetic justices will adjourn cases for some period so that some pressure may be <Col N="2207" /> brought to bear on the county manager and that the order of eviction may not stand.</P>
    <P>This question of the rights to possession of a house is a very important one. Against the landlords who were in this country in other days it was a fight that was carried on for many years, a very bloody fight, but eventually that fight was successful, and the tenants of ordinary houses got protection by Statute.  I have felt for a number of years, and I have advocated it, that there should be statutory protection given to the occupants of local authority houses and, if they are to be put out, let them be put out on a case which, to the justice hearing all the facts, is sufficient for him to make the order of ejection.</P>
    <P>I have said that the city councils, the county councils and the town councils or town commissioners have no say whatsoever, good, bad or indifferent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly they have no say in Dublin so far as the bringing of proceedings against the tenant is concerned.  I feel this is an opportunity given to us now of giving a certain measure of protection to tens of thousands of tenants so that they can only be put out of their cottage or their house in which, perhaps, they and members of their family have lived for generations, for reasonable cause, such cause as will commend itself to the district justice who hears the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister and the House to accept this amendment.  I want to make it perfectly clear to the Minister that when I drafted the amendment I tried to do it in a very simple way by deleting a sub-section out of the Rent Acts, and the Ceann Comhairle told me that it was not in order <Col N="2208" /> in that form.  It was so important that I was very anxious to get it on the Paper, and I redrafted it in the form in which it now appears, in order.  It has nothing to do with the Rent Acts, for which the Minister for Justice is responsible; it has only to do with the Minister for Local Government and with local authorities.  It has no object other than that set out in its wording &mdash; to give some reasonable protection to the tenant of a local authority house so that he cannot be thrown out at the whim of a county manager or a city manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will not accept this amendment.  Deputy Cowan has recited a lot of theory in so far as it concerns city government. He has spoken this evening as one who not only has no knowledge of the practice that operates, but apparently is very far away from it.  In this age, he is asking us to approach the State and local authority provision of houses for the working classes in the same manner as were the approaches to the Irish people under the absentee landlords. Deputy Cowan talks about a notice to quit and suggests that any official of the Dublin Corporation, if he dislikes a tenant, can send up a docket to the city manager to put the man out, and the city manager acts on that.  I can assure the Minister it is not that easy.  A notice to quit is resorted to by officials of the Dublin Corporation &mdash; I can speak with knowledge only of the Dublin Corporation &mdash; only on what is called &ldquo;good cause&rdquo;. We have our own legal department, which will consider it.  There are two types of case where notice to quit can be brought in, as far as I know &mdash; one is arrears of rent and the other is where the individual so misconducts himself and so misbehaves that he becomes a nuisance to his neighbours and some steps have to be taken, but that is under an approach to a district justice.  What does Deputy Cowan want to introduce?  What does he want to suggest as a power to be given to the ordinary district justice?  It is in the amendment &mdash;&ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. What does he mean by &ldquo;reasonable?&rdquo; The district justices are always reasonable. <Col N="2209" /> If a person has the misfortune to be in arrears of rent through circumstances which are genuinely sad and hard, the district justice will not give an order for possession if there is a willingness to make an attempt to pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the point.  In the City of Dublin we are becoming very rapidly a vast landlord.  Whoever the representatives of the city will be will have the responsibility, on behalf of the ratepayers and to a certain extent of the taxpayers, of continuing to build houses and set them to the citizens, under the best circumstances they can do it, for the purpose of not putting on the backs of the ratepayers unreasonable rates by maladministration. One of the serious things that could happen is that we could have a &ldquo;No Rent Campaign&rdquo;.  We could have, in any section of the city at any given moment, some gentleman organising that.  The State and the local authority have recognised the need for proper housing accommodation for the people and are considering the best way to adopt this differential rent, although it is a very much discussed matter at the moment.  For the purpose of immediately reducing rents, where persons suddenly find themselves unable to pay the rents previously agreed on and where all this is taken into account, we could have some active gentleman organising a &ldquo;No Rent Campaign&rdquo; in Dublin.  You could have the city threatened with complete chaos, if we attempt, in this kind of legislation, to interfere with the <Col N="2210" /> ordinary protection of the public and the State in the ordinary course of law as we understand it.</P>
      <P>I do not think the Minister would agree that there has been any harsh treatment, generally speaking, in any part of the country by any local authority.  I want to say this here in the House &mdash; I am saying this as a member of the Dublin Corporation &mdash; that if an officer of the corporation, a caretaker in the building of flats, because he did not like the colour of someone's eyes or for some unfair reason, got a notice to quit against a tenant without justification, I feel sure that the Labour organisations to which that official might belong would be very glad to sit on him and punish him very severely.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not necessary, in my opinion.  There were 12,000 prosecutions in Dublin in a period of two years by the Dublin Corporation against its tenants, and there were 21 evictions in the whole two years, possibly because these evictions, in certain individual cases, were justified.  You are bound to have a black sheep where we have so many thousands of tenants and, when you have this tremendous liability and this risk on the shoulders of the people who are ratepayers, you cannot afford to be giving the impression that you are going to be generally lenient and generally &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does Deputy Cowan mean by &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;?  If there is a flaw in the method of procedure against tenants of a local authority, I suggest that that is a matter for the Department of Justice, to bring in legislation under the auspices of the Minister for Justice and to have something done. Those of us who are not legal men are <Col N="2211" /> concerned only with the ordinary layman's administration of local affairs, and we cannot be expected to understand all the intricacies of legal documents and legal practice.  I am satisfied that the position should be left as it is. There is a sufficient margin of safety for the people and the corporation is not unreasonable in its treatment of its tenants.  The proof of that lies in that nobody is afraid to become a corporation tenant.  We do not find people afraid of that, as they get decent treatment and if they, in return, give the corporation decent treatment and behaviour, we can continue to build the houses as fast as we can and will not be retarded by any fear that would become inherent in the backs of the minds of the people if such an amendment were to be part of the local authority housing legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>What recommends this amendment most to me is that under the present system the district justice is nothing more than a rubber stamp. Provided that the formalities necessary for a valid notice to quit are complied with, the district justice has no discretion whatever and in matters of this kind he is simply a penny-in-the-slot machine.  Provided that the formal proofs, as we know them, are in order, the district justice, however sympathetic he may be, has to say to the tenant who is defendant before him that, while he is very sorry, he has no power to refuse the application of the local authority for the order of ejectment.</P>

      <P>The position at present is so incredible that reasonable men just cannot understand that the position is so.  Deputy Cowan and I are speaking from practical experience. If any district justice is consulted he will admit that he is nothing more than a penny-in-the-slot machine; once the formal proofs are in order &mdash; that is, the notice to quit in valid form and the proof that it has been served on the tenant&mdash;there is no obligation on the complainant to give any grounds whatever.  Now there have been cases to my knowledge of reasonable applications for an adjournment. There have been cases in which the district justice, if he had a discretion, would exercise it in favour of the tenant sought to be ejected. There have been cases, for instance, where the local authority fails to keep a cottage in a proper state of repair and where the tenant, in desperation, says: &ldquo;I will not pay the rent until this cottage is put into a proper state of repair and until the local authority fulfils its contractual obligation to me under the agreement.&rdquo;  All his pleas with the local authority fail, and he adopts this course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>No rent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The local authority then comes along and says: &ldquo;This tenant is not paying the rent; let him have a notice to quit,&rdquo; and out the tenant goes.  He is not permitted to put up the defence in court that the local authority has failed in its contractual obligation to him.  The district justice has to say to him: &ldquo;Under the law as it stands, even if the local authority has failed in its contractual obligation to you, I am afraid I cannot pay any heed to that; you have a contractual obligation to the local authority, and you have to fulfil that; I cannot let one cancel the other out.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now, I had on to-day's Order Paper a question to the Minister for Local Government about a case in point in County Tipperary where the local authority over a period of one year failed to repair properly the roof of a bedroom occupied by a man suffering from tuberculosis; the roof is leaking. They had some dispute with the contractor.  They were offered labour. But this man is left under a leaky roof all the time.  If the man refuses to pay his rent the local authority can go to the district justice, who has no discretion and who cannot say whether the local authority is acting reasonably or unreasonably in its attitude, and the district justice will have to give the order for possession.  I agree there are times when the district justice can say to the county council solicitor: &ldquo;I think that this is a case in which justice would be done by adjourning the case for two or three months.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact he usually does that in cases where the local authority's reason for the ejectment proceedings is failure to pay rent.  But if the solicitor says: &ldquo;My instructions are to oppose any application for an adjournment or any suggestion of any adjournment,&rdquo; the district justice has to forgo his own desires and the application of the defendant for the grant of an adjournment. For the sake of common-sense, this amendment ought to be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am not opposed to any reasonable protections against eviction, but I certainly do object to anyone suggesting that local authorities or managers have behaved in anything like the way it has been suggested they have behaved.  I have been a member of a local body over a period of 30 years and I cannot recall a single instance of any harsh eviction except for forcible possession.  There have been a few for non-payment of rent and my experience is not that the district justice did not refuse the conviction; they have done it.  But where the local authority refused to carry out their duties, they have refused it.</P>

      <P>It does not matter. The district justices are not fools any more than anybody else.  In fact they have been sympathetic to the tenants. I do not mind about precautions being taken, but I do not think it is right to suggest that the local authorities or the managers have been in any way harsh on the tenants of labourers' cottages. They have not.  The records will prove the contrary.  I have seen cases recently where there was even forcible possession taken by tenants and the district justices adjourned the cases.  They did not refuse the application, but they adjourned the case.  The sympathy has always been, to my knowledge, in favour of the tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say that, notwithstanding the assurance given by Deputy Cowan that this amendment does not infringe in any shape or form on the Rent Restrictions Acts, I am of opinion that it is an astute approach to the rent restrictions code and does offer a protection that should be intended only for that code.  I believe that, in dealing with local <Col N="2216" /> authority housing, there ought to be a different approach altogether.  These tenants are not rack-rented tenants. They are subsidised tenants.  Exceptional cases may occur.  I think the case referred to by Deputy Cowan was an exceptional case of hardship.  It is certainly not the rule with local authorities to deal in a harsh manner with their tenants.  Many of the members of this House are members of local authorities, and I think all of them will agree that, generally speaking, local authorities are not inclined to be over-drastic in the use of their powers in regard to tenants or to evict them.  The case that Deputy Cowan quoted was a hardship case.  It was not by any means a typical case.  There were some extraordinary circumstances in connection with it.  I may tell the Deputy that I had the matter inquired into and that the eviction is not going to take place.  It is a kind of thing that ought not to have happened. Some aggravating circumstances led up to the action that was taken.</P>
      <P>I believe that local authorities would be restricted by the Deputy's amendment.  They have certain functions to carry out, and have certain building programmes to get through.  There is a question of transferring people into reserved houses. They have to get that done in a specific period.  In my opinion, this is a matter that would arise more properly in connection with the Rent Restrictions Commission.  I can tell the Deputy that I am having a representative who will attend before that commission.  He can have the question raised there, and perhaps get some adjustment of it.  The amendment, however, could not be accepted at this time.</P>

      <P>Here is where the mistake was made.  There is a rent restrictions code which clearly means what it says, that it is a code which prevents an unlawful increase of rent. Now, into that code, somebody imported sections dealing with evictions which have nothing to do with rent restrictions.  They also imported a little section which said that &ldquo;the Rent Acts will not apply to local authorities.&rdquo;</P>

That is the law at the moment &mdash; that he has to prove to the court that he must be put out.  Now, what we are trying to do is to give to the tenants of local authority houses &mdash; I am glad that Deputy Lynch is arriving now &mdash; the protection in regard to ejectment that an individual has who is the tenant of a rapacious, or otherwise, private landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I fully appreciate the point of view which Deputy <Col N="2219" /> O'Rourke has expressed.  He agrees that it is right there should be protection, but in his experience he has never seen this Act improperly used against tenants.  I accept that in regard to quite a number of counties, but unfortunately, we run up against cases where, in the City of Dublin alone, there are on a Friday morning probably 150 cases for ejectment on notice to quit.  Now, most of these are in regard to the non-payment of rent.  What really happens is that the district justice makes a decree.  The man concerned goes and sees the housing committee.  He pays the arrears of rent and the cost of the proceedings, and the ejectment does not take place. In actual fact, anything from 100 to 300 cases, of orders made to evict, take place every Friday in the City of Dublin.  That will come as a great surprise to Deputy O'Rourke.  A solicitor may go down and say to the district justice: &ldquo;I object to this man being put out and I want to have the local authority give reasons.&rdquo;  The representative of the local authority will say: &ldquo;Sir, we are not bound to give any reasons, and we do not give any reason.&rdquo;  I am only saying what happens that from 150 to 300 cases are dealt with in a forenoon.</P>
      <P>Now what happens?  We will say that Deputy Briscoe is the tenant of a corporation house, and that he owes three weeks' rent.  The whole procedure that takes place in the District Court is this, and I want Deputies to appreciate it: Robert Briscoe's name is called out and an official gets up and says: &ldquo;10/6/50.  18/6/50.&rdquo;  Another person says: &ldquo;17/6.  52/6,&rdquo; and the justice says: &ldquo;Decree.&rdquo;  That is the whole hearing of the case.</P>

      <P>What I want the House to realise is that whether a person is a private tenant or the tenant of a corporation house, there are certain things on which the court will always find it reasonable to eject him. For instance, if he does not pay the rent, that is a reasonable case for ejectment in the case of any tenant, corporation or otherwise.  If he is a nuisance and that is established by evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would have much preferred when I introduced this amendment that it would have gained <Col N="2221" /> a certain amount of support.  I certainly am disappointed when I look back on the fights that were made for the protection of tenants to find Deputy Briscoe getting up in this House and leading the attack against something that is necessary to give protection to the tenants of local authority houses in Dublin and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>I do not want to go into the matter at any greater length.  I have put forward this case and I have advocated it for many years.  I was delighted to get an opportunity on this Bill to put down this amendment and I still ask the Minister to accept it.  It does not interfere with the rents.  If there was a question, as Deputy Briscoe suggested, of somebody starting a no-rent campaign, they can all be put out. There is no protection in this for non-payment of rent, but at least there is this protection: that whenever a tenant is brought to court, the local authority should give some reason to the justice for requiring the eviction of that tenant.  I want to assure Deputy O'Rourke and the Minister that every district justice in the country supports this amendment of the law, which would enable him to <Col N="2222" /> use his discretion in appropriate cases to see that a person is not evicted except on grounds and for reasons that to the district justice seem to be reasonable.</P>

Of these 30,000 tenants, many of whom I am afraid are in arrear with their rents judging by the evidence which has transpired, some of whom may be disorderly and an intolerable nuisance to their neighbours, there were only 21 evicted.  So far as the Deputy adduced evidence, he referred to only one case. What I am really concerned with is the true motive behind this amendment. I think it was revealed to the House, perhaps unwittingly, by the Deputy in introducing the amendment.  He said that notwithstanding the fact that there is a saver for the rights of local authorities under the Rent Restrictions Act, in regard to recovery of their premises, solicitors sometimes go into court on behalf of people for whom they can do nothing and make a sort of show before the district justice and <Col N="2223" /> their clients in order to justify the fees which they subsequently collect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Second Schedule, I want to ask the Minister one question.  There is, of course, provision in the Second Schedule by virtue of which there are different scales of grants where sewerage and piped water supplies are available.  It is not possible to put down an amendment to the Schedule because it would mean an increase in the charge, but I want to make a suggestion to the Minister that he should make some provision by virtue of which if a person building a house installs the appropriate sanitary appliances for water and sewerage, and then perhaps some six to 12 months afterwards when the local authority puts in the appropriate mains, connects with those mains, the difference between the smaller grant and the larger grant can be paid.  There are at the present time in County Kildare many people building houses who are not able to connect with water or <Col N="2228" /> sewerage because the water and sewerage schemes are only at the moment being put in by the local authority.  The houses will be completed and the grants will be paid by the Department before the sewerage and water schemes are ready for connection. We understand that in these cases the people concerned will only qualify for the type of grant specified in the Second Schedule to this Bill and in the Second Schedule to the Act of 1948.  I suggest to the Minister that he should try to ensure, where a person is building a house and puts in sanitary services in contemplation of what the local authority are going to do to make main supplies available, that when these main supplies are ultimately connected the difference between the two grants will be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephPatrickBrennan" hpid="Dr. Brennan Dr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In Question 35, which I put to the Minister for Industry and Commerce to-day with regard to the prices charged for tomatoes, with the object of protecting and encouraging the commendable efforts of tomato growers, I asked the Minister if he would enforce an Order controlling the prices of home-grown tomatoes on the basis of adding a percentage charge to the market price.  The Minister did not see fit to accept the proposal which my question conveyed.  I regret that, because the weapon which he used to defend the policy of non-interference by his Department in order to protect Irish tomato growers was the whip of the imported tomatoes.  That is the way in which he refused what Irish tomato growers might have been led to expect from a native Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent weeks it has been noticeable that tomatoes which were bought in the market from 10d. to 1/6 and, in one case, to 1/9 per lb., were sold in shops which were quite adjacent to <Col N="2230" /> one another at 2/-, 2/6 and 3/-.  I think that a Department which permits undue profiteering by any retailing section of the community is failing in its duty &mdash; that it should not only protect the tomato growers, but the purchasing public.  It is no answer to state that this control is exercised by the importation of foreign tomatoes.</P>
    <P>About two weeks ago tomatoes reached a phenomenal price in the Dublin shops.  It is true to say, in justification of the Minister's attitude, that there were no Dutch tomatoes for sale on the Dublin market at that time.  If there is on the part of the tomato growers as well as on the part of the retailers a desire to avail of every opportunity offered to profiteer at the expense of the public, surely that is a still greater reason why the Department should control the price of tomatoes.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the reply to my question that control of that nature would be impracticable.  It seems to me that the Department is failing in its duty.  It is failing to protect the public and failing to encourage the development of this industry, and I think we may say that it is following in the tradition of its predecessors in evading a responsibility which it ought to bear, in the interests of an industry which does deserve the greatest encouragement.</P>

      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Brennan is a very important one, and it is one to which I have referred before in the House.  It seems to me that, if definite steps are not taken to regulate prices in the tomato-growing industry, and on the sales side of that industry, the industry is bound to find itself in a bad plight.  I understand that representations have been made at various times to both the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce by the representatives of the tomato growers as to the difficult situation in which native growers have found themselves over the past year or two.  That difficult situation arises very largely from the unrestricted imports of Dutch tomatoes which occur <Col N="2231" /> during the months of the year when the native crop is most plentiful, during July, August, September and October.</P>
      <P>This industry consists largely of approximately 650 growers.  It represents a capital investment of £1,500,000, that is, in the provision of glass-houses, heating equipment and so on.  The tomato growers' organisation claims that they employ something in the neighbourhood of 1,000 operatives.  That number may be subject to examination, but, to my own knowledge, the number of men actually employed in the Dublin area runs into some hundreds, so far as wage workers are concerned.  In my own constituency of North County Dublin, in Rush and Lusk and Skerries particularly, and in other parts of the county, there are a considerable number of small landowners, small farmers with anything from half an acre to four or five acres, working at this industry for a long period and trying to get a living from it.</P>
      <P>During the years of the war, when imports of any kind were impossible, there was a pretty substantial return to any person who embarked on this particular line of business, and indeed the criticism which could have been made then was that no restriction whatever was placed, during those years, upon the price of tomatoes as they came to the consuming public. However, since the end of the war, with imports of all kinds becoming available to a greater extent, the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;and, we may assume, the Minister for Industry and Commerce &mdash; has adopted a policy of allowing unrestricted import of Dutch tomatoes, and this is having a disastrous effect upon the tomato-growing industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it clear that, in raising this issue, I am not advocating an absolutely free hand for the Irish grower.  I do not think it should be allowed.  I do not think a situation wherein native growers can charge whatever price they like for tomatoes is any more desirable than the present situation, but there is a happy medium, and I think a situation can <Col N="2232" /> be brought about wherein the native grower can get a fair price for his produce and the consuming public will have to pay no more than a fair price for the tomato for which their taste has become so cultivated in the past seven or eight years.  Any examination of the prices paid to the growers for tomatoes either last year or during the present year will prove very conclusively that, when there is a limited importation of Dutch tomatoes, the price to the Irish growers can be satisfactory, but that, when Dutch tomatoes are allowed in in large quantities, the price falls disastrously. In August of last year, for best quality Irish tomatoes, the price fell as low as 9d. and 7d. per lb., and in September of last year the price on the Dublin market fell to 7d. and 6d. per lb. in various weeks.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in the House by advocates of free imports of tomatoes from other countries that the advantage is that the consuming public, the vast number of working-class people in the City of Dublin and throughout the country who want to buy tomatoes can buy them at a reasonable price, because there is this element of competition, this degree of imports from Holland; but I think that is being pushed to the point where the entire native industry is threatened with destruction.  I do not think that Irish people, the ordinary Dublin City dweller or any person throughout the country who has a liking for tomatoes &mdash; and, as I have said, this taste for tomatoes has largely grown up over the past seven or eight years amongst our people&mdash;would object to the payment of a couple of pence extra per lb. for the Irish product because it is generally admitted by those who eat tomatoes that the Irish tomato is a better product, that it has a better flavour and a greater appeal to our people, so that it is not unreasonable that the growers should request some kind of preferential treatment, and I do not think they have asked for anything unreasonable in what they have been putting forward.</P>
    <P>I understand that, on 23rd February this year, the Agricultural Association of Ireland, which represents these <Col N="2233" /> growers, put before the Minister the suggestion that there should be restriction of imports on a quota basis and that such quota should not be operated except when the price of Irish tomatoes fell to 1/- per lb.  Surely we can at least consider, without any heat or histrionics, the possibility of guaranteeing a price on that level to our own people. I think we can assume that, if steps are taken to regulate this industry, it will expand and develop.  The fact that no steps of that kind were taken led to abuses, when they did occur, in the past.  We do not want to see any recurrence of fancy prices for tomatoes, but we do want to see a guaranteed fair price for the men who have invested their capital in the growing of tomatoes and who are employing labour.</P>
    <P>The present situation in so far as those who are engaged for wages in the industry are concerned is that, when they seek increased wages from their employers, they are informed that, because of the uncertainty of the future of the trade, nothing can be done.  We want some degree of certainty brought to this trade.  It can be a very great asset and of very great value to the nation as a whole.  I consider that the suggestion made by the association that there should be quota restrictions on the import of tomatoes is very reasonable.</P>
    <P>The reply to the question put down by Deputy Dr. Brennan to-day indicated that the Minister was of the opinion that because of the various types and grades of tomatoes such regulation of price would be impossible. I do not subscribe to that view at all.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Minister and his Department to find some way of saving this trade from extinction which, apparently, faces it if steps are not taken.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that in 1949 the total imports of tomatoes amounted to 2,533 tons, to the value of £500,000.  I am informed by people in the trade that Dutch tomatoes have been imported and sold in the City of Dublin at the price which was paid for them or at a loss in many cases.  It is difficult <Col N="2234" /> to understand why that should happen.  It is even more difficult to understand how the Dutch can export and ship to this country tomatoes which can be retailed at 1/4 per lb.  It has been suggested that that can be done only by a method of subsidisation peculiar to Holland.  That appears to be the case.  Otherwise, having regard to the cost of production and transportation, it would be manifestly impossible to sell Dutch tomatoes here at 1/4 per lb.</P>
    <P>Irish tomato growers, as I understand it, do not ask for subsidisation. They do not ask for any preferential treatment other than that which is accorded to most industries that we have encouraged in this country.  It has been the policy to encourage native industry.  Some time ago a circular was read at meetings of local authorities from the Minister for Industry and Commerce directing that as far as possible local authorities should encourage native industry in every possible way, should encourage the purchase of goods manufactured and produced in Ireland, and that all possible steps should be taken to make native industry as prosperous as it could be so that the maximum degree of employment could be maintained. Here we have a native industry which is of vital importance because it produces, I will not describe it as an essential foodstuff, but a foodstuff that is becoming part of the ordinary diet in most working-class homes.  With that huge market available, we should see to it that tomatoes are produced in this country in sufficient quantity, if possible, to meet our own requirements.</P>

      <P>I understand that, and I will conclude in a minute.  First, we should see to it that tomatoes are produced in sufficient quantities to meet our own requirements; secondly, that a price is guaranteed to the grower which will enable him to operate his business satisfactorily with some degree of security and without fear of loss: <Col N="2235" /> thirdly, and equally important, that tomatoes will be provided for the public at a price which they can afford to pay, a fair and reasonable price.  That can be done either by quota restrictions or by fixation of prices at various levels.</P>
      <P>Finally, I want to make this suggestion to the Minister and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to convey it to him: the situation can be met if the Minister will call a conference representative of all the interests in this industry &mdash; growers, retailers, wholesalers and workers.</P>

      <P>Time is running out and I do not want to encroach upon the time of the Parliamentary Secretary, who will be replying.  If there is anything wrong with the policy that is now being pursued in respect of the tomato-growing industry, the Deputies who have raised this question and who have spoken in regard to it have the remedy in their own hands.  I believe that there is a good deal wrong with the policy that is being pursued by the present Government towards this industry.  I believe that the origin of that policy dates back to the occasion on which the present Minister for Agriculture expressed his attitude towards the Gaeltacht scheme. We have had a continuance ever since of the hostility which was expressed at that time, which can only be rectified by Deputies who are supporting this Government taking action and adopting an attitude entirely different from that of merely coming in here and raising this matter after the business of the Dáil has concluded, for the purpose of getting a little bit of local publicity.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputies appreciate too well the immense advantages that this Government has brought to the country to be in any way deceived by Deputy Smith's intervention. I have no doubt that Deputies appreciate that it has been our aim to provide the public with tomatoes at a reasonable price.  I think we can claim that that has been achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the question put down by Deputy Dr. Brennan to-day, he wished to ascertain what steps the Minister would take to protect Irish tomato growers and the purchasing public.  In reply to the Deputy, I informed him that a price of 1/4 per lb. has been fixed for imported tomatoes, but that it was not practicable to enforce control of home-grown tomatoes.  When the Deputy raised the question on the Adjournment to-night, he referred to this answer and said that it was essential to introduce some control to protect the public.  The aim of the Government has been to allow sufficient <Col N="2237" /> imports to ensure that the public are not exploited, but, in order to provide a measure of protection to home-growers, a duty of 2d. per lb. is operative from June to October.  That provides protection to home-growers while it allows, during scarce periods, imports of tomatoes which, in turn, ensure that adequate supplies are available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dunne discussed a number of questions which raise the difficulty of providing protection for an industry of this sort, at the same time ensuring that the public are not exploited.  The Deputy is anxious to see some form of control or assistance provided for the people who have invested their money in the industry or who are deriving their livelihood from it and, on the other hand, he is equally anxious to see that the public are not exploited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is felt that it is necessary to provide the home growers with protection by a duty of 2d. per lb.  It has secured the achievement of a fair price for tomatoes except in very exceptional circumstances when a short period of scarcity may occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Brennan referred to the fact that, during a period recently, tomatoes were bought at as low as from 10d. to 1/6 per lb. and subsequently sold at 2/-, 2/6 or 3/-.  I think the Deputy will realise that tomatoes are different in size and quality and <Col N="2238" /> that it is not practicable to enforce a price control except, possibly, on a weight basis.  The home-grown tomatoes are sold, in a number of instances, in the market but they are also sold directly to shops that are supplied by home growers.  It is not, I think, easy to see what steps could be taken which would ensure effective control in these instances but, in so far as imported tomatoes are concerned, the price of 1/4, which has been fixed, has made it possible for the public here to get tomatoes at a reasonable price.  Last week, or the week ending the 14th of this month, the prices on the Dublin market ranged from 1/- to 1/6 compared with 2/4 to 2/6 per lb. the previous week.  During that week, a consignment of 30,000 boxes of Dutch tomatoes was imported and I understand that a further consignment is expected in the near future.  The prices of tomatoes which have operated recently have been satisfactory.  There are occasional exceptions.  I think Deputy Dunne will also agree that the duty which has been imposed has provided a measure of protection.  It may be that the protection is not sufficient in every instance, but the delicate question of where adequate protection is provided and at the same time a reasonable price for the goods operates is one which varies from time to time according to supply or according to the quantity which is available from home and imported sources.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.25 p.m. until Wednesday, 25th October, 1950.</P>
