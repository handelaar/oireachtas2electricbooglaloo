    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether the Government have yet concluded their consideration of methods of bringing under review the activities and financial operations of the various State-sponsored bodies; and, if so, if they propose to take any action in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The consideration of this matter by the Government, although not yet concluded, has reached an advanced stage.  Its outcome will probably entail proposals either for a Resolution of Dáil Éireann amending the Standing Orders of the House or for legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in view of all the existing circumstances, he will consider the setting up of an all-Party committee charged with the task of drawing up an agreed programme for the revival of Irish as the spoken language of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the revival of Irish can be assisted by State action.  I am satisfied that the appropriate instrument for that purpose is the Government and that no advantage would be gained by the establishment <Col N="680" /> of an all-Party committee, as suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach, perhaps, reconsider that in the light of the public expression of dissatisfaction made by the Gaelic League in connection with the use of Irish in the Oireachtas and the Civil Service? Would the Taoiseach not consider that this is a major outstanding national problem which should be approached in the same way as Partition was approached, by the setting up of an all-Party committee?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  So far from achieving the purpose by the suggestion embodied in the question, I think the setting up of such a committee might very easily have the opposite effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the high incidence of emigration from the Gaeltacht areas generally, would the Taoiseach not agree that the first step would be to provide employment for as many as possible at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter has been attended to, as was announced in the House last week or the week before.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details, including the name of appointee, post, salary and expenses of each appointment made directly by the Government since February, 1948, including appointments made by the Government to semi-State concerns.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has any statement to make on the guarantee given by Mr. Chuter Ede, British Home Secretary, to the Prime Minister of the Six Counties of closer co-operation and ties between the Government of Great Britain and that of the Six Counties at a recent dinner of the London-Ulster Association.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The only information I have about the statement made by Mr. Chuter Ede on the occasion to which the Deputy refers is derived from newspaper reports, which do not confirm the suggestion that the statement contained a guarantee to the Prime Minister of the Six Counties. So far as the statement bore upon Partition, I can only repeat what I have, in effect, said so often before: that an overwhelming majority of the Irish people are justly determined to secure the reunification of the national territory and that that determination, supported, as it is, by informed opinion throughout the world, must eventually prevail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the statement which has just been made by the Taoiseach be considered as a guarantee to the nationalists of the Six Counties in the same light as Mr. Chuter Ede's statement was a guarantee to Sir Basil Brooke?</P>

      <P>I should think it would have a much better effect for the nationalists in the Six Counties than the statement to which the Deputy refers as having been made by Mr. Chuter Ede because he gave no such guarantee, as far as I can gather from the newspapers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The present price of 62/6 per barrel is the highest yet guaranteed for wheat by an Irish Government and I consider that it provides ample encouragement for any farmer with land suitable for the growing of the crop.</P>
      <P>As far as imported wheat is concerned, I would point out that when allowance has been made for drying and screening losses, the cost of native wheat is at least equal to the cost of first-quality Manitoba wheat and is appreciably more than the cost of imported wheat of comparable quality. Under the International Wheat Agreement, we are assured of a substantial proportion of our wheat requirements for the next few years at prices no higher than those obtaining at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether, in view of the grave scarcity and increased cost of fodder and concentrated feeding-stuffs and the increased cost of production of milk, and the fact that there is a remunerative market for butter on the Continent, he is now prepared to review the price of milk both for liquid <Col N="711" /> consumption and for delivery to creameries with a view to increasing these prices.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the claim that there is a grave scarcity of feeding stuffs nor do I agree with the other implications in the Deputy's question. As I indicated this week at Kilkenny, our farmers can produce an excellent feeding cereal, at substantially lower cost than they are now paying for imported feeding stuffs, which with grass ensilage and potatoes renders winter feeding independent of imported foodstuffs.  If they do not do so and prefer to pay more for the imported article, they have only themselves to blame.  Continental markets for butter are precarious and difficult and cannot be depended on to provide a remunerative outlet for our surplus production of butter at present milk prices to creameries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware of the serious situation confronting the winter fishing industry at Burtonport, Bunbeg and other ports in North-West Donegal where quantities of first-class herrings are being landed and are being sold with great difficulty by the fishermen at an uneconomic price; and if <Col N="713" /> he will indicate what steps are being taken by him to assist the fishermen in disposing of their catches at an economic figure so as to ensure the continuity of this industry which is so valuable to County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the difficulty recently experienced by Donegal fishermen in disposing of their landings of herring has been due to the fact that the landings contained a considerable proportion of spent fish and fish ready to spawn.  Such fish are not in a suitable condition for curing owing to the almost complete absence of fat in the flesh.  Furthermore, supplies of herring in better condition from other places on the coast were plentiful thus limiting the demand for the Donegal fish in the fresh state on the Dublin market.  The Sea Fisheries Association is doing everything possible to help in clearing the Donegal landings and it is expected that as the fish improve in condition the position will become more satisfactory for the fishermen in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if his Department has any definite plans to deal with the situation that will undoubtedly arise when heavier catches are landed?  When the weather improves sufficiently the catches will be much heavier and the fishermen are anxious to know now if his Department has any plan to deal with the situation that will undoubtedly arise then.  I can assure the Minister that the catches at the moment are prime, first-class herring and the officials of his Department are probably aware of that by now.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that if consignments of herring reaching Dublin from that part of the coast do not contain from 57 to 82 per cent. of spent or spawning fish the difficulty of disposing of them on the fresh market in Dublin will be very materially reduced.</P>

      <P>Applications have been received from a number of coal importers for permission to purchase coal of U.S.A. origin.  No dollars have been provided in respect of any of these applications.  U.S.A. is not a normal source of supply for coal and accordingly no provision was made for coal imports in the programming of dollar expenditures for the present year.  The available dollars have already been committed for imports of essential commodities such as grains, raw sugar, tobacco, petrol and machinery.  The dollar cost of any substantial purchase of coal from U.S.A. would be considerable and could not be contemplated until it is beyond doubt that such expenditure is unavoidable.  Some success has attended efforts to secure supplies from the continent and efforts are also being made to secure an improvement in deliveries from Britain. The position is being kept constantly under review.</P>
      <P>I have no precise information as to what the current c.i.f. cost of domestic coal imported from the U.S.A. would be.  The tentative information furnished by coal importers in connection with their applications suggests that the c.i.f. cost would range from 107/- to 121/- per ton, but I cannot say how the quality of this coal would compare with that of coal imported from other sources.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority has been asked to pay particular attention to the question of industrial development in rural areas, including the counties mentioned by the Deputy.

      <P>In view of the answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary last week, that private enterprise since February, 1948, was accountable only for nine factories and employment to the extent of 150 persons in the Province of Connaught, does he not consider that private enterprise has completely failed with regard to the expansion of industry in the West? Would he not consider it the Government's duty to intervene and take the necessary steps as private enterprise has failed, or is he prepared to leave the young people of the West at the mercy of those who are not prepared to put their money into private enterprise?</P>

I made a statement on Thursday last that no such instruction was given and Deputy Boland is making a charge against the police of failure to do their duty. Deputy Boland said that the Gardaí now knew about this matter, but I have not made any further investigation since because I think that the Gardaí are doing their duty in the matter.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill comes to the Dáil from the Seanad.  It was decided to introduce that measure in the Seanad partly for the reason that the Bill is of a consolidating nature and secondly, because no important question of principle arises on it. The proof of the second matter is that in the Seanad the Bill was regarded virtually as a non-contentious measure and there was no division on it at any point.  The only changes it made in the legislation as it was originally introduced were a few drafting amendments where deficiencies in drafting were revealed in the course of the discussion. I myself brought in a very limited number of drafting amendments to meet such points that I had discovered.  If I go on to repeat the general features of it I will be repeating to a great extent what I said in the Seanad but even though most Deputies will have read what I said, I suppose I must take it that they are without information on the matter and go over the same ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> Before 1928 the coins in circulation consisted of British coins of either gold, silver or copper prior to the Act of 1926 which provided for an issue of Irish token coins.  The first coins bore the date of the year 1928.  The Act of 1926 was amended.  Certain amendments were made to it by the Currency Act of 1927 and others by the Central Bank Act of 1942 but that Act of 1926 has remained the Principal Act on the Statute Book, the main statute dealing with Irish token coins and that Act will be repealed by the present Bill. The main purpose of this Bill is to authorise the issue in cupro-nickel of coins, 1/-, 2/- and 2/6, in place of the silver coins of those denominations issued under the Act of 1926.  The 1926 Act was amended in the case of 3d. and 6d. pieces by the Central Bank Act of 1942.  That provided for the issue of cupro-nickel coins instead of nickel coins of those denominations and this legislation will complete the transition to cupro-nickel and provide that new coins of the denominations 1/-, 2/- and 2/6 as well as coins of the denominations 3d. and 6d. will be made of cupro-nickel. Coins of lower denominations, 1d., ½d. and ¼d., will continue to be made of bronze.  The Central Bank is, of course, authorised under this legislation to keep in circulation silver coins or nickel coins issued under the 1926 Act and, of course, cupro-nickel coins issued under the Central Bank Act.  When this legislation becomes law arrangements will be made for a gradual withdrawal through the agencies of the banks of Irish silver coins and to replace them by cupro-nickel coins.</P>
    <P>These changes are being made mainly because of the uncertainty about future supplies of silver and because of the uncertainty with regard to the price of silver.  Prices have risen considerably in the past and if they continue to rise a further issue of silver coins would become unprofitable. There is, indeed, the danger that eventually silver coins might be hoarded and melted down.  These considerations as regards silver supplies and prices have led to the complete replacement in the British token coinage system of silver coins by cupro-nickel.  The use of precious <Col N="743" /> metals is a rare occurrence now and on the Continent they are using base metals instead.</P>
    <P>Cupro-nickel is considered to possess all the qualities requisite in a satisfactory coinage.  It is intended that the new coins will have exactly the same design, diameter and weight as the existing silver coins.  Cupro-nickel coins usually consist of 75 per cent. copper and 25 per cent. nickel.  This is specified in the Bill as the standard composition of Irish cupro-nickel coins. Power is being taken, however, in Section 5 to very, by Order, the standard composition of cupro-nickel coins and there is a further section, Section 6, which enables the issue, under Orders which will be subject to confirmation by resolution of each House of the Oireachtas, of coins of any metal or mixture of metals other than gold, silver or cupro-nickel, whether or not including copper or nickel.  This latter provision would permit the introduction of a pure nickel coinage without fresh parliamentary legislation and enable advantage to be taken of any minor improvement in the metallic composition of the coinage which may be discovered in future, for instance, the introduction of small portions of a third metal.</P>
    <P>It is anomalous to have different legal tender limits for coins which have the same metallic composition, and, accordingly, it is proposed by Section 12 to remove the legal tender limit of 5/- in the case of 3d. and 6d. pieces and to make it lawful to tender these, like coins of higher denominations, in payment of debts not exceeding 40/-.  In other words, all cupro-nickel coins will have the same legal tender status.  The bronze coins will continue to be legal tender for the payment of amounts not exceeding 1/-.</P>
    <P>The Bill also resolves certain doubts which have arisen as to whether British coins circulating in this country are legal tender.  It expressly reserves legal tender status to token coins under the 1926 Act and subsequent legislation; that is to say, legal tender is reserved to Irish token coins only. Token coins are issued through the <Col N="744" /> Central Bank as the agent for the Minister for Finance.  The expenses of the issue are charged against the currency reserve maintained by the Central Bank and the proceeds of issue are credited to the same reserve. The proceeds of the melting down of coins withdrawn from circulation and of coins held by the Central Bank and not required for issue or re-issue will also, under Section 14, be credited to the currency reserve.</P>
    <P>The opportunity afforded by the Bill is being availed of to consolidate the law relating to Irish token coins.  Provision is made for the repeal of the Coinage Act, 1926, of Part VIII of the Central Bank Act, 1942 and of other legislation dealing with token coinage. The live provisions of these statutes are incorporated in this Bill and amongst the provisions so preserved are those relating to expenses and disposal of proceeds of issue to which I have already referred, to copyright in Irish coins, which will continue to be vested in the Minister for Finance, and to the publication of reproductions of Irish coins, which will continue to be prohibited unless the Minister for Finance allows it.  Since the Bill went through the Seanad, a few other items have come to light which require amendment.  An examination of the Bill has revealed this and I propose to circulate a few amendments which are almost entirely of a drafting nature in connection with these.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of asking the Minister whether he would be prepared to accept an amendment or to introduce an amendment himself to prevent the Central Bank from disposing of the bullion resulting from the calling-in and melting down of silver coinage and to ensure that such bullion will be kept here by the Central Bank, in view, particularly, of what he has said with regard to the reasons for the introduction of the Bill.  He has pointed out, and the House will agree with him in this, that the uncertainty with regard to the value of silver is one of the main reasons for its introduction.  We might find ourselves in the position, if we had not got the Bill, of issuing silver coinage at a loss to the Exchequer <Col N="745" /> because the coinage would have a greater intrinsic value than its face value.  If the Minister will not introduce such an amendment, I will ask the leave of the House to do so, for the purpose of retaining this bullion in the Central Bank and to remove any power to dispose of it and to credit it to the currency reserve.</P>
      <P>The Minister has made it clear that, once this Bill becomes law, British coinage will not be legal coinage here. It has always been the position that our silver coinage has not been acceptable across the water, but what is the position with regard to the quantity of silver coinage which is in circulation in the Twenty-Six Counties?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Will the Minister authorise the handing back to the Central Bank by the banks of this silver coinage for retention as bullion, the property of this country, or are the British coins to be handed back to Britain, with a possible consequent loss to us in relation to the value of silver when silver will rise in value, in view particularly of our history of having handed over our gold to the British so often with consequent loss to ourselves?</P>
      <P>I have no objection to the idea behind the Bill, but I feel that, in view of the situation developing in the world, we should take advantage of the opportunity to lay the foundations for building up within our own control certain commodities as guarantees for our own currency to our own people and whatever other people might wish to take our currency in the form of the establishment of trade credits.  I feel very strongly that the time has come when we should lay the foundation for the collection of commodities which will be of immense value to us in time to come, if the general tendency of things continues as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that we are recasting our currency, we should avail of the opportunity to discard the unnational, unworthy and, as I would say, pagan representations which disfigure <Col N="746" /> our coinage.  I am not one of those who suggested or would suggest for one moment that religious emblems or anything of the kind should be used on our coinage, but we should avail of this opportunity to make our coinage more national in character by having on them representations of leading figures in our national history. The emblems upon our coinage are altogether unworthy of a nation with our civilisation and history.  Domestic and wild animals may have a certain appeal for certain people, but I do not think that they are sufficiently important to be embodied in our currency. Some people will say that the representations on our coinage are a tribute to the agricultural industry, but I do not think anyone will claim that hares or woodcock represent any industry in the country except, perhaps, the poaching industry.  I should like the Minister to give the House an indication that he has given some consideration to that matter.  There are a great many national figures in our history who could be honoured and represented on our currency.  I do not see any reason why that should not be done.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear, as a farmer Deputy, that the animals portrayed on our coinage do not reflect any honour on the agricultural industry even.  We have some coins with a representation of a sow with a very small litter of bonhams.  We have also a representation of the antiquated hen which the Minister for Agriculture has been seeking to eliminate and replace by artificial methods of incubation.  I am not quite sure whether the bull represented on our 1/- is a dual-purpose bull or conforms with the regulations as to conformation which are required by the Department of Agriculture.  I think the whole matter requires some consideration and that we should avail of this change to improve the whole set-up of our various types of coinage, to pay some tribute at any rate to our philosophy, to our history, to our culture, and to our nationality generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the suggestion of Deputy Briscoe is worthy of examination because the amount of gold in the currency reserve is limited <Col N="747" /> and there must be an important psychological value in having precious metals to a substantial extent provided in that reserve.  The £1,000,000 or so, which I understand is the value of the silver in the coinage after the deduction has been made for the cost of the new cupro-nickel coinage to replace it, is not a great sum of money, but when one has regard to the increasing value of silver and to the fact that every article of value in the way of silver is being carefully garnered in this country, collected for exportation to the U.S.A., we may find ourselves in the position that there is practically no silver available in the country. While the Minister, no doubt, will be guided by considerations of currency and economy, I think that Deputy Briscoe's suggestion is, at any rate, worthy of examination.</P>
      <P>There is a further point, and that is, if the Minister decides eventually that whatever silver is taken in will be melted down and sold out of the country, whether the proceeds will be permanently in the reserve.  As I understand&mdash;I have not looked into the matter specially&mdash;at present a certain contribution is made by the currency reserve&mdash;I think £400,000 was the amount in recent years&mdash;to the Exchequer.  I do not know whether that is a statutory sum or whether, in circumstances, it may be increased. But it is certainly of value, whether the money is melted down and kept as bullion or whether it is sold and the proceeds put into the currency reserve, that that reserve should be as substantial and as solid as possible.  I think it should be generally recognised that it should be part of the State policy to do everything that is possible to strengthen our currency and give it that stability and public confidence that is necessary to get the best results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present measure is really one of economy and, while from the point of view of economy and finance, there are no doubt good reasons for the steps which the Minister is taking, one cannot allow the opportunity to pass without calling attention to the fact that the small coinage which in the <Col N="748" /> past was of value to the housewife, has become less and less valuable as time went on.  The significance of the currency position is the extraordinary increase in the amount of paper money in circulation.  The total amount of silver, nickel and bronze coinage has less than doubled since the pre-war period, whereas the amount of notes in circulation seems to have increased by more than three times, apart altogether from bank money, which has increased in at least an equal proportion. We have no idea whether the production of goods in the country has kept pace with that.  It will no doubt be argued that it has and that the increased monetary circulation is necessary to meet the demands of business and the needs of the people. But I think the Minister ought to give the country the opportunity of enabling it to make up its mind as to whether the production of goods and, in particular, the output per man, have kept pace with the extraordinary increase in money, whether notes or cheques or coinage, in circulation.</P>
    <P>Looking at the figures, I see that the quarterly return of the average note circulation shows that there has been an increase of £3,500,000 this year as compared with last year.  We have no idea whether the production of goods has kept pace with that.  The best authorities, including the Central Bank, which is our monetary authority here, are of opinion that, unless the production of goods can be encouraged to a proportionate extent so that the balance of payments situation will be eased, the increased circulation of money has a deleterious effect on the general welfare of the country in that it prevents our pound from retaining its value.  I think we can all agree also that, if circumstances obtain where you have a larger circulation of money than is necessary&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps, however, I might be allowed to refer to a statement which was made by the late George Bernard Shaw to the effect that Henry VIII cheated his creditors by giving them short weight in his silver coins and Mr. Shaw continued to point out that modern Governments have got over that difficulty by no longer depending upon the ordinary coinage, since they have paper money to fall back on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Central Bank for the year 1950 is not yet available. When may we expect to receive that report and, in connection with the question of currency, I should like to ask whether there is any possibility that further information will be given in the monthly <i>Statistical Bulletin</i>, issued by the Statistics Department, <Col N="750" /> regarding the currency position? Would it be possible that summaries of the statements, if statements are supplied, from the banks to the Central Bank, could be given at as near a date as convenient after they are supplied so as to enable the House and the public to ascertain the position?  It is very important, in discussions in connection with the cost-of-living figure and index figures generally, that the fullest possible information as to the currency situation should be made available at the earliest time.</P>
    <P>The fact that this measure is being introduced and that the Minister is taking responsibility for it is, I hope, an indication that this House is the supreme authority in dealing with matters of currency and coinage and that the Central Bank is the agency through which the policy and legislation, as passed by this House, is put into effect.</P>

      <P>This Bill, it appears to me, aims at doing a certain thing.  It aims at the debasement of our coinage and is a similar attempt to that which was made in the time of Dean Swift, when he wrote his famous Drapier's Letters and said that if that coinage were adopted people would have to draw it in horses and carts to pay for their goods.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the circulation of British money in this country and Deputy Briscoe referred to the circulation of our coinage in England.  I cannot understand why it is not possible to use Irish coins freely in England, just as English coins are used freely in this country.  I do not know what the reason is.  Of course, the same thing applies to paper money. I understand that, in order to get change for paper money in England, one must go to a bank and pay some small commission.  If that is the case, there must be something wrong with the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not there a possibility that people will take stock of what is being done and will collect as much silver coins as they can?  I do not know whether there would be any remedy for that or any way of preventing hoarding.  If there is no attempt <Col N="755" /> being made at the present time to call in silver coins that are in circulation, what is to prevent people from hoarding these coins, which will be more valuable later on than the new coins that will be put on the market?</P>
      <P>I have often wondered if it would not be possible in this country to have a note of smaller denomination than 10/-.  Everybody realises that paper money is easier to handle than coins. The United States of America have the dollar bill which, I suppose, would be almost equivalent to 6/- now.  That would obviate a great deal of trouble. That is a matter which can be considered later on.</P>
      <P>As we are not permitted to discuss the question of currency and the advisability or otherwise of breaking the link with sterling, there is nothing more I can usefully say on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Briscoe cares to put down an amendment on the matter he mentioned first, I will have it considered.  Deputy Briscoe's point was that he desired to put some impediment in the way of the Central Bank disposing of whatever bullion they may acquire from melting down silver coins instead of crediting the proceeds to the currency reserves. Deputy Briscoe will no doubt be reminded by some of his colleagues that in the year 1942 the Government which he supported passed an Act called the Central Bank Act of that year.  Section 7 of that Act makes it lawful for the Central Bank to do one or all of a number of things.  One is to buy or sell coin or gold or silver bullion or any foreign currency.  They had power to hold or to sell it.  I understood, when the Central Bank was set up, that the purpose of that institution was that people who were experienced and talented with regard to certain monetary matters were to be put in charge of the Central Bank and that that institution, when established, would be given the series of powers in Section 7.  There are in fact some powers given to the Central Bank of that day that I questioned when the 1942 Act was going through and which I hope to question in another way hereafter, but I think this question <Col N="756" /> of whether they should hold or sell such silver as might come from the melting down of coins when withdrawn from circulation, is a matter that might well be left to them.</P>
      <P>I do not know whom Deputy Briscoe would ask to advise on such matters as to whether it would be better to sell whatever silver was accumulated by the melting down of silver coins.  I do not know who would be a better adviser on the point as to whether that ought to be sold or held.  As regards the suggestion about better advice, I will have that considered.  There are some powers I would not be disposed to interfere with, and some of the other powers given to the board of the Central Bank I would rather see dealt with in a different way.</P>
      <P>A point arises with regard to British coinage.  There were two agreements lasting ten years as between the two countries.  On the repatriation of British coinage, I would like to point out that the British are themselves withdrawing whatever silver coinage they have in circulation; they are doing what we are doing here.  It is possible we may see a certain amount of silver coins which are of the English type.  I might make profit out of them, but I am not sure that it would be a wise thing to do.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan and Deputy Hickey have raised a question with regard to the design of the coinage.  I want to draw attention to one aspect of this matter because I may have misled the House in relation to the legislation going through.  There is a certain situation.  I referred to Section 5 and I contrasted that with Section 6.  I pointed out that Section 5 enabled the standard composition of coins to be changed by Order and that would not be subject to confirmation by this House, whereas certain things under Section 6 are subject to confirmation. They may be done by Order but that would not be operative unless it is affirmatively approved by the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  I can change the design under Section 5.  That can be done by regulation and that would not require authority from this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Personally, I would not be disposed to change the design.  I heard much <Col N="757" /> more favourable comment in regard to the design of Irish coins than criticism or condemnation.  Possibly there are people who feel that we ought to have certain national figures represented on our coins, something more in the nature of a sentimental attachment to our coinage than, perhaps, would be represented by merely depicting the produce of the country.  On the whole, our coins have merited approval.  They were brought in by one Government and another Government that lasted for 16 years had power to change them but did not think it worth while to bother about doing so.  I do not think there is any great volume of critical opinion, any volume sufficient to sway anyone to make a change.  I propose to leave the designs as they are until there is some better argument advanced showing that a change would be welcomed by the mass of the people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane talked about the debasing of the coinage and he referred to the Swift Letters.  The Swift Drapier's Letters were mainly against the handing over of the proceeds of a debased coinage to an individual for certain rather unworthy favours that that gentleman was giving.  In this case, I think Deputy Kissane need have no concern.  The State is taking whatever benefit will be derived from what the Deputy describes as the debasing of the coinage.  In any event, debasing is only a relative term.  We are somewhat apprehensive that the point may be soon reached where the silver in the coinage may be so valuable as to render necessary some further consideration in regard to it.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised another point. He asked me did I not realise that a situation might arise where people might be induced to hoard.  There is in this Bill an offence section, Section 19, which prohibits any person other than the Central Bank from melting down, breaking up or using otherwise than as currency any coin which is for the time being current in this State or in any other country. What more can we do except to make it unlawful and impose penalties? When this matter was examined in the <Col N="758" /> Seanad a fine not exceeding £100 per offence was mentioned and that offence might be associated with each particular coin melted down.  If there is any apprehension on this aspect of the legislation, the way to meet it is by some amendment of Section 19&mdash;to impose a bigger penalty.</P>
    <P>There is a danger and, as the price of silver increases, the danger is all the nearer.  However, I do not think in the immediate future it is going to be profitable for anybody to hoard, for anybody to take a decision to collect and hoard coins in the hope that eventually it might be profitable outside the law&mdash;in the hope that a person doing these things could escape the law and make a gain.  The sooner we get rid of that idea the better.</P>
    <P>There is another point to be considered and that is that the silver coinage is in the position that new supplies will be required and if this Bill is not passed soon and if new supplies of silver have to be got, the price at which silver may be obtainable may become a difficult one and it may become an onerous matter to institute a fresh issue of silver coins&mdash;and silver may go even higher still.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane raised a point with reference to small notes.  That hardly arises in relation to this measure, but it will get consideration.  As Deputies know, there are many countries notorious for issuing notes of small denominations.  There are certain objections to paper notes.  If the Deputy is agitated about debased coins, then I suggest that paper notes would be a still greater debasement.</P>
    <P>When this legislation becomes statute law, after some time an arrangement will be made to have the coinage in circulation withdrawn by imposing a designation of non-legal tender upon it.  One cannot do this quickly or speedily but it is hoped that over a period the coins will come in. As regards English coins, we will have to make some arrangement about repatriation&mdash;some new arrangement.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised a further point as to our notes and the commission charged upon them abroad.  The Deputy must accept responsibility for that himself because it was the <Col N="759" /> Deputy's Government that made the arrangement.  Unfortunately, the arrangement is only a one-way arrangement.  Legislation was passed and people thought it was a definite arrangement, a two-way arrangement, but that is not so.  Our note has on the face of it a very simple statement, and that is that it is redeemable at face value in the Bank of England.</P>
    <P>This commission to which the Deputy referred is sometimes charged by hotels or restaurants and the people who charge it say that that is to repay their trouble in going to the Bank of England and getting the appropriate amount there.  That is the type of currency for which the Deputy was responsible.  It would, of course, be more satisfactory if there was complete reciprocity and if our notes were freely taken by hotels and restaurants, as notes are taken here.  However, I do not think that the occasion on which there is an initial charge on notes arises very often.</P>

    <Title>Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, 1949.&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) Michael Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill, as its Long Title states, is &ldquo;to repeal expressly certain enactments or parts of enactments relating to local authorities which may be regarded as spent or which have ceased to be in force otherwise than by express repeal or which have, by lapse of time or otherwise, become unnecessary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The enactments which it is proposed to repeal in whole or in part are listed in the Schedule to the Bill, the extent of the repeal being indicated in each case.  More than 70 enactments are affected ranging from the Grand Jury (Ireland) Act, 1816, to the Local Government Act of 1946.  The reasons for repeal in each case are set out briefly in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to Deputies.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will appreciate, the many changes which have taken place in local government since 1816 have made many existing statutory provisions unnecessary or obsolete.  Such provisions, however, remain on the Statute Book until they are expressly repealed.  In addition, enactments sometimes contain transitory provisions whose application is confined to a limited period, and which are spent when this period expires.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that this Bill introduces no new legislative principle. It will make no change whatever in the existing law relating to local authorities.  Its purpose is merely to clear away obsolete provisions of the local government code.  The retention of these obsolete provisions creates confusion in the minds of persons studying or administering local government law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special committee of Seanad Éireann considered this Bill and <Col N="761" /> meticulously examined every item on the Schedule.  As a result of that examination, a number of amendments were made in the Schedule to the Bill as introduced.  I can assure the House that no provision which is not clearly spent, obsolete or unnecessary is being repealed.</P>
    <P>Apart from its immediate and obvious intention, there is a more farreaching purpose behind this Bill.  It constitutes the first step towards the simplification and modernisation of local government law.  The next step will be the preparation of a Statute Law Revision Bill, and finally a Consolidation Bill to bring up to date the legislation dealing with local government. This is a large and difficult task, but I think Deputies will agree that it will be a welcome reform, and one which is long overdue.  As I informed the House in the course of the debate on the Estimate for my Department in July, a text-book on local government law has been prepared and would already have been published only that certain amendments may be necessary therein in view of the provisions of the Local Government (County Administration) Bill, 1950, which is at present before the House.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies will welcome this Bill for what it will immediately achieve and even more because it is intended to lead to the eventual simplification of the existing complicated code of law relating to local authorities and their administration.  I accordingly commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this Bill has been in preparation for a considerable time.  The Minister has explained that it has been scrutinised carefully in the Seanad and in his Department and follows a line that is generally accepted.  It had already, to some extent, been worked upon before he occupied his present position. Therefore, there is no objection from this side of the House.  I do not think we need go into the details, as we have the Minister's assurance that no change is made in the law, the general effect of the Bill being to remove deadwood legislation and obsolete sections and enactments.  We have no objection to the Second Reading.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="762" />
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House welcomes any effort to remove this deadwood out of legislation.  This Bill certainly eliminates a considerable amount of that deadwood.  The difficulty about local government law and nearly all our codes of law is that for the last 28 years we have been passing legislation and amending legislation and the Minister tells us now that there was a text-book on local government law ready, but even before it sees the printers it has to be amended.  It is natural, in the changing circumstances, and particularly in administrative law, that that should happen; but one of the great difficulties that confronts anyone who endeavours to make himself familiar with local government law&mdash; and this is a matter of great importance not only to lawyers but to those who have to administer the local government law&mdash;is the difficulty of knowing exactly what the law is.  It certainly is an eye-opener to Deputies that there should be such a jungle of legislation as is shown by this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are many matters in connection with local government law which could undoubtedly be brought up to date and put in one volume&mdash;in fact, in one statute.  I am afraid it is just expressing a pious hope to say that that should be done.  The Minister may have the best intentions in the world to do that&mdash;and other Ministers with similar problems may feel likewise &mdash;but unfortunately these things are placed on the long finger and now, 28 years after the establishment of the State, nobody knows just exactly where we are, not only in regard to local government law but in regard to other law.  The House will have no difficulty in approving any suggestions the Minister might make for tackling this big job of codification of local government law.  There has been a tendency in local government law over a long period to bring in simply enabling legislation&mdash;legislation which permitted or authorised a Minister to make regulations dealing with small matters in local government administration&mdash;but I can see no reason why the broad general lines of local government administration cannot be contained in one statute.</P>

    <P>Even reading through the Bill, which <Col N="763" /> is going through at the moment, dealing with county management, I see quite a number of matters in that Bill that I do not think ought to appear in legislation at all, matters in connection with procedure at meetings, the signing of orders and things of that nature.  If we could get the legislation that has stood over a long period of time collected into one omnibus statute, that would simplify many problems for quite a number of people.  It is part of the difficulty of the administration of the whole local government code that an official entering the Department of Local Government may spend 40 years there before he discovers what code of law he is administering and, possibly, he may find at the end of that 40 years that he has been entirely wrong on some matters.  This problem is both a serious and an important one, and I think the Minister should take some practical steps to solve it by setting up a whole-time committee to deal with the matter.  Certainly an omnibus statute would be of tremendous assistance to those who have anything to do with local administration. It would also be of immense value to officials anxious to familiarise themselves with their duties and to perform their duties efficiently.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Derrig, I am glad to see a Bill of this kind introduced for the purpose of disposing of so much lumber, but I think we could do with a little more tidying-up and with a little more rebuilding of the whole code of local government law.  I avail of this opportunity to give expression to that view.</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Cowan that the points to which he has adverted have gone beyond a pious hope and that practical steps are being taken to implement, with the least possible delay, the suggestions made. Two Bills will be prepared almost immediately, but it was essential, in the first instance, to clear away the deadwood in order to get on with codification and consolidation.  That codification and consolidation will be given effect to with the greatest possible speed.  The text-book is <Col N="764" /> actually ready, but it was considered desirable to hold it up in order to obviate the necessity of going back again on some further contradiction. That book will issue immediately after the passage of the Local Government (County Administration) Bill.  The other measures will be proceeded with as speedily as possible for the purpose of consolidating and codifying the existing law which makes it difficult at the moment for those dealing with it either administratively or in its legal aspect.</P>

      <P>This amendment stands in my name.  We had a somewhat scrappy debate on it on Thursday last and it may facilitate the House if I briefly reiterate the arguments in favour of the amendment.  The debate was scrappy not merely because the Dáil came to consider the Bill in Committee at a late hour on Thursday, but also because eight months had elapsed since the Bill received its Second Reading.  Deputies may not recollect fully the nature of the debate we had when the Bill was before us on the Second Stage.  Deputies on this side of the House unsuccessfully opposed the approval of the Bill on Second <Col N="765" /> Reading on the ground that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is charged under the Ministers and Secretaries Act with certain statutory functions in relation to industrial development and other matters and that he appeared under this Bill to be endeavouring to pass over the responsibility for the discharge of these functions from his Department to this new body, described as an autonomous body, but possibly more accurately described as an anomalous body, with the grandiose title of Industrial Development Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying that we had unsuccessfully opposed the approval of this Bill on Second Reading because we disliked the proposal to transfer to an autonomous body, with which the Dáil would have no contact, functions which were previously discharged by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and concerning which he could be questioned by the Dáil.  I do not think, however, that many of the Deputies who failed to respond to our arguments for the rejection of the Bill on Second Reading can have fully appreciated that, as framed, it purports to give to this Industrial Development Authority a position of superiority to all other statutory boards and companies concerned with industrial development in any form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to endeavour to limit the functions of the new board in regard to matters for which other statutory boards and companies have already been given responsibility by the Oireachtas.  Its aim is to provide that the functions of this Industrial Development Authority &ldquo;shall not extend to any undertaking constituted by statute, being an undertaking which is carried on by or on behalf of the State or the directors of which are appointed by the Government or by a Minister of State, or to any commodities which any such undertaking is authorised by statute to produce or make.&rdquo;  I do not know what the view of the Government is on <Col N="766" /> this amendment.  We have not yet had an opportunity of hearing that view expressed by the Parliamentary Secretary, but, in so far as the limited discussion which we had on last Thursday night is an indication of the views held on the benches opposite, there appears to be a desire to justify the position in which this new Industrial Development Authority will have functions not merely in relation to industrial development by private enterprise but also in relation to the activities of organisations like the Electricity Supply Board and Córas Iompair Éireann.  If that is intended, then I think the opposition originally expressed on this Bill is even more justified than it at first appeared.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas, by legislation, established these other bodies.  It empowered the Government, or a particular Minister, to choose for membership of those boards persons with the experience and competence that would enable them to carry on properly the undertakings entrusted to them.  It is certain that any attempt to put between them and the Minister, or between them and this House, this Industrial Authority will merely lead to confusion and retard rather than facilitate progress.</P>
    <P>These other bodies have their powers defined by statute.  Their members are appointed by the Government, or by Ministers who are answerable for their appointments here.  They are under an obligation to submit annual reports and accounts which are presented to the Dáil and which the Dáil can discuss. It has on occasion discussed them for the purpose of expressing criticism of their administration or of urging development along particular lines.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the intention of the Dáil in framing the legislation which established them&mdash;the legislation establishing Córas Iompair Éireann was enacted no later than this year&mdash;was to have these bodies directly answerable to the Dáil through a Minister and to give no responsibility to anybody else, except the Minister, and through the Minister to the Dáil, for the way they discharged their duties.  It is a matter upon which I would have thought that many Deputies sitting opposite would have strong views and that they would <Col N="767" /> join with us in objecting to the intervention between these bodies and the Government and the Dáil of another organisation described as an autonomous organisation, an organisation which has no responsibility whatever to any Minister or to the Dáil and which it is not proposed should be under any obligation by statute to present any report here as to how it exercises its powers or discharges its functions. I do not know whether the other statutory boards to which I have referred have been consulted about this proposal to appoint over them this super-authority.  I am sure it is most unlikely that, if they were consulted, they agreed.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could give us some information on that point.</P>
    <P>During our brief discussion on Thursday last Deputy Hickey made an observation which appeared to convey that he regarded this Bill as an answer to the case that is being made for instituting some more explicit system of supervision over the activities of other statutory bodies.  Clearly, that is not so.  The reply given to-day by the Taoiseach to a parliamentary question which I addressed to him makes it obvious that the Government has not yet completed its considerations of the methods by which more detailed examination of the accounts and reports of these other bodies can be accomplished by the Dáil, and that when it has so completed its consideration of that matter it will have definite proposals to make to the House.  This Bill is not an answer to that case.  If it were so regarded I think most of us would consider it as asking the Dáil to move in a direction opposite to that which the majority of the Dáil would prefer to go in that regard.</P>
    <P>Mind you, this is not quite a matter of theory, because I have already drawn the attention of the House to one important matter in regard to which it can be said that ambiguity as to the functions of this new board has stopped progress.  In 1947 the Dáil enacted a Bill to establish a company with special responsibility for the development here of chemical industries. That Bill was passed with <Col N="768" /> the approval of all Parties then represented in the Dáil, and the Government chose for the company&mdash;Ceimici Teoranta&mdash;a board of directors that appeared particularly suitable to be entrusted with that responsibility.  I intimated to the Dáil when, as Minister, I proposed the enactment of that measure, that the first task the new company would be asked to undertake would be to investigate the commercial problems associated with the manufacture here of nitrogenous fertilisers, of sulphate of ammonia.  The history of previous attempts to establish that industry here need not now be recounted, but our experience during the war years, when supplies of that important fertiliser were not available at all except the very limited quantities that were smuggled into the country and sold at exorbitant prices, justified us in regarding it as an urgent post-war task to get that industry established here.  It is particularly suitable for this country, in so far as it can be conducted with practically no imported raw materials.</P>
    <P>That company was set up, given the necessary legal powers and assured of the necessary financial resources to enable it to do all the preliminary work necessary to secure the establishment of that industry, although it was recognised that before the final step could be taken, the Dáil would again have to be consulted and would have to agree to make the financial provision which it was estimated would be required.  It has done nothing. The accounts of that company, as published, indicate quite clearly that in that particular matter with which it was especially charged nothing has been done.  There has been no expenditure of any kind on any activity which could be regarded as being remotely associated with the establishment of that industry.</P>
    <P>A question addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce early this year elicited the reply that it was the Industrial Development Authority which was now expected to carry out any investigations which were necessary in that matter.  They are doing nothing either and we have the position that, as a result of the creation by the Dail of two authorities with <Col N="769" /> overlapping functions, progress is stifled.  I think it would be far better for us if we could leave these other statutory bodies in their present position, responsible to the Minister for the discharge of the duties given to them by statute and, through the Minister, to the Dáil, and that the giving of any functions whatever in relation to these matters to this so-called autonomous body, with which the Dáil will have no contact, is a retrograde step which we should resist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this amendment proceeds from a misinterpretation of the functions of the Industrial Development Authority.  It is made quite clear in Section 4, sub-section (6), that the members of the Industrial Development Authority will be answerable to the Minister.  The phrase is that &ldquo;the members in the exercise of their duties shall be responsible to the Minister&rdquo;. That obviously places emphatically the responsibility on the Minister and if the Minister regards it as necessary to get a particular view of the workings of an industry carried on either by a company set up under statute or by private enterprise, then he is free to take the advice of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
      <P>The amendment which Deputy Lemass proposes would exclude statutory bodies from an inquisition by members of the Industrial Development Authority.  He bases the case for the amendment on the ground that the bodies referred to have been set up under statute and have defined functions, that the directors are appointed by the Minister and that consequently it is assumed that the Minister and the Government have confidence in them. I do not think that the functions which the Industrial Development Authority have under this Bill in any way question the authority or the competence of the directors of a statutory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions of the Industrial Development Authority are purely advisory.  It is true that it is an autonomous body, that the members are free to decide their own procedure, to investigate any particular matter or <Col N="770" /> to inquire into factors which they think it desirable should be inquired into in any way, and according to their own procedure, but having completed whatever investigations they have in hand, the members of the Industrial Development Authority are responsible to the Minister, just as statutory companies have their functions and responsibilities and their duties defined precisely by statute.  It may be that these companies from time to time would be required by the Minister to furnish either, in the course of their annual reports or otherwise, particulars about the nature of the work they have in hands and the Minister may query them as to how their duties are carried out under the statute but I cannot see any objection to the members of the Industrial Development Authority inquiring into the workings of a particular industry merely because it is carried on by a company set up under statute rather than by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>This Bill in no way places the members of the Industrial Development Authority as a super-body over existing statutory companies.  The statutes which set up these companies and defined their functions allocated specific duties to them.  This Bill defines the functions of the Industrial Development Authority and assuming the amendment were passed, it would not preclude the Minister getting information at any time or carrying out any investigation he liked, either from the directors of the concern or alternatively through the officers of his Department in the ordinary course of their duties.  It is the normal procedure to have direct contact between the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the various statutory bodies that are responsible to that particular Minister just as certain companies may be answerable to other Ministers.  The majority of these State companies are answerable to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass asked were these companies consulted.  I can state emphatically they were not, but I do not think there is any obligation to consult existing statutory bodies on <Col N="771" /> the effect of legislation of this sort.  It is not usual to consult any of these statutory bodies on any legislation that is introduced.  From time to time that legislation may impinge on them. If, of course, the legislation deals directly with the work of the particular body concerned, then naturally consultation would take place, but in a case of this sort, no consultation takes place, and I do not think it is necessary. I think that the passing of this amendment may unduly restrict the work of the Industrial Development Authority, and for that reason may in some way limit its usefulness.  Deputy Lemass referred to the fact that in reply to a parliamentary question it was stated that the Industrial Development Authority had investigated or was considering certain proposals which, he said, were allocated under statute to Ceimici Teoranta.  If the Minister feels that the advice of the Industrial Development Authority or the information that may be available to them would be of help in deciding any matter of policy, which would be in the national interest or in the interest of an individual industrial concern, then I think it is desirable that he should be in a position to get the advice directly, and get the authority to undertake certain investigations, all the time in the knowledge that the authority is responsible to the Minister and the Minister responsible to the Dáil for whatever duties and responsibilities the authority may discharge.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputy Lemass has really made a case for his amendment at all.  It seems to me that statutory bodies and undertakings set up and carried on by or on behalf of the State or alternatively undertakings the directors of which are appointed by the Government or by a Minister of State are the very bodies and undertakings the functions of which should come under the examination of the Industrial Development Authority.  I think that they are the very people who would benefit from examination, help or assistance.  The bodies which purport to be above the law or outside the law are the very ones whose workings should be investigated. Far from leaving them as they are I think a very strong case can be made for the Government and this House having all the information possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce clear up a point regarding the functions of the Industrial Development Authority?  It <Col N="773" /> has been stated that it is an autonomous body and I would like to know how far its autonomy extends particularly regarding State or semiState bodies.  So far as I understand the Parliamentary Secretary, he stated that the Industrial Development Authority is free to conduct any investigation by its own procedure and methods and that at the same time it is responsible to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Is it not a fact, however, that the authority only conducts investigations or handles questions which are remitted to it through the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  If we are to take the Parliamentary Secretary literally, is any Ministry with a problem which may have some relation to the work of the authority free to remit directly to the authority a question concerning these State-owned bodies or any other body or any question generally?  Is the authority empowered to make its decisions or give its findings direct to that other body or to any other body outside the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  If its initiative is regulated or restrained by the desires or wishes of the Minister for Industry and Commerce it certainly has not the autonomous functions ascribed to it by Deputy Lemass nor is it the super-body which he contends it is in pressing his case for this amendment.  In other words, if the powers of this body are limited to actions decided upon by the Minister for Industry and Commerce who is responsible to this Dáil, then it cannot get between the State bodies which have been set up or cause confusion in the way instanced by Deputy Lemass because any investigation on their part can only proceed on the initiative of the Minister who is ultimately responsible for these bodies.  Therefore, I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to make quite clear whether the authority can proceed on its own initiative against the wishes perhaps&mdash; in a critical case or a case of emergency&mdash;of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to whom, theoretically, it is responsible and to whom it makes its report; or whether they can proceed on the request of any responsible body, responsible <Col N="774" /> industrialist or trade union or any other person who is concerned about the activities of State bodies or anxious to get their view on any question which relates to these bodies.  When that matter is settled we might see the amendment in a clearer way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether Deputy Connolly has seen the Bill or not, but the functions of the authority are defined in Section 3.  There are eight sub-sections which read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to initiate proposals and schemes for the creation and development of Irish industries;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to survey possibilities of further industrial development;</P>
      <P>(iii)  to advise on steps necessary and desirable for establishing new industries;</P>
      <P>(iv)  to advise on steps necessary for the expansion and modernisation of existing industries;</P>
      <P>(v)  to give advice and guidance to persons contemplating starting new industries or expanding existing industries;</P>
      <P>(vi)  to investigate the effects of protective measures, with special reference to employment, prices, quality of goods, wage levels and conditions of employment;</P>
      <P>(vii)  to examine any proposals referred to the authority by the Minister relating to the imposition or revision of tariffs, quotas or other protective or developmental measures, and to investigate the probable effects of such proposals, with special reference to employment, prices, quality of goods, wage levels and conditions of employment, and</P>
      <P>(viii)  to advise on any matter relating to industrial development referred to the authority by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These functions, the Deputy will realise, embrace any aspect of industrial development or any matter which is related to it.

I am aware of the general functions set out in the abstract and the ideas governing the Industrial Development Authority as such, but what I want to get at is the actual mode of operation.  I am founding my question on a case of which I have knowledge in which a particular matter concerning a definite industry was referred by one Department to this authority which, as I understand it, stated that they were not empowered to investigate it, except through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and the matter had to go through the Minister for Industry and Commerce, limiting in that way, as I thought, the functions of this body which had been given broad duties and functions under this Bill.  I want to know whether it is limited by having first to get a reference to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I can see the merit of the amendment, but whether Deputy Lemass is wise in wasting time trying to improve this Bill I do not know. There was a broad conception with regard to this body that it would be a body which would, by its efforts in investigating possibilities and such like, succeed in establishing industries, and, as I gather from the schedule of duties laid down, this authority will be snowed under with all types of little routine matters and will have no time whatever to get down to the big problem of getting industries started.  If they do not get industries started and if we do not make provision to enable them to start an industry, we are to a large extent merely wasting time.</P>
      <P>The general tendency on the part of Deputies who understand certain difficulties has been, and will be, to make this Dáil supreme, and where you have any statutory authority or undertaking such as has been set up there will be a demand by a number of Deputies that that stautuory authority be subject to this House, through the Minister. I think that is a very wise thing. It has been resisted in the past and it is being resisted at present, but I nevertheless think that this House must have absolute control over these statutory bodies which it sets up.  If any authority such as the Industrial Development Authority has the right, or if it can be regarded as having the right, to pry into the affairs of these other bodies, it may spend time on them which could very well be spent on considering the development of industry.  They may create a certain amount of discontent.  There may be certain objections and the position may well arise in which a very serious conflict might develop between this Industrial Development Authority and one of these statutory bodies.  I do not think that is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This authority ought not to be permitted to have anything to do with the industries or bodies or authorities set up by this House and, secondly, it should be relieved of all these routine matters which are the responsibility of the Minister and which are being thrown on to it and which will have the effect of preventing them doing anything worth while.  I should like to <Col N="777" /> see the Bill such that its main and primary function would be to get industry going, and that is its prime and main function, but clearly if we give it other responsibilities, it will be inclined to look after these responsibilities rather than get industry going.</P>
    <P>This authority has been in existence for a number of months.  I do not know whether anyone will contend that it has not been able to do as much as it might have done because it had not got the statutory authority.  I think it was understood that whatever it did would be approved, but this is probably the time when we might know what exactly it has done other than these routine matters to which I have referred.  If the House would approach this Bill in that way, on the basis of trying to give this body authority only to do the big things, I think we would have a considerable amount of sympathy with the point of view expressed in the amendment put forward by Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <P>It may be true that I am wasting time in trying to improve the Bill, but I feel that I have the obligation to ensure that the House understands what it is doing when it passes the Bill and approves of each section in it.  Let this be quite clear, in reply to what the Parliamentary Secretary has said and, to some extent, to what Deputy Hickey has said: I have no objection whatever to the Minister having the right to get every detail of information he thinks he should have concerning the activities of these other statutory organisations. The suggestion that I am trying to prevent him getting that information is completely groundless.  I am objecting to his seeking that information through this Industrial Development Authority.  I think he should seek it by direct approach to the organisations concerned.  That has been the practice heretofore and should be the practice in the future.  There may be, and I think there is, need for the creation by the Dáil of some machinery for the closer examination of the reports and accounts which these other statutory bodies submit to Ministers from time to time.  Deputy Cowan is incorrect in suggesting that that idea had been <Col N="778" /> resisted in the past.  It was not resisted.</P>

      <P>No.  The matter became one of urgent importance as the number of these statutory bodies increased.  When originally there was only the Electricity Supply Board, the annual report of that board was, on occasion, discussed here, and when the number of such bodies was limited that was a practical procedure.  But, as they increased in number and in the complexity of their activities, that procedure became impracticable. The Dáil had not time to discuss these reports and accounts as they appeared. The need for the creation of some organ of the Dáil to discharge that duty of the Dáil became clear.  I am strongly in favour of that.  The question that arises there is not one that concerns this Dáil alone.  Deputies who have read the papers know that a proposal on the same question was debated in the British Parliament last week.  The same desire exists amongst members there as exists amongst members here to have some effective means of investigating the activities and questioning the policies of these statutory organisations.  A procedure was adopted there which I do not think would suit our circumstances. Nevertheless, it would be better than nothing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither have I any objection to the Minister for Industry and Commerce having the right to go to the Industrial Development Authority for advice on any question.  I instanced the case of the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers to indicate the nature of my objection.  It is not that he has gone to the Industrial Development Authority for advice but that, pending the receipt of that advice, he has told the organisation which the Dáil set up to establish that industry to do nothing, and they have done nothing.  Deputy Hickey is confused about the industry to which I am referring.  The manufacture of superphosphates and phosphatic fertilisers has been conducted in this country for many years by private <Col N="779" /> concerns.  We never had an industry here for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers.  It is a large-scale undertaking involving the investment, in present circumstances, of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000.  In my view, it can only be done by a State organisation. It should only be done by a State organisation because, of necessity, it must be a monopoly concern.  We nearly got it established before the war.  Difficulties emerged which delayed it and then the war started.</P>
    <P>We set out after the war with the idea that this was one of the first of the tasks to be attempted in the industrial development programme and to discharge that task an organisation was set up.  I do not say that it was a perfect organisation, but on the board there were people with high qualifications for investigating and organising that industry.  There are no people on the Industrial Development Authority who even pretend to have qualifications of that order, and I think it was completely wrong of the Government to take from that specialised body set up for that particular task the duties which were assigned to it by the Dáil and give them to this Industrial Development Authority, the establishment of which the Oireachtas has not yet approved.</P>
    <P>However, to come back to the particular point covered by the amendment, it is not good enough, I think, for the Parliamentary Secretary to say that of course the Industrial Development Authority will not annoy the directors of these other boards by interfering unnecessarily in their affairs or that the Minister will not ask them to do so.  Deputy Dockrell rose immediately afterwards to put another point of view: that this was going to be a most important function of the Industrial Development Authority, namely, meddling round with the affairs of the Electricity Supply Board, Córas Iompair Éireann and similar organisations.  Neither is it sufficient for the Parliamentary Secretary to refer me to the sub-section of Section 4 which says that the members of the authority shall be responsible in the exercise of their duties to the Minister. <Col N="780" /> That either means something entirely different from what the Parliamentary Secretary suggested, or else it is in direct conflict with the assertion in Section 3, that the authority is to be an autonomous body.  If that word means anything, it means that it is independent of the Minister in the discharge of these functions.  That is clear from the whole text of the Bill.  The members of this authority are appointed by name; there are names in the Bill.  They are appointed for a stated period of time.  They cannot be removed by the Minister during that period of time, assuming they remain capable of discharging the functions of the authority, except for stated misconduct. They are set up as a judge is set up, independent of the Government and of the Minister, to discharge these functions, subject only to this condition, that in the specific matters where the Minister is empowered to ask them to do things they must do them if he directs them.</P>
    <P>They can interfere with the affairs of a private company which is benefiting under a protective tariff whether that company asks for their interference or not.  They can interfere with the affairs of those statutory organisations whose functions have any relationship with industrial development. Is it not nonsense to say that this is not a super-authority?  In the event of a conflict, it can bring the chairman of the Electricity Supply Board and the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann before them on mandate and make them give evidence on oath and send them to jail if they do not.  It is unlikely that the chairman of the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it is not the wish of the Government or the desire of the Dáil that this authority should have these powers and functions in relation to other statutory bodies, then is it not the safe course to put this amendment or some similar amendment into the Bill to limit their functions to private industrial development, concerns that are operated by private individuals, and exclude them altogether from having anything to do with other activities for the discharge of which the Oireachtas has already set up bodies under statute?  I think it is and I do not think we should be put off by an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that the Government will not act unreasonably in the matter.  It is far better to have the law clear both from the point of view of this House and the point of view of the members of the authority as well as those with whom they will have dealings.  That is all I am asking.  If it is not intended that the authority should interfere, then say so.  If it is intended, I want the House to understand what they are doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very wide discussion on a comparatively restricted amendment.  We have discussed two problems which are entirely separate, one of which is the question of making statutory bodies amenable to the Dáil and having their activities brought under review.  That question, Deputy Lemass says, has attracted considerable attention in the British <Col N="782" /> Parliament.  Even last week there was a debate there on it.  I do not know whether Deputies read the article in the <i>Economist.</i>  I think it was headed &ldquo;Controlling the Giant&rdquo; and dealt with that problem.  But here the situation is very different.  Relatively, I suppose, we have probably nearly as many statutory bodies as they have in Great Britain, but one fact about it which has not been generally noticed is that, although the Electricity Supply Board has been established now for over 20 years and the accounts have been laid on the table each year since it was established, there was never a separate discussion on the accounts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was discussed but the accounts were never discussed.  It may be that there were a number of amending Acts in the period and that, consequently, Deputies had an opportunity of discussing different aspects from time to time but, with few exceptions&mdash;and possibly only one exception&mdash;the report has not been discussed.  The accounts are presented.  Of course, there have been a number of amending Acts which enable Deputies to raise matters that normally they might have wished to raise on the accounts or on the annual report.  The same, probably, goes for a number of statutory bodies.  Again, in the case of Bord na Móna or any of the other bodies, amending Acts have probably provided the opportunity, which the Dáil would normally expect to avail of by tabling a motion, to discuss the report or report and accounts.  But, from time to time&mdash;in fact, on each Order Paper&mdash;there are questions dealing with statutory bodies, asking for specific points of information about, probably, matters of local interest or, alternatively, asking for information on major matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time discussions have taken place here on the desirability of making these bodies amenable to Parliament and amenable to public discussion both from the point of view of ascertaining how the bodies work and from the point of view of shedding <Col N="783" /> light on their activities.  With the exceptions that have been mentioned, it is a remarkable fact that, generally, these bodies have functioned without any number of specific debates on their activities.  While Deputies, from time to time, may feel aggrieved with particular aspects of the workings of individual statutory bodies, there is a general recognition that the day-to-day affairs of these bodies&mdash;their ordinary day-to-day administration&mdash;should not be the subject of continuous surveillance by the Dáil.  Certainly, it is felt that, whatever about getting information, the ordinary day-to-day administration is entrusted to whatever number of directors are appointed or whatever from the company may take and that the responsibility for carrying on for a limited period&mdash;subject to placing the accounts of the company and presenting an annual report and answering directly to the Dáil&mdash;is a matter that should be left to the individuals concerned.</P>
    <P>In this amendment it is proposed to exclude the Industrial Development Authority from having the right to inquire into the workings of any of the statutory bodies on the ground that it is undue interference and that they are already charged with specific responsibilities and have defined functions. Again, I want to say that Deputies misinterpret the functions of the Industrial Development Authority. Deputy Lemass instanced the possibility that the members of this body may interfere with or may ask for information which will cause disturbance in a statutory company or which will be an undue interference with their functions.  Remember, however, that under this Bill the authority can take <Col N="784" /> no specific decision affecting any of these bodies other than an inquiry into them and that it must report back to the Minister.  In fact, the Minister cannot impose a tariff or quota: it must be done by the Government.  He can suspend quotas but the actual imposition of a tariff is a matter for the Government.  Assuming that the authority does inquire into the working of a statutory undertaking, no specific action on any inquiry they may make may be taken unless the Minister assents to it.  If it is protection for an industry, either a tariff or a quota, not only must the Minister assent but the Minister must afterwards get the consent of the Government.</P>
    <P>The discussion here is unreal in the sense that the Industrial Development Authority is in no way superimposed on existing statutory corporations and can in no way interfere with their functions.  I agree that if the members of the Industrial Development Authority acted in an unreasonable fashion they could be a source of annoyance to the directors of other concerns. However, I do not think it is to be expected that reasonable men will act in that manner and it is unlikely that anyone would expect that they would even have the time to do it.</P>
    <P>If this amendment were accepted it would preclude the Minister from having a specific question inquired into by the members of the authority.  Consequently, he would not have the advice which he will have available if the authority reports on a particular question referred to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is on Section 2 that we might try to clear up some of the ambiguities of the Bill which have already caused some trouble to Deputy Connolly.  It is true that in Section 3 the authority is described as an autonomous body.  This is the section which sets it up, and it is on this section that we should try to ascertain the Government's view as to the form the authority should take.  I interpret the term, &ldquo;autonomous body,&rdquo; as meaning a body that is able to function independently of the Minister or the Government.</P>
      <P>The fact that the Parliamentary Secretary has accepted amendment No. 4 improves the position to my mind, but it still leaves it ambiguous if it is intended to keep in Section 3 the term &ldquo;autonomous body.&rdquo; The Dáil is aware of the feeling that exists amongst Deputies on this side of the House that this Industrial Development Authority may turn out to be the old Tariff Commission dressed up, and nothing that has been said yet by the Parliamentary Secretary has removed that feeling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cumann na nGaedheal Government set up the Tariff Commission with the obligation of investigating, as a court would investigate, applications for the imposition of customs duties for protective purposes.  That commission reported to the Government following each investigation.  It was a procedure which imposed interminable delay on <Col N="788" /> every attempt to promote industrial development of any kind and led inevitably to the abandonment of many industrial projects which might have proceeded if there had been a more encouraging attitude on the part of the Government of the time, or if these prolonged investigations of relevant and irrelevant matters relating to the industry or company concerned were not carried out.  If it is intended that this Industrial Development Authority shall undertake on its own initiative prolonged investigations of that kind, either in relation to tariff applications or the operation of tariffs, then I think there should be some power given to the Minister to check it, because it can do very considerable harm.</P>
    <P>May I say that I learned that by experience?  The first Prices Commission set up by the Act of 1933 could and did function independently of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I must record my disgust when I found it had occupied a very long period of time, after it came into operation, investigating the price charged for a commodity that was not subject to protection at all and that was being sold by an Irish concern in competition with the world.  That concern was making profits and it was this fact that attracted the attention of the Prices Commission.  Where there were industries that might have been taking an unfair advantage of the protection afforded them I thought it was a waste of time to be inquiring about a commodity that was not protected.  When the Prices Commission Act was amended there was a different procedure followed.</P>
    <P>I fear what this Industrial Development Authority, as an autonomous body able to function in these matters independently of the Minister, able to defy the Minister when he expresses a desire that they should not do it, might do in the way of slowing down industrial development, and I think the Minister should have power generally to supervise their activities.  They should not be autonomous in the ordinary meaning of that term.  They should investigate only matters that he thinks are worth investigating and nothing else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> The body established by this legislation will be in a strong position.  The members of it are not merely people who are appointed by the Minister and who are removable by the Minister. The proposal is that they will be appointed by the Dáil and they are named in the Bill.  It will be an Act of the Oireachtas that will give them their position.  They cannot be removed by the Minister except for stated misconduct or incapacity.  They will hold office to a date in 1954, a date named in the Bill, and if any of them chooses to use that appointment over that period of time for purposes that would be regarded by the Minister as a waste of their time or harmful in their consequences, he cannot do anything about it, because the exercise of the power given by the Bill could not, in any circumstances, be described as stated misconduct.  Is it intended that this Industrial Development Authority will be an instrument of the Minister or is it intended, like the Supreme Court or the High Court, to be an independent authority which can function independently even against the Government's wishes?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, this authority will be responsible to the Minister in the exercise of its functions.  The amendment which was accepted just now makes assurance doubly sure.  It provides that this body will be responsible and answerable as a unit or body, as distinct from individual members, to the Minister.  The reason for making this body an autonomous body is to give it freedom from normal Civil Service procedure and practice to regulate its procedure, to undertake investigations and to make inquiries free from the ordinary restrictions which we associate with Civil Service procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputies recognise that for the particular work for which this body has been set up it is essential it should have that freedom and that liberty of action.  Deputy Lemass mentioned that it might be comparable to the old Tariff Commission, which was regarded as rather slow and which took some time to make recommendations and caused what appeared to be unnecessary delay.  In introducing the Prices <Col N="790" /> and Efficiency Bill in 1947, Deputy Lemass provided that a number of factors would be taken into consideration by the commission or body set up in relation to tariffs and price protection generally and the effect on public economy.  It would review existing tariffs.  The Tariff Commission examined proposals initially and tried to gauge their effect and consequently the procedure was a slow one, but I think there is a general recognition that the functions and duties defined in Section 3 of the Bill are defined in the manner in which the Dáil wishes and in the manner in which public opinion desires, in order to give effective protection generally regarding prices charged to the community.  In order to see how protection works and whether the rate is unduly high or not, or whether there is some element which should be taken into consideration, it is necessary that a body of this sort should investigate it.</P>
    <P>If the body is to function effectively it should be free and autonomous. That is necessary in order to carry out properly and efficiently the responsibilities and the defined functions under Section 3.  The body is responsible to the Minister and the Minister is responsible to the Dáil, so there is no question of it functioning in any way which might be regarded as inconsistent with national policy or with economic policy as laid down from time to time by the Government or by Parliament. From every point of view, it is desirable that the autonomy which this body has under this Bill should be retained and, consequently, I must oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I certainly would agree that the board should not be subject to Civil Service control&mdash;I think we all agree on that&mdash;in other words, that it would not have all the kinds of queries about procedure coming in from the Department of Industry and Commerce.  At the same time, the word &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; has two interpretations&mdash;one from Deputy Lemass and one from the Parliamentary Secretary &mdash;and the question is as to which interpretation it will get in practice.  If they are to be autonomous in regard to control of their own procedure, I do not see any objection; but if it means that for the period of their appointment they can do whatever they like it would be a serious matter.  Perhaps between now and the Report Stage the Parliamentary Secretary would consider that particular aspect of interpretation. I am quite sure it would be no desire of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary that this board would not be subject to him and through him to the Dáil except in so far as their actual procedure and their method of operation would be concerned. Certainly, as regards the responsibilities, there ought to be no doubt whatever about it.</P>

I think it would lead to a great deal of friction if the members of the authority could go down to some private firm, which had no desire to have any talk whatsoever with them, and start advising that firm as to how to run its business.  Remember, people can start industries here without going to the Industrial Development Authority, the Department of Industry and Commerce or any Government Department.  There is no law in the Statute Book which says that nobody can start an industry. They go then to the Department of Industry and Commerce or to the Industrial Development Authority only if they want protection, Government assistance in procuring raw materials, or some other form of Government aid or, perhaps, if they require a building licence.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>When the authority reports to the Minister on the effects of protective measures, the Government shall not remove, suspend or amend any customs duty or restriction on importation, to which such report refers, until the said report has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard this amendment as an important one.  This Industrial Development Authority will have the function of investigating the effect of protective measures with special reference to employment, prices, quality, wage levels, etc.  Presumably, if an investigation shows that there is something unsatisfactory in any industry in relation to these matters, the Minister will take action to remedy the position.  As matters stand now, the only effective sanction the Minister has is to withdraw, or threaten to withdraw, or reduce, the protection given by law.  That was my difficulty on various occasions when considering this question of controlling protected industries because this is a sanction which can rarely be used.  If a particular concern, or a number of concerns, engaged in some industry are not functioning satisfactorily, if their goods are of poor quality, their <Col N="795" /> prices unduly high, their conditions of employment and level of wages unduly low, it does not remedy anything to withdraw the protection which brought the industry into being.  That not merely punishes efficient firms just as much as the inefficient ones, but it certainly is no remedy for the unsatisfactory conditions so far as the employees are concerned and not even, in my view, so far as the public is concerned.</P>
    <P>The purpose I had in mind in framing the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Act was to devise alternative sanctions, methods that could be applied in order to force efficiency upon industries which were found to be inefficient and methods which did not involve wiping out an industry altogether.  I do not want to discuss that particular measure now, but I did recognise then, and I think the Dáil should accept now, that if the authority has carried out an investigation into the conditions in any industry and reported to the Minister that the industry is badly managed or organised and producing goods of poor quality or at unduly high prices and the Minister feels he must do something about it, that he should not do anything in the way of removing protective duties or reducing the measure of protection afforded without giving the Dáil an opportunity of seeing the report submitted to him by the authority.  That is what the Industrial Efficiency and Prices Bill, 1947, proposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister was given drastic powers to handle such cases, powers which were attacked here and outside because of their particular character, but powers which he could not begin to use until he had published to the Dáil the report he had received which, in his view, justified the use of such powers.</P>
    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to establish a similar procedure in relation to this Bill.  I seek to get the Dáil to accept that if there is a report made by this Industrial Development Authority to the Minister under sub-section (6) of Section 3 and if, as a result of that report, the Government <Col N="796" /> decides to remove, suspend or amend any customs duty or other restriction on importation, that, before doing so, it should publish to the Dáil the report upon which it is acting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment because I think it must be obvious to the House that, if the Government is to take action quickly in, for instance, a case of dumping or for any other reason, then patently an opportunity of forestalling such action would be afforded by the publication of the report by laying it on the Table of the House.  If the Dáil happened to be in Recess, widespread efforts could be made to counteract the effect of any action the Government might take. Most amendments in the past and at the present time are for the purpose of increasing the rate of tariff.  Even if the Government wished to reduce the rate or alter the size of a quota, if advance publicity is given to that immediate steps can be taken to stock up or defeat in some other way the effects of whatever decision the Government may take.  One of the problems at any time is that, if there is a suggestion that protection will be introduced, immediate steps are taken to stock up or in some way to avail of the existing situation to defeat or delay the effect sought to be created by the imposition of a tariff.  If publicity is given in a matter of this kind by laying on the Table of the Dáil the report furnished to the Government that will inevitably retard the effectiveness of any Government decision.  The Industrial Efficiency and Prices Act did lay down the procedure under which reports would be presented to the Dáil but up to the present all protective measures have for their effectiveness rested in most cases on the rapidity with which a decision can be taken and put into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If at any time there is a suggestion that protection is to be afforded or any alteration made in the existing rate of protection, then the effects can be nullified by rapid action on the part of those people who are prepared to take a chance.  If this amendment were accepted, it would restrict the powers of the Government to take action quickly and, consequently, effectively. <Col N="797" /> I do not see any reason why any particular decision based on a report from the Industrial Development Authority should be presented to the House any more than a normal decision taken by the Minister on the basis of the advice available to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would resist this amendment for the reasons stated by the Parliamentary Secretary. We place responsibility on the Government and the effectiveness of Government action depends entirely on the speed with which that action is taken. In the public interest it is essential that the Government should act speedily and effectively.  If that is not done, the effectiveness is nullified.  In the ordinary way I would contend for Dáil control but, after all, we can have control in this matter by taking advantage of those methods by which a particular decision can be brought up for discussion and review here.  It is the type of thing that, in the public interest, must be dealt with speedily and quickly.  The bringing of a report before the Dáil, which could be debated here, would, I think, defeat, probably, very good recommendations that might be made to the Government.  To a large extent that course would hamstring the Government.  If we hold the Government responsible in these matters, as we must, then I think we cannot interfere with it in the proper exercise of its responsibilities.  For these reasons I could not support the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire whatever to deprive the Government of the power to impose customs duties or to increase customs duties speedily without any previous notification to the Dáil or to anybody else.  I was I think responsible for pressing on the previous Government the necessity for legislation giving that power.  In reading over my amendment again, I realise that it does not quite express fully the idea I had in mind when preparing it. What I am anxious to ensure is that the Government will not remove, suspend or reduce customs' duties speedily without giving the Dáil an opportunity of examining the justification for their action, on a report <Col N="798" /> from the Industrial Development Authority that it is a desirable step to take to penalise some industry for its inefficiency.  This is a situation which may never arise.  On the other hand, we have seen a member of the Government attacking a particular industry last week, the tanning industry, in public.  Under a normal Government that speech would be taken by the public as indicating the intention of the Government to take some action in relation to the tanning industry, at least of asking this Industrial Development Authority to look into it.  If the speech is any indication of what the investigation might result in, then we must conceive the possibility of a report from the Industrial Development Authority to the Minister recommending that the protection which that industry at present enjoys should be removed.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that if such a recommendation comes from the authority to the Government, a recommendation that a particular industry benefiting by protection is not efficient, that it is producing goods which are in the opinion of the authority not of sufficiently good quality or are too dear and that it should be wiped out by the withdrawal of the protection which created it, then I want the Dáil to have an opportunity of considering it before the Government takes action.  Whatever case there is for speed when the imposition of duties or the increase of duties is involved, there is not anything like the same case for it where their removal is concerned, and particularly their removal as a form of penalty upon those who previously benefited under a duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has often been suggested here that some of the industries which were established in consequence of the imposition of protective tariffs had not developed as fully as was anticipated at the time or had not developed on the right lines, and that we should wipe them out and start again.  I must say that, on occasion, I was often tempted to consider that course when representations of a verbal kind to those directing the industries did not produce the increase in efficiency or the <Col N="799" /> increase in output or employment which had been deemed practicable. That course was, however, precluded by the realisation that such a step would involve putting a number of people out of employment and might indirectly hit other industrialists who were not to blame for the conditions that it was sought to remedy.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government is going far enough at all in this Bill to take powers to enforce efficiency in industry or to supervise the development of industries which are benefiting from protection, or to insist upon them utilising in full the opportunities which are there for them.  But, if they were proposing to go further, then they would have to consider again the problem that I considered in 1947&mdash;the alternative methods of making their will effective.  The only method open to them now is to withdraw or reduce the protective tariffs, and it is only when they decide to take that course that I intend to ask that the Dáil should be given the opportunity of considering their justification for it by seeing the report from the Industrial Development Authority which led to their decision.</P>
    <P>Amendment put and declared negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 4 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) The authority shall not exercise any function in relation to</P>
      <P>(a) the administration of the Control of Manufactures Acts;</P>
      <P>(b) the administration of the Control of Imports Act;</P>
      <P>(c) the administration of the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Acts;</P>
      <P>(d) the granting of licences for the importation free of customs duty of dutiable goods;</P>
      <P>(e) any other power or duty conferred on the Minister by statute,</P>
      <P>unless a resolution approving of the giving of such function to the authority has been passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> (2) A resolution under the preceding sub-section of the section shall be effective for a period of one year and no longer, and at the end of that time the authority shall cease to have the function to which the resolution referred, unless and until another similar resolution is passed by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The question which arises on this amendment is one, I think, of very considerable importance, one that came to the knowledge of the House only when the Minister made his speech proposing that the Bill should get a Second Reading.  When the Government first established the Industrial Development Authority, and when the Bill was circulated, it seemed to be a straightforward proposition&mdash;more or less straightforward&mdash;to set up a board to investigate industrial possibilities and make recommendations to the Government concerning them.  Subsequently, however, we learned that the Minister proposed to transfer to this board many of the administrative functions previously exercised by the Department of Industry and Commerce under the authority of other Acts.  In fact, we know that the Industrial Development Authority, even in advance of the passage of this Bill, has already been exercising these functions. What are these functions?  They are functions under the Control of Manufactures Acts, under the Control of Imports Act, under the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Acts and under various Finance Acts, under which the Minister is empowered to grant licences for the duty-free importation of goods, and possibly under other Acts as well.  That decision of the Government to leave the effective administration of these Acts to the Industrial Development Authority has been tried out in practice.</P>
    <P>We are discussing this Bill in rather unusual circumstances.  It is a Bill which proposes to authorise the establishment of an authority which was in fact set up 18 months ago, and which has been functioning ever since.  Not merely can the Minister, but individual Deputies and citizens also, judge the desirability of leaving to this authority the administrative functions <Col N="801" /> to which I have referred, administrative functions which were formerly exercised by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am in this position that, when framing this amendment, I had intended to put in separate amendments to cover each of the five paragraphs so that we could have a separate discussion on them, but the amendment appears in this form, and I leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I think the Industrial Development Authority could act in lieu of the advisory committees that functioned under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  I withdraw any objections which appear to be implied in this amendment to the Industrial Development Authority replacing the advisory committees under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  There is no point in having the two committees doing the same job, but I hope the functions of the authority under the Act are limited to the functions previously exercised by the advisory committees.  A recommendation from the committee for a trade loan has not merely to secure the approval of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; it has also to secure the approval of the Minister for Finance.  Though the Minister for Industry and Commerce may be prepared to act blindly on a recommendation of the authority, I doubt if he could bring the Department of Finance that far.  Where it comes, however, to other questions which intimately affect the business of individual citizens, I think it is not good enough to have these matters passed over to a non-official body such as this. In the course of the past few days, I met some traders who went along to the Department of Industry and Commerce in Kildare Street last week for consultations which they intended to have with representatives of the Minister for Industry and Commerce relating to a quota Order.  The question of fixing a new quota was under consideration and both the importers and the manufacturers were anxious to discuss the matter with the officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  They went to the building in Kildare Street and they met an official of the Department of Industry and Commerce, but before the proceedings <Col N="802" /> started, the official of the Department told them that he was not there as an official of the Department, that he was there as a representative of the Industrial Development Authority, that the Industrial Development Authority was not an official body and that the only thing he could do was to make a report to the Industrial Development Authority following the discussion.  Apparently what happens is that the Industrial Development Authority, having considered that report, themselves make a recommendation back to the Department which that official presumably takes to the Minister and gets him to approve of it.</P>
    <P>I have seen to-day a circular issued to a number of traders telling them that they will recommend the issue of duty free licences for the importation of nylons before the 1st February if they cost more than 70/- a dozen.  There is inevitably a doubt in the minds of the traders who received that circular as to where precisely they stand.  Is it the situation that recommendations from this authority are accepted by the Minister?  The Parliamentary Secretary shakes his head.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I said &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not accepted. Therefore the position is that the individual trader who wants a licence to import goods free of duty, who wants some alteration in a control of imports Order or some other change, has an opportunity of arguing his case for it only to the authority, and he is left under the impression that what the authority recommends will happen. While I cannot say that I know of any case where a course recommended by the authority was rejected by the Minister, I know of many cases where the authority gave people to understand that they did make a recommendation on which no action was taken.  I gather the position apparently was that if the Minister disagreed with the authority's recommendation, he either left the matter standing on his desk or sent it back to the authority to have another look at it, leading to further delay with inevitably adverse <Col N="803" /> consequences on the business of the persons concerned.</P>
      <P>This amendment is proposed first of all on the grounds of administrative efficiency.  It is unsatisfactory from an administrative point of view that this change should be made.  It is undesirable from the point of view of traders who are naturally concerned with the way in which the powers of the Minister under these various Acts are exercised.  There is a further reason than that.  For many years the power of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to grant duty free import licences was the subject of debate in the Dáil, and, not infrequently, of rather discreditable misrepresentation in the Dáil, but there was always the answer made to those who queried the use of these powers, that the Minister was responsible for every individual act of his to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>He had to come to the Dáil, give full information as to the manner in which he exercised his powers, and be prepared to defend every single licence issued by him if the propriety of his action were questioned here.  Now we are apparently putting between the Minister and the Dáil this Industrial Development Authority because it will always be open to the Minister, if his actions are questioned here, to defend himself on the ground that the course he took was recommended by the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is good enough nor do I think it is good enough that the particular method of procedure, of which the Dáil approved when passing these Acts, should be warped in this manner so that an alternative method, not contemplated by the Dáil at the time, is now in operation.  Where the question of issuing duty free licences arises there is some element of discrimination possible.  Normally it is a limited element.  The Minister announces, or makes known through the trade channels concerned, that duty free licences for certain goods will be available and that everybody who applies for them will get them, or that licences up to a certain quantity are available and will be distributed amongst applicants on some rationing basis.  If the Minister goes further <Col N="804" /> and issues in certain circumstances a licence to one individual, then the name of that individual and the particulars of the licence must be placed on the Table of the Dáil.  All that procedure was established because it was recognised that where there was the power of discrimination between individuals and a power of individual decision given to the Minister, there was also the danger of a mistake, or an abuse or, at any rate, the danger that suspicion would be associated with it.  It is not good enough in my view for the Industrial Development Authority to decide that they are prepared to recommend, for example, licences to import nylons duty free from now until February next if the traders who are invited to make applications for these duty free licences do not know at the time they make them whether the Minister is going to accept the Industrial Development Authority's recommendation or not.  It would be an entirely different proposition if a circular went out from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to tell traders that he would give these licences in certain circumstances to certain traders.  The element of uncertainty and doubt which now exists and which must continue to exist when administration is done at secondhand through the Industrial Development Authority is very undesirable.  That applies both to the Control of Imports Acts and to the duties imposed by the various Finance Acts which admit of duty free licences.</P>
    <P>I want Deputies to notice particularly the intention of the Minister to transfer to the Industrial Development Authority his functions under the Control of Manufactures Acts.  The Control of Manufactures Acts were a necessary corollary of the industrial development policy.  They were intended to ensure that the imposition of tariffs by the Irish Government to promote industrial development would not merely result in the creation here of branch factories of British concerns, limited in scope, which would disappear if the protection which created them were withdrawn. In order to minimise that risk, a risk which was peculiar to this country being alongside a great industrial State with which we had had <Col N="805" /> intimate industrial relations over a long number of years, it was decided to insist that except in exceptional circumstances all industrial development would be under the control of companies owned and in the main managed by Irish citizens.  That was a limiting policy.  No doubt if we had not decided on that policy we could have got a larger number of factories established more quickly but on a far less secure basis.  In passing that Act the Dáil with reluctance gave the Minister power to exempt certain companies from the obligation to be Irish-owned and Irish-controlled by authorising him to issue Control of Manufactures Act licences&mdash;subject to a whole series of conditions which were set out by that Act&mdash;in specific cases.  I think that that is a matter of Government policy &mdash;the extent to which these powers are used.  I think that the Dáil should object strongly to the Minister's farming out his functions under that Act to any body, to any autonomous body such as it is proposed to set up here with which the Dáil has not got intimate contact.</P>
    <P>There is another function of the Minister's under the Control of Manufactures Act in which Deputy McQuillan may be particularly interested. One of the problems which we had to consider in our day when we were promoting industrial development was the likelihood that industrial development would in the main be concentrated around east coast towns and that if we were to get industrial concerns interested in establishing factories in the West of Ireland we would have to take special powers to ensure it.  We took special powers to guarantee to anybody who started a new industry with our approval in the West of Ireland that he would not be subsequently subjected to competition from another concern starting up in Dublin or in Cork or in some more convenient centre.  That power of giving reserved commodity licences to persons engaging in industries in the West of Ireland was not very extensively used. The first time it was used was for the purpose of assisting a thread factory in Westport and I invite Deputy McQuillan to read the debates of the Dáil over a long period of years following <Col N="806" /> the establishment of that factory during which the Government was criticised, abused and misrepresented because of the limiting effect of the exercise of these powers upon competition in that industry or any other industry established under that section of the Control of Manufactures Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So much public agitation followed that attempt to induce industries into the West of Ireland that the Government was naturally reluctant to use its powers for that purpose in other cases, yet here we have a proposal that that particular power, the exercise of which was so criticised before the war, should pass from the Minister to this body which is not responsible to the Dáil and which is not even under an obligation to report to the Dáil if it uses these powers.  I do not think that that is desirable.  The Parliamentary Secretary's answer will be that whatever is done in the long run will be done on the authority of the Minister.  That is true, but both from the point of view of administrative efficiency and convenience and from the point of view of helping traders and manufacturers to know precisely <Col N="807" /> where they stand, particularly in relation to the importation of goods and other matters to which I referred &mdash;I am thinking particularly of the special powers given to the Minister under the Control of Manufactures Act&mdash;it would be far better if things were handled by the Minister's own officials and the Department of Industry and Commerce.  In that way people dealing with these officials would know that they were speaking at first hand to the Minister's representatives and that whatever decision was conveyed through them was a final decision which would be implemented. I am quite certain that if the Parliamentary Secretary consults with any of the trade organisations which have been compelled to deal with these questions of the control of imports and regulations as to customs duties in a roundabout manner in the present year since the Industrial Development Authority was created, and if he gets their opinion on the practice they will easily convince him that it is a bad practice and that it should be removed.</P>
      <P>Furthermore&mdash;and this objection will, I think, appeal to Deputy Captain Cowan&mdash;inevitably the day-to-day administrative work given to the Industrial Development Authority under the Acts is so heavy that they have no time to do anything else, and a large part of the failure of the Industrial Development Authority to produce more decisive results in the general industrial field in the very favourable circumstances now existing is because they are cluttered up with questions such as whether nylons should be imported, how many and at what price between now and the 1st February.  Surely there are competent officials in the Department of Industry and Commerce who could deal with these matters without bringing this highly paid body into consultation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question which was raised in the Dáil by Deputy Lehane.  He asked if the members of the Industrial Development Authority could divide their functions amongst themselves so that one individual member would be responsible for the discharge of one set of functions and another member would be responsible for the discharge of another set.  I believe that that is so.  At least it is well known that if you want to deal with duty-free licences for goods that are otherwise subject to a customs duty you go to one member, and that if you want to deal with quotas you go to another member, but that was denied by the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of the Minister, and as the Bill stands there is no such power to divide their functions between the members of the Industrial Development Authority.  It is the Industrial Development Authority as such that must act, and we must assume therefore when we are dealing with importations of nylons, quotas for hats or anything else that it is the Industrial Development Authority which meets and discusses them.  Because it is meeting and discussing these matters which could be handled more expeditiously and efficiently by officials of the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;if nothing else from the Minister's own point of view&mdash;it was a mistake to have farmed out his functions.  I am quite certain that it was not the original intention to farm out his functions.  It was an afterthought, and so perhaps they will think further about it.  If, as I have said, they consult with traders affected by the change before they do their further thinking, they will have little difficulty in making up their minds to go back to the better arrangement which previously existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Lemass has built up a case which has not got a great deal of foundation in fact.  First, the administration of the Control of Manufactures Act is a function exercised by the Minister or by the Parliamentary Secretary or whoever else is in charge, and as the Deputy is <Col N="809" /> well aware, there were in his day a number of applications per week which had to be dealt with and which had to be referred to the Minister for decision as to whether a particular individual or concern was to be granted a licence under that Act or not.  The decision in all these cases is taken by the Minister or by whomsoever is functioning on his behalf.  It is, however, either the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary. In present circumstances, numerous similar applications are dealt with in the course of a week, and maybe a few in a single day sometimes. There is no change whatever in the procedure of dealing with these applications.</P>
      <P>I hope that Deputy McQuillan will not be misled into the belief that the exercise of these functions in some way confers particular benefits on the West of Ireland.  It may be that some competitive concern anxious to establish itself in the West in the particular circumstances in which the Westport Thread Company was set up was refused a manufacture licence.  That particular company was given a reserved commodity licence, but, in general, there are no powers available at present under statute, and were none at any time in the past, which would enable the Government to direct the establishment of factories in any part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so, and I hope that Deputy McQuillan will not be under any illusion about it.  Similarly with the Control of Imports Act, duty-free licences are granted by the Minister. In practice, a great number of functions are carried out under the duty-free section by officials who act in the name of the Minister.  That is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience shows that over a number of years in any Government Department a number of functions are carried out by the particular Minister responsible, but, in effect and in practice, general policy is laid down, and, subject to compliance with general policy, a number of individuals carry out these functions.  If difficulties <Col N="810" /> arise, or if at any time trade organisations wish to make representations, they make them, in the first instance, to officials and, if necessary, then, direct to the Minister.  That is the practice which has operated since the establishment of the State and I think it is a practice common to other countries as well, so that there is nothing remarkable in these duties being carried out by officials of the particular section concerned.</P>
    <P>The fact that at present some of these functions to which the Deputy has referred are carried out by officials who are under the Industrial Development Authority is, I think, nothing unusual. It may be that, for precise purposes, the authority should delegate particular duties to the staff, but in effect these various functions, either under the Control of Manufactures Act or the Control of Imports Act in relation to the granting of duty-free licences, are all part of the protection machine which is designed to assist industry.  It is probably a reflection on the general working of the machine that so many duty-free licences have to be issued. They are useful for precise cases and the advantage of the issue of a duty-free licence quickly and at a particular time is obvious.  But generally, the fact that so many such licences have to be issued for such a wide variety of commodities is, in itself, a criticism of the effect of protection, either because manufacturers here are not able to supply the market or alternatively because people under the protection may be taking advantage of the particular rate of protection operating for a specific article or range of goods.</P>
    <P>With regard to trade loans, the Deputy withdrew any objection with regard to the system under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts working reasonably well and the Industrial Development Authority can function as a committee in the same manner as <i>ad hoc</i> committees functioned in the past.  All these functions mentioned, however, are nominally, if not in fact, carried out by the Minister.  The practice has been, and I suppose will be in the future, because of the administrative difficulty and impossibility of the Minister issuing the licences personally, to have them carried out and issued by <Col N="811" /> staff in some section of the Department. The fact that at the moment the staff of the Industrial Development Authority are dealing with it is due to the general system under which protection is administered and the responsibility which this body has for protection and looking into the whole question of industry and its development, and I think it only reasonable that these different parts of the protection machine should be administered under that body; but to say that, when the traders were in the Department, they were told they were visiting the offices of the Industrial Development Authority or that it was that body which was dealing with the matter is an exaggeration of the effect or influence which the authority might have on the traders concerned. In the past, before this authority was set up, these traders would visit the Department and be interviewed possibly by the same officials&mdash;and, in the main, the same officials are still dealing with it&mdash;and subsequently, whatever decision was taken was taken by the Minister.  At present, they still visit the Department.  The section concerned is under the Industrial Development Authority and whatever decision is taken is taken by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary did not make some reference to the Industrial Development Authority's staff position.  I take it that, with all the functions it has to carry out and all the responsibilities placed on it, it must have a staff.  Whether a section of the Department of Industry and Commerce has been handed over to it as staff or not, I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is only part of the question.  I certainly agree with Deputy Lemass, and I have already expressed the view that, unless this Industrial Development Authority is left free to deal with major matters, the purpose for which it was established will not be achieved.  It is the general feeling that the authority is snowed under with the consideration of matters that were entirely routine matters in the Department of Industry and Commerce and that, consequently, they are not in a position to deal with important matters.  If it is correct that they have divided the responsibility amongst themselves and that one member takes on one particular line and another another and so on, that is not in accordance with the provisions of this Bill, nor is it in accordance with statements made when this authority was first authorised.  They are to act as a unit and they have no right, for the purpose of overtaking or overcoming the heavy work thrust upon them, to divide up the duties and responsibilities amongst themselves.  If the authority will realise that they have no authority to act in an independent capacity and that they must act as an authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not understand that when the authority were set up or even under this Bill I did not understand that it is permissible for them to divide up the duties and responsibilities amongst themselves because, if that were so, it would mean that an individual would be acting in respect of certain matters and that the authority might agree among themselves that whatever the individual member, in respect of the duties allocated <Col N="813" /> to him, might decide, would be the decision of the authority.</P>

      <P>As I said, I feel that a division of responsibility amongst members would be a very undesirable thing, because there is the danger that the authority would adopt as an authority decision the decision of an individual member without examination. I would consider that to be a very objectionable feature.  Clearly, as far as the public are concerned, the public have the right to go to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and it is the Minister's responsibility if he transmits to this authority certain matters for consideration by them.  But I think it would be wrong in the first instance for the Minister's Department to suggest to a citizen that he should go and have a discussion with the authority.  I think he ought to make his case to the Minister, the Minister refer it to the authority, receive advice from the authority and come to his decision.  Before he comes to that decision, however, the individual citizen ought to have the right to discuss the matter with the Minister or his representative. That is vital, and it is vital also from the point of view of parliamentary control that the matter should be operated in that fashion.  I certainly agree that the Authority ought to be free from a number of these routine matters that will prevent them from dealing with the major matter of starting industry.  I gathered from Deputy Lemass that private traders recently received licences to import signed by the Industrial Development Authority or by a member.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement from the authority saying that they would recommend licences.  I think that is undesirable, because the responsibility is on the Minister and, if the authority makes a recommendation, that recommendation <Col N="814" /> should go to the Minister. It puts the Minister in an embarrassing position if the authority will send out to certain people a circular saying they will recommend and then the Minister may not accept that recommendation. That is an objectionable way of doing the thing and I do not think the authority should have that right under any circumstances.  The question as to whether nylons should be imported at 70/- a dozen is a matter for another day.  I do not think, however, that it is right that this authority should communicate with the public telling the public of recommendations they are going to make to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy is not confusing the intimation to a trade organisation that the Minister is recommending a duty free licence. Under that system the recommendation is made to the Revenue Commissioners and they issue it.  The Deputy may be confusing the recommendation which the Minister makes to the Revenue Commissioners.  In practice, of course, once a recommendation is made it is acted upon but there is a distinction between a recommendation to the Revenue Commissioners and any recommendation that the authority themselves may make to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I took Deputy Lemass as stating that this circular was issued by the authority stating that the authority was recommending a free import licence for so many hundred dozen, or whatever it may be, of nylons at a price of not less than 70/- a dozen.  Clearly, that is something that the Industrial Development Authority ought not to do.  That procedure would be entirely wrong. Perhaps, now that the Parliamentary Secretary has heard about it he will <Col N="815" /> inquire into it and will certainly not permit it to happen in the future.</P>
      <P>Briefly, I want to see this Industrial Development Authority free from the clutter of routine work that is being thrown on it, so that it will be free to create and set industries going.  If it does not bring about the establishment of additional industries in this country, then it were better it were never established at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all at one with Deputy Cowan in his desire to see that the Industrial Development Authority exercises its primary function, its function as commonly understood by the people generally.  This amendment 14, however, has a restrictive force which would to some extent reduce the activity of the authority on matters ancillary to that main general purpose.  Generally speaking, it is very easy to talk in the abstract about the initiation of proposals and schemes for the creation of Irish industries. This, however, is a very complicated matter.  No new industry can be created or given birth to, nor can the birth of it be assisted by the Industrial Development Authority without consideration of the very complicated circumstances of the present industrial set-up.  No industry starts <i>de novo.</i> On no aspect of the needs of the consumers or the needs of manufacturers or on none of the other divisions of industrial work can we conceive an industry starting without having some impact on the existing industries, not only definitely in that field but on the borderline and flowing over into fields of similar and related activity.  In so far as that is correct, the body will have to go further than merely initiate proposals or survey possibilities or advise on steps necessary and desirable for establishing these industries.  It will require to consider the effects of protective measures and the effects of tariffs and quotas and other restrictive devices on any such new industry being created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the Opposition permitted paragraph (vi) of Section 3 to pass, giving the authority this power of examining the effect of existing measures on the industries related to <Col N="816" /> any given industry they propose to create, it seems rather contradictory that their power should be attempted in this amendment to be nullified.  It is clearly a matter of importance to any person considering the establishment of a new industry, on which he may have been guided under paragraphs (v) and (vi) of Section 3, to understand and to have an examination by the authority of the effect of the administration of the Control of Manufactures Act on his particular industry, factory, workshop or whatever it may be.  How he can escape that, I cannot quite say from Deputy Lemass's contention in regard to this. In the same way, in connection with the Control of Imports Acts and the administration of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts, in which anyone interested in the initiation of a new industry would be closely interested, surely he should ask for and have the advice of this body on how all the existing industrial legislation will affect his proposals, whether adversely or otherwise.  It may be a matter of supreme importance to him as to whether he will continue with his proposals, particularly if he is not very conversant with the very complicated legislation governing industrial development in this country.  For that reason it does not appear to me that a very good case has been made for this amendment which seeks, if it is the intention, to prevent the Industrial Development Authority from being cluttered up by merely administrative work concerning tariffs and quotas, nylons and silks and other matters of subsidiary and minor importance.  With that we are all in agreement, but surely, however, this cluttering up of the Industrial Development Authority is not a criticism of that authority so much as a criticism of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Department under his jurisdiction. While it is incumbent upon the authority to examine under paragraph (vii) of Section 3 any proposals referred to the authority by the Minister, there is nothing in this Bill which would indicate that the Industrial Development Authority is a body which is likely to welcome such routine matters nor is the record so far <Col N="817" /> available nor the opinions of the members of that Industrial Development Authority, in so far as they may be known, in any way indicative of their encouraging this type of work. I think that each of them would be very glad to be relieved of this routine duty and that this authority, or the creation of it, has given quite a number of executive heads in the Department of Industry and Commerce a unique opportunity of practising the American act of &ldquo;passing the buck&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me, from my little experience&mdash;and I am sure this would be borne out by others who have greater experience in the matter&mdash;that whatever appears to be difficult to certain sections of the Department of Industry and Commerce, whatever appears to have the slighest element of doubt in connection with any proposal before them, is referred to the Industrial Development Authority.  It would appear that certain sections of the Department think that this newlycreated body, the Industrial Development Authority, is the body on which they can unload all their troubles or a certain part of their work.  That is a criticism of the Department.  The Minister might be asked to consider whether this unloading of routine work on the authority should not be curtailed. It has grown and is tending to grow beyond reasonable bounds.</P>
    <P>It has become necessary and, I suppose, under the most favourable set of circumstances it would become necessary, that the Industrial Development Authority should institute some form of division of labour among themselves. Whether that is implicit or explicit in the Bill, it will be done.  It has already been done, despite any parliamentary denial.  Anybody who is in touch with the Industrial Development Authority knows, as Deputy Lemass said, that each member of this board is charged with or is primarily concerned with one or other of the different types of work which relate to the board and which come before the board.  One member of the board is primarily concerned with the establishing of new industries and if any <i>entrepreneur</i> has the idea <Col N="818" /> of starting an industry, he will naturally be referred in the first instance to this particular member of the board. Whether that particular member of the board objects to the proposal or favours the proposal or has any views or observations upon the proposal, naturally, it will be the procedure of the board to have regular meetings, weekly, daily or otherwise, at which the various problems assembled by each of the members is brought before the board and the board get a quick review of the whole question.  The unessential and unnecessarily detailed portions of the proposal have been condensed by the particular member charged with investigating the proposal. Thus, the time of the board is saved.</P>
    <P>That is a natural labour-saving device that any board of this nature will create for itself.  It is a line of action that will develop in any efficient board and no objection can be taken to it.  The only objection, as was already suggested by some Deputies, probably under a misapprehension of the idea, is that a member of the board may have been in the past, or might be in the future, tempted to render a decision on his own account. I do not know whether there is any case of that.  That, of course, is not likely to be the practice of the board. There is nothing that indicates that here.  So long as the board gives its imprimatur to a decision, even if it is arrived at by one member of the board, and endorses the advice that he suggested should be given to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that appears to me to be a quite well-regulated business, a quite businesslike type of procedure to which there should be no objection.</P>
    <P>That should dispose of the contention that the board has been going on the wrong lines, in so far as, up to the present, it has been reduced to a board for which too much material of work has been found by the Department. In my opinion, that is not a criticism of the board but a criticism of the Department.  We should try to avoid that so as to enable the authority to get on with its primary work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 13, to delete all words after the word &ldquo;appointment&rdquo; to the end of sub-section.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Government decided to write into the Bill this provision, that if a member is reappointed on the expiration of any period of office it must be on terms not less favourable to him than those upon which he was first appointed.  Whatever their motive, I do not think that they are doing such a favour to the members of the authority whom they have appointed as may appear at first sight because by this provision they have created a situation that, if at any subsequent time it should be decided to reduce the function of the authority to such an extent that it might be considered necessary to have all, or some of them on a part-time basis, the existing members could not be reappointed, and in order to bring about that change the Government would have to appoint new members and, while the appointment of new members might not disimprove the Authority, I am sure it is not the position that the Government intend to create.  It is open to the Minister to decide the terms and conditions of the appointment of any member, and it seems to me that it is wiser that he should leave himself free to consider the circumstances of the time and the merits of the individual he proposes to appoint, rather than that he should bind himself by statute to reappoint them only upon conditions not less favourable than those on which they were appointed originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section was to give an assurance to the persons appointed that in the event of reappointment the terms would not be less favourable.  These people had positions in commercial industrial life and consequently, when requested to relinquish their ordinary work, it was necessary to give them some assurance that, at the end of their term of office in the authority&mdash;subject, I suppose, to the possibility of changing Ministers or a change of Government&mdash;in the <Col N="822" /> event of reappointment the terms would be not less favourable.  I think it is reasonable that a person accepting a position of this nature should get such an assurance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass has referred to the possibility of the functions being diminished in some way.  That would require an amendment of the Act and, if that occurred, provision could be made during such alteration for a revision of the terms.  In the event of no revision of the Act, there is no case for refusing reappointment on the same terms as were given in the first instance.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is wrong in one respect.  A substantial reduction in the duties now exercised by the Industrial Development Authority could be effected by administrative order, without any amendment.  All this work regarding licences, quotas and so on is work to which there is no reference in the Bill, work which the Minister decided to give them and gave them by administrative order.  It could be reversed by administrative order.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wants this in, he can have it, but the effect is that if at any time it should be decided to reduce the functions and consequently reduce the remuneration of the members, the only way to bring it about is by appointing new members&mdash; and that does not seem to me to be anything like an assurance to the present members.</P>

      <P>I think it is a superfluous amendment, in so far as the Minister has set out in this Bill the terms of the remuneration, service, and <Col N="823" /> so on, only for the period.  If these members have discharged their duties and functions to the best of their capacity and to the satisfaction of the House, they will be reappointed, it is assumed; and if they are to be reappointed we hope that the Minister and the Opposition will not depart from the usual custom of giving increments to competent officials when they have discharged their work.  If they have proved incompetent or have not discharged their duty, if they have done things which are against the interests of the country, surely the Minister will not reappoint them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (3) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister may at any time for stated reasons and shall if a member contravenes (by omission or act) the provisions of sub-section (11) or (12) of this section by Order remove a member from office and any such Order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (3) gives the Minister power to remove one of these named members before 1954 for stated misconduct or incapacity.  I think that is tying the Minister's hand far too tightly.  The normal phraseology used in other Acts providing for the appointment of members of boards by Ministers gives the Minister power to remove members for stated reasons.  I do not know what constitutes incapacity or misconduct.  If the Minister has good reason for removing a member, a reason he can state to the <Col N="824" /> House, he should have power to do so. The effect of leaving the sub-section as it stands means that the member cannot be removed for incompetence.  I think that is an undesirable restriction on the Minister's power.  Incompetence is neither misconduct nor incapacity. At least, incompetence has to go a long way before it becomes incapacity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>A disclosure under sub-section (11) would surely be misconduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point of my amendment.  It seems to me that whereas sub-section (11), which prohibits a member from disclosing information, or sub-section (12) which requires a member to give information regarding his financial interest in industrial concerns, do not provide for sanctions; one of the purposes of my amendment was to require the Minister to remove the member who committed either offence.  That, however, is a secondary consideration.  It is true that in certain circumstances the Minister could do it, but he could not remove a member who just proves himself incompetent. That is an undesirable limitation. He would be much wiser to accept my amendment, even if he leaves out the second part, and take power to remove him for stated reasons, which has been the normal provision in other Acts.</P>

      <P>I move amendment 16a:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (5) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  The remuneration, terms of appointment and conditions of service of a member may be fixed by contract entered into with him by the Minister, acting with the approval of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to delete sub-section (5) and substitute the amendment which has been circulated and is printed on the Order Paper to-day.  As Deputies are aware, the members of this authority were appointed in the first instance under contract and it is provided in the Schedule to the Bill that that contract will have legal effect.  This amendment provides a new sub-section which legalises the method of appointment and which, in addition, allows the contract to include the remuneration, terms of appointment and conditions of service under which the members of the authority may hold office, the contract being entered into with the Minister, acting with the approval of the Government.  The members of the <Col N="826" /> authority are rather apprehensive that their period of office might be disturbed and for that reason it is desirable to cover, by this sub-section, the contract entered into with them.  I think it is desirable that they should get an assurance carried into legal effect that the term of office for which they are appointed will be completed without disturbance or that, in the event of disturbance, that the terms of their appointment will be such as to enable them to be compensated for any loss between now and the end of the five years for which they were appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Government have entered into any contract with any member of the Industrial Development Authority they have done so without any legal authority from the Dáil.  The Dáil is only now considering the Bill which purports to authorise the establishment of this Industrial Development Authority.  It was in fact established 18 months ago.  Any contract made by the Government with the members of that authority is, so far as I am concerned, of no binding value whatsoever. I have already given notice here on the Second Reading of this Bill that this Party is opposed to this Bill and, should it become an Act, will repeal it so soon as this Party can command a majority in the Dáil; and no member can claim that he accepted membership of that body after the Government had obtained legal sanction for its creation without knowing that that position existed.  If the Minister is now trying to validate retrospectively some contract he made without legal authority 18 months ago he can, no doubt, do so by inserting this provision in the Bill; but, so far as I am concerned and so far as this Party is concerned, if and when the Bill is repealed every safeguard he now seeks to insert in it will disappear with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That might be a legal question and we need not try to interpret here any contract that may be entered into.  But it is precisely because members of the authority recognise that the tenure of office might be disturbed in the unlikely eventuality of any immediate change that it is necessary <Col N="827" /> to give legal effect to the warrant of appointment under which the members of the authority have been appointed.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (7), line 25, to delete the words &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;at the time of his appointment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (7) says that a member shall devote to his duties the whole of his time or so much of his time as the Minister may from time to time direct. That contemplates that the contract between the Minister and the member may be varied from time to time and that a member of this body appointed in accordance with the terms set out in the Schedule and at the rate of remuneration indicated there may be released by the Minister from the obligation of giving whole-time service by action under this sub-section.  I think it is far preferable to provide that the amount of time the member should devote to his duties should be fixed by the Minister at the time of his appointment and should not be subject to variation except the whole contract, including the rate of remuneration, is varied also.</P>

      <P>There is some substance in the contention of the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition in so far as it appears to me to establish a new precedent as a result of which we may have part-time members of this body, which is completely under the jurisdiction of the Minister, who do not appear to be in the same category as industrialists serving on different boards. They are in an advisory capacity.  They are civil servants.  It might be to the detriment of the members themselves if they were allowed to engage in other activities.  If they are members of the board they should be full-time members and, having heard so much about &ldquo;cluttering&rdquo; up their time, they would <Col N="828" /> not appear to have time for any other occupation.  As their remuneration is fixed and as there will be no diminution in that remuneration it would appear advisable to consider seriously the point made by the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition and to make them whole-time servants of the public.</P>

      <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill it was made abundantly clear that the intention was that the persons appointed to this body would act in a whole-time capacity.  I do not know whether or not it is necessary to accept Deputy Lemass's amendment in order to ensure that.  I would urge very strongly on the Parliamentary Secretary that the Dáil should not be asked to leave it open for members of this authority to engage in any profession or occupation or be gainfully employed other than in their capacity as directors of the Industrial Development Authority.  I take it the Dáil is entitled to an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary on that point.  If the position is not adequately covered, and I incline to the view that it is not, I urge on the Parliamentary Secretary that Deputy Lemass's amendment, or some other amendment, should be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>If for any reason the Minister deemed it advisable or desirable to vary, even in a specific case and for a limited period, the duties of a member of the Industrial Development Authority he could not do so and I think it is desirable to leave it as it is. <Col N="829" /> It gives the Minister freedom of action and the Minister has undertaken that that freedom shall be exercised on a whole-time basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is fair to the Dáil to ask that the Minister's hands should be left free in this matter.  The Bill was presented to the House on the Second Reading on the basis that these five members would not be gainfully engaged in any other occupation.  The Parliamentary Secretary instanced the case of the chairman who is also a director of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  Admittedly quite a good case could be made why that duality of that function should continue but it should not defeat the Parliamentary Secretary's ingenuity to bring in an amendment covering the position and, at the same time, meeting the case made by Deputy Lemass.  I would be prepared to accept the Parliamentary Secretary's assurance that that will be done on the Report Stage.  I think the position should be covered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The wording in the Schedule says that he is to be remunerated &ldquo;at the rate of&rdquo;.  Is his salary to be £2,000 a year or £2,500, and is he to be paid that if he does eight hours a day on so many days a week or, if the Minister does not employ him for so many days, is the usual Civil Service regulation to apply that he is not to get paid for the days that he does not work?  This matter is important from the point of view of the members of the authority, to be certain as to whether they are to get £2,000 or £2,500 a year and be employed whole-time and that the Minister will <Col N="830" /> not have the right to say: &ldquo;You are to report only on four days a week and lose two days' pay.&rdquo;  There is that difficulty that could possibly arise. Then the question arises as to what is work.  Does work mean physical effort, or are the members of the Industrial Authority not entitled to sit down and think?  At least a good thinker may be doing very valuable work.  I think that, at the present stage, there ought to be no doubt that the members of this authority will be whole-time, and that they should be given no excuse for not producing the goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I personally approve of the amendment.  I think it is the one service which Deputy Lemass has rendered to the members of the Industrial Development Authority despite his virulent antagonism to them, and despite the fact that he has served notice on them on several occasions that he is going to sack the lot as soon as he is returned to power.  I think it safeguards their conditions of employment. The case made by the Parliamentary Secretary does not satisfy me at all.  He says that the Minister may vary the work of these members of the authority, and that he should be left free to find some method for a variation of their work from time to time.  I think that is not correct because, according to the terms of the Bill, the Minister has no such power. Once the Minister employs them, he employs them as members of the Industrial Development Authority.  He can vary their work in so far as he can give them different tasks to perform, but as the Parliamentary Secretary says, once he gives them some work other than that of the Industrial Development Authority, they are no longer amenable to him as members of that authority and so will have to come under the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1924 to 1926, and all the other regulations that concern civil servants.</P>

As far as they are anxious about their own positions, I think it would be better if the Minister had no power to vary their work from full-time to part-time, and that the House would be better pleased if, as Deputy Con Lehane has said, they were tied down to being full-time members.</P>

      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary be a little bit more frank with the House?  I am not saying that in any offensive way; but, in answer to the case made for the amendment, the Parliamentary Secretary put forward the position of the chairman, and the fact that the amendment, as drafted, would preclude the chairman from acting in his capacity as a director of the Industrial Credit Corporation.  I agree that is so.  I also agree that it is desirable probably that there should be that duality of functions.  He then went further and sought to suggest that there should be freedom for the Minister to vary the work of the members.</P>

If that is the case, it shows to me a complete misconception of the job which these people have to carry out.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider his position and give the House an undertaking that, on the Report Stage, he will bring in an amendment which will cover the position.  If there is something else in the mind of the Parliamentary Secretary which is his answer to the case made by Deputy Lemass, I would ask him to be frank with the House, and let the House know.  Up to date he has not told the House, except to express the vague desire that the Minister should have as much freedom as possible.  Quite frankly, I do not think that is desirable.  I agree that the amendment, as drafted, is not in all the circumstances an acceptable one.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should give an assurance to the House that he will bring in an amendment to cover the position.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the position that might arise if the next amendment&mdash;No. 18&mdash;in the name of the Parliamentary Secretary were carried.  The obvious object of that amendment is to alter what is in the Bill already.  The members of this authority would require time to get elected to the Oireachtas.

      <P>I want to point out to Deputy Lehane and Deputy Connolly that the amendment proposed by Deputy Lemass does not deal at all with the case which they were making.  Deputy Lemass's amendment does not affect the possibility of having people there on a part-time basis.  What Deputy Lemass's amendment suggests is that, instead of the Minister having power during the period of appointment of a member of the authority of varying the hours of work, if you like, the Minister should be compelled to define the period and the hours of work when the member is being appointed.  It does not deal with the question as to whether you must fix at the start the matter of a whole-time appointment or a part-time appointment.  The amendment will still leave it open for members of the authority to be appointed on a part-time basis with this qualification, that it would have to be made clear at the time the appointment was made that it was to be on a part-time basis rather than on a whole-time basis.  I want to point that out because I think a certain amount of confusion seems to have arisen in the minds of Deputies who spoke because they appeared to consider that the question involved in this amendment is part-time work as against whole-time work.</P>

      <P>As an addendum to Deputy O'Higgins's explanation of my amendment, might I point out that the remuneration of these members is fixed at a stated amount which presupposes whole-time service.  Even though the Minister, under the sub-section as it stands, can vary the conditions of service and hours of work, as Deputy O'Higgins says, it cannot alter the remuneration.  Now, I want to provide that where you appoint named individuals on the basis of whole-time salaries, the obligation of whole-time work will be specified in their appointments. If the Minister had power to vary the remuneration with the conditions of service, I would not have proposed the amendment.</P>

      <P>Remember we may be legislating for present conditions but the piece of legislation that is being enacted now may be in full force and effect after ten or twenty years in different circumstances.  We should have sufficient commonsense, in my opinion, to allow a certain amount of discretion and not to allow ourselves to adopt the defeatist attitude that the situation which we want to remedy will never be remedied.  If we were to accept the suggestion implicit in Deputy Cowan's remark it would mean that we would have to accept the belief that the present circumstances will always be in existence.  I want to point out that sub-section (7) of Section 4 provides that &ldquo;a member shall devote to his duties the whole of his time.&rdquo;  That is the first part of it. Then the discretion comes in&mdash;&ldquo;or so much of his time as the Minister may from time to time direct.&rdquo;  If the Minister does not direct any variation, then it must be a whole-time appointment. The responsibility is on the <Col N="835" /> Minister when he is making the appointment.  If the Minister does nothing when he is making the appointment, then it is a whole-time appointment.  If Deputy Lemass's amendment were accepted, the position would be that if the Minister made an appointment and said nothing more, then it would be a whole-time appointment, but it is still open to the Minister at the time he is making the appointment to vary the conditions as to whether it is to be a whole-time appointment or not.</P>

      <P>The difficulty is that the Bill, as it stands, states that the Minister may vary the time of a member as he thinks fit.  The idea of the amendment is to guard against that and it makes the definite point that the member is a full-time member or, if he is not, that the variation in his time is stated at the time of his appointment.</P>

      <P>Here is what the Parliamentary Secretary did not follow, that this is an autonomous body who, the Parliamentary Secretary assured us, could proceed as they wished, define their own procedure and carry on generally as an autonomous body.  How can the Minister vary the time of a member of an autonomous body?  He may try to vary it by taking a man out of that autonomous body.  He is then no longer a member of it and this section no longer applies.  He becomes a mere civil servant.  If the Minister wishes to keep him there as a civil servant, for the sake of the common good or whatever the phrase is, then he will come under Civil Service regulations. <Col N="836" /> That is the only way in which his work can be varied.  It would appear to me, therefore, that the amendment does safeguard the position and makes it obligatory on the Minister to see that these members are fully employed for the purpose for which they were selected.  These members are named in the Bill, as has been pointed out again and again.  Their work is known.</P>

If the Minister sees fit to appoint certain members with certain qualifications to this position, it is incumbent upon him to see that they are fully employed.  It is incumbent on us as members of the Dáil to see that these members give a full return for the money which they receive.  Any amendment put forward by the Opposition which would ensure that they are fully employed and which safeguards against their being gainfully employed in any other capacity, will receive my endorsement and support and the endorsement and support of many other members of the Government Parties.  I do think that the Parliamentary Secretary should take this amendment under serious consideration.

    <P>
      <Col N="837" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be read a Second Time.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputy Dunne.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last debate on this Bill I referred to the fact that it was not impossible to anticipate some of the arguments that might be brought forward against it, and in fact within the past week or two Deputies have taken the opportunity to express their opposition to the idea of a farm labourer getting a half-day in the week. The criticisms of the Bill are so puny as to be hardly worthy of answer, but it is as well, I think, to refer to them just the same.</P>
      <P>In the first instance, it has been said that this Bill is undesirable&mdash;that it is undesirable that a farm labourer who is paid less than any other worker in the country should get a weekly half-holiday.  I have never met any person in agriculture who expressed that view although it has been expressed by public representatives and I have discussed the matter with workers and farmers in most counties in the country.  I think it is more than desirable that these workers should be given fair treatment and it is a very small thing to ask that out of their long working week of 54 hours they should get four hours holiday on a Saturday.  Everyone knows that farm workers living in rural areas very often removed by long distances from villages, towns and shopping centres are very much inconvenienced at the present time.  In many cases they are put to great hardship by virtue of the fact that many of them are paid only on Saturday night when they finish at tea-time and they must then go to the shopping centre which may be many miles from home in order to meet their weekly accounts and to make what few purchases they can make out of their meagre wages so I think that many Deputies who would be inclined to describe the Bill as undesirable is not doing justice to the agricultural workers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said also that the Bill is unnecessary.  I wonder who thinks it <Col N="838" /> unnecessary.  The man who works for the farmer does not think it unnecessary. Many farmers have spoken to me and I have yet to meet one who thinks it undesirable or unnecessary. They may have stated their belief that it could be impracticable but the greatest objection I have come up against is that farmers do not want to see the half-holiday made operative by piecemeal methods.  If it were made a national requirement, if they were required by law to meet the minimum of a weekly half-holiday for their workers they would do that so long as they were satisfied that every farmer in the country was doing it.</P>
    <P>As I stated on the last occasion, in my own area, County Dublin, we have been operating this half-day for agricultural labourers since 1944, that is six years, and you will not find any farmer to say what has been said in this House that the proposals inherent in this Bill will bring about disaster for Irish agriculture.  To my mind that represents the worst element of reaction as far as progressive thinking is concerned.</P>
    <P>Surely we have come to the time when we can deal with the men who work on the land on some sort of fair basis.  If it is possible for a working farmer living in Meath, Dublin or Wicklow to give a half-holiday to agricultural labourers it should be no hardship in other countries.  There are many farmers who employ no labour on the land and they will not be affected by the Bill, but the farmers who do employ labour will have no objection to the Bill if it becomes law, and I sincerely hope that members of the agricultural industry in this House, no matter what Party they belong to, who at election time appeal to the farm labourers as well as to the farmers for votes, will not forget their responsibility to the labourers who gave them their votes and that they will bring this measure of justice to them.  They are the last section of workers who have not a half-holiday. Not alone are they the last section who have not benefited, but there are more agricultural labourers working for wages in Ireland than there are workers in any other occupation or industry.  They are the most important <Col N="839" /> form of wage labour in the country, and on that score this House should give very serious consideration to the Bill.</P>
    <P>This vote, I understand, will be a free vote of the House, and I think that is an advantage because very often in times gone by, when issues of this kind were discussed and the Party whip was cracked, the true opinion of the House may not have been expressed.  I am putting this measure before the House for the consideration of all Parties purely on its merits, and I am convinced that it is a minimum which no decent-thinking Irishman would refuse to the agricultural labourers.  It should be remembered, too, that the representatives of the farmers who come to this House and make efforts to improve the position of the farmers declaim very eloquently at times upon the responsibility that this State has to the agricultural community.  This being an agricultural country, nobody will deny that our primary consideration as a Parliament must now and always be for the agricultural community and I think that successive Governments have given consideration to that very large section of our population.  If that responsibility exists where the farmer and the State are concerned, I think it exists, too, where the farmer and his employee are concerned.</P>
    <P>There has been an endless amount of ill-informed discussion with regard to the relationship between the farm worker and the farmer.  There has been a good deal of discussion of a very useless nature and some people have tried to create the impression that the advent of organisation and trade unionism amongst agricultural workers represents the interference of the city mind into rural life.  That is only one of the arguments used, in my view, to keep agricultural workers in their present lowly condition.  Since the advent of trade unionism amongst agricultural workers, far from its having a detrimental effect from the point of view of either the worker or the farmer, it has been found in practice to have a most beneficial effect.  Any employer in any <Col N="840" /> industry who has any intelligence at all must realise that a worker who is not fairly treated will not be a satisfactory worker.  Nowadays, the accent is on increased production and particularly increased agricultural production.  It is something we all want to see.  How are we to get any kind of satisfactory conditions in which to bring about that increased production if these men are to be left in their present position?</P>
    <P>This is only one of the measures which, I believe, should be taken to elevate the farm labourer to a more satisfactory plane.  I see no reason in the world&mdash;in fact, I am convinced that it is a great injustice that it should be so&mdash;why unskilled labourers in our towns and cities should work ten and 12 hours a week less than the agricultural labourer and should get twice the wages the agricultural labourer gets, without having one-third of the skill and knowledge the agricultural labourer must have to discharge his job effectively. There are trades which can be learned in a year, in three years, in five years or in seven years, but the agricultural labourer is still learning up to the time he goes down into the grave. He is learning all his life and the wealth of knowledge of his job which he must have is ill-rewarded in this country at present.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will be very fully discussed, and I put it forward for the consideration of the House, as I said before, primarily on the plea of justice for men who are at present not being justly treated.  Whatever argument may be brought against it, no Deputy, I am sure, will try to prove that it is something which should not be given, and I hope that Deputies of all Parties will agree with me that the time is long overdue when this very small concession, which will mean nothing, or very little, in terms of cash or financial imposition upon the farmers but which will mean a great deal to agricultural workers&mdash;they can finish their work at lunch time on Saturday and devote their afternoon, as does every other civilised person in the world of the working-class type, to the performance of the ordinary household duties which require to be done or the obtaining of domestic requirements&mdash;should be given <Col N="841" /> in ordinary common justice to men who have very little protection other than the protection which can be given to them by law as passed by this Parliament.</P>

      <P>I feel that it is unnecessary to state at the outset that I, as a small farmer, have the deepest sympathy with the agricultural workers.  I have lived amongst them all my life.  I have trotted with the children of the worker bare-footed to school as a small boy.  I have worked side by side with them in the fields during the greater part of my life.  I know that the agricultural worker endures a low standard of living and a low standard of income.  My opposition to the Bill is based on the fact that we have to be realistic.  We have to realise that this Bill extends still further the principle of compulsion to the agricultural community.  The Minister for Agriculture has stated on a number of occasions that he would never again allow an inspector to cross a farmer's fence, unless invited to do so by the farmer.  Under this Bill, inspectors will continue to cross the farmer's fence and dictate to him and the worker what particular hours of work they are to operate.  That is the principle which is unnecessary and undesirable in agriculture, having regard to the wide variety of conditions under which farmers and farm workers live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, if enacted, will provide that each farmer will have to make a minimum sacrifice of at least £13 per year, or 5/- per week.  Spread over all the employees in the agricultural industry, that would amount to over £1,400,000, or roughly £1,500,000. That is the sum of money this Bill will cost the agricultural industry, and, while it will cost the individual farmer a minimum of £13 and the agricultural industry approximately £1,500,000, it will not put one red halfpenny into the pocket of the agricultural worker.  That is the first fact that has to be considered.  The agricultural worker's income is admittedly low, but this Bill will not raise his income.  It may give him a little more leisure in which to expend, as Deputy Dunne pointed out, the small income he enjoys at present.  It will add nothing to his existing income and I think that, fundamentally, we should be aiming at doing something to raise the agricultural worker's income rather than tackling this question of reducing the working hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne, I think, did not get down to a very serious consideration of this Bill.  Both last week and to-day his speech reminded me of the empty billowing and flapping of a nightshirt on a clothes' line.  There was very little weight or substance in the arguments he advanced; very little weight or substance in his comparison between the agricultural worker and other types of employees.  If you apply the argument that the farm worker is as much entitled to a reduced working week as the industrial worker, why not go a step further and say that both farm workers and industrial workers should be given Civil Service hours, a still further reduction?  If the 54-hour week is too long for the agricultural worker, is not the 50-hour or 48-hour week too <Col N="843" /> long for the industrial worker?  Why not give them the 40-hour week, the same as many of our office workers? We could push this argument along that line and it would carry us nowhere.</P>
    <P>Fundamentally, the fact is that the whole volume of agricultural output is altogether too low.  The output per man-hour is too low.  It must be raised, and until we raise the output per man-hour we cannot tackle this problem of reducing the length of the man-week.  In industry, we know that the reduction of the working week followed but did not anticipate the increase in the volume of output per man-hour.  In industry, the volume of output per man was stepped up rapidly to an extraordinary extent by the introduction of machinery.  We have been and are introducing improved machinery into the agricultural industry. But our progress towards increased production will be slow and difficult.  We may move forward slowly and steadily, but it will take a long time before the increase in the volume of output in agriculture will be anything to compare with the increase in industry.  Any Deputy who has any connection with farming knows that in agriculture you are not dealing with an inanimate thing as in industry.  You are dealing with living animals and growing plants.  You cannot completely mechanise all agricultural processes.  No machine will lay an egg or give birth to a calf.  The farming industry has to keep to a certain extent closer to nature than industry can.  Therefore, this comparison between agriculture and industry is unreal.</P>
    <P>We have only got to realise that notwithstanding all the efforts made for the past three or four years, the volume of agricultural output is only 2 per cent. higher than in 1938 and until we can force the volume of agricultural output up we have to be careful about restricting the hours of work. We are going with outstretched hands to the great republic of the west seeking and obtaining loans which are being given to us on the understanding that we will increase agricultural output. <Col N="844" /> Does anyone think this measure is calculated to achieve that object? If it were possible for every farmer, the small farmer who employs one man just the same as the farmer who employs ten, to comply with this, he would have to employ additional labour on his farm and thereby carry additional cost.  From what source is that additional cost to be obtained?</P>
    <P>There are two ways in which the farmer can comply with this Bill.  He can either employ additional labour or reduce output by reducing the working on his farm.  He must either increase his cost or reduce his output.  If he increases his cost, from what source is he to obtain the income to cover that increased cost?  Can he pass this burden on to the consumer?  If he does, we know the outcry we will have about the increased cost of living.  We know that, in present circumstances, it is extremely difficult to pay an increased price for agricultural output. It is questionable whether, in our present economic set-up, it is desirable to have any very substantial increase in the price of foodstuffs which would be necessary to finance this Bill.  We know what would happen if the cost of living went up still higher.  Immediately we would have a demand for higher wages and, again, we would have the vicious spiral of wages and prices chasing each other upwards towards a complete collapse.  Everyone will agree that that is not a desirable situation.  On the other hand, is there not a danger that this Bill may lead to a slackening down of production by farmers relying, not on dairy cows and the raising of young stock but on dry stock?  That is another undesirable result which may very possibly flow from this Bill.  All the time, we must realise that our whole economic existence depends on our ability to secure an increase in agricultural output.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned in my amendment that it is necessary to achieve some increase in agricultural income before this Bill can be made operative and compulsory on the country.  Do Deputies realise that the present income of each person engaged on the land, the farmer and his adult sons and daughters working with him on the farm, is less than £3 10s. 0d. per <Col N="845" /> week?  That is the average income. There is no escaping the figure.  We know the total number of people working on the land and the net value of agricultural output.  Therefore, we know how much money there is to be distributed amongst the farming community. We know that they are not in a position to bear an increased burden unless they can pass it on to the consumer, with the very uncomfortable results for other sections of the community which must inevitably follow. Therefore, I say that this Bill ought not to be enacted and that we ought to set our minds very definitely and rigorously towards raising the standard and status of the agricultural worker by other means.  When I mentioned publicly that there are other concessions which could be given to the agricultural worker, Deputy Dunne challenged me to name these concessions. I immediately pointed out that one of the first and most important concessions which ought to be made to the lowly-paid workers in this country, having regard to the high cost of living, is an increase in the children's allowance.  An increase of 1/- per week would not be very much, but it would be of immense benefit to the struggling agricultural worker with a family.  The inclusion of all children under 16 years would also be a tremendous benefit to the agricultural worker.  In that way it would be possible to benefit the agricultural worker, particularly the worker with a family, very considerably, without adding to the costs of production in agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is one very important &ldquo;must&rdquo; in agricultural policy and in economic policy, and that is that we must get down the cost of producing food as well as we can.  That is why I say that, instead of adding to the farmer's costs, as in this Bill, without benefiting the worker, we should give the worker a definite benefit such as would be implied in children's allowances. That, in my opinion, is the first and most important step towards putting the agricultural worker on a better footing in society.</P>
    <P>I realise that the time allowed for the consideration of this Bill is very <Col N="846" /> limited and I do not want to delay the House unduly, but, in addition to providing increased children's allowances there are other ways in which a substantial benefit could be conferred on the agricultural worker.  There are farmers in this country who give their workers such benefits as free milk or milk at a very low price.  All farmers should try to do that service for the men who are working for them on the land.  In the same way, there are farmers who could supply firewood or turf to their workers at a low price. Further, farmers, owning as they do, tractors and horses, could help their workers to cultivate their plots and, where necessary, provide additional allotments on their land for the growing of vegetables.</P>
    <P>I put forward these suggestions because I consider that there is a need for the continuance of that close cooperation and mutual help between the farmer and the worker which has always existed amongst the best agricultural employers and workers.  I do not consider that it is a matter of charity on the part of the farmer to help his workers in the ways I have suggested.  It is a matter of justice.  I hold very strongly to the principle of justice for all sections of the community. Since the farmer has essentials which the labourer, if he does not get them from the farmer, has to purchase at the retail price, he should, as a good employer, give his worker the benefit of these essentials.  He should help them in the cultivation of their land by loaning horses or, if necessary, tractors. He should let them have turbary or turf or firewood at a cheap rate. Another thing which the good farmer almost invariably does and which every farmer should do is to give every worker a full week's work in spite of weather conditions.  Every farmer should endeavour to find indoor work for his men during wet weather, so that the worker will have a full week's wages every week unless he desires to remain at home.  Every worker who presents himself for work at the farmer's place, irrespective of weather conditions, should be given a full week's employment.</P>
    <P>These are concessions which the <Col N="847" /> farmer should make to the worker and they would not cost him anything except, possibly, a little inconvenience now and then.  They would ensure a larger measure of goodwill between the farmer and the worker.  They would raise the worker's real income by lowering his costs.  Instead of having to go to the shop and buying some commodities at the retail price, the worker would be able to buy at a lower price.  Instead of buying coal at a high price, he would have cheap fuel supplied to him by the farmer, and instead of having to hire horses or to dig his plot with a spade, he would have the use of the farmer's horses.  The farmer should make these concessions to the worker in the interest of the industry.  I think it is wrong that a man should be told that he must work only a certain number of hours per week.  Deputy Dunne has said that every civilised person in the world enjoys a half-holiday.  He must be under the impression that the farmers and the farmers' wives and sons are not civilised because they have never enjoyed a regular weekly half-holiday.</P>
    <P>The House ought to put the most important things first.  If we are to help the agricultural worker, we ought to help him in such a way as to raise his real standard of living without reducing the hours of work or the output of the agricultural industry.  Later on, when science, invention, the progress of mechanisation and increased knowledge in agricultural science will have succeeded in raising the volume of agricultural output&mdash;when we have surmounted the serious national problem that faces us in regard to the balance of external payments, we can consider agricultural working hours.  I think that that time has not yet arrived.  Therefore, I suggest that we wait until the volume of agricultural output has substantially increased and until there is sufficient income available to the farming community to enable them to make this concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware that I could not reserve my speech.  I wanted to see the drift of the debate and to hear the points that would be raised so that I might say something on them.  However, I must conform with the procedure and must do the best I can.</P>
      <P>While supporting the amendment, I do not want to be taken as being in any way hostile to the proposal to give a half-holiday to agricultural workers. I have never advocated low conditions for the agricultural worker.  I hope I never will.  There were some points made by Deputy Dunne in introducing the Bill with which I entirely agree. He said it was not just that the agricultural worker should be singled out and should not get the same conditions as the industrial worker.  I am in entire agreement.  He also said that he could not understand how an agricultural labourer could exist on an income of £3 a week and provide for a family.  With that also I am in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only point of consideration with me in connection with any of these issues is: is there any proof that the agricultural industry gives the average working farmer an income of £3 a week?  The average income of all those engaged in working farms is only £3 10s. a week.  The income of some must be very much in excess of £3 10s. a week.  That applies, for instance, to <Col N="849" /> those who engage in bloodstock breeding and the production of pedigree live stock.  That is a very highly specialised industry, involving a considerable amount of overhead expenses and speculative expenses.  If such persons had to live on the average income they would be out of business at a very early stage.  Therefore, it must be admitted that the average working farmer producing goods which are included in the cost-of-living index must be in receipt of a very much lower income than the guaranteed minimum weekly wage of £3 of his labourer. Therefore, I hold that there is an attempt still more to crush the working farmer and his family by imposing further obligations on anyone compelled to employ a labourer.</P>
    <P>The mentality of those outside the agricultural industry appears to be that results obtained, no matter by what means, are justified.  So long as agricultural produce comes on the market and sufficient food is provided to maintain those in the cities and towns, who have very much better conditions of living than the agricultural labourer or even his employer&mdash;shorter hours, annual holidays, half-holidays, insurance benefits and social benefits&mdash; it is taken as a matter of course that the price for such goods is sufficient to cover the cost of production.  I hold that that is not the case.  The bulk of agricultural production is the result of unpaid family labour.  The farmer employs his children from the time they are six or seven years of age to do some work on the farm.  Therefore, the fact that agricultural goods come on the market is no proof that the price obtained for it covered the cost of production at the minimum rate of wage guaranteed by the Agricultural Wages Act.  Those farmers who have not family labour and are compelled to employ labour are being crushed between the upper and nether millstone. They are compelled to give a fixed minimum wage even if they employ one workman.  They are compelled to give him an annual holiday, to pay national health insurance contributions and employer's liability insurance. The present proposal, as Deputy Cogan pointed out, would add another £13 a year to the cost of the worker.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> What guarantee has the farmer when he is selling his produce?  The price for the vast bulk of it is governed by the export market price. If that price is low, he must sell on the home market regardless of the cost of production.  For instance, the proposal for the coming year is that the farmer must sell his eggs at 2/- a dozen, for the simple reason that the British Minister of Food will not give any higher price than that.  Is there any prospect then that on the home market the farmer will get the 3/- a dozen that he enjoyed in 1948?  As I say, the farmer is crushed between the upper and nether millstone.  His costs of production are increased.  His prices are not even maintained, much less increased in accordance with the increased charges on his industry.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about justice but I claim that in this connection there is scope for the application of justice all round. To what extent is it being done?</P>
    <P>It is only natural that this proposal to ameliorate the conditions of the agricultural workers should come from a Labour Deputy, a Deputy who has interested himself in the organisation of agricultural workers.  On the other hand, what evidence have we&mdash;at least in my experience in this House&mdash;that Labour Deputies in general are prepared to back any proposal for increased prices for agricultural produce so as to enable the employing farmer to get the cost of production&mdash;in other words, to give the producing farmer the minimum wage that the law compels him to pay to labourers?</P>
    <P>Let me take one instance, milk prices.  There was a motion introduced by Deputy Cogan and myself last Spring to increase the price paid to the farmer for his milk at creameries on account of the increased cost of production over the past couple of years by reason of the increase of 10/- a week in wages, increased rates on the land, increased national health insurance and increased employers' liability insurance, as a result of increased benefits granted by an Act passed in this House in 1948 whereby an agricultural worker, if he met with an accident, was entitled to higher <Col N="851" /> benefits than he had been receiving hitherto.  To meet all those increases we moved a motion to increase the price the farmer would get for his milk.  The Labour Deputies almost without exception walked into the Division Lobby to vote against that motion.  Those who did not vote against it certainly did not vote for it. They had an opportunity there to mete out justice, but that opportunity was evaded by the Labour Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Can anyone dispute my assertion that the average working farmer has not the income to enable him to pay the wage he is compelled by law to give the labourer?  We put another motion before the House during the Spring and the proposal there was an experimental farm for the purpose of accurately ascertaining the cost of production, the amount that the agricultural producer&mdash;the working farmer&mdash;would have to get to produce any commodity on his land.  In this case also the Labour Deputies voted against it.  In face of that, how can farmer Deputies stand idly by and allow increased burdens to be put on the agricultural producer without insisting on a corresponding increase in the price he gets for his produce in order to enable him to live?</P>
      <P>I have yet to meet a farmer who will object to improving the conditions of his labourer provided he can afford to do it, but the evidence is not there that it is possible for him to do it, and until that is done I think Deputies should vote against the Second Reading of this Bill.  Until the time comes, whether by increased output per man hour or reduced costs or higher prices for our produce&mdash;any one of these three methods&mdash;I think a proposal of this kind is more or less heading for disaster; it is putting the last straw on the camel's back, if you like, to continue to put burdens on the agricultural producer without providing means for him to meet those increased charges.  I wish to second the amendment proposed by Deputy Cogan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Bill.  I feel that an excellent case has been made by Deputy Dunne.  I was interested listening to Deputy Cogan speaking against it and I was anxious to hear what points he would put up. I am afraid, although he gave us a long contribution, he did not give us anything very positive as to why the half-holiday should not be given.  He claimed that production would suffer and I hope to deal with that matter in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think any fair-minded Deputy will agree that the agricultural worker, whether a farmer or a farm labourer, is a key-worker.  It is the main industry in this country.  It is the essence of production when you apply manpower to raw materials and produce something, such as agricultural commodities. We produce from the earth and we give something to humanity. During the emergency and at other times when it suited, the agricultural worker was described as the front line of defence, as the skilled man, the man worthy of support.  We feel these things are true and we feel that he is <Col N="853" /> as much entitled to a half-day as his industrial colleagues.</P>
    <P>I have anticipated a number of points that I thought would be made against the Bill.  One of them is that the farmer could not afford to pay the extra few shillings.  If it is said that five shillings a week per agricultural worker will bring any farmer to disaster, it has been proved beyond yea or nay in County Dublin and County Westmeath, where the agricultural workers are organised and where they have secured a half-holiday, that there was no disaster brought on the farmers there.  We will equally find, if this Bill is passed, that the farmers will continue to prosper, as they are at present.  I trust that that prosperity will continue.</P>
    <P>The half-holiday for agricultural workers was introduced in County Waterford in 1922, and was continued for a number of years.  Some 12 months ago when the Agricultural Wages Board gave an increase it was understood throughout the country that it was for a 50-hour week.  Practically every farmer in my county and adjacent counties gave a half-holiday in the belief that it was then the law. It was not until they found out some months later that that was not the case that they decided they could not possibly do it.  If this Bill is passed, I feel that it can easily be carried out.</P>
    <P>As regards loss of production, Deputy Cogan made his point, but I would draw his attention and the attention of other Deputies to this fact, that contented workers are the men who produce most.  To my knowledge as a trade union official production is in direct ratio to the contented state of mind of the worker.  If you have a discontented worker you will not have satisfactory production.  If these workers get a half-day, if they feel they are on the same status as other human beings, they will give of their best, and the farmer who will concede the half-day to his worker will find that during the week, whether it is a 48-hour or a 50-hour week, he will get back more than he has given.  That is a thing that the industrialists of this and many other countries are beginning to realise and act upon.  Cows have to be <Col N="854" /> milked every day and they must be milked on the half-day as well as on ordinary days.  That is a very common statement, but is it not possible that where there are two or more employees on a farm they could arrange so that there would always be someone left to milk the cows?  Is it not possible, on a farm on which there is only one employee, that the farmer and his man could arrange between them so that the man would get at least one half-day in the week?  Surely on such a farm, with so small a labour content, the number of cows cannot be so big as to make it impossible to have such an arrangement for milking, either by the farmer or his son or someone else?  If there is need for more men, surely they should have been employed.  I believe there is nothing in the objections raised but just a feeling that this is something extra.  If the farmer believed that this Bill is just what it is &mdash;meant in the interest of the farmer and his family, as well as of the worker &mdash;there would be no objections raised to its passage through this House.</P>
    <P>Another point raised is that this is a trade union function, that it should not be brought up in the House at all, that it should be secured by the old-time method of disputes and strikes or by agreement.  But surely, if that is true, it is equally true to say that the question of the wages the farmer should pay his men is a trade union function, and it is also true to say that the annual holiday question is a trade union function?  Is it not also true of almost every section of the community that we have had legislation for conditions and hours and half-days, even though they are covered and well organised into trade unions? I believe that we are laying down minimum rules and that it is the trade union function, not to secure the minimum but to secure the maximum. I suggest that Deputies allow this Bill ta pass its Second Reading and that if there is an amendment worthy of consideration it will be accepted, if it is in the spirit that we wish it to be in.  Then, no longer will the agricultural worker be the Cinderella of industry, but he will be a respectable man with rights the same as every other industrial worker.  By that means <Col N="855" /> we will win back to the land the people who have deserted it and no longer will we hear of the &ldquo;Flight from the Land&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I feel very much as Deputy Dunne feels in regard to the agricultural workers.  I believe they are the greatest national asset we have and that they are underpaid and not getting the facilities to which they are entitled.  However, it seems to me that Deputy Dunne and the Labour Party are talking with their tongues in their cheeks when they are talking about better facilities for agricultural workers, while at the same time they make every endeavour to prevent agricultural producers from getting a decent price for their produce.  I believe that agricultural workers&mdash;farmers, farmers' sons and employees&mdash;are the people who keep this country going.  It is wrong to segregate one section from the other and wrong to ask the employees, the farmers-employer and his sons and daughters to work for a wage which, owing to the present agricultural prices, they cannot afford to pay to their employees.  To get out of the dilemma, there will have to be a remuneration for farmers, their sons and their workers, that will enable everybody engaged in agriculture to have a decent standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said before that I do not believe that agricultural workers have been paid anything like what they should be paid, having regard to their contribution to the national economy. However, that is not the farmer's fault: it is partly the fault of the Deputies of this House, who decided that agricultural produce must obtain the lowest possible rate, while those who produce luxury articles can have any profit they like.  We are asked to produce milk at 1/2 a gallon and there is a suggestion that that is to be reduced by 2d.  Cows must be milked regularly and the milk put into cans and delivered to the creamery or factory.  At the same time, one may dish out lemonade in bottles at 6d. a half pint and there is no inspector going around to see the amount of bacteria in lemonade.  The unfortunate <Col N="856" /> farmer has to be up at six o'clock in the morning to produce the milk at 1/2 a gallon, with the threat that it will be reduced to 1/-.</P>
    <P>The members of the Labour Party are speaking with their tongues in their cheeks and are shedding crocodile tears for the agricultural worker.  They will go into the Lobby and vote against any increase for the producer of that particularly nutritious commodity and they will not have the slightest reaction against the excessive profits made by those producing luxury commodities.  I agree thoroughly with Deputy Dunne that the agricultural worker, whether he be farmer's son, farmer or agricultural worker, is not getting a fair crack of the whip in this agricultural country; but that is due to the horrible urban mentality we have in this House directing everything.  It is not confined to the present Government&mdash;though they are largely responsible for it&mdash;but the previous Government was more responsible for it.  They tried to drag everything from the country up to Dublin.  This Government also has done the same.  They will not let us have an airfield in Cork and they are trying to take our Dairy Institute from Cork to Dublin.  They will not let us do anything in the country.  They will not let us have a shipyard.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Smith had allowed me to proceed he, I think, would have been in complete sympathy with my remarks.

I was about to point out the fact that on a Bill such as this, which will be left to a free vote of the House, the only appeal that could be made would have to be made to the individual conscience of the individual members.  Yet, not one member, except Deputy Lehane, of the Fine Gael Party has seen fit to grace the benches for the presentation of this case.  Now the Minister for Agriculture has deserted his bench; as the American say: &ldquo;He has taken a run-out powder.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I apologise to Deputy <Col N="858" /> Lehane.  I am now informed that there is not even one member of the Fine Gael Party in the House and not one of them has seen fit to grace the benches in order to listen to the presentation of the case for a half-holiday for farm labourers.  I hope that the Minister for Justice, who has most appropriately arrived, will live up to his name as Minister for Justice, real justice to the farm labourer as well as to every other member of the community, and ensure that this case is presented with all the force he has to the other members of his Party.</P>
      <P>To whom are we to appeal?  We have to appeal to the members of Clann na Talmhan, to the sympathy of the members of Clann na Poblachta which, I am sure, we have; and we have to appeal to Fianna Fáil, the members of the Opposition Party.  Let me remind the members of the Opposition and, in particular, let me remind Deputy Smith, that on a certain occasion when there was some cross-talk here with the Deputy-Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lemass assured us on that occasion that in any case where the Labour Party brought forward measures relating to social welfare, of importance to the working classes, and measures for the success of which that Party had to rely upon the goodwill of the House, the members of his Party would be actively in support of any such legislation.  I think he further said that the members of the Labour Party should take courage and not permit themselves to be in any way amenable to intimidation from the major Party in Government.  If that is the case, and I am perfectly certain that Deputy Lemass means what he says and will bear out his words in deeds and acts, I think the case made by Deputy Dunne should recommend itself to him and that he should realise that this is a measure of social justice in relation to the social welfare of a very deserving section of the community. I do not base that on any of the tommy-rot that I have heard about farm labourers requiring this as a measure of social justice because they are the lowest paid section of the community. Irrespective of whether they are the lowest paid or the highest paid, they are still entitled to a half-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="859" /> The arguments put forward by those in favour of the amendment with regard to the average income of the average farmer are completely beside the point.  The average farmer is not employing a farm labourer.  The average farmer is not giving a half-day per week to his farm labourers.  If people look at this from the proper point of view and with a proper understanding of economics, they should appreciate, if they want to enter into the field of economics, the economic effects which the measure will have.  We hope that this measure will be brought to fruition with the help of the progressive members of the Fianna Fáil Party, the progressive members of the Clann na Talmhan, Clann na Poblachta and the Labour Party.  What will be its economic effects?  It will adversely affect those who employ a lot of labour and it will be favourable to those who employ no labour because it will place another burden on the competitors of the small farmers.  We are always hearing about the farmers.  The people who talk about the average farmer and this mythical sum of £3 10s. od. per week or £166 per year fail to realise that there is no such thing as an average farmer.  Farmers come into certain groups according to their poor law rating and their income and the groups have separate and antagonistic interests.  A large farmer has not the same interests as a small farmer, particularly in the western areas.  He is more allied in his tastes, outlook, philosophy, upbringing and the manner in which he educates his children to the industrialist and the capitalist, to those running the big mills, the factories and the workshops, than he is to the small farmer from whom most of us have had our origin.  People talk here about the urban mentality. They say that Dublin controls everything. They accuse us of being all Dublinmen.  There is no such thing as a Dublinman.  If our fathers were not from the country, then our grandfathers were.  We all bear the mark of the peasant.  Even the Minister for Agriculture, who has just returned to the House, would probably thank God for that.  It would be a very difficult task in this small State so to urbanise <Col N="860" /> our mentality that we could forget the claims of the rural community, particularly that section of it which is interested in this Bill.</P>
    <P>A measure like this, which depends upon the goodwill of legislators, is in advance of its time from the point of view of economics.  Let us candidly admit that.  Legislation lags behind actuality.  We are to-night trying to work a miracle and we are asking Fianna Fáil to help us to work that miracle.  We are asking them to come to our aid in our endeavour to pass this Bill.  I am talking now to the progressive members.  I am not talking to the reactionary members in Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have a combination of those who are progressive in this House.  Let Deputy Smith show how progressively-minded he is by lining up with the Labour Party on this. When the Labour Party finds that Deputy Smith has some progressive legislation on foot we will reciprocate that feeling.  That is a fair offer. Deputy Lemass made a fair offer before in regard to social welfare.  He said not to be afraid to bring forward any such measures as they would always command the support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Let us have that co-operation and that understanding of this rural mentality.  We all know that we never can expect the mass of agricultural labourers to have the striking power that industrial labour has, or the force necessary to bring about a much needed amelioration of their conditions. It is for that reason Deputy Dunne and the members of the Labour Party want the other Parties to aid them in this, and so make the path a bit easier for the agricultural labourers as well as to get over the anxiety, doubt and distrust that is in the minds of farmers.  Mind you, that is all there is to it.  If Deputies look back over the history of any scheme of importance that has been put before the sections of the public concerned, they will find that there was the same form of opposition in regard to it as that which emanated from Deputy Cogan <Col N="861" /> and Deputy P. O'Reilly to-night.  These Deputies did not quite predict the bankruptcy of the whole farming community if this proposal were put into effect, but they did remind the House of the old days when the shopkeepers and their assistants worked long hours, when shops remained open to a very late hour on Saturday nights, and when some opened on Sunday.  That sort of general mentality has been portrayed in the novels of H.G. Wells and others.  It is now exhibited by those who purport to represent the interests of the farmers, that the longer the hours worked the greater will be the productivity of the industry concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>They serve an essential need for the community.  We were told a moment ago that agriculture deals not with inanimate things.  You have human beings in shops, farms, factories and workshops.  The argument used to be that it was only by working them long hours, from the days of their infancy almost until they went to their graves, that industry could maintain itself, and could be in any way comfortable for the capitalists engaged in industry.  We now have the same mentality intruding itself into the agricultural field.  Instead of having an urbanisation of our mentality we are having a ruralisation of it.  We all remember when restrictions were introduced against the working of long hours in the coal-mining industry in England, and the furore that was created when an attempt was made to stop the employment of children in that industry under ten years of age.  The opponents of such proposals said that the industry would be made bankrupt if they were not allowed to employ children of tender years.  That has been the attitude all through the ages when any attempt was made to bring about an amelioration of the conditions of the working classes.  The case always made was that it would be impossible to do it, that it would create disorder and in some way would impede progress in the industry concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that argument was not used, the other argument was, that the time was inopportune to bring about the <Col N="862" /> desired reform.  We find the same attitude on this Bill in the amendment that has been proposed, that the implementation of the half-holidays should wait until such time as the rate of agricultural production has increased, and the cost of production has been lowered.  I think it was in a public speech at Carlingford that the Minister for Agriculture made the best presentation of this case that could possibly be made, if the case for it is to be founded on economics, because he showed how the productivity of the country has increased.  I have not the data with me, but the Minister showed from figures he gave how there had been a considerable increase in most spheres of agriculture. That should encourage Deputy Cogan to change his line of policy if he really believes in the economic basis.</P>
    <P>The opposition to this proposal is not, most Deputies believe, on the economic basis at all.  The opponents of it want to get their heels in, to dig them in against any attempt at having social progress in this country.  To continue to argue as to why agricultural labourers should have a couple of hours less work would lead nowhere.  It can be proved that in countries somewhat similar to our own, where they have up-to-date agriculture and the highest and most intensive cultivation of the land, farm labourers are better paid, are better organised and have better hours than they have in this country. The argument for this should be on an ethical and moral basis.  It should be based on a sense of equity.</P>

We are asking Deputies in all parts of the House to take courage from the fact which Deputy Dunne has mentioned that, for the last four years in the County Dublin, they have been operating this idea of a half holiday for farm <Col N="863" /> workers, and not to the detriment of the industry or of the farmers.  During those four years the farm labourers in County Dublin have enjoyed that little measure of social progress.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order Paper to-day I had the following question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state what compensation, if any, he proposes paying to Mrs. O'Neill, Hurler's Cross, Clonmoney, County Clare, for the loss of her business and furniture and depreciation of her house in consequence of his Department notifying her that the house was being taken over for departmental purposes and ordering her to secure alternative accommodation.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, replying to that question, stated that no acquisition Order was made in respect of the premises occupied by Mrs. O'Neill, and accordingly no compensation falls to be paid.  I should like briefly to outline the facts of the case, and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take a more humane view of the case than he has so far shown.  The facts are that Mrs. O'Neill, a widow of a former member of the Garda Síochána, with her child, carried on a small business at a place called Hurler's Cross, Clonmoney, Co. Clare.  In 1945 she was approached by an officer authorised by the Parliamentary Secretary's Department and informed that her house and plot were acquired for State purposes.  A month later the same officer called on Mrs. O'Neill and told her that she would have to make arrangements to vacate her premises and to secure alternative accommodation within a period of three months.  She accordingly closed her shop, discontinued her business, and sold her furniture.  In consequence she did not carry on the usual repairs, including the thatching of her house, with the result that the condition of the dwelling-house has very much <Col N="864" /> deteriorated since.  She was never informed subsequently that her house and premises were not being acquired. She was not informed of any change of policy on the part of the Department. Most of her neighbours who were similarly circumstanced have been paid compensation, but this unfortunate woman alone has been excluded.  In reply to a recent letter written to the Department, the Minister stated that they did not require the house, and that, if she was so informed, it was a mistake.</P>
    <P>This woman has a very strong moral claim for fair compensation by the State if she has not a legal claim.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to take his stand on a legal technicality but to face up to the facts of the case and see to it that this poor widow will not be made the victim of State action.  She certainly is entitled to some compensation because of the State action.  I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will do his best to see that justice is done to this poor woman.  The amount involved is a small mite so far as the State is concerned but to her it means all.  Ways and means could be found to meet her claim if the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government took a humane view of the case.  They could provide the wherewithal very easily.  It would not be a terrible burden to impose on the State and it would mean all the difference to this poor woman and would perhaps save her from penury in the end of her days.  She has been forced out of business by State action and she finds herself now in the unfortunate position that she is refused compensation because of a legal technicality. She was informed, as I say, that her house and premises were required for State purposes and she was not informed, until her business was lost, that they would not be acquired. I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take a humane view of this case.  She surely has a moral claim for compensation.  That being so, I think the Parliamentary Secretary should have at least a little bit of humanity and view this case as an ordinary fair-minded man would.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in support of the case put <Col N="865" /> forward by Deputy O'Grady.  Whatever legal action may have been taken, there is no doubt whatever that a decision was made by me, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to acquire this property in County Clare in 1945 for the construction of dwelling-houses for workers employed at the airport. The workers employed by the Department and by air companies using the airport were complaining about their inability to get housing accommodation in Limerick and the high price of the housing accommodation available there. It was, therefore, considered desirable to construct a village adjacent to the airport to house these workers.  The area to be acquired was selected, plans were made for the works to be carried out and everything was brought to the point at which only the formal act of acquiring the land had to be completed and the works commenced.  At that stage the workers concerned, employees of the Department and of the air companies at the airport, intimated certain objections to the proposal.  They disliked the idea of living in this isolated village where they would, in their hours off, meet only the same people with whom they were associated at work and they urged that, if accommodation was to be provided for them, it should be at Limerick.  The representations they made were so strong that the scheme to build the village was abandoned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, however, had happened prior to that?  The officers of the Department charged with the responsibility of carrying through the decision of the Minister visited the land to be acquired.  The most of it was just agricultural land, but on the site there was also this shop.  They informed the woman who owned the shop that it was going to be acquired by the State, as the site was needed for State purposes and that she would be well advised to get out of it and find accommodation elsewhere before it was taken from her.  She did so.  She left the premises, and in the belief that the premises were going to be taken over by the State, she allowed them to go derelict.  Now it has been announced that the land that was acquired is to be given back and that compensation is being paid where <Col N="866" /> there was disturbance, but in this particular case, because there was no formal act of acquisition, it is said that compensation is not payable.  The only defence to this claim is a purely technical one, namely, that the formal step of acquisition was not taken.  She left the premises, however, because she was told by an officer of the Department that they were being acquired.  She left her house in the belief that it was going to be demolished and took no steps to keep it in repair.  It is now completely out of repair, I understand, incapable of being inhabited, but she is informed that it is hers again and that she will not be disturbed.  It seems clear to me, apart from any legal claims she may have, that the Government should make some <i>ex gratia</i> payment of compensation for the disturbance which followed the official decision to acquire the property.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I agree with Deputies that it is very unfortunate that a decision of this sort operated in the way it has operated, and I sympathise with the person who finds herself in such circumstances. It is easy to see how it creates a very difficult problem for the individual and, as Deputy O'Grady remarks, it is a comparatively small amount from the point of view of the State, but a comparatively big matter for the individual concerned.  I think, however, that in this case it is necessary to get the facts about it right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cottage was included in the lands originally proposed to be acquired in connection with the establishment of a village settlement at Firgrove, and an officer from the Department interviewed the owners and occupiers on the land in May, 1945.  In June, 1945, it was decided at a meeting in the Department of Industry and Commerce that the cottage should be excluded from the acquisition.  In August, 1945, a vesting Order was made under an Emergency Powers Order which operated to vest the lands in the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with the village settlement.  The cottage was not included in that Order. Each tenant was furnished with a copy <Col N="867" /> of the vesting Order and map and the owner of the cottage, who was not actually the tenant&mdash;the owner was a Mr. Brennan&mdash;received a copy in connection with the acquisition of a forge, but the cottage was not included as it was not being acquired.  Following the service of the Order the Department of Industry and Commerce valuer and an inspector from the Land Commission interviewed the owners and occupiers concerned on the question of compensation.  On that occasion neither Mr. Brennan the owner nor Mrs. O'Neill, the tenant, was interviewed. Subsequently it transpired that the land registry had misread the acquisition map and had transferred the cottage to the Minister.  That mistake was rectified three years after in 1948 when it was discovered, and it appears to have no bearing on the case because the records show that no one examined the records or inspected them.  It was not until September, 1948, three years afterwards, that any claim was made, and subsequently representations were received in the Department.  Deputy O'Grady and Deputy Hogan, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, both made representations.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether in the light of those circumstances Deputies feel that there is the same justification for compensation as would appear at first sight because although the person concerned was interviewed in May the matter was set right within a month and as far as I know there is no evidence that the person sold within the month or left the place.  The Order was made and this cottage was excluded. The vesting Order was published in August.</P>

      <P>That does not transpire because my information is that she was not interviewed a month later and the decision was taken in June not to take the cottage.  The Order was published in August and the cottage was not included.  It is a question of time.  If the woman sold within the month I believe that there is a good case but not if it was after the Order was published and the second interview with the other owners in the locality because it is obvious that the news would get around that inspectors were interviewing people in the area it was proposed to acquire.  The whole case turns on whether Mrs. O'Neill sold her right in the premises&mdash;she was only a tenant&mdash;within the month and I do not think that there is any evidence to show that she did.  The significant feature of the case is that there was no application for compensation for three years.  The Order was made in August and as far as everybody else was concerned the matter ended in August.  I think it would be a strange interpretation of humanity to press the claim of Mrs. O'Neill.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Grady's information is that it was on the second occasion she was visited and told to get out as the cottage would be acquired. Although it was decided not to acquire the cottage it was in fact acquired due to an error in the Land Registry.  Is it not conceivable that the official who went down on behalf of the Minister for Lands made the same mistake, and told the woman that her cottage would be acquired if there was a legal document made out to acquire it?</P>

      <P>That is possible, but the Order was published, I take it, in the local Press, and when the Order was made in August, 1945, the cottage <Col N="869" /> was not included.  It does not transpire either from what Deputy O'Grady said or from my own information whether Mrs. O'Neill left the premises between May and August.  Certainly no claim was made until August, 1948, which was the first time that a claim was made for compensation.  If this person was prejudicially affected she would have made a claim before a period of three years had elapsed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is yet in a position to make a statement on the question of egg prices for 1951-52, for the guidance of Irish producers and if he will state (i) the number of hen-and-duck stations about to be closed down in each county, and (ii) the number and location of hatcheries serving each province.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my statement on the 15th June last in the Dáil, when moving the adoption of the Estimates for my Department, in which I announced the prices to egg producers until the 31st January, 1952. I would also refer the Deputy to many subsequent public statements which I have made on this matter.  The prices which I have announced for 1951-52 are 2/- per dozen from 1st February, 1951, to 31st August, 1951, and 3/6 per dozen from 1st September, 1951, to 31st January, 1952.</P>
      <P>I am not yet in a position to state the number of hen and hen-and-duck stations that will be discontinued in each county after the 1951 season as the county committees of agriculture have not yet completed the selection of applicants for poultry stations for 1951.  The total number of hen and hen-and-duck stations in operation in the 1950 season was 533.  The committees were requested not to select any new applicants for hen or hen-and-duck stations for the 1951 season, and it is, therefore, probable that the number of such stations for that season will not exceed 533.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is open to holders of hen or hen-and-duck stations to qualify for provisional permits to supply hatching eggs to licensed hatcheries and, in fact, the majority of these station-holders have already so qualified.  The decision to discontinue hen or hen-and-duck stations after 1951 does not, therefore, imply that the output of these stations <Col N="739" /> will no longer be available to poultry-keepers.</P>
    <P>The appended table shows the number of hen and hen-and-duck stations in operation in each county and province in 1950 and also the number of licensed poultry hatcheries.</P>
