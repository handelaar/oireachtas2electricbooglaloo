      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will recommend to the Government the setting up of a special subcommittee from amongst its members charged with the duty of examining forthwith the present steep rise in the cost of living, and of making recommendations as to the method of controlling it, whether by the establishment of a prices tribunal or otherwise, such recommendations to be given effect to within one month from this date.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Without accepting the assumption regarding the cost of living which is contained in the Deputy's question, I may say that the Government have been carefully reviewing the existing methods of price control with the object of making such improvements in those methods as may be practicable and of satisfying the House and the public that every step that can be taken to prevent avoidable increases in the prices of essential commodities will be taken.  A statement on the further steps which the Government propose to take in respect of price control will be made to the House on the Second Stage of the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (Continuance) Bill, 1950.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would invite the Deputy's attention to the context in which I made the statement to which his question refers.  I said that industry could best discharge its responsibility to the community by granting the consuming public a reasonable share of the benefits of the increased productivity which has been a feature of the Irish industrial economy in recent years.  I also said that, at the present time, when the protected sector of the industrial economy is more prosperous than ever before, the industrialist enjoying protection should spare no effort to reduce, and should neglect no opportunity of reducing, prices.  In my statement I deliberately refrained from specifying individual commodities or categories of commodities.  I endeavoured, rather, to indicate in general terms the scope which unquestionably exists for co-operation by all sections of the community in all efforts to secure reasonable levels of prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Between September, 1949, and September, 1950, Irish import prices increased generally by 15.8 per cent.  During the same period the following percentage increases occurred in the wholesale prices of certain commodity groups:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  Food, drink and tobacco, 2.8 per cent.</P>
      <P>(2)  Mine and quarry products, 1.2 per cent.</P>

      <P>(7)  Chemicals, etc., 1.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>The increase over the period in wholesale prices generally was 7.2 per cent.</P>
      <P>From mid-August, 1949, to mid-August, 1950, the following percentage increases occurred in certain of the groups comprising the interim cost-ofliving index (essential items):&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state the present position as regards the conditions of employment of temporary clerks in the employment branch of his Department, indicating (1) the position of those who have given two years' satisfactory service but who fail in the examination for established positions, (2) whether it is proposed that employees in county exchanges who qualify in the examination will be transferred from their present offices, and, if so, if he will arrange to have them retained in these offices as a change would be detrimental to them, and (3) the position as regards continuous employment of employees in county exchanges who do not sit for the examination.</P>

      <P>The conditions of employment of the temporary clerks referred to at (1) and (3) of the question will not be altered by the forthcoming examination for posts as clerical officers.  Such temporary clerks will continue to be subject to the conditions of employment under which they were recruited and their continued employment will depend as heretofore on the amount of work to be performed in the employment exchanges in which they serve.</P>
      <P>As regards (2) of the question, temporary clerks appointed to posts as clerical officers as a result of the examination will be subject to the conditions of service of the examination which provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that, in common with all the permanent staff of the employment branch, they may be required to serve in any part of the State and will be liable to be transferred from time to time.  As this condition is essential for the efficient and economical administration of the Department it must be enforced where necessary, but it may be accepted that every effort will continue to be made to keep staff transfers to a minimum.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare (1) if he will indicate <Col N="1041" /> when his Department altered the policy of making the best turf available for the cheap fuel schemes which provide for old age pensioners, blind pensioners and recipients of home assistance in the area administered by the Cork Corporation; (2) whether a tender for machine-won turf, received by the Cork Corporation, was rejected by him in favour of a tender for hand-won turf; (3) if he received a resolution of protest from the Cork Corporation in connection with this; and, if so, whether he proposes to reconsider the position, and (4) whether machine-won turf was provided for the Dublin and Dún Laoghaire cheap fuel schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>My view in this matter is that the best available turf should be supplied under the cheap fuel schemes.  A tender for the supply of machine-won turf was obtained by Cork Corporation and submitted to my Department.  It was learned on inquiry from Bord na Móna that the quantity of machine-won turf available in Cork was less than half of the amount required for the cheap fuel scheme for the winter season.  This fact does not appear to have been known to the firm tendering, nor to the corporation.  Now that the corporation is aware of the position, I will be glad to meet their representatives and discuss with them the best course to adopt.  The question is whether it would be advisable to use hand-won turf now and keep the limited supply of machine-won fuel in reserve against a period of very bad weather, or to use the machine-won turf forthwith and then fall back on the hand-won turf.  An objection to the latter scheme may be that the hand-won turf will probably deteriorate more rapidly in bad weather.  I do not think there would be any great difficulty in arriving at an agreement on the best procedure to adopt.</P>
      <P>The Dublin and Dún Laoghaire schemes are in the same position as Cork.  Portion of the demand will be met by machine-won turf and the rest by hand-won turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the law relating to workmen's compensation stands, workmen who contract certain diseases in the process of mining are entitled to compensation.  These diseases include all industrial diseases affecting miners for which, up to the present, it has been found practicable to make provision in the workmen's compensation code of this country.  The question of making provision in that code for cases of the respiratory industrial diseases which affect miners and others and which are known by the general term pneumoconiosis, is under active consideration in my Department.  My information is that the occurrence of pneumoconiosis is very rare in this country.  If the Deputy has any such case in mind I would appreciate it if he would give me particulars.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will examine the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act he will see that, while certain industrial diseases are covered by the Act and prescribed as industrial diseases, there are other diseases which are not prescribed and which can only be covered if a special scheme is brought into operation.  He will perceive also on examination of the Act that there is a special method of financing any such scheme brought into operation.  The circumstances of this country, with our limited output of coal and limited number of coalmine employers, make it, I fear, impracticable to bring into operation any such scheme.  I think we may have to deal with the matter in an entirely different way because the Act is constructed on a basis which, apparently, does not suit a country with the limited coal-mining possibilities which we have.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state whether (a) enough land will be available, (b) a sufficient number of plants will be available for transplanting, and (c) an adequate number of trained officers will be available to ensure that the decision to plant 25,000 acres annually will be implemented before 1953.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the forestry programme depends on many factors: staff, intake of plantable land, availability of plants, labour, fencing material, tools, machinery, etc. Foresters take a considerable period to train and the necessary steps have been taken to ensure that adequate staff will ultimately be available to ensure the smooth working of the programme. Intake of land is necessarily slow because of title and other difficulties in almost all cases and also due to the fact that much of the acquisition staff's time is lost or wasted on the inspection of totally unsuitable offers.  Plants available for any given acreage depend on the quantity of seed sown, the germination percentage, and the mildness or severity of the winters and periods of drought in the summers during the nursery stage.  Suitable fencing, which is indispensable, is, I regret to say, yet in very short supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is much too early at this stage to give a definite reply to this question, some of the practical steps which I have taken will indicate the progress made.  Acquisition staff of the Department has been increased from two to 11 and will shortly be increased to 15.  Over 14,000 lbs. weight of seeds have been sown in each of the years 1949 and 1950.  It was with great difficulty that we succeeded in securing <Col N="1050" /> even this quantity because of a world scarcity of seeds for some years past. Towards that end a very intensive drive has been made in the last few years for home collected seeds with very satisfactory results.  All the fencing wire, net, barbed and plain, that could possibly be obtained has been purchased.  The question of the purchase of suitable machinery for preparing what was hitherto regarded as unplantable ground has, as I informed the Deputy last week, been given consideration. The planting of any given acreage depends on these and other factors, and it is only by overcoming successfully the obstacles in all these that the desired result can be achieved. The planting programme does not depend alone on the three points raised in the Deputy's question, as the other important factors which I have outlined have also to be ironed out.  While the general tone of this reply points out the difficulties, I wish to say that results in all fields of activity towards the achievement of the programme have been most satisfactory to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what number of plants is available as a result of the seed sown in the year 1949?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that a check carried out in the autumn of this year revealed that there were approximately 40,000,000 plants in the nurseries following the sowing the Deputy referred to.  The number available for planting out depends on what way the coming winter may affect them.  A blizzard might wipe out onethird of them, as happened in the winters of other years, when there was very heavy black frost.  For that reason it would be difficult to give the Deputy the precise number that will be available.  The check which takes place in the autumn of each year must not be regarded as an indication of the number that will be finally available for the reason that I have stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I have given a considerable amount of information. We have sufficient land, but everything does not depend on that alone.  We have to take into consideration the availability of plants and of fencing, which is very important. These are very important factors and any one of them might seriously reduce the programme.  I think the last sentence of my reply should clear up any doubts:&mdash;</P>

The occupiers offered to contribute only £90.  I regard that as treating our effort to benefit them as a joke, and I think they would be well advised to reconsider the question of an offer.</P>

      <P>On the basis of quotations ruling at present for imported seed the maximum cost of seeding an acre of Ymer barley would be approximately 66/-.  The cost of liming and fertilising for a high yield will naturally depend upon the existing level of fertility in the plot proposed to be sown and an attempt to estimate the average cost would be of little practical value.</P>

      <P>I understand that a Dublin wholesaler who supplies pasteurised milk to Greystones is at present considering discontinuing the delivery of milk to this area, as he alleges that the prescribed maximum retail prices for milk payable in the Greystones area, which are lower than the prices fixed for the Dublin sale district, do not allow him a sufficient margin to cover the costs of the collection of milk from farmers throughout the production district, transport to Dublin, pasteurisation, bottling and delivery to Greystones.  These retail prices for milk are fixed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce under the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936.  As far as I am aware, however, there is no general scarcity of milk, and I feel sure that if the need arose the consumers in the Greystones area could co-operate to arrange for the collection of sufficient milk to meet their requirements.</P>

I am satisfied that there are no cogent reasons for seeking an increased price for Grade B cattle and that it would not be in the ultimate interests of our producers to do so. Only about 1 per cent. of all the fat steers and heifers sold to the Ministry of Food since the making of the 1948 Trade Agreement have been graded B.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the adjournment of the debate on Thursday last, I attended a meeting of the County Galway Vocational Committee, of which I am a member.  The meeting took place yesterday and one of the principal items for discussion was the provision of new vocational schools in the county and the offer of a grant by the Minister for the erection of a new school in Kilronan in the Aran Islands. The committee for some time back have been agitating for the extension of vocational education in County Galway, and, on 19th November, 1948, the Minister was pleased to receive a deputation from the vocational education committee on the matter.  I have here a copy of the minute which was sent to me and to every member of the committee of what took place at that interview.  The subject discussed by the deputation was the provision of additional schools in the committee's area as follows: In the Gaeltacht districts, Kilronan and Knock, new schools, and a room extension of the existing school at Carraroe; in the non-Gaeltacht districts the provision of new schools in New Inn, Dunmore and Loughrea.  The deputation consisted of five members: Senator Liam Ó Buachalla, Rev. Father Greaney, P.P., New Inn; Senator Quinn, Mr. J.J. Nestor, county councillor, and myself, and the position was put clearly before <Col N="1077" /> the Minister by the deputation.  The summary at the end of this minute says that the Minister suggested that, as regards the Gaeltacht area, a complete and detailed statement of costs, both as to capital expenditure and annual maintenance, be made out by the committee on the basis of what is required in Inishmore and that, on receipt of this, he would review the Inishmore project fully and be very disposed to give it most favourable consideration. That refers to the school in Kilronan on the island of Inishmore.</P>
      <P>At yesterday's meeting of the committee, we discussed a letter which was sent to me and the other members of the committee, in which were set out details of the grant which the Minister proposed to make with regard to this school.  The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Tá orm a rá go bhfuil an tAire Oideachais sásta deontas speisialta nach rachaidh thar £1,260 sa bhliain a thabhairt dod' Choiste faoi Alt 103 (2) de'n Acht Gairm-Oideachais, le córas oiriúnach Gairm-Oideachais a chothabháil ar Oileán Árann.  Is faoi réir na gcoinníollacha seo leanas a tabharfar an deontas i leith aon scoil-bhliana:&mdash;</P>

    <P>That letter, as I say, was discussed at yesterday's meeting and the members of the committee felt that the annual grant of £1,260 would have to be spent in the provision of courses, classes and teachers' salaries in the two-roomed school which would have to be built, assuming that there would have to be at least two teachers there, in Kilronan.</P>
    <P>We thought that the capital expenditure for the erecting of this school would be provided by the Department, and that there would have been some mention of that in the letter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that point later.  As a matter of fact, at the moment the eastern portion of Galway, that is east of the Corrib, paid £5,195 this year up to the 31st of March, 1950, for the provision of vocational education in the west Corrib area, or in the Gaeltacht area.  We thought that, by reason of the fact of having such a big Gaeltacht area, special provision would be made for the erection of vocational education schools in the Gaeltacht area. Recently, the Galway County Council raised a sum of £40,000 for the three new schools which it is proposed to build in the non-Gaeltacht area.  The matter was discussed yesterday at a meeting of the Galway County Committee. I was under the impression, and so was the Very Rev. Chairman and all the other members of the committee &mdash;we have been under that impression all along&mdash;that, as far as the Gaeltacht area was concerned, the capital expenditure for these schools would be provided from the Central Fund.  We, of course, would take on responsibility as far as maintenance and staffing are concerned.  I am giving that opinion here.  It is the opinion that was expressed by all the members at the meeting in Galway yesterday. It is the opinion that has been held all along by the committee.  I think the deputation gave that impression to the Minister, too, when they met him on the 19th November, 1948.</P>

      <P>Is the Deputy making the suggestion that, instead of paying £1,260 a year for keeping the school going, the State expenditure should be the cost of building the school, and that then the committee would finance the running of the school in the ordinary way&mdash;that is to pay half and half?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>That came up yesterday <Col N="1080" /> at the meeting.  There was no reference at all to the building of the school in the Minister's letter to the committee. There was only a mention of this grant.  The committee held that this grant would not be sufficient to staff and maintain the school, and to provide the other courses and meet the conditions laid down in that letter.  The committee held that the grant would not be sufficient to do that, so that the committee, out of its own resources, out of the ratepayers' money, would have to come to the assistance of the people in Aran in order to meet in full the requirements set out in the Minister's letter.  The committee expected that there would have been some mention of some portion of a grant towards the capital expenditure of the erection of the school.  They asked me to put that point forward in the Dáil to-day. In response to the request that was made to me, I am putting it before the Minister now, and I am asking him to look into it again.</P>
      <P>As I have already mentioned, the impression that was left on my mind and on the minds of the other members of the committee who went on the deputation to the Minister, was that, as far as the Gaeltacht area was concerned, it was going to get special concessions in the case of the schools that we were to build in the Gaeltacht area.  That was the report that the deputation brought back, following their visit to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>A special concession of £1,260 was not bad, plus 50 per cent. of the cost of the capital expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting forward the views that were expressed at the meeting yesterday.  I know that the committee are not satisfied.  They know about the 50 per cent of the capital cost.  But the committee has no provision made with the county council to meet the capital expense of erecting this school.  The committee, as I have already explained, have made provision to erect three schools in the non-Gaeltacht area.  The county council agreed to borrow a sum of £40,000 for these three schools.  We have done our part in co-operating with the Minister <Col N="1081" /> and the Department, and we are not satisfied as to progress that is being made towards the erection of these schools.  Although it is two years since the deputation met the Minister, we have not got sanction yet for the schools in the Gaeltacht area, except to be told to go ahead with one.  We have made provision for the three schools that I have referred to in East Galway, but we have not made any provision for the others for the simple reason that we were under the impression that the Gaeltacht area would get special treatment.  The Gaeltacht area in Galway is a very big area.  It should be treated as a special area on account of the low valuations there and the density of its population.  For these reasons we thought that we had made an unanswerable case for special treatment for it.  The committee, as I say, are not a bit satisfied with the position.  As I have said, they have made no provision for the schools there with the county council.  The committee are also very much dissatisfied with the last sentence in the Minister's letter in which he says re the proposed school in Kilronan:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Tá súil ag an Aire go rachaidh an coiste ar aghaidh anois comh luath is is féidir.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister tells us that we are to go ahead with it now.  We have been going ahead with it since November, 1948, ever since the members of our committee met the Minister, and for years previously.  I may say that the members of the committee were thoroughly disgusted with the last line of that letter.  That was the feeling at the meeting yesterday.  It was as much as to say to the committee: &ldquo;You should go ahead with this thing now.&rdquo; That would look as if the committee had done nothing up to this.  As far as I can see, we have been led astray about this whole matter.  I hope that a clarification of that letter will be sent down to our committee so that we may know where we are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other school I mentioned, New Inn school, we have got permission to go ahead with that. We have done our part so far as the <Col N="1082" /> money is concerned.  As regards Dunmore and Loughrea, we have been held up from going ahead any further with these schools.  As we have cooperated with the Government in every way and made provision for the money, I should like if the Minister would let us go ahead with the building of these schools as quickly as possible.  Other Deputies mentioned about putting up annexes to halls, Nissen huts, etc.  I think they are only temporary expedients.  If we are to have vocational education, if we recognise that it is an integral part of our educational system, we should have buildings properly erected for that purpose.  Parish halls are very useful, but there is such a demand for the use of these halls by Young Farmers' Clubs, Country Women's Associations and our local defence force in every parish who use these halls for training purposes that we cannot provide properly for vocational education classes and all the equipment necessary which has to be left in these halls.  Therefore, we should have proper schools for vocational education as we have for national and secondary education.</P>
    <P>So far as County Galway is concerned, our committee are prepared, if we get the co-operation from the Minister and the Department, to erect these schools.  We have raised money for three in the non-Gaeltacht area and, as far as the Gaeltacht area is concerned, in view of the density of the population and the small valuation there, I hope we shall get special terms for it.  In order to bear out my point, I have here a circular from the Sligo Vocational Committee which I think was sent to every Deputy, but which I should like to read in order to have it on the records of the House.  This is a memorandum explanatory of the methods of financing vocational education committees, especially in low valuation areas, and County Sligo committee's resolution calling for their amendment.  I hope that the Minister may be able to insert such an amendment in this Bill, or accept one, if it is put down, on the lines suggested in this resolution and the explanatory <Col N="1083" /> memorandum that goes with it, which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The finances of every vocational education committee are derived mainly from two sources, namely, the local rating authority and the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>The amount provided by the former is the amount of the rate struck.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution is made up of basic grant and additional grant.  In the case of county schemes, the additional grant is the equivalent of the contribution excess.  In the case of urban schemes, the additional grant is generally four times the contribution excess.</P>
    <P>The contribution excess is the amount of the excess of the proceeds of the rate struck in any year over the proceeds of seven farthings in the £.  For example, if the rate struck is 7d. in the £, the contribution excess is the proceeds of 5¼d. (7d. &mdash; 1¾d.) in the £.</P>
    <P>It follows that the Department's annual contribution to vocational education in counties of low valuation is much smaller than its annual contribution to other counties.  The lower valuation areas are generally the more densely populated and, therefore, require a greater share of money to provide popular education. Hence, the Department's contribution, which is derived from the taxpayers, should be greater in these populous areas and not very much less as at present.</P>
    <P>A simple example will show the inequity of the present system, even in a case where there is no difference between two counties in population per square mile, but where one, A, is of higher valuation than the other, B.  Assume each to strike a rate of 7d. in the £ for vocational education. If the proceeds of 1d. are £1,200 in A and in B only £800, A gets the contribution excess of £6,300 (£1,200 × 5¼) from the taxpayer, while B gets only £4,200 (£800 × 5¼). In other words, A, the wealthier county, can employ at the taxpayers' expense about five teachers more <Col N="1084" /> than the poorer county, B.  When the poorer area has the greater population, the injustice is still more glaring, and as the local rate increases the disparity becomes greater.</P>
    <P>Experience ever since the passing of the Vocational Education Act has shown that the low-valuation counties have not been able to provide vocational education on the same scale or to the same extent as the sometimes sparsely populated, but wealthier, areas.  In counties like Sligo, Leitrim and Galway, a system of vocational stop-gap special grants has had consequently to be resorted to, not so much to develop schemes as to enable existing under-developed schemes to survive in the face of constantly rising costs.  It is significant that the local authorities in these areas, knowing the educational needs of the people, almost without exception, strike the maximum rate permissible.  Although they do so willingly, it must be admitted that the present system makes it practically imperative on them.</P>
    <P>If it is contended that the same system obtains in all local services, such as roads, agriculture and health services, that is so much the worse for the counties in question.  In those services, however, special grants are available in respect of special schemes and in making those grants regard is usually had to the financial ability of the area concerned. But this is not so in the case of vocational education.</P>
    <P>It is not the County Sligo Committee's aim that any change in financing schemes should involve taking from one scheme in order to improve the other.  On the contrary, they feel that the finances of all schemes are inadequate to meet the growing demand of popular education of a practical kind.  They urge that the time has now come when the position should be re-examined and that the Statutory Order made annually by the Minister should be so amended that the areas at present seriously affected should receive additional grants equal at <Col N="1085" /> least to twice the contribution excess.  Only in such a way can there be uniform progress in vocational education throughout the country.  The County Sligo Committee also know that this question of providing educational amenities for the poorer rural areas is closely linked with the evil of emigration, and they feel that their resolution, as hereunder, will be actively supported, even for that reason alone, by all public representatives to whom it is addressed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the resolution which was proposed by the Very Rev. Fr. Kelly, P.P., seconded by Very Rev. Canon Wims, P.P., and passed:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That in this committee's view the method of making grants from central funds, on the basis of pound for pound of the excess contributions in county areas is grossly inequitable; imposes unjust limits to the development of county schemes where the rateable valuation is low; and creates the situation of making the comparatively greater number of taxpayers in these areas contribute to the development of wealthier schemes while bearing the burden of a similar, or even higher, local rate. That rural committees in the West affected by this injustice be requested to convey their protest to the Minister by formal resolution and by enlisting the sympathies of local Teachtai Dála.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That memorandum explains the position of counties such as County Galway. I hold that our county, on account of its peculiar position in having such a large Gaeltacht area, is even in a worse position still.  With this circular was sent out a table showing the rate struck by each county for vocational education, the local contributions per head of the population, the grants per head from central funds and the totals of the two grants.</P>
    <P>It can be seen clearly from the table that counties like Sligo, Galway and Leitrim are paying the full rate that was allowed up to this, 7d. in the £, and at the same time they are getting only small grants per head as compared <Col N="1086" /> with counties like Meath, which is up at the top.  Meath is paying only 5.4d., and the people there are getting 7/6 per head of the population in grants. I could not get the figures for all counties in the Library to-day but I got them for Meath.  These figures show that the valuation of Meath in 1936 was £554,172, the population being 66,220 and the area, 577,824 statute acres.  In our county, the valuation is only £484,049, much less than that of Meath, but our population is 191,053, three times that of Meath, and our area is 1,520,610 statute acres.  That is for County Galway as a whole, but the valuation of the area west of the River Corrib, including the Aran Islands, is only £55,725 10s.  I have here another table supplied to each member of Galway County Vocational Education Committee and which, I understand, was also forwarded to the Department, showing that the total grants received from the county council and the Department, so far as West Galway and Connemara were concerned, amounted to £5,556, while the total expenditure in the same area was £10,755.  The debit against the East Galway area was, therefore, £5,199, payable by the ratepayers.  These figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, it can be seen that counties such as ours have a special claim and I hope the Minister will be prepared himself to insert some amendment or to accept an amendment from some other Deputy to deal with these matters before the Bill becomes law.  Yesterday, we held a statutory meeting in addition to our ordinary committee meeting, in County Galway, and in order to finance our schemes for the next year, and to show that we are co-operating with the Government even before this Bill becomes law, we raised the rate to the maximum figure allowed for this year, 8d., subject to this Bill becoming law and to the county council approving of the proposal. We did that at the statutory meeting after the ordinary meeting of the county vocational education committee had been held.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the comprehensive report which the Minister presented to the House in introducing <Col N="1087" /> the Bill which indicated the progress that has been made in vocational education since its inception in this country.  We have a very energetic committee in our county and we have availed of every scheme that we could possibly avail of.  In addition to ten permanent day schools, we have classes all over the county.  I am particularly interested to have schools erected in rural areas because, knowing the conditions in these rural areas, I realise that the extension of vocational education will benefit the people of these areas both socially and economically.  One of the factors which operated against the spread of vocational education in the beginning was that the people did not really realise the immense value that was being conferred on them.  We had the canard, to which reference has already been made by some Deputies, that vocational schools were white elephants in many areas, just as we had the canard in reference to compulsory Irish and illiteracy in two languages.  We know that if these cries are raised often enough, some people will be inclined to believe them. I believe that what happened is that, perhaps, there was some small falling off for a while in the beginning in the attendances at vocational schools in rural areas.  People did not really realise that it was more important that the son who was to stay at home, and who was to have the farm, should attend a vocational school than it was even for the young boy who was to become a tradesman, an apprentice, or who intended to take up work in an office.</P>
    <P>In later years they began to realise that, and nowadays we have the young men who intend to stay on the land attending our vocational schools.  In addition, we have the girls who intend to stay at home and to get married in rural Ireland, attending domestic economy classes.  These schools then are socially and economically of great benefit to the people, and with the extension of rural electrification, the laying on of water supplies to country houses and the introduction of other amenities, vocational education will be of great help in stopping emigration <Col N="1088" /> and in preventing the flight from the land to the cities and to foreign countries.  In conclusion, I hope the Minister will be able to amend the Bill before it becomes law so as to incorporate some of the suggestions and ideas which I have expressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJCrotty" hpid="Mr. Crotty Mr. Crotty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crotty</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in introducing the Bill, gave us a very comprehensive report on vocational education in Ireland generally.  I think it is very necessary that the Minister should empower local committees to receive an increased rate from the county councils in order to carry on their work because of increased salaries, in the first instance, and also the increased cost of building.  Much comment has been made because the Government proposes to give only £ for £ to the vocational education committees as compared with the contribution from the rates.  I think the Government are treating these committees very fairly in giving £ for £.  There may be special considerations with regard to cities like Cork and Dublin in which a higher contribution is given but I think that in the counties generally the Government is doing very well in giving the £ for £.  I have been a member of a vocational education committee and on many occasions the chief recommendation for carrying out a particular work was that the Government were prepared to pay the largest portion of the cost.  If the Government offered to pay two-thirds or three-fourths of the expenditure, vocational education committees perhaps would be inclined to spend money which would not be always expended to the best advantage. I think it is only right that the local people should be asked to contribute towards the cost of these schemes and that the proposed contribution is very reasonable, having regard to the fact that the local authority will be empowered to conduct these vocational education schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, the fact that owing to the war, very few schools were built during the emergency period and now that building has become possible on a more extended scale, I would ask the Minister to consider making a contribution of two-thirds of the cost from central sources <Col N="1089" /> to assist the erection of these buildings. I think that would be of great assistance because there is no doubt that many new schools are required. I think, however, that when the Minister receives a proposal for the building of a school it should be examined very carefully.  In years gone by, schools were built in places in which there was a very small population and the people there found it very hard to carry on these schools.  I heard Deputy Moran refer to the peculiar circumstances connected with one school in his county which had to close down.</P>
    <P>In County Kilkenny there has been the same experience.  A school was closed down through lack of pupils. In my opinion that school should not have been built.  There was another school that would have been closed down but for the fact that pupils came by motor service from a nearby very populous district.  It is strange that that populous area had not a school while a thinly populated area was provided with a very good school.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister contributes towards the building of a new school he should examine carefully to see that there is a reasonable prospect of there being sufficient pupils in the area or within a radius of four or five miles.  A school should not be built in an area where there is not a reasonable prospect of there being sufficient pupils.</P>
    <P>The question of scholarships for the study of Irish has been raised in this debate.  In some cases where committees gave free scholarships in Irish colleges quite a number of them were not taken up.  I wonder is it a case of something free not being appreciated.  Parents, in some cases, send their children to Irish colleges at their own expense.  Very often when the vocational education committees allot scholarships they are not availed of and, what is worse, the pupils who have been allotted the scholarships do not notify the committees that they are not availing of them until a day or so before the course is due to start, with the result that the committees have not time to hand over the scholarships to pupils who might avail of them.</P>
    <P>The various vocational education <Col N="1090" /> committees and the headmasters of schools have been co-operating to a great extent with local farmers in connection with seed-testing.  In Kilkenny, seed-testing for germination has been carried on for quite a number of years.  That is a great help, and every year the number of samples handed in to the vocational education committees for testing has been increasing. There is no cost.  It is a free service given to the farmers. Lectures are given.  Such co-operation should be extended as far as possible.</P>
    <P>There is one matter in connection with which I would invite the Minister's co-operation.  Although there are very fine vocational schools in Dublin, there is one trade which is not catered for, namely, the bakery and confectionery trade.  I understand that there are night classes for that trade but these would be available only to boys serving apprenticeship in the City of Dublin.  I know cases where boys who are connected with the trade have to go to London in order to attend a technical school.  That is a very bad situation.  This is a free country.  The least that would be expected is that the Minister would co-operate with some of the vocational schools in Dublin for the purpose of providing day classes for the bakery and confectionery trade so as to give boys from the country an opportunity of attending such classes in Dublin instead of having to go to England for that purpose. This State has been established for 28 years and there is no reason why they should have to go to England for such education.  The provision of classes would not involve great expense and there is the added advantage that in such classes boys could get practical as well as theoretical training.  That is not possible in the case of many other trades.  There are great opportunities in this country for first-class male confectioners which, I am sure, the vocational school would be able to turn out.  There is a very large demand for persons trained in this trade, at very good wages.  Our boys should get an opportunity of having this training in their own country.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the way in which he has helped vocational <Col N="1091" /> education in general throughout the country.  I trust that he will be long spared to continue the work.  I hope that during his term of office he will establish or help to establish a bakery and confectionery day school.  That would be ample for the whole country. There are several such schools in England but one would be sufficient for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that in his introductory statement to this amending Bill the Minister would deal with the problem that exists to-day. It must be admitted that the Minister's introductory statement is a very fine treatise on the inception, development and present state of vocational education in this country.  But I was hoping that he would let us know exactly what we are to expect from him during the remainder of his period of office.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kitt said that Galway has been led astray.  We in Dublin are not being led anywhere.  The vocational education committee for the City of Dublin are doing the leading.  They cannot get any backing.  Everybody knows that there is a public demand for additional vocational facilities in the City of Dublin.  The Minister knows now, I am sure, that for the current session in Dublin there is a waiting list of 2,500 pupils and that does not take account of people who presented themselves at the schools and, on hearing that the schools were full, merely went their way.  There are 2,500 people who want to get into the schools, who have left their names at various schools in the City of Dublin, and I would say that there are as many more who have not intimated their intention to take a vacancy should one occur by a pupil dropping out.  I would put the estimate at 5,000 students awaiting accommodation.</P>
      <P>It is irksome to have to repeat the same statement over and over again. Very nearly three years have passed since the Minister and his colleagues took office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely, in my opinion.  We had a policy.  We had a programme of vocational school buildings ready.  We had sites acquired and paid for when the present Minister took office.  For the past three years the plans for the Clogher Road School at Crumlin have been passing backwards and forwards between his Department and our committee and my opinion is&mdash;I have expressed it before and I express it now in this House&mdash;that there has been deliberate obstruction on the part of the Minister for Education in collusion with the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>Our only difficulty in the City of Dublin is the difficulty of finance.  As regards the plan for the Clogher Road School, the original intention was to put up a school costing in the neighbourhood of £70,000.  That was whittled down and we are putting up a building which will cost £50,000.  The original scheme, which is three years old now, would not have cost relatively much more if it had been proceeded with then, in view of present day prices.</P>
      <P>However, the point is that the Minister cannot deny that the scheme was before him and that the plans were ready for that school.  I would like to know why that school has not yet been started.</P>

      <P>We were ready to go ahead and the Minister said: &ldquo;I have no money.&rdquo;  Who is going to complete the school?  Who will do it if the Department say: &ldquo;We have no money&rdquo;?  The ratepayers are paying at the rate of 9d. in the £.  The Dublin ratepayers are getting £2 for £1.  I think it was Deputy Roddy who remarked that in Cork they get £4 for £1.  The Dublin ratepayers are paying to the extent I have mentioned. Dublin is the clearing house for the whole country.  The people in the city <Col N="1093" /> are already rated to the hilt.  Are they to build those schools or will the Government tell us: &ldquo;Here is what we want you to do and we are prepared to back you,&rdquo; and tell us how far they are prepared to back us, whether it will be on a fifty-fifty basis or giving two-thirds of the cost of construction?</P>
      <P>We know where we stand in relation to Clogher Road and the schools at Crumlin.  They are two of the schools that we were told would ring this city. We were ordered to go to the Dublin Corporation and raise £130,000.  We did that and that money will be spent on 31st March next year.  Then we shall have to go for another £125,000 to the Dublin Corporation.  I want some indication of Government policy, some assurance that the building of these schools will start shortly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Crotty speaks about a school of bakery.  The Minister knows that the Dublin Vocational Education Committee has been trying to erect a school of bakery for many years. We have indicated to him our intention to do so if we get the opportunity. Perhaps Deputy Crotty does not know that our present School of Bakery and Confectionery in Dublin is part of the school dealing with electro-technology in Kevin Street.  There has been no change there except in the number of the pupils.  Our School of Bakery and Confectionery is just part of the school concerned with electro-technology, which is one of the most overcrowded schools to be found anywhere. The whole thing is impossible. We must have some indication from the Minister as to what is going to happen.  We have sites in Killester, Inchicore, Whitehall and Rathmines &mdash; we have sites everywhere, but we cannot go ahead with the building because we have no money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say this deliberately, that the Minister has completely neglected this aspect; he has closed his eyes to the needs of vocational education in this city.  A few years ago when I met officials of the Minister's Department I was sorry to hear them express themselves as if the Dublin problem were similar to a provincial problem&mdash;they <Col N="1094" /> looked at the Dublin problem through provincial glasses.  I was told that the danger of erecting a vocational school in Killester was that it might turn out to be a white elephant, something like the erection of such a school in, let us say, County Clare.  Any person who talks about Killester or Whitehall or Crumlin, about vocational schools being erected there and turning out to be white elephants, does not know Dublin or the needs of the Dublin people.</P>
    <P>There should be a complete reorganisation in the Department of Education and a special section should be set up to deal with vocational education in Dublin City.  Approximately £936,000 is spent on vocational education throughout the country and of that amount Dublin spends £300,000.  Surely, the Dublin problem is a separate one and should be treated as such.  We want to know when schools will be provided in the areas in which the Dublin Corporation are carrying out building schemes.  There are many areas around the city where they have built new houses.  We are hoping to build new houses at the rate of 3,000 a year.  I suppose we will complete at least 2,000 this year.  The point is that there are no vocational schools, no facilities for such training in any of these areas. Some of these built-up areas have been in existence since 1933.</P>
    <P>There is no hope of these areas getting schools so long as the present Minister remains, so long as the Government continue to remain inactive. There is no effort being made.  The Dublin Vocational Education Committee are being put off by one means or another; the committee are being led up a path that leads nowhere.  We must have separate treatment for Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling in the Department of Education that there is no need for adult education in the city.  The people who express that opinion have no conception of the need that exists of technical instruction here.  Technical instruction was originally introduced to assist the working-man's son or daughter who had not the wherewithal for a secondary or a university education. The intention was that they could <Col N="1095" /> get a useful education in technical matters after working hours.  That is largely the position to-day, with this exception, that the scheme has expanded in many directions and instruction is to be had in a number of specialised works.  There are aspects of technical education that were not contemplated when the scheme was initiated.  That is all the more reason why new schools should be put up as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Has there been any money added to the pool, to the kitty, or whatever way the Minister expressed it when we went to him on a deputation?  How does the Minister for Finance expect to raise money?  We hear a lot of highfalutin nonsense talked about expenditure on various capital works.  There is not a penny being spent on these schools.  We hear of cultural relations between this and other countries.  If foreigners walked into some of the schools in Dublin and saw the conditions under which teachers and pupils exist they would be very cynical indeed.  I would ask the Minister to go over some night and have a look at the Dublin Municipal School of Music and see there an unfortunate teacher trying to instruct someone in playing the violin and hear, at the same time, the blare of the war trumpets next door.  That school is housed in an improvised building which was never intended to be a school of music but which seemingly will continue to be used as such.  The school houses 1,450 pupils and those pupils must continue to study in that inferior building so long as the present Minister and his colleagues are prepared to sit down and do nothing.</P>
    <P>I think it would be well if the Minister would permit the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee to conduct its own affairs.  I do not say he should not interfere where the sanction of the Department has to be obtained.  That would be unreasonable because, where there is a State contribution, the State has the right to inquire into how the moneys are spent. I would urge upon the Minister that he should let the vocational committee <Col N="1096" /> proceed with the broad scheme and not to have his officials interfering in the trivial and more minor aspects of the scheme.</P>

      <P>Such as.  I am chairman of the Dublin Municipal School of Music.  Our committee asked the vocational education committee to appoint a clerk-typist there at £3 per week.  At the present moment the director and assistant director do the clerical work. It is most amusing, indeed, to go in there and see the director or assistant director, two eminent musicians, writing out postcards, keeping records, and doing all sorts of clerical work.  The director actually answers the telephone because the telephone is in his office, which is also used as a cubicle for giving instruction in the piano.  We asked the committee for a clerk-typist and the committee agreed that the request was a reasonable one, but the Minister turned it down.  To my mind that action is the very negation of democracy.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me in that. We sent that request back to the Minister again and he again turned it down. I do not want to speak too harshly but I am sure every reasonable member of the House will agree that it is not right that the director or assistant director of a school catering for 1,450 pupils should have to sit down and write postcards without any clerical assistance of any kind.</P>
      <P>I have put questions to the Minister. The Minister asks how can I expect to get answers because of the way in which I have put the questions.

      <P>I have had an opportunity over the week-end of reading and digesting the Minister's remarks on this Bill.  There are just a few suggestions I would like to make to the Minister.  I do not think that the general development of vocational education throughout the country is sufficient to meet the demand.  Undoubtedly <Col N="1097" /> that development requires money and the Minister has moved a considerable distance in the direction of providing us with the wherewithal necessary for that development.  I have had considerable experience of vocational education in the country having been a member of Cork County Vocational Committee for a number of years.  I believe in vocational education.  I think it is one of the soundest forms of education.  It is essential, indeed it is incumbent upon us, to provide facilities to ensure that our boys and girls going out into the world to earn a livelihood shall be equipped with a good, sound, vocational education.  There are towns in County Cork which are well catered for in that respect.  Some very excellent schools have been built there over the past quarter of a century.  Within the next year or two Cork County Council intends to provide additional schools &mdash; one in the town of Midleton, which has been crying out for such a school for many years.  Midleton, where there are a number of factories, distilleries, corn mills, requires a school where the youth of the town can receive such an education as will equip him to take his place in the economy of the State in the years that lie ahead.  I understand that Mitchelstown will be provided with a school in the near future.</P>
      <P>I have, as we say in the country, a grádh for the rural population.  I think from henceforth we should let more of our teachers percolate into the remote country districts.  I know a few classes that have been started in different villages and I know that the people in those villages are most appreciative of what is being done for them in order to train them in woodworking, housewifery, farriery, motor engineering and so on.  But I think the people in these districts are to some extent the forgotten children of the Department of Education, and I hope that under the new Bill the Minister will insist that the smaller towns and villages will get greater attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of motor cars on the road at the present time undoubtedly shows that the country is progressing <Col N="1098" /> and I was very pleased to see that the number of apprentices serving their time in the motor trade is five to six times greater than is was in 1945. Recently, I was interested in a young lad who had a penchant for motor engineering.  I tried to get him into a garage in Cork and I was informed there that at the moment they are inundated with apprentices.  That is a good sign.  It shows that the young people are anxious to learn and to take up work which will ensure them a decent livelihood in the future.</P>
    <P>The apprenticeship scheme seems to be working very well in the motor trade, the Electricity Supply Board, the Post Office and in the other branches of industrial life.  The Minister naturally has a keen bias towards education.  He would not occupy the post he does if he had not got that bias.  I suggest that he should do more for the rural population.</P>
    <P>There has been some agitation to raise the school leaving age to 15.  I know it is a ticklish problem but I think that selected districts might be taken, districts where there are factories in existence, in which it might be feasible to raise the school leaving age.  The Bill has been practically spoken out, but these are one or two matters that I would like to impress upon the Minister.  Get the teachers to go into the country areas with the subjects the farmers' sons want, such as woodwork and motor engineering and, for the daughters, housewifery and the various crafts they perform. The Bill is an excellent one and should commend itself to every Deputy in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. M. O'Reilly Mr. M. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no objection at all to the objects of this Bill.  It is absolutely essential, if we are to develop vocational education to meet the public demand.  I was somewhat surprised when I heard the statement made by Deputy McCann that vocational education in the City of Dublin was so badly neglected.  I was under the impression that the position was entirely different, that the city was leading in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, when vocational education was becoming known, there <Col N="1099" /> was considerable opposition and many people believed, when some of these schools were established in County Meath, that they were somewhat overdone. We had running water, hot and cold, and different methods of cooking; in fact, in one or two cases we were accused of having made available lipstick and other cosmetics and that that was inclined to lead people astray. Others were critical because we tried to have a bit of land attached to each school.  It has become very important now to have a properly cultivated garden and a piece of land attached to the school in the rural areas, available not only to the pupils but to the general public on certain dates.  That is a great advantage, but earlier, when these things were first mentioned, they were severely criticised.  Now they are being appreciated and, from the figures the Minister gave, the young people by their attendance have indicated their complete appreciation.</P>
    <P>We have four or five schools in Meath.  One of them, until recently &mdash; in fact, until they were evicted&mdash;was set up in an old workhouse and under great difficulties it continued to succeed.  Eventually, the people who bought over the workhouse evicted the committee; they are there now on sufferance and I do not know how exactly they stand regarding the new schools.  I am not now a member of that committee but from reading the reports occasionally it seems to me that some difficulties have percolated down through, as in the City of Dublin.  For one reason or another, the school has not yet been tackled. There is a good deal of objection and so forth.  That is an area in which a school was essential.  In the early stages the attendance was not too good, but it developed and finally the people in the district appreciated very much all they were taught.  The first impression I got of these schools was when people were taught the principles of certain trades and callings and got some education in cookery, and if they had to emigrate they did not go with their two hands tied behind their backs.  Emigration is a thing I believe we will find it hard to bring to a sudden <Col N="1100" /> conclusion.  It will take some years. It is very edifying to get accounts from abroad that so many young people, when they go, are trained in so many different arts and crafts and many of them are ready to go into a factory.  By our efforts in vocational education, we have removed them from the level of sweeping crossings. That is a great thing and it is well worth the amount of money spent on it.</P>
    <P>I notice that Deputy P.D. Lehane objected here very strongly to the county council contributing any money. As everyone knows, the county council appoints the majority on the vocational education committees and I can say, from some ten or 12 years' experience of those committees, that it was they who led and not the Department, and very often they had to fight the Department to get that lead.  The success of this scheme is entirely due to the rural vocational education committees. Therefore, if the Government is asked to put up all the money, they are certainly going to control it, and as soon as that begins the leakage will start.  As long as the county councils contribute, they have the right to control policy to a large extent.  They are the people intimately connected with the youth and must understand the policy.  Therefore, I believe the principle is right and that the county council will have no objection whatever to any contribution of extra money.  It is fairly evident that more is needed and portion of it should be contributed by the local ratepayers, in order that their representatives would have the control and could direct operations.</P>
    <P>We have three or four new schools in County Meath.  There is one at Navan which is too small, as the attendance has outgrown the capacity.  There is one in Athboy which has a neat garden and a bit of land, and it is doing excellent work.  There was one in Nobber which became a white elephant for some years, but it is no white elephant now, as the attendance has increased very rapidly and is very satisfactory there now.  In addition to teaching people trades and crafts which are mainly carried on in the city, we have in County Meath a certain amount of <Col N="1101" /> agricultural teaching in the rural schools and now that we have young farmers' clubs I hope they will be able to carry on a certain number of experimental plots in conjunction with young farmers.  That was the main object long ago, when these schools were started.  We got some of the land cheaply enough and that was the main object in getting the land.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, the cultural side to all this, and I am sure from his statement the Minister does not mean to let that go adrift.  We tried some years ago to have modern oil paintings exhibited from time to time in the schools.  We went so far as to purchase some of them, done by Irish artists, some that were hung here in the academy; and the people appreciated that very much.  The other thing we wanted to do there was to get a type of museum which we never succeeded in doing.</P>
    <P>Another very important thing which I heard Deputy McCann talking about is music.  As you know, our rural people get very little opportunity of learning music.  They hear a certain amount on the wireless but they have very little opportunity of getting teachers and where there are teachers very often they are beyond their purse.  Music is a thing, I think, which we should do our utmost to develop in rural areas.  It is a great consolation in country districts when people are in a position to sing or play music, and there are thousands who would be capable musicians if they had the chance.  Consequently, I would ask the Minister, as far as direction of policy is concerned, not to put an impediment in the way of any committee which proposes to have teachers in their schools to teach music&mdash;that is, if they can get the teachers.  I think that the money spent in this way would not be ill-spent.</P>
    <P>Although vocational education has been developing for quite a long time in this country, I believe that it is now developing more rapidly and we should give it every opportunity.  We should not concentrate on trades and crafts only but if possible develop the arts side.  We have in the museum what is possibly the world's best exhibit of <Col N="1102" /> ancient Irish art and it is to a large extent hidden away.  People come there occasionally to see it but the bulk of our youth know nothing about it.  It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that we might have a scheme of lending between the museum which is under the direction of the Department of Education and the county committees of vocational education so that these magnificent displays of art could be seen by the pupils which would encourage them to aim at better production. It is a pity that that side of their training is not properly developed.  I do not know that the museum or the picture gallery, which has thousands of pictures in the cellars, would object. That is a side of life which is certainly neglected and which in ancient times was highly developed.  Whether we are going on or going back I do not know, but that is one way we could go on and it would put us on the map of the world.  It is done in every country. We have the opportunity in vocational education to develop the arts and I am sure that neither the Minister nor anyone else would have any objection to that development as well as the development of crafts and industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrigetMRice" hpid="Mrs. Rice Mrs. Rice">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Rice</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Minister to make provision in the coming year for the building of a vocational school at Carrickmacross.  As the Minister is aware the present classes are held in an old part of the workhouse which is a most unsuitable building and pupils are not very anxious to attend such building.  As the Minister is also aware a site has been bought and completed for three years which is now awaiting only the sanction of the Minister's Department. I sincerely hope that that sanction will be forthcoming in the coming year. The school in Castleblayney is nearing completion and if we got sanction for the school at Carrickmacross so that the work could be carried on there when the other school is finished it would be a great blessing to the people of Monaghan who are waiting for the facilities of vocational education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past people were rather slow to attend these schools but now they are quicker and with a little more propaganda <Col N="1103" /> parents would be inclined to make sacrifices so that their children could attend vocational schools even after working hours.  We know how difficult it is for children to attend these schools and certainly a certain amount of sacrifice is necessary, but the years after leaving the primary school are the most important years in a child's life and are the best years for learning.  As one Deputy suggested the Minister might make it compulsory for children to attend after leaving the primary schools.  It might be a good thing, although, of course, compulsion is not a good thing in any community. It might, however, be tried so that people would see the advantages provided in the vocational schools and how helpful they could be to them.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately many of our children will have to emigrate and it would be a good thing for them if they were able to take up jobs other than the most menial jobs which are offered to them when they go to America or England.  They have to take these menial jobs because they are unable to get better jobs.  With even a slight training in housewifery, domestic economy or other crafts they could command good wages and be a credit to their country and to the people who sent them out.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister not to be slow in giving sanction for the building of the school in Carrickmacross during the coming year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to congratulate the Minister on the foundation he has laid for a better Ireland.  Vocational education is most essential to progress at the present moment.  We all know that the demand for education is much more keen than it was.  The uneducated person in the present world has very little future. The day of the badly educated man is gone.  Vocational education has been making progress over the years but I believe that a review is needed now after 25 or 30 years to see where we stand and to see whether we are on the right lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of the opinion that a group of vocational schools in a few big centres <Col N="1104" /> and towns would be bad.  It would be all right for a try-out but it would only cater for the needs of a few.  I am a firm believer in the view that an extra class should be attached to every national school where the children who leave school at 14 could carry on with classes to the age of 15, 16 or even 17.  By that time they would be properly formed for life and would have got a proper outlook on things. They would also find out what vocation in life would suit them best. Between the ages of 14 and 16 children go a bit lax and wild and are a bit of a nuisance at home to themselves and to everybody else.  If there was a class centre in every parish&mdash;by day or night I would not mind&mdash;where they could be properly educated for two or three years more, not so much to give them a training but to give them a sound outlook on life, it would be a very good thing.  There is a great lack of that proper outlook and I think it is more important at the present juncture than at any point in our history because at the present time young children are inclined to pleasure, idleness, devil-may-care and having a good time.  It is the despair of the age, I suppose, but an effort must be made to curb this trend, and prepare them for the responsible position they must hold in the future in order to build up the country.</P>
    <P>We must get back a proper Irish culture as at the present time we are nothing more than a West British colony which must import ideas and outlook from the foreigner and we have the slave mind still.  The only way to combat the slave mind is to get a proper Irish outlook.  Otherwise, freedom does not mean very much at all.  We are no more than a shire of England if we have not a sound national outlook and the greatest thing we need is to give the younger generation that start.  If they get that start, the nation will react and respect the glories of our past and the young generation will be fit to take over when the old generation leaves off.  If we do not progress in that respect I do not believe that national freedom means very much and we are only tagging on to another <Col N="1105" /> nation.  To build up a nation, we must build and mould the character of young people of an impressionable age.  The impressionable age is between 14 and 17 years and if you can get them to have that proper national spirited outlook they will hold it right through their lives.  I know that the man at the helm, the Minister, is the right man for the moulding of character, because he has spent his life at it and has made a great success of it in many fields, and, with the cooperation of this House and of the teachers throughout the country, he will be able to lay a firm foundation.</P>
    <P>We all know that there is far too much shoneenism in this country, far too much idleness and spending of the wealth of the nation on pleasure. These activities should be curbed.  I do not suggest that they should be completely stopped, but many of them should be curbed&mdash;because the present trend is a trend towards pleasure and the spending of money foolishly.  Very few people care about building up a happy home life.  I am satisfied that a vast amount of money will require to be spent and I should like to see a review being carried out with a view to finding out if we are proceeding on the right lines at the moment and catering for the people to the extent we should.  In my county, over a number of years, a vast amount of money was spent on classes throughout the various parishes, and, in connection with these classes, the biggest job we had was to get four or five people to come in order to keep the classes going.  I should like to find out whether these classes are successful. We had quite a number of Irish classes and it is my belief that they were a complete farce and a waste of public money&mdash;I am sorry to have to say it &mdash; because the teachers had to put in a certain number of hours in order to get their salaries and they did everything they could to get a few people to come together to form a class so that they could have the required number of hours.  These classes were not a success &mdash;they were absolute hopeless failures.  I should prefer to see an effort being made to get attached to every national school an extra class where this continuation education <Col N="1106" /> could be provided in every parish. There is no use in catering for the few and letting the many go as they please.  The people in the country are as much entitled to anything that is going, so far as the national purse is concerned, as any other people.</P>
    <P>Vocational education in my county got off to a very poor start because it was held, controlled and ruled by a political clique who were narrow, vicious and mean and did everything they could to sicken the people. Slowly but surely we got away from that position, but there are still on our vocational committees people whose sole ambition is to see that nobody but those of their own political frame of mind are allowed to control our vocational education system in County Meath.  These people are the types of people who paid very little in rent, rates or taxes for the upkeep of education or anything else.  They are of the bully type who are anxious to work themselves into secure positions at the top, if at all possible.  While we have that type of people we will not get the proper balance in education which is needed.</P>
    <P>An extension of our vocational education system to many other areas is needed at present, so that before long we shall be able to cater for all the people leaving school in the different parishes.  It takes a good deal to get a proper balance, but I am satisfied that, with a proper review of the situation and with the finances of the State being made available more generously, we will be able to provide all our people with the same amount and type of education.  I congratulate the Minister on the effort he has been making to get an Irish Ireland of the right type, and, if he gets the full support of the people who are worth anything, we can lay the necessary foundations and there will be no danger of having in our country nothing but West Britonism, shoneenism and so on, qualities which go to make the country hated in the eyes of those who made sacrifices in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement of the Minister was very interesting indeed, and, on the whole, I should say that, in its quality of being so factual, it is <Col N="1107" /> a very fine tribute to the continuity of the good work done for the past 20 years or so.  I think it implies a tribute not merely to the officials and those in charge of the committees throughout the country but to the former Minister who was particularly enthusiastic in his attempt to develop the cultural with the language side.  What one feels is lacking in the statement is a line of direction, which has already been commented upon by other speakers.  We would expect from the Minister some attempt to inspire the people with an objective, with something that is required in the country at present.  We have developed in many ways, but we do require a great deal of development on the cultural side in almost every aspect of culture.  We are inclined to regard it as trivial, as something very secondary, whereas really it is a matter of very great importance.  Almost every aspect of cultural development will be responded to by the people.  Our experience has been that, in spite of criticisms and lack of enthusiasm in certain quarters, the people have responded to any attempt made along these lines and those who have had faith in the people have not been disappointed.</P>
      <P>Someone said, many years ago, that rural depression was mental depression and perhaps the best antidote to that depression in all rural areas would be a very active development of the cultural side of the life of the people. When one looks around for the instrument by which that development could be brought about, one realises that the best instrument is the vocational school.  To some extent, it can be brought about in the primary schools, but the vocational school is best of all, because there is an atmosphere of freedom about it, and there can be very considerable opportunity for local initiative in certain areas.  In my own County of Waterford, enthusiastic people have tried to develop local interests and that is also true of other places in the country.  It is in respect of that aspect that one would look to the Minister to give a lead in the encouragement of these attempts to develop local initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> One of the things which is very much required is a development of taste and judgment in the people.  There is no use in telling them that they must not do this or that, that they must not go to dances, or dance this or that dance, or go to films.  The way to do it is, by cultural development, to give them a taste and judgment for the kind of thing that is best.  That could be done through developing music, Irish music and choral music, and a taste for good pictures.  It would be a very useful thing if the best of our works of art could be seen around the country, with people to give lectures on them, so that the people generally would get to have a proper standard in these matters.  I do not know whether there are people who lecture even upon judgment in films, on the kind of films that one could appreciate and the kind of films that one should have a capacity for condemning.  I have heard teachers discuss that.  These are some of the things which are really needed at the present time.  You have people going to films who are ignorant in the sense that they have not got the background in their minds to give them a capacity for judgment.  The result is a deplorable vulgarity in taste and a lack of a proper knowledge of things.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of this cultural development are in history, folklore, local history, and archæology.  All of these are things to which people will really take if they get any opportunity of being stirred, not merely to learn these things themselves, but to make inquiries and accumulate information about them.  A great deal of work is being done at the present time by the Folklore Commission.  That is quite right.  It is, however, more a question with it of collection rather than of distributing.  The whole tendency in countries that are really interested in culture is to give back to the people the very best there is in culture.  There was a time when culture was confined to the very few.</P>
    <P>I remember W.B. Yeats saying on one occasion that he had been told, I think is was by Paderewski from his experiences in England, that there were only 10,000 people in England who were <Col N="1109" /> interested in good music.  Now, the whole situation has completely changed.  The whole effort now in European countries and in Britain, too &mdash;it should be so and would be so in this country if the people had their way&mdash;is to give the very best to the people whose judgment is just as good and who are just as capable of enjoying the best, as that of anybody else. If the inspiration for this does not come from the top it is very hard for the people themselves to build up a proper atmosphere and attitude, but when we had, as we did have, the destruction of the idea of having a proper concert hall in Dublin&mdash;its absence has been constantly commented upon by distinguished visitors who come to this country&mdash;as well as the unwillingness to make use of the plans that were there for the development of the museum and the National Art Gallery, then, of course, it is no wonder that the position should be as it is.  These were all efforts which should have been developed.</P>

If, at headquarters, there is a lack of that approach, then, of course, it becomes practically impossible to develop it.  The Minister has referred to the Parliament House. You have there one of the grossest misrepresentations of the former Government that there has been.  I am surprised at the Minister.  I could understand some other Ministers, who are given to hyperbole, attacking the <Col N="1110" /> former Government about the Parliament House, but I am surprised at the Minister because he usually sticks to facts and not to fancies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have said sufficient.  I do not want to detain the House.  I do hope that the Minister, in his concluding statement, will follow up the line of giving the encouragement which I suggest he should give to the country, because it is tremendously important for a country that it should be inspired with the idea of local initiative so that the people would be able to do things for themselves: to encourage the building of halls in connection with the work in vocational schools, not merely for technical education but for cultural purposes as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>In concluding the debate, I may, perhaps, be permitted to open my remarks by saying that I entirely appreciate what was said by Deputy O'Reilly, namely, that the great impetus, the great constructive force in the realm of vocational education, comes from the local committees. I do not think any group of people would be more ready to admit that than the officials in the Department of Education, and the inspectors who are privileged to be associated with the <Col N="1111" /> committees in helping them in their work.  It is that particular appreciation that makes me react very definitely against the Deputies who get up here and plead that the State has to do everything, from finance down.  I would ask Deputy Little to appreciate that, in the matter of giving a lead in culture, my experience in the Department, since I went there, has been this, that it was not necessary for me to give a lead along cultural lines because I was very happy to be able to realise the stimulus towards cultural development, as well as instruction along cultural lines, that already existed amongst members of the various committees throughout the country.  It was that which inspired so many C.E.Os. and various teachers who are teaching throughout the country.  As I said earlier, I was responsible for the introduction of the teaching of instrumental music under the vocational education schemes.  I was moved into that position by the vocational education committee in Kilkenny who, contrary to the rules and regulations, were training a band under their scheme.  I got them out of their difficulty by opening the door to everybody.  The development I have spoken about in Cork, where one of the teachers under the Cork vocational scheme has developed a system of choral classes throughout the whole county, running to about 24 centres and of training teachers for them, was due to local initiative which, without encouragement from myself or the Department except by way of help, has enabled that movement to spread to County Waterford and South Tipperary, where it is being initiated in the coming year.  When we found the spirit and the willingness and the capacity there, we assisted in every way so that the initiative found an open door to go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was through no stimulus from myself or the Department that the scheme of adult education, initiated in University College, Cork, taken up in University College, Dublin, and, I understand, now extending to Galway College, was begun.  When, however, we saw the desire to take the initiative <Col N="1112" /> and the capacity there and understood what a great advantage it would be to help, then we helped in the development of that by giving small initial grants, by arranging that a teacher of the local vocational education committee should co-operate with the university and that the university, with that assistance, should spread this work through the vocational schemes in Limerick, Waterford and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This matter of cultural development does not look to the Government for help.  It looks to the Government for understanding and assistance.  I am sure Deputy Little will appreciate that it is the same type of local initiative, although in a different sphere, which caused the municipality of Waterford City to start the little theatre there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is rather a happy position to be able to try and help in every way possible to encourage that initiative.  It is gratifying to see that that initiative with regard to music and educational matters is encouraged, that the demand for it is shown to be extending in all directions, and that, by a natural growth from among the people themselves, their schemes both for organisation and curricula develop quite naturally in connection with their own particular outlook and their own particular needs.  The whole development of vocational education throughout the country is stamped with that kind of leadership arising among the committees and the teachers are spurred on by the local needs and opportunities.</P>
      <P>In the City of Dublin it has developed around the initiating of the apprenticeship scheme.  Deputies will recall that in my opening remarks I said that the apprenticeship schemes which had been set up in a voluntary way had been more successful than the ones set up with a statutory basis to them.  Therefore, we look forward to local initiative and we look to local cultural traditions to be the root from which a broad, general and strong national culture will develop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> It is, therefore, disappointing when we have some deputies arguing that the State must take over the whole of the financing here, there and elsewhere.  It is gratifying to know, however, that opinion on that was very divided and that from every side of the House the opinion was expressed that it would be quite wrong to hand over the financing of vocational education entirely to the State, because that would mean handing over the control and direction of it and it would lead to very wide and very irresponsible demands from people who are not as thoughtful as the people who are financing, to the extent to which they are financing now, their own schemes and creating a real, sound educational and cultural development.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt challenges the position with regard to the State financing of schemes for the Gaeltacht.  I resent being told, particularly by a Deputy whom I infer is a member of the vocational committee in Galway, that I misled the Galway committee, just as I resent Deputy McCann's suggestion that I also misled the City of Dublin Vocational Committee.  I had, what I understood, a perfectly satisfactory and informative discussion with the representatives of the Galway Vocational Committee.  I discussed the priority in which they would go ahead with their various schemes.  They placed the New Inn scheme in the forefront of their plans and the next scheme on their list was the Aran scheme.  There was also a school for Knock.  There has been considerable difficulty over the school for Knock because there was a difference of opinion as to where that school should be sited, because it was thought that the original site was going to interfere with the educational provision made through a secondary school in the neighbourhood.  I understand the difficulties have been settled.</P>
    <P>In the case of Aran the committee in Galway have been offered an annual grant of £1,260 per year to keep instruction going through the medium of Irish in a two-room school in Aran and in whatever other classes they arrange throughout the islands there. The implication is that the committee themselves will be responsible for the <Col N="1114" /> provision of the money to build a two-room school there, but, in accordance with the normal financing of the general scheme in County Galway, the Galway committee will receive from the Department one-half of the cost of the capital work in putting up the school.  If I am to understand from Deputy Kitt that the Galway county committee repudiate any responsibility on behalf of the ratepayers to build a school or to make any contribution to vocational education because that vocational education is intended for that portion of our population traditionally speaking the Irish language, then that is a comment on the situation which I do not take from Deputy Kitt as being representative of either the members of the vocational committee in Galway, the Galway County Council or the ratepayers in Galway who would have to bear, in connection with the Aran scheme, simply the annual cost of 50 per cent. of the capital cost of putting up the school.</P>
    <P>On top of that attitude with regard to Galway we are going to have with regard to the western counties a claim that they should have special facilities and special financial help from the State, while, on behalf of the vocational committee in the City of Dublin, we have Deputy McCann saying that they are not getting enough of money with the £2 to £1 grant in respect of their expenditure.  I feel that Deputies generally will understand me when I say that, while there may be inconsistencies in the financing of the various schemes of vocational education throughout the country, any changing of the scheme that has traditionally existed is not a matter which can be lightly entered upon.  I appreciate that there are inconsistencies of one kind or another there but I cannot offer to review a scheme in the atmosphere or from the point of view that either Deputy Kitt has spoken in regard to the Gaeltacht, that Deputy McCann has spoken in regard to Dublin or the Sligo people have spoken in regard to that area.  The system of financing vocational education may have to be reviewed but such a review would require more complete statistical information, as to what has been <Col N="1115" /> achieved in the various counties, the money that has been spent and the problem that remains to be dealt with, before I would recommend any change in the scheme.</P>
    <P>To deal with Dublin for the moment, the position in regard to Dublin is that the committee came to me.  Quite a number of works were planned or, should I say, envisaged&mdash;an extension at Aldboro' Parade, an extension at Mount Street, an extension at Denmark Street, the erection of a ten-room school at Clogher Road for boys, six rooms at Crumlin Road for girls, six rooms at Whitehall for boys and six rooms in the same place for girls, six rooms at Killester for girls, six rooms at Emmet Road, Inchicore, for boys, six rooms at Williams Park, Rathmines, for boys, a 12-room extension at Bolton Street New Science School and a ten-room replacement for the School of Music.  The attitude of Deputy McCann is that all that work is held up, that everything is in a shocking mess, that there are queues in the City of Dublin, all because of the Minister's neglect.  However, the list of works that the committee require to have carried out there shows that a very considerable amount of work and a considerable amount of planning were involved.</P>
    <P>The committee were authorised to proceed in October, 1950, with the Aldboro' Parade extension and that work has already begun.  That was to accommodate 120 pupils.  So far as the Mount Street extension and the Denmark Street extension are concerned, the committee were authorised to proceed with the work in May, 1950, and the stage has been reached where these extensions are being roofed. The committee was also authorised to proceed with the building work at Clogher Road new school in November, 1950.  In regard to the Crumlin Road school for girls, the Whitehall school for boys and girls, and the Killester school for boys, no action has yet been taken.  Sites have been acquired.  Sketch plans for Whitehall and Killester were submitted in December, 1948, on the basis of 240 units per school.  The Department was not satisfied.  I discussed the matter <Col N="1116" /> with a deputation in March, 1949, and I suggested that experience gained in Clogher Road of a 240 unit school would help in coming to a decision as to the size of further regional schools. It is unlikely therefore that any further action will be taken pending the completion of Clogher Road.  In the case of Emmet Road and Williams Park Schools for boys, sites have been acquired but no further steps have so far been taken by the committee.  In regard to the Bolton Street extension, adjoining premises are being acquired for the purpose of a site for this proposed extension.  No further action has so far been proposed by the committee. In regard to the new science school and the new school of music, no definite proposals have as yet been formulated.</P>
    <P>I have no conflict with the vocational education committee of the City of Dublin.  If they have any representations to make to me, I think that it would be much more satisfactory for me and for them to have a different method of indicating their desires and wishes than the type of contribution we have had from Deputy McCann here this evening.  There is a very big capital expenditure envisaged at the present moment in the City of Dublin, when you take into consideration the large number of schools of which I have spoken that require to be built according to the present outlook of the committee.  There is a plan there extending over quite a number of years.  I am most anxious that the committee should be helped in every possible way to do its work in the most effective manner, but to come in here and say that the only thing that is impeding the progress of the City of Dublin committee's scheme for building vocational schools that would wipe out all the queues is that the Minister for Education is doing nothing about the matter, is just ignorance and futility, if it is nothing worse.</P>
    <P>The position generally in the country is that there is a tremendous amount of initiative, a tremendous amount of realism, and that realism is helped in great part by the fact that there is a sense of local responsibility.  A number <Col N="1117" /> of Deputies put forward here various ideas in regard to private halls and private schools.  Building is very costly at the present time and, when we consider the general problem that requires to be dealt with, I have no desire to be finicky with regard to any proposal for housing vocational education classes in any part of the country at the present time.  I do feel that it is very desirable that there should be a great sense of responsibility and a considerable amount of foresight on the part of committees.  Most committees are facing their work in that way. Quite a number of varying types of propositions come up from time to time and I am prepared to take my chance, in an experimental way, in giving committees authority to proceed with certain things.  Muintir na Tíre, in the Coachford area, bought a house and proposed to rent it to the local vocational education committee for the establishment of classes suitable to the area.  From my point of view, that proposal cut in on what would be the normal priority in dealing with the plans that the committee had in front of them.  Nevertheless, there was a certain amount of local initiative and when the proposal was examined by the local committee, I entirely agreed to allow the Coachford proposal to go ahead.  In County Wexford the committee propose buying, at a fairly reasonable price, Coláiste Garmáin, which has been in the hands of a committee which ran the Irish college every year.  Their proposal was that it would be a great advantage to them, particularly with the development of voluntary bodies such as Macra na Feirme, the Irish Countrywomen's Association and Muintir na Tíre to have a place where they could have residential courses at various times of the year.  They put up a proposal that they would continue to run an Irish college during the summer, that they would use the college in various ways and have residential courses, according as their scheme developed.  The scheme had the approval of the committee; it had the approval, as far as I understood, of the bishop, and I have given approval for the purchase of Coláiste Garmáin to be run in that particular way by the Wexford Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1118" /> There was a hall available in Kiltegan, rather near where there are technical schools.  The committee propose to buy that hall.  I have not yet agreed to sanction the purchase of that hall because I am not sure that it fits in in a reasonable and systematic way with their general proposals.  It might be much more reasonable to expect that that hall would be run as a parish hall.</P>
    <P>Then there is the case that Deputy McQuillan mentioned the other day where local people are building a hall. The suggestion is that if a room were added to the building and the local vocational education committee subscribed £300, the committee would have a room there and that generally they might mutually assist each other. I have not quite approved of the plan yet but, in my present frame of mind, I might be tempted to approve of that particular proposal although there is a nice phrase, &ldquo;bíodh rud agat féin nó bí i n-éaghmuis&rdquo;&mdash;have a thing yourself or be without it.  It is quite possible, in the local circumstances there, that co-operation could be satisfactorily arranged.</P>
    <P>There are other cases.  There is one county where a farmer has offered a field for a site for a technical school. Very often you could have cases which would be like a fellow getting a bell for a bicycle and then all he would want would be the bicycle.  I feel that while offers and proposals of this kind can in some cases be signs of real initiative and a promise of real development, and while they may come from great generosity of heart, they could easily distort a plan set out by the committee as a long distance plan to be followed carefully and systematically with the best and most constructive expenditure of money.</P>
    <P>My frame of mind is that I am prepared to experiment and to allow local committees to experiment a little at the present time but generally in my discussions with committees I asked them to set out short term schemes say, for two or three years, and to fix their priorities in relation to that so that, from the point of view of State commitments&mdash;because the State provides a considerable amount of the <Col N="1119" /> money&mdash;from the point of view of their own commitments and from the point of view of the systematic development of the educational requirements of counties, they will fix their short term plan, settle their priorities, and stick to these priorities in spite of temptations to be dragged in one way or another.</P>
    <P>The question of teachers is a difficult question at times.  There is a certain shortage of woodwork teachers.  A course was established in September, 1949, and 20 additional woodwork teachers will be available in June next. After that, until the needs are fully saturated, there will be 20 additional woodwork teachers available every June.</P>
    <P>The demand for metal work teachers is not so great but 16 metal work teachers will be available in June, 1951, and another course, which will begin in September, 1951, will produce 16 teachers in June, 1953.  Under present circumstances, it is possible to hold only one metal work course at a time.</P>
    <P>Twenty-four teachers of domestic economy are provided annually from Coláiste Muire and 12 from Coláiste Caitríona.  As far as we can see, the present demands from the committees are fairly well met.  It would not be easy to increase the number of teachers available from the existing institutions but that situation is being carefully watched.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig, I think, asked that special attention would be given to the extension of vocational education in so far as it affects the economic and effective operation of the farm.  I think those responsible for the development and operation of vocational education schemes can congratulate themselves in that they have made an outstanding contribution to improvement in that line.  The rural science teachers throughout the vocational education system have brought a new light and a new hope to the agricultural community. To a very large extent their work in the schools has been responsible for the development of bodies such as Macra na Feirme.  They have been drawn outside their school work <Col N="1120" /> into the farms and into the committees of agricultural societies working on the farm.  The parish scheme that the Minister for Agriculture had intended and that he has started in a few places is the scheme that would put the crown on agricultural education.  The rural science teachers have prepared the ground for the day when, in a more effective way, under the county committees of agriculture or under the Department of Agriculture more effective instruction can be brought to farmers in methods of marketing and other aspects of farm economy to which Deputy Derrig referred, but I do not think that the training of teachers for agricultural instruction can go beyond the training that those who are rural science teachers have been able to get up to the present.  They are extending in a very practical way and facing up to the economy of the farm, but I do not think that we can provide any different type of instruction for rural science teachers than they are getting at the moment.</P>
    <P>I did indicate that in connection with teachers who are teaching Irish, and in some cases commercial subjects, there has been a development of the discussion group, even around the commercial subjects.  The discussion group idea could also be developed around rural economy and rural science.  In that way, perhaps, a little more will be added to the work of the rural science teacher bearing on the other general matters that a farmer has to take into account for the proper running of his economy.</P>
    <P>I would like Deputy Connolly to understand that it was through no lack of appreciation of the work that is being done on the commercial side that I concentrated on the apprenticeship side and on the rural side of vocational education.  The work that is being done on the commercial side is of very considerable importance and is very well known, but I have been endeavouring to see that where rural classes are being run in a necessarily small way and in a school that has only a small number of rooms, woodwork and metal work and domestic science for girls will be concentrated on.  I have been trying to keep typewriters out of some <Col N="1121" /> parts of the country where I consider that rural crafts and domestic economy work should be concentrated on.</P>
    <P>I expect Deputy Moran was talking on a light note when he said that young country people were fed up with <i>Jimmy Mo Mhíle Stór</i> and they wanted some other kind of music.  I feel he must have been talking without very much contact with Mayo opinion and practice in connection with this matter, because I have searched some of the biggest and the most likely places in the City of Dublin to get a copy of the song to which he referred I would like him to understand that there have been published from the Gúm about 23 songs that are less traditional than <i>Jimmy Mo Mhíle Stór</i> and <i>Eamonn an Chnuie.</i>  One would think that the passage west of those two songs might revive interest in those two gentlemen and their antecedents.</P>
    <P>While there may be discrepancies in the incidence of the cost of vocational education as between the State and the rates in some of the poorer parts of the country, the vocational education scheme must rest on local responsibility and we cannot accept the position that counties like Galway and Donegal will repudiate any responsibility for bearing part of the cost of vocational education in the Irish-speaking districts.  The State has given considerable assistance in helping vocational schemes in these districts and we will, to the very best of our ability, continue to do so.</P>
    <P>Question&mdash;&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;&mdash;put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (General MacEoin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  I do not think that I need take up very much of the time of the House in explaining the necessity for this measure.  The existing Rent Restrictions Act, which was passed in 1946, was expressed to continue <Col N="1122" /> in operation only until the 31st December, 1950.  Accordingly, unless the Legislature now prolongs the Act for a further period, the protection afforded to the many thousands of tenants who come within the scope of the Act will automatically lapse at the end of next month.  I think that it will be the view of Deputies on all sides of the House that there can be no question of allowing this to happen. To permit rent control to be terminated in so abrupt a fashion would, I am convinced, be bound to result in considerable and, perhaps, widespread hardship for many tenants.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, I have recently appointed a commission of inquiry with terms of reference which provide, amongst other matters, for an examination of the working of the Act of 1946 as modified by the amending Act which was passed last year.  The obvious course for us, therefore, is to extend the period of operation of the Acts for so long as may be necessary to permit the commission to conclude its investigations and to present its report.  I may say, in this connection, that I have asked the commission to give priority to that portion of its task which is concerned with rent restriction and to prepare an interim report on the subject.  I am aware that the commission is tackling the problem energetically and that already, in the comparatively short period of its existence, it has held half a dozen meetings. But, with the best will in the world, the taking and examination of evidence, the consideration of all the matters that have a bearing on this complex problem and, finally, the preparation of a report must take some time.  And, when the report has been received, we must allow for a reasonable time for its examination by the Departments concerned and by the Government and for the drafting of any fresh legislation that may prove to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will have observed that the Bill proposes a further life of two years for the existing Acts.  I am optimistic enough to hope&mdash;and I may say that my optimism is a measure of my confidence in the commission&mdash;that long before the two years have elapsed, we <Col N="1123" /> shall have received the commission's report and shall have formulated any necessary legislative proposals.  The continuation in force of the existing Acts for a further two years need not preclude the enactment of fresh legislation before the expiration of that period if this should prove possible.</P>
    <P>The House will probably wish me to say a word or two on the significance of Section 2 of the Bill.  The Act of 1946 provided in Sections 11 (2) (g) and 17 (2) (e) for special lawful additions to the basic rent in respect of a landlord's expenditure on repairs over and above a prescribed minimum during any of the pairs of the years comprised in the period 1945 to 1950. The actual provision was that, where a landlord expended in any of the pairs of years in question a sum in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent on putting the premises into a reasonable state of repair, he was entitled to increase the rent by a sum equal to 15 per cent. per annum of the amount of the excess of his expenditure over two-thirds of the basic rent.  This was modified by the amending Act of last year which scaled down the percentage allowed to the landlord and the present position is that he is entitled to 15 per cent. only on the first £100 of the excess of his expenditure over two-thirds of the basic rent, while on the second £100 he is allowed 8 per cent. and on any amount over £200 he gets 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>The reason why, in the Act of 1946, these provisions to which I have referred were restricted in their application to the pairs of years from 1945-6 to 1949-50 was, of course, that the Act itself was expressed to continue in operation only until the end of the year 1950.  Now that it is proposed to continue the Act in force for a further period of two years, it is right and logical, I suggest, that we should provide for the application of the provisions of Sections 11 (2) (g) and 17 (2) (e) of the 1946 Act, as modified by the 1949 Act, to the pairs of years 1950-51 and 1951-52.  It may be said that, in this way, we shall be preserving the <i>status quo</i> while the commission of inquiry is carrying out its task of examining the practical working of <Col N="1124" /> the provisions of the Acts including, of course, these particular provisions which are mentioned in Section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister asks the House to pass this extension of the existing legislation solely on the ground that he has referred some of these matters to another commission of inquiry.  It is a question for the House as to whether or not, if amendments to the existing code are necessary, such amendments should be shelved until this commission reports.</P>
      <P>Some time ago, in the year 1936, a commission was set up to report upon the very matters that this commission is now being asked to report upon. The terms of reference of the particular commission in 1936 were as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) whether any, and if so what, hardships and abuses arise or are capable of arising under the existing law governing the letting on occupation tenancies at occupation rents of houses and parts of houses in cities, towns and villages where the house or the part so let is used by the occupier thereof wholly or partly as a dwelling-house, and</P>
      <P>(b) if any such hardships or abuses are found to arise or to be capable of arising, what additions to or amendments of the said existing law are practicable and desirable to remove or modify such hardships and abuses or to prevent the same from arising.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those terms of reference were as wide as they possibly could be and that particular commission had every opportunity at that time to make any recommendations they thought fit to amend the then existing law.  Everybody knows, indeed every schoolboy knows, what amending legislation is necessary in relation to present-day abuses of the rent restrictions code.</P>
      <P>The terms of reference given to the new body set up by the Minister are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(1)  To inquire into the working of the Rent Restrictions Acts, 1946 and 1949, and to report whether, in the opinion of the commission, <Col N="1125" /> those Acts should be continued in force and, if so, whether they should be extended or restricted in their application, or amended in any way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the first paragraph of the terms of reference.  Surely the Minister knows whether or not it is necessary to extend the protection afforded by the rent restrictions code and surely there should be no necessity for either the Government or the Minister to refer this matter to any outside body.  Does not everybody know that if protection is necessary while the present shortage of houses exists one must continue the protection afforded in the past?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  To investigate and report whether it is necessary or desirable to control the rents of furnished dwellings and, if so, what legislative provision should be made for that purpose.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the second paragraph of the terms of reference of this new body. It is obvious to everybody, as well as to every tenant and every prospective tenant, that one of the first things the Government should do is to stop the existing loophole in relation to furnished lettings under the existing code.</P>
    <P>The third paragraph of the terms of reference deals with Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, which treats of building leases and so forth. In the main it is not of very great interest to the public as a whole.  The three important items in connection with housing and the control of rents which are agitating the public mind to-day are, firstly, the question of furnished lettings which are uncontrolled under the existing laws; secondly, lettings for temporary convenience or alleged temporary convenience which provides another loophole for getting out of control; and, thirdly, the houses that have been built since 1941 and which are not controlled.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows that these are the three main problems.  The public generally and, in particular, those people interested in the administration of the law in relation to rent restrictions <Col N="1126" /> and control know that these are the three important matters requiring to be dealt with.  Why then should there be any necessity for the Government or the Minister to shelve the solution of this problem by handing it over to a commission?  Does not everybody know that it is simply a matter upon which the Government must make up its mind?  Does not everybody know that it is simply a matter for the Government to say: &ldquo;We shall not allow in future lettings purported to be made for the purpose of temporary convenience to be taken outside the scope of protection afforded by the Rent Restrictions Act and we shall bring in a short amending section to continue the existing legislation and make it applicable to houses built since 1941; in other words, we shall bring the existing legislation up to date&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>There is no problem for a commission to solve and there is no question for a commission to decide and it is an absolute waste of time to refer these matters to a commission.  A competent draftsman can draft an amending section, or sections, if the Government and the Minister will make up their mind as to what they intend to do. This commission appears to me to be merely a way out for the Minister and the Government by putting the whole question on the long finger in pushing it over on a commission and asking that commission to report.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his opening speech said that this commission had made some progress.  Evidently they have held six meetings.  He said that he would have to wait until the report is made.  But when the report is made there will be another wait until the Government considers that report; there will be another wait until legislation embodying the Government's proposals comes before the House; and there will be yet another wait until such legislation is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the meantime, all those people who want houses and all those who are being put out of houses on the ground that the lettings are furnished lettings or were for purposes of temporary convenience and all those people in the unfortunate <Col N="1127" /> position of having to rent houses built since 1941 must all wait while all that red tape is unwound. If this commission proves as slow as some former governmental commissions, God alone knows when these people will get redress.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why these matters should be referred to a commission. These matters are vital throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The solution to them lies in the Government making up its mind and the Minister could introduce a 20-line Bill to-morrow which would let the public know where they stand in regard to these lettings and check those who are taking advantage of the existing code solely in order to abuse it by letting houses at rack rents.  It is a simple matter.  Apparently the Minister wants to complicate it by suggesting that there is some reason why the solution to it should be shelved until such time as this body considers and reports upon it.</P>
    <P>As far as the actual body set up is concerned, they are excellent men and presumably in due course they will present a very nice report to the Minister. It does not take a commission to deal with these matters agitating the public mind.  Any schoolboy in Dublin City could tell the Minister what needs to be done, the three matters I have mentioned, and it is for the Minister and the Government to decide and to introduce legislation.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I notice that in the terms of reference to this body there is not one word about ground rents, in spite of all the discussion we had here and the statements from some of the Parties opposite, both outside and inside the House.  That is not down as one of the matters on which this commission is to report.  It is not left to them, though we were told from time to time that this was a vital and urgent question and one that would have to be dealt with by legislation at a very early date.  The last commission that dealt with this problem, with the wide terms of reference to which I have referred, took five years to report.  The Minister is asking this House to extend this existing legislation for a period of <Col N="1128" /> two years, but why it should be two years, I do not know.  When the commission does report, the question will simply go back into the Minister's hands and it is then for him to decide on these three points (a), (b) and (c). Or, if the commission comes in with a report in two years' time like that of the recent Roe Commission, the Minister may disregard whatever the commission says and put it on the long finger for another two or three years. I do not say it will take five years to report but from our experience of commissions here we have no guarantee that it will act very expeditiously or that it will get any further with this problem by the time further legislation of this kind will be coming before the House in two years' time.</P>
    <P>It is a great pity that the Minister did not put into the terms of reference that this commission also would inquire and explore into what happened the Commission on Emigration, the Commission on the Garda Síochána, that on the flour industry, the Dollar Advisory Commission and all those other commissions that have been set up and have not been heard of since up to this day.  This seems to be a Government of commissions for commissions by commissions on commissions. We will never see the end of commissions, though there may be some case to be made for them in certain involved matters.</P>
    <P>These are vital questions: (a) temporary convenience, (b) furnished lettings, and (c) houses built since 1941. Where in the name of common sense is the necessity to refer them to commissions? The Minister, without leaving that seat, could to-night inform the House and the country what his mind is on the matter.  The Government could inform the country in the morning what it intends to do about the problem. They have a simple duty to face up to their responsibility and give the House an opportunity to deal with the exploiters who are getting outside the rent control in this State.  It is not an involved problem.  The Minister indicates that this Bill is to be effective until the 31st December, 1952.  The House is entitled to ask him for some assurance that we will see some solution <Col N="1129" /> to these three problems I have enumerated, within the foreseeable future.  The House and the public are entitled to view with grave suspicion the fact that this matter is being shelved until the commission reports.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that we cannot wipe out this legislation, since there must be some protection for the tenants and we must continue it until the commission reports.  When they do, the Minister will have to introduce legislation to deal with the weakness of the existing law.  We know that, but there is no necessity to wait until the 31st December, 1952, to face up to the problem.  I am telling the Minister here and now that that problem can be met by him and by the Government, if they are prepared to face their responsibilities, inside 24 hours; and there is no reason why the tenants in this country should be exploited because the Minister or the Government are not capable of making up their minds on this vital problem until 31st December, 1952.</P>

      <P>I have a considerable amount of sympathy with the point of view that has been expressed by Deputy Moran.  I feel that this House has been treated very badly in this matter.  Questions were asked of the Minister here some months ago in regard to furnished tenancies and he said that legislation to deal with the matter was in course of preparation. If that is so, it should have been included in this Bill.  Everyone knew that the present legislation would expire on the 31st December and I feel that Parliament and the people have been treated very unfairly by the delay in setting up a commission&mdash;if a commission were required at all.  It was very unfair to wait until the Dáil was in recess and about to reassemble for the autumn session, to announce that the commission would be set up.  It was clear when that announcement was made that the commission could not report in time to have legislation dealt with prior to the 31st December of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that there are difficulties about this whole Rent Restrictions code.  The Rent Restrictions Acts now in force are a most involved and difficult business.  It is almost impossible <Col N="1130" /> to wend one's way through the Act of 1946.  Whoever conceived it I do not know and I do not know why this House should have passed it.  I am quite sure that the House did not know what it was doing and that the Minister who was in charge of the Bill did not know what he was putting before the House.  I must say I read that Act through when I saw it first and I said to myself: &ldquo;That is all, I am not going to endeavour to understand what it means.&rdquo;  I would not have had the time to know exactly what that Act meant.  Persons came along to me to ask what the Act meant and I always told them that there was somebody who probably knew something about it but that I did not.  I agree that a commission was necessary to inquire into that particular Act but my strong objection is that everybody knew that and that it was left until a few months before the Act was due to expire to set up the commission.  That was why I say that I do not think the House was treated fairly with regard to that, nor do I think that the public were treated fairly.  Now that the commission has been set up, I sincerely hope that it will endeavour to produce the draft of a simple Bill that will be understood. I hope to see an end to 1914 with regard to rent restrictions.  I hope to see the adoption of something reasonable based on the poor law valuation, or if needs be, setting up some type of rent court that would fix rents in accordance with some prescribed scale.  If the commission that the Minister has set up will clear away all the nonsense that is written into rent legislation and endeavour to get a simple Bill that can be understood, the commission will be doing very valuable work.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Moran, I have nothing to say to the persons who are appointed as members of this commission but I do think that there are certain interests that might have been included in it.  I think it might have included somebody with practical experience at the lowest level of the operation of the Rent Acts.  The Rent Acts are operated in the District Court in the main by one particular <Col N="1131" /> district justice in Dublin.  He has a staff who are dealing with that matter day after day, a staff who are aware of all the complications and implications in it, a very intelligent staff too. There are practising in the District Court some solicitors who have a practical knowledge of the Act and of the defects in the Act and I think it is a great pity that some persons out of that particular class were not included in the commission.  It is all very well to say that they can come before the commission, give evidence, make statements or submit documents or memoranda.  I think it would have been very valuable had some persons with practical knowledge of the working of the Act been included in the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission must deal with leaseholds in addition to rent restriction and a very serious problem is arising in Dublin and perhaps in other parts of the country at the moment regarding leaseholds: leases that are now expiring. I had experience of a case recently where a lease of 21 years was expiring.  Notice of application for a new lease was given.  The rent was £60 a year and the landlord said: &ldquo;Yes, I will give you a new lease but you must pay a rent of £300.&rdquo; The unfortunate person who had endeavoured to build up a business in that place was horrified and shocked that he should have to pay a rent of £300 per annum.  He entered into negotiations with the landlord and the landlord said: &ldquo;Yes, I would be prepared to reduce the rent to £150 a year but I will only give you letting for temporary convenience for a period of five years.&rdquo;  In other words: &ldquo;I will deprive you of all your rights and you will give me £150 a year.&rdquo;  That is too serious a problem to be left over until such time as this commission reports and the Minister and the Government have the opportunity of considering its recommendations.  I do not know whether the Minister could do it within the scope of this Bill but if he cannot do it within the limitations of this Bill I would suggest that he should bring in along with this Bill a very short Bill which would stabilise the position for a period of three years until such <Col N="1132" /> time as the commission's report can be examined and legislation prepared and enacted.  I suggest that that short Bill should provide that a person whose lease falls in will continue under the same conditions and with the same rent for a period of three years and that that will apply whether the lease has expired already or whether it has not so long as that person is in possession of the premises.  If the Minister would do that he would remove a great hardship and put an end to a source of racketeering which is going on with regard to property here in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Obviously in connection with that the question of ground rents must come up.  I understand from Deputy Moran&mdash;I have not the terms of reference before me&mdash;that that has not been referred to the commission.  Perhaps it is just as well, but it should be referred to another commission and should be dealt with very quickly because this matter is becoming a dangerous racket, dangerous to the whole fabric of society.  The creation of new ground rents should be under the most severe restrictions and the old ground rents which are in existence should be dealt with in such a way that the owner of the house would have the right on some reasonable terms of compensation to become absolute owner of his own house.  I do not want to say any more with regard to that matter on this particular Bill, but the Bill does give the opportunity to me to say approximately that much with regard to this serious problem.</P>
    <P>In order that instances of hardship may not continue for the period of two years, a period which the Minister considers is a reasonable period, as I think it is a reasonable period, in which to enable the commission to come to its findings, to enable the Minister to examine these findings and the Government to examine the legislation to be introduced and passed&mdash;and if within that period we can get a rent restrictions code which is fair, reasonable and easily understood, we will have made some progress&mdash;there must be inserted into the Bill a section dealing with furnished lettings.  This matter of the increases a landlord may lawfully claim <Col N="1133" /> requires some slight amendment and there ought to be introduced into this Bill a section which will bring local authority houses, the houses owned by county councils, Dublin Corporation and other authorities, within the scope of the rent restrictions code.  That code does not include them at the moment &mdash; they are expressly excluded&mdash;but very grave cases of hardship are arising day after day because these houses owned by local authorities are not within the legislation.</P>
    <P>Even in Dublin at the moment, under a scheme which is known as a differential rents scheme, the rents of houses which are now 30/- per week are to go up to 36/6.  That could not be done in regard to a letting by a private individual and should not be allowed to happen in regard to a letting by a corporation or other local authority. There are 28,000 houses in Dublin owned by the Dublin Corporation and, within a period of ten years, it is hoped that there will be 50,000 houses in Dublin owned by the Dublin Corporation. It is too much to think that these 50,000 houses would be outside the scope of the Rent Restrictions Acts. On the Housing Bill, I endeavoured to get an amendment through dealing with this matter, and I was told that it was a matter for the Rent Restrictions Bill.  I hope that if I put down an amendment to that effect to this Bill, it will be in order and that it will be accepted, but I ask the Minister to do a little more than he has done in this Bill, that is, to deal in a temporary way with these matters I have mentioned and particularly the rents of furnished houses, the rents of houses built in the past nine years, and other houses which are not within the code at the moment.</P>
    <P>I think that, in a general way, where legislation of this kind is passed by the Dáil which is limited in its existence to a certain period, whatever inquiries or investigations are necessary should be carried out during the period, so that, if amending legislation or new legislation is required, it can be brought in in sufficient time to enable it to be passed into law before the old legislation has ceased to exist through effluxion of time.  That is my great objection to the bringing in of <Col N="1134" /> this Bill at this stage, when we cannot do very much more, because of the necessity of protecting thousands of tenants all over the country, than pass it into law in the short time at our disposal.</P>

      <P>This Bill simply proposes to extend the Rent Restrictions Act for another two years.  I am very sorry indeed that the Minister did not take his courage in his hands and deal with the questions which we all know require amendment.  These are mainly three, as enumerated by previous speakers: furnished flats, tenancies for temporary convenience and houses built since 1941.  If my memory serves me, only a few months after the Minister took office, in reply to questions about furnished flats, he said that legislation was being prepared.  A period of two and a half years has elapsed since then and now a commission has been set up.  I hope this commission is not just a way of shelving a decision on these questions.  I know that it has been said outside that that is so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are probably big difficulties, but, at the same time, this question of furnished flats, in the city of Dublin in particular, is such that the Minister could, by a simple Act, have dealt with the big majority of the grievances which exist.  One meets some appalling cases in connection with furnished flats&mdash;cases of exorbitant rents where a further huge increase is demanded, and people are put out because they simply cannot pay it.  These people are thrown on the roads in these times of scarcity. In addition, I came across a case in which the gas-stove which was supplied fell asunder.  Two experts said that nothing could be done with it, and the landlord, though charging a rent of £260 a year for a three-roomed flat, was not bound to replace it.  The tenant had to pay £20 to replace it, and he went to court to recover it from the landlord and lost his case.  We could deal by simple legislation with a big proportion of the grievances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be other aspects which it <Col N="1135" /> is necessary that a commission or some such body should inquire into, but this question is urgent.  The years are passing by and people are suffering and being forced into a state of financial difficulty from which they will never recover.</P>
    <P>Those people who, unfortunately, have to go into furnished flats are in the position that they will never be able to get a home of their own.  They have no protection whatever from the law.  I think it should not be beyond our ability to pass a simple measure that would help to remedy the grievances from which they suffer.  Such a measure is, to my mind, long overdue. I hope that the Minister, either by an amendment to this Bill or, by immediately bringing in another Bill, will do something to remedy the grievances that I speak of, and at the same time deal with lettings for temporary convenience. I am concerned principally, however, with the position in regard to furnished flats.  I do not think there is any Deputy who is not in agreement with this Bill as far as it goes.  We all know that there is a tremendous necessity for it.  I am sorry the Minister did not go further.  I suggest to him that he should immediately bring in some sort of a Bill that would deal with the main aspects of this question to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the commission to which reference has been made, may I say that I feel precluded from entering into this discussion in the manner that I otherwise would like to?  There is one matter, however, in respect to the working of the commission to which I feel I should, in the interests of the members of that commission, advert at this stage.  The Minister, in his opening statement, said that since the appointment of the commission the members had energetically tackled their work.  I can vouch for that fact.  I want to make this point, that while they have so far held one public session, and propose to hold another public session on Friday next, and notwithstanding the fact that they put their machinery in motion straight away from the time of their appointment by the <Col N="1136" /> issue of the various public notices, etc., the surprising feature is that even the interests which might be regarded as being specially affected have so far shown no great disposition to hurry unduly in the presentation of their case.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that some members of the House have expressed some apprehension as regards delay, so far as the report of the commission is concerned, may I say on behalf of the members of the commission&mdash;I have their authority to say so&mdash;that they are determined that that position will not arise, or that its work will unduly drag on?  As a matter of fact, a decision will be shortly announced by the chairman fixing a time limit for the reception of evidence beyond which it will be deemed to be late. That is as regards the portion of their work which relates to the Rents Acts. I mention that, as a matter of interest, in view of the contributions which have already been made on the Bill. May I say that that decision of the commission is in response to the request of the Minister that they should supply an interim report on the two matters referred to in the terms of reference?  I can safely say, from my short experience, that there is no desire on the part of the chairman, or any member of the commission, to delay unduly their work and that at the first opportunity, consistent with a proper examination of the position within their terms of reference, that report will be supplied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is merely a continuation Bill.  I understand that the Minister, in his opening statement on it, referred to the commission which he recently appointed.  There is one thing that one is tempted to say straight away and it is this.  If there are problems in respect of rents fit to be dealt with by this Bill, the Minister has had almost three years to prepare for them, but, when it comes to the point when he must act, he comes along and he appoints a commission and brings in merely a continuation Bill. That savours very much of evading the issue.  It is another instance of where a problem is being evaded or avoided by passing it over to a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1137" /> There is another more surprising feature about this debate.  It is an extraordinary thing that when the Minister sets up a commission&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy O'Sullivan has left the House&mdash;which, I understand, is answerable to report to him, that one member of that commission gets up to speak on behalf of that commission in the House.  It seems to me that that type of procedure is almost a negation of ordered government.  It seems to me as if the Minister, in common with many of his other colleagues in the Government, is only anxious to disperse or throw away his responsibility and let somebody else shoulder it.  Now this is a very serious matter indeed, because there are many issues arising, and if the Government will not face up to them, if they get into the habit of evading these problems, then some day we may find ourselves faced with a very serious national issue and the Government will funk that as well.</P>
    <P>Let us see what we have in this Bill. Bills were passed dealing with this problem over a large number of years from 1923 on, and indeed, going back to 1920, with the object of trying to restrict or control rents, and at the same time trying to leave to the owners of property some rights.  I am referring to the long series of legislation, known as the old Rent and Mortgage Restrictions Acts of 1923 onwards.  Under that code a huge volume of case law was built up and a huge amount of experience was gained.  That experience, and the problems arising thereunder were examined and marshalled, and the code was revised by a Bill in 1946. In that year another effort was made.  I will admit that there are many things in that code that may need amendment.  The point is this: that it was known that the 1946 Act would automatically come up for review on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Over the past two and a half years, with present conditions and, notably, in the City of Dublin, certain problems have arisen.  I am not going to express my opinion on them at the moment since they do not come up in this Bill.  But there are problems, many of them problems of balance; for instance, the problem of the mechanism provided under that part <Col N="1138" /> of the 1946 Act where application can be made to a district justice in the first instance.  Then there is the question of furnished dwellings, which Deputy Colley mentioned.  All of these things are to some extent urgent, have been known to be urgent and, when it comes to the time for action, we get merely a continuation Bill and a commission without any guarantee as to when these problems are going to be faced up to, if they are to be faced up to at all.</P>
    <P>I do grant the Minister that there are problems there but, while he is Minister, he has the responsibility of making up his mind on these problems and it is highly desirable that he should exercise his powers of decision, even if he is taking a decision that will not satisfy all the parties who are pressing on him in the matter.  As I said, the objectionable thing is that, when the time comes, all we get is a continuation Bill and a commission. Therefore the content of this Bill is such that there is nothing more to be said.  Section 1 merely carries on the Act in operation.  Section 2 amounts merely to carrying on the provisions in respect to lawful additions and Section 3 is merely a question of citation. There is, therefore, nothing in this Bill to deal with the problems mentioned and, then, as I say, we have got this commission.</P>
    <P>It is a surprising thing that Deputy O'Sullivan should speak for the commission here.  I should imagine that, if the commission were to do useful work, all its members would, so to speak, work together, that any announcement would be made through the proper channel and the report made through the proper channel to whatever is the proper reporting authority, which I understand is the Minister.  When that commission has made its finding, there is no obligation on the Minister to accept the finding. Then there will be further time for consideration of it and all that the Minister can hold out for us here is the promise that this matter, like many other serious problems which are before the Government, will be put on the long finger, with perhaps a little bit of bluff that it is being attended to. <Col N="1139" /> While the Minister has had practically three years to consider this problem, we are not a step further on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that this is merely a continuation Bill and that there is a commission in existence charged with the task of advising the Minister as to how the law governing rents of property should be administered. If these circumstances do tend to restrict the scope of the Bill, I cannot say that I agree at all with those Deputies who have suggested that the Minister should rush headlong into introducing new legislative proposals before the commission have delivered their report.  Deputies have suggested that there are certain grievances with regard to lettings for temporary convenience, furnished lettings and houses built since 1941 and that the Minister should introduce legislation immediately on behalf of the tenants.  I think that there is need for considerable caution in dealing with a problem of this kind.  It must be recognised that there is a large variety of circumstances governing the letting of property and quite a large variety of tenants requiring housing accommodation.  There is the tendency to regard all tenants as the very poor.  On the other hand, there is the tendency to describe all householders as landlords, which is a very bad word to describe anyone in this country with this country's history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that there is a very wide variety of houses.  There is slum property which is, practically speaking, unfit for human habitation and which should be let at a very low rent and demolished as soon as it can be replaced by decent housing accommodation. On the other hand, there are good types of dwellings let to tenants who may be in receipt of a fairly good income and who require that type of accommodation.  I do not think that, because there are some people who have to take rooms or apartments and who are very poor, everybody who lets property should be regarded as exploiting the poor.  We have to take a realistic view of this problem and we cannot afford to oversympathise as some Deputies have done <Col N="1140" /> who seem to take the view that there are only two types of people concerned in this whole question, the impoverished tenants who are crowded into, perhaps, unsuitable rooms or apartments and the vicious, avaricious landlords who are exploiting them.</P>
    <P>As we all know, there is, of course, another type of householder and another type of tenant.  There is the householder who may be a comparatively poor person, the householder who may be the widow of some public servant or some businessman who has realised the property left to her and invested the money in an apartment house or in flats for the sole purpose of having an investment to give her a return for her remaining years and enable her to bring up her family.  That type of person must be considered just the same as the tenant who feels that he has a grievance.  You cannot in justice&mdash;and the Minister is the Minister for Justice&mdash;take property from a citizen without compensation and without just reason.  That ought to be clearly emphasised.  I am sure the Minister, who is a broadminded and a fairminded man, will consider every aspect of this question and will not allow himself to be rushed into hasty legislation tightening still further the restriction on people who may be, and who I think are, trying, firstly, to make a modest living for themselves and, secondly, to provide accommodation for any decent section of the community and who are, in addition to that, fulfilling a very useful national need in supplying additional housing accommodation, having regard to the shortage of houses.</P>
    <P>So far as the very poor are concerned, people under a certain level of income, there is only one solution for their problem and that is to build more houses for them as quickly as possible and let them at a reasonable rent.  For those who are perhaps on a higher income level, other accommodation can be provided by private enterprise. People with fairly good positions, whose positions are not perhaps stabilised, who have to travel from place to place and who are not sure where they are going to make their ultimate residence, would appreciate the value of a flat in which to live for a time.  That <Col N="1141" /> accommodation is being provided for them by private enterprise and private enterprise ought to be allowed to fulfil that need, and not be unduly hampered and persecuted.  No Government has the right to deprive a citizen of his property, which he has acquired justly out of his savings.  I think that is one thing that must be clearly recognised and understood.</P>
    <P>In addition, where a citizen enters into a contract with another citizen, with regard to the letting of either a house or portion of a house, it is not justice to set aside that contract without at least consultation with both parties to the contract.  That is again ordinary elementary justice.  If a citizen of this country, perhaps as an investment, provides additional accommodation for other sections of the community by setting his house in flats, he should have the right, subject to reasonable requirements, to recover possession of that house when he requires it, in order to utilise it for some other purpose or even to dispose of it if the purpose for which he has been using it has not proved satisfactory. He would be required, of course, to give ample notice to the tenants, but at least the right of an owner who has invested perhaps all his life savings in a house, to recover possession of it when he requires it, should be recognised and accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The position, as I say, is comparatively simple in this way.  You can deal with the very poor in only one way, by providing housing accommodation for them and providing it as quickly as possible.  With regard to other sections of the community, the duty of the State is to see that there is justice and fair play between one party and the other.  There are two parties to every contract of letting, and both parties have their rights.  The landlord is not always the wealthier or the more powerful of the two parties, and that fact has got to be recognised.  I am sure the Minister will recognise it.</P>
    <P>The owner of a house which is let in flats is obliged to bear the expense of keeping that house in repair.  We all know that the cost of repairs in the last ten years has increased at least threefold.  I think that is a modest <Col N="1142" /> estimate.  Caught between the increasing cost of repairs and a reduction of rent, the owner of the house has no redress.  He is crushed out completely. We all know that this undue restriction on the right to use property of this kind profitably or at least in a way that will avoid loss constitutes a very grave danger.  House property which is used at the present time to accommodate people of the middle classes, people with salaried positions, and people who, for the moment, are not in a position to decide where they will make their permanent residence is a valuable asset to the community. House owners, in supplying this need, are fulfilling a very useful purpose.  It is possible that we may drive them out of existence, or force them to allow their property to fall into decay owing to the cost of repairs, until it becomes a slum property.  I think we have enough slum property in this city at the present time without enlarging the area.  It should be the duty of the Government to protect property which is at present valuable, not alone to the owner but to the type of tenant who requires it and to the city as a whole. I think, in all fairness, the rent should be based on the value of the property. If a house is in a good district, very well constructed and cost a considerable amount of money to purchase, the owner has a right to obtain a rent for that house in proportion to its cost or, alternatively, the amount of money invested by the owner of the house should be ascertained and the rent based on that figure.  That would be fair play.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned those facts for the simple reason that this discussion so far as it has gone seems to have drifted into a representation of the position as if there were only one type of criminals in this country and they were the people who own houses.  I think that is entirely unfair.  As I say, there are many people who have invested all their savings in a modest amount of house property and who depend upon the income from that investment for their livelihood.  For that reason, if for no other, it is essential that we should give this commission an opportunity to consider the whole matter carefully.  For that <Col N="1143" /> reason also, I suggest that there should be no question of rushing through legislation hurriedly without any consideration, simply on the basis that some people or some tenants have a grievance.  We all know that there are tenants who have grievances.  We all know that there are people with grievances amongst every section of the community but the task of the Minister for Justice and of the Government is to see that there is justice and fair play between all sections.</P>
    <P>Before I go further, I should like to say that while I have the deepest respect for the members of the commission which has been appointed I for one do not think that the commission is sufficiently representative to deal with this whole question.  I do not think there is anybody on the commission who has a first-hand, intimate knowledge of the letting of houses even from the point of view of the tenant.  I do not think there is any tenant of a flat, or any owner of house property which is let, on the commission. The commission, therefore, is very restricted, so far as representation is concerned.  I am sure that the members of it, nevertheless, will be exceptionally diligent and conscientious in hearing every side of the case and in weighing the pros and cons very carefully.</P>
    <P>There is one matter which I think the commission must deal with if they are to consider the entire question of lettings and rents, that is, the question of ground rents.  They must advise the Government on that matter. Nothing seems more unjust, to my mind, than that certain persons, by some means, perhaps over a long period, have acquired sites upon which houses stand and, regardless of what amount of money may be invested by the leaseholders in those houses, regardless of any improvements they have done to the buildings, the ground landlords extract their rents.  Further, I think it is wrong that we should go on allowing people who know that certain land has a potential value as building sites to acquire that land and then to charge high rents for it.  First <Col N="1144" /> of all, the Government should stabilise the value of land that is acquired as building sites.  They should let all concerned know that, from now on, land will have nothing more than its agricultural value and if anyone purchases land at a high price as a speculation, knowing that the community requires it for housing, he can suffer the loss. Warning should be given in time that that type of speculation will not yield profits in future.</P>
    <P>All credit should be given to people who provide accommodation by building houses.  These people are doing a national service.  The people who acquire building sites and who hold the public to ransom are like the landlords of old and are simply exploiting the progressive efforts of the community.</P>
    <P>When we are dealing with a matter of this kind we must be just and fair to everyone.  I do not see why the unfortunate private person who has built a house or has purchased a house and has spent large sums in improving it should be brought into court and have his income halved or reduced to one-third while there is no power under existing legislation to fix fair rents for houses that are owned by the corporation or by local authorities. Why the distinction?  Where is the difference?</P>
    <P>Now we are getting into a very serious and contentious matter. Apparently, it is the view of those innocent people who draft legislation that the private individual can do great wrong to his neighbour but that the democratically elected local authority can do no wrong and is infallible. There is just as much danger that a city corporation or local council can rob their tenants just as a private houseowner can rob his tenants.  We cannot have one law for one section and another law for another section. The fact that people are elected to a local council does not mean that they acquire the quality of infallibility.  I know that tenants have been gravely wronged in houses owned by local authorities.  They have been wronged in many cases because their houses have been badly built, because they have not been repaired when repair <Col N="1145" /> was necessary, and because of unfair rents, cases of which a number of Deputies have cited.</P>
    <P>The whole question of differential rents opens an avenue for grave injustice towards one tenant as against another.  A local council may claim that one tenant has a certain high income and that tenant may be asked for a very high rent, while another tenant who, perhaps, has a higher income but who has a &ldquo;pull&rdquo; with the local authority, may get away with a lower rent.  If the individual who owns a house and rents it or portion of it is to be dragged before a court for the purpose of having a fair rent fixed, there should be the same right to bring the local authority before the court if a tenant feels that he has a grievance.  The tenant of a local authority should have the same rights as the tenant of a private individual.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House. I think I have said enough to indicate that there are two sides to this question, just as there are two sides to every question.  It is essential that the Minister and the commission of inquiry should hear both sides of the question and should give a fair decision based upon Christian justice. Their recommendations should be fair, reasonable and constructive.</P>
    <P>If the suggestion which I have put forward, that rents should be based on valuation, is accepted, it will be a step in the right direction.  Another step in the right direction would be to ensure that any person who has invested money in a house, who has purchased it or improved it and who may require it, should be facilitated in doing so.  In the same way, if an owner of a house is afflicted with an unsatisfactory tenant who is, perhaps, using portion of the house for an illegal or undesirable purpose, the owner should have adequate rights to obtain possession.</P>
    <P>There will be no injustice to anyone if we ensure that there is always a reserve of housing accommodation.  That is the one big task that faces the Government.  It would be the greatest solution of the whole problem.  Build more houses.  Build them quickly.  Let them at a fair rent.  Then you can <Col N="1146" /> afford, perhaps, to be more fair and just to those who are fulfilling a useful purpose by letting houses or portion of houses to their neighbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I always listen with a great deal of interest to Deputy Cogan when he speaks on matters pertaining to agriculture, but I am rather disappointed at the state of confusion into which he has allowed himself to be dragged in approaching this small Bill. As one of the leaders of the ratepayers of Ireland, some of whom are house owners but most of whom are occupants of houses, he should have known a little more about the matter than his intervention in this debate would indicate.  Deputy Cogan, when winding up his speech, suggested to the Minister that house owners who have rented houses to tenants who use the premises for illegal purposes should be given some protection.  They have that protection.  Under the law as it stands if a person gets a house to live in and if he uses it for an illegal purpose, the owner has no trouble in getting back that house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no use in trying to make this two-sided question a hundred-sided question.  The Deputy confuses the person who owns a house with the person who acquires land in order to make it available for house building, and then he tried to bring in ground rents.  This Bill deals with extending legislation that was recently amended for another period until such time as the commission that is now sitting will bring forward its recommendations. Of course, the Minister must be given some time to study the recommendations and discuss them with other members of the Government.  I venture to suggest that the legislation now in operation will again have to be extended because it is quite obvious to me that this matter is so involved that the commission's recommendations cannot be adopted just off the bat any more than the recommendations of other commissions have been adopted by any Government to which they were submitted.  It is obvious that the recommendations of any commission cannot be adopted <i>in toto</i> because it is the responsibility of the Government to make up their minds about what <Col N="1147" /> legislation they think should be enacted.</P>
    <P>I have one grievance against this Bill.  When the Minister's attention was drawn to certain abuses&mdash;Section 2 of this measure sets out to correct certain of those abuses&mdash;in record time he brought in an amendment which to a great extent remedied the trouble. These abuses, if they were allowed to go on unfettered, would unquestionably have caused a great deal of distress amongst different sections of the community. They were, I might say, deliberately calculated.  While the amendment which was brought in does a great deal, I am not quite satisfied that it goes the whole way.</P>
    <P>I believe the best intentions are expressed in Section 2, but I think it is possible for this to happen, that where the landlord, during the period 1950-51 or 1951-52, expends an amount in excess of two-thirds of the basic rent of controlled premises in putting them into a reasonable state of repair, a sum calculated in accordance with the scale comes into operation. Now, Deputy Cogan seems to think that every rack-renting landlord who came along, took a virgin site and built a house there out of kindness of heart to accommodate unfortunate people who had not a dwelling, should be regarded as a pioneer and a good angel.  In Dublin City we have a great number of persons or firms who made a business of acquiring old, dilapidated buildings, places that we might describe as tenements, slums, purely for the purpose of getting the biggest return they possibly could get out of what might be regarded in all fairness and justice as a very small investment. Such people were cashing in up to quite recently on the absolute hardship of persons for whom adequate housing was not otherwise available.</P>
    <P>The legislation which seeks to remedy that particular type of grievance does not, in my opinion, go far enough.  Perhaps the commission will find a way of dealing with it, but I was hoping, now that the Minister has had time to reflect on this matter, that he would go somewhat further.  I give him all praise and every credit for coming to the rescue as soon as this matter <Col N="1148" /> was brought to his notice, but I believe there is room for improvement.  A number of premises were allowed to get into such a state that in order to get an increased rent or to get possession of the premises the owners found ways and means, by allowing dilapidations to develop, of spending such a substantial sum that they were able to increase the rent to such a figure that the person in occupation could not possibly afford it and he had to get out.</P>
    <P>Now we have a scale.  I am now talking of the older type of house and I want the persons in occupation to have some line of defence which would not be costly and which would not mean having to go to court.  They should have some line in the shape of an officer of the local authority who would carefully examine the building and decide on what would be essential to put it in proper repair.  Then if the landlord spent any further money he would have it on his own head and he could not impose it on the tenant. While the present scale has to a very great extent helped in protecting persons in occupation, there is still room for evasions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan has told us of people who, through goodness of heart, went in for building houses.  Does he not know that houses built since 1941 are not under the Rent Restrictions Act? There is no use in the Deputy singing a song about those people or trying to exaggerate their position.  They have had a fairly good run and I believe at some future date the Act will have to be extended to cover houses built after a certain period.  At the present time the Rent Restriction Act affects only houses built up to 1941.  Rent restriction of some kind or other is essential, imperative.  Arising from the control exerted over people who are owners of property certain new practices have developed.  References have been made to the type of landlord who escapes control by setting a furnished flat.  At the moment we are becoming very flat-minded.  Those who have experience of local authorities know that side by side with the erection of houses it is a great benefit to many people to have flats constructed.</P>
    <P>The furnished flat that is intended in <Col N="1149" /> the Act to be free from control is quite different from the furnished flat where some landlord manages to shove in a chair or a rickety table into portion of a premises or a series of rooms and makes the unfortunate tenant, who cannot qualify for a local authority house, sign a document indicating that he is in fact getting a furnished flat.  I hope this commission will inquire into that. That problem alone is an important one and I am sorry that the Minister has not seen fit to introduce some immediate protection for the tenant of that type of landlord.  Two years is not a very long period when one is dealing with a controversial and many-sided matter.  This is not a two-sided question, as Deputy Cogan seemed to think.  For a tenant who is living from day to day and week to week in these types of tenancies, a period of two years is a long period.  He does not want relief in two, three or four years. He wants it now.  The Minister did make some effort recently to bring about some improvement in a matter which might have created a very serious problem and I am sorry that he has not seen fit to make some attempt to remedy this grievance.</P>
    <P>I would like him to reconsider the schedule of the rent increase permitted. I would like to have seen some definite machinery laid down under which the tenant could make some appeal for protection.  Listening to Deputy Cogan speaking, one would think that local authorities built houses for the purpose of profit-making.  If he had any experience of the City of Dublin or Cork he would know that the building of houses by local authorities is a great boon for the majority of our people because they are themselves indirectly at once the landlords and the occupiers of their own premises.</P>
    <P>The houses which are subsidised by the State and the local authority belong to the ratepayers.  Differential rents are quite a different matter from what Deputy Cogan appears to think. These rents are for the purpose of giving power to the local authority to give relief to a family which may have suffered the loss of its main breadwinner and is thereby unable to pay the rent that was fixed.  These rents <Col N="1150" /> are to meet the altered circumstances of the occupiers of local authority houses; they are not for the purpose of inflicting a higher rent on a particular family because of improved family conditions. I have discussed this matter with all kinds of people.  I have discussed it with those who are against it. I have discussed it with those who do not understand it.  I have discovered that the ordinary worker and the ordinary tradesman, whether skilled or unskilled, is much more agreeable that his neighbour should be helped in distress rather than objecting to the principle of the differential rent.  In the main, objection to that particular form of rent does not come from the occupiers of the houses.  It comes from those who are anxious to find an axe to grind and who are not for the most part tenants of local authority houses.</P>
    <P>Is it possible to appeal to the Minister even now to emulate his former action?  Will he tell us that he will look into the matter again and reconsider it?  He may be able to consider strengthening what he believes to be a step in the right direction towards giving adequate protection to the type of person to whom I have referred by extending the amendment made to the Act of 1946.</P>
    <P>I hope the commission will not be long in making its findings.  Its task is not an easy one.  It is not easy to please everybody.  There are many people who want rent restrictions removed altogether and who would prefer to see rents taking their normal course.  Perhaps in ten years time when another 30,000 houses have been built and circumstances generally will have improved it may be possible to say &ldquo;O-kay&rdquo;.  But we are living in an age of such uncertainty that we do not know from day to day, or week to week how world affairs will react upon us.  I believe that we shall always have to have some form of control in the future on all essentials.  The occupation of a house is an essential in the life of any individual or any family.</P>
    <P>If the Minister cannot reconsider this matter, would he consider the setting up of a small committee of the House in an effort to improve further the improvement he has already made in the 1946 Act?</P>

      <P>Deputy Briscoe would seem to convey that the workers generally are not opposed to the differential rent scheme.  In Cork we have a number of tenants who were charged what was calculated to be the economic rent some years ago.  When the differential scheme was introduced their rents were raised by 4/-, 5/-, 6/- or 7/-, an increase calculated on the increased income coming into the home.  In that way the burden of the differential rent is confined to the tenants of the actual houses.  It is not carried by the community as a whole. That provides a nice point for study and I hope the commission will consider the matter because if we have a differential rent scheme, I believe that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister to be very careful not to repeat mistakes that have been made already.  Although it may be done with the best intention, it may produce results altogether unexpected and altogether contrary to what he may hope his action would have.  My experience has been that the Rent Acts have been designed very largely in favour of the tenant.  That was very good and I was very glad when it was being done and I think nearly everyone was glad, too; but in actual result these Acts have hit nobody harder than the tenants themselves.  They have hit the man who cannot afford to buy a house and cannot afford to build a house, the man who must try to get some shelter for rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already the restrictions have hit landlords to such an extent that very few landlords will build houses for rent at all, and if a house that a landlord has rented happens to become vacant, he immediately puts it up for sale.  It is because people cannot get <Col N="1153" /> a home of their own that they are seeking flats.  Now, it has been suggested to the Minister here to-night to be more severe on those who are letting flats.  You cannot easily get a house to rent at present&mdash;some people say you cannot get them for love or money &mdash; but if the Minister goes too far with regard to flats, you will not get a flat for love or money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Butler</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that there should not be control, but I am suggesting that the Minister should be careful not to go too far in his desire&mdash;and the desire of everyone in the House&mdash;to be in favour of the tenant.  A great many people are forced to set part of their houses, owing to various reasons&mdash;deflation in money, the higher cost of living, which has been rising for many years, and so on&mdash;but they do it at great sacrifice, and if it is made not worth their while to do it there will be a housing hunger which will be much more intense than anything we have experienced up to the present.  That will occur if the Minister is not careful.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this debate has toned down a little from the opening quarter.  I had a look at myself to see if I could recognise myself from the description given by a member now sitting in the Front Bench of the Opposition.  However, I am glad to see that reason has prevailed in the various benches since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a continuing Bill, as has been properly explained.  I could have taken the simple expedient of including it in the Expiring Laws Bill and let it go through without any shouting about it at all, but I took the democratic way of bringing in a Bill&mdash;showing what I was doing&mdash;and I think that was the correct step to take.  I am told that any schoolboy knows what to do, and that if the Minister were even a good schoolboy he could bring in a Bill here to-day that would wipe out all the <Col N="1154" /> difficulties.  Of course, it could only be a half schoolboy who would make such a statement.  Deputy Butler and Deputy Briscoe have pointed out that there are difficulties.  If I were a dictator and not a Minister subject to a democratic Parliament, I could bring in a Bill saying that such and such was the law, and that that was all about it; but I did not, I set up a commission to try to find out the facts.</P>
    <P>You may blame me for the delay in setting up that commission, but in defence I want to say that there were the 1923 and the 1926 Rent Restrictions Acts to be considered, and then there was the 1946 Act also.  As Deputy de Valera pointed out, a great amount of case law had been built up by 1946 and they had the experience of the working of the 1923 and 1926 Acts, yet what did we find in 1948?  When I was only three months a Minister, there was such a grave omission found in the 1946 Act that we had nearly to steamroll a Bill through the House.  I had clear evidence from the members of the House and from the Seanad that such a situation had arisen.  I did not fail to act then, and I must say that the House did not fail to give me the necessary support to put it through &mdash; and that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>This commission is going to inquire into the whole working of the Rent Restrictions Acts, to see how far they require amendment.  Listening to the various speeches here to-night you can see all the points of view that can be expressed and will be expressed before that commission.  It is quite true that I may not, and the Government may not, take the findings of the commission. If not, what is the position?  The good Act which the previous Government passed four years ago will still be in operation and nobody means to say that the previous Government were such duds that they brought in a Bill which had to be amended overnight. The 1946 Act should be a firstclass Act because, as Deputy Major de Valera said, they had experience of all the shortcomings and failings of the 1923 and 1926 Acts.  That being so, when it has its shortcomings it is quite obvious that the only proper way to settle the matter was by a commission, and I think I got a good commission. <Col N="1155" /> They are people of experience&mdash;and I do not think they want any recommendation from me&mdash;who are interested and who will give us an early report. All I have done is to extend this for two years as a minimum.  I hope to have whatever legislation is necessary put through the House before that time.  If I wanted to give effect to my own view I could do it but I could make as big blunders as the previous Administration did.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the ground rents problem.  Strictly speaking, as such it is not referred to the commission, but the commission is empowered to inquire into that aspect of the ground rents problem which is covered by Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, that is to say, the conditions upon which expiring leases may be renewed and new ground rents fixed under the fresh leases.  I know that certain leaseholders' representatives are quite satisfied that this aspect of the problem is being inquired into.</P>

I could make all the laws you liked and yet if I wanted to set a plot of land for some fellow to build a house at so much per annum we would find a way to do it and ground rents would start again.</P>

      <P>If I gave expression to my own views who knows what I would do?  Having some experience of ground rent landlords, I say that it would not be in their interest if I were a member of the commission as I might be so prejudiced against them.  Therefore it is a good thing that I am not. <Col N="1156" /> I will try to approach this matter in the most unprejudiced manner possible and I will try to live up to the tradition of the Department of Justice of being fair to every citizen of the State.  There are two sides to the question.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I should follow all the points.  Deputy Butler speaking of the furnished flats question has put his finger on the point: very few speculative builders will build houses to-day. If we go too far with the furnished flats question we could reach the same situation.</P>

      <P>The question of furnishing is one, I think, on which we could lay down conditions.  It is a matter that could easily be effected. There are aspects of it that require consideration.</P>
      <P>I have had no complaint on the question of the 1949 Amending Act and Deputy Briscoe's point this evening that it is not extensive enough came rather as a surprise to me.  I would suggest to Deputy Briscoe that that is a matter which he should bring to the notice of the commission and the same thing applies to what was said by Deputy Captain Cowan and by another Deputy who made a point upon the Landlord and Tenant Acts about furnished flats and dwellings. There is a responsibility on Deputies of the House who have information to bring it to the notice of the commission. In that way, I think we will be able to get a rent restriction code that will be equitable to every section of the community.</P>
      <P>People are described as landlords who are not landlords.  I think it is not a fair name to give them.  You have landlords, as has been said, like the widow of a civil servant who set her house as she was not able to keep it.  She had to go back to her people and as she did not want to sell the house she let it.  She had only one house and by the longest stretch of the imagination you could not describe her as a landlord.  Yet she comes into the category of landlords.</P>

      <P>I would say that she is an owner of a house.  I would describe her by that simple word &ldquo;owner&rdquo;.  She was trying to conserve for herself and her family whatever stocks had been built up for her by her husband.  She had either to sell or let her house and yet she comes into the same category as Dublin Corporation. She is looked on as a landlord and you would be surprised at the otherwise charitably-minded people who would describe her almost as public enemy No. 1 because she tried to get a reasonable rent for the house she was letting.</P>
      <P>On the question of Dublin Corporation houses, I will include them with pleasure but I do not suppose that I would be let go very far with it.  Again, that is a matter that should be referred to the commission.  I do not want the commission to be cluttered up with too much work.  I have referred enough to them but at the same time, as the Dublin Corporation is one of the biggest landlords in the country &mdash;I think you could describe them in that way because they certainly own a few houses&mdash;I think that they should not be excluded altogether from the rent restriction conditions as they are generally at the moment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 3, Section 4, to delete sub-section (3) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  The Minister may, by Order, remove a member from office for stated misconduct or incapacity and shall lay such Order before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1161" /> On Committee Stage, I accepted an amendment by Deputy Lemass, which, I think, required redrafting, inasmuch as the warrant for appointment given to each member provided that a member could be removed from office only for stated misconduct or incapacity, but not otherwise.  The amendment which I now move safeguards that position and also includes that portion of his amendment which Deputy Lemass wanted to include, providing that any Order under the sub-section will be laid on the Table of each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is, of course, something more than a drafting amendment here.  The amendment which the Minister accepted in Committee gave him the right to remove a member of this authority from office for stated reasons.  The Bill, as introduced here, or as it will appear if this further amendment is accepted, limits the power of the Minister to the removal of a member of the authority for stated misconduct or incapacity.  I argued in favour of the amendment which the Parliamentary Secretary accepted on the ground that the Minister or the Government should have the power of removing from membership of the authority a member who was found to be incompetent, and I do not think that incompetence could be described as incapacity or misconduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is unwise to tie his own hands, or to attempt to tie the hands of his successor, by restricting the provisions of this sub-section.  There have been other statutes which gave Ministers power to appoint members to boards, and none of them was as restrictive in this regard as it is proposed to make this Bill.  It may be in the Government's view desirable, because of the opposition which has been expressed in this Bill from this side of the House, to give these nominees of theirs the security of civil servants for the period of years mentioned in the Bill, but it is establishing a new precedent which is, from every point of view, undesirable.  Members have been removed from office on statutory boards for reasons other than misconduct or incapacity, and it is unlikely <Col N="1162" /> that any Government which found it was getting bad service from any such board or felt that public mischief was being done by the activities of members of this board, would be deterred from making changes by a provision of this kind in the legislation.  It would be forced to make these changes, and the only effect of having this safeguard in the Bill would be to put them under obligation to make some payment in compensation to those whom, for good reasons, they thought fit to remove.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I am right in believing that I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say that the reason he was unable to leave sub-section (3) in the Bill in the form in which it stands is that the warrants of appointment already given to the members of the authority limit the power of the Minister to remove them to circumstances in which misconduct or incapacity could be shown.  If that is so, I would protest strongly against any warrant having been issued to anybody to act on this authority in advance of the enactment of the legislation setting it up.  No warrant issued by the Minister to a member of the Industrial Development Authority, as such, can have any binding force yet, and will not have any binding force until this Bill becomes law, and then only when issued under the provisions of the Bill. I do not think it is right that the Dáil should be put in this position that, because the Government has already, without statutory authority, appointed certain individuals upon certain terms, we are bound to accept their appointment and terms without question when the Bill comes before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that this Industrial Development Authority was set up in rather unusual circumstances. Normally, when people are appointed to public boards even if there is a change of Government, they are not removed until their terms of appointment fall in.  It is undoubtedly difficult to oppose the view of the Deputy and the Opposition that this safeguard is required.  On the other hand, the phrase &ldquo;for stated reasons&rdquo; which in effect, means for no reason, would entitle the Minister to remove a member <Col N="1163" /> of the authority.  But, even if the same Minister changed his mind and were to say that he was not specifying a reason, that, normally, would not be accepted as a cogent reason for a change of that sort.  The amendment which I have moved, if it does not meet the Deputy in full, meets, I think, the main point in the amendment that he moved in Committee.</P>

      <P>(2)  A witness shall not under any circumstances be called upon to disclose any particulars which would involve the divulging of secret manufacturing processes or recipes or of methods peculiar to the particular undertaking of such witness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment meets, I think, amendment No. 9 which appeared on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Dockrell.  The Deputy submitted the same amendment on the Committee Stage, and put it down again for Report.  It provided that a witness should not disclose any particulars which would involve the divulging of secret manufacturing processes, or recipes, or methods peculiar to the particular undertaking of such witness. As the section was originally drafted, it might have involved particular technical processes or knowledge which were peculiarly the property of an individual manufacturer being made public in circumstances which might not in any way assist the inquiry in hand, and yet might seriously injure that manufacturer in competition with other people in the same line of business.  For these reasons, amendment No. 10 which is moved to meet amendment No. 9, provides that a witness shall not be called upon under any circumstances <Col N="1164" /> to disclose particulars which he regards as secret or possessing particular value to the undertaking in question.</P>

      <P>This amendment is to meet a point which was raised by Deputy Lemass on the Committee Stage concerning officers of the Industrial Development Authority who are not civil servants, in the event of such being appointed. It provides that they will be liable in respect of any wrongful disclosure of information obtained by them in the course of their duties.

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I made in my opening remarks was to the effect that the best presentation of the case for the half-holiday for agricultural workers should be made on the basis of ethics and morals rather than on the basis of economics.  I do not mean by that that it was unnecessary or inadvisable to give an answer in economic terms or from an economic viewpoint to the various objections to the provisions of the Bill raised by Deputy Cogan.  I propose to deal with some of these points raised by him in the best manner possible.  The Bill being one on which a free vote will be taken, one whose passage we hope to secure by appealing to the individual consciences of the progressive members of this House, it does behove those who are supporting the Bill to give the answer, if answer there be, to every question and every objection raised by those who start off in opposition to the Bill.  I trust that we can appeal even <Col N="1166" /> to Deputy Cogan, rather I would say advisedly to Deputy Cogan, Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy P.D. Lehane at least to moderate their objections. Perhaps in the end, as is often the case, those who start out in opposition to an idea may become its most brilliant advocates.</P>
      <P>It would perhaps be difficult to perceive such a change as that in Deputy Cogan, but we need not necessarily give up hope.  There are certain reasonable arguments put forward by the Deputy, and, if we can answer them in a manner that might appeal to his intelligence, as I am sure they do appeal to his sense of social justice, he may permit his opposition to lapse; he may join with us for the sake at least of the sentiments he expressed as a small farmer when he recorded that he had the deepest sympathy with the agricultural workers.  He might permit the Bill to advance to a further stage, to pass its Second Reading with his help, and we might then get to work on the Committee Stage to remove what fears he may entertain and the fears that are entertained by Deputy O'Reilly as to the extra burden imposed on the small farmers, on the difficulties that the small farmers who employ labour have in being crushed between the upper and the nether mill-stone, as Deputy O'Reilly stated.  We might remove these objections, we might mitigate the effects and make it possible, with the goodwill and the co-operation which these Deputies ask for and advocate as between the farm labourer and the farmer, to have a better understanding which would lead to an increase in agricultural productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine the terms of the amendment.  The terms of the amendment are of a conditional nature.  I fail, however, to find concretely expressed the nature of the condition which Deputy Cogan incorporates in his amendment.  He states that this Bill should not pass pending a substantial increase in the net agricultural income and in the volume of agricultural output.  That is an extremely vague amendment and perhaps there might be an opportunity to clarify some of the points in it.  The actual words there, &ldquo;substantial increase&rdquo;, <Col N="1167" /> would require to be made much more definite and precise, because were Deputy Cogan the Minister for Agriculture, and were his views to obtain endorsement by this House and the House suspended the operations of this Bill until there was a substantial increase, we might be at variance with Deputy Cogan in his position as Minister as to the exact meaning of &ldquo;substantial&rdquo;.  A 5 per cent. increase might appear very substantial to us, but a 10 per cent. increase might mean very little to him.</P>
    <P>The figures are rather difficult to obtain, but we will go into them later. From them it would appear that there is an upward trend in the volume of agricultural output compared with the basic period of 1939 that the Deputy quoted.  What is to be the determining factor in deciding when he will permit a half-holiday on the basis of that increase is not clear at all.  In other words, Deputy Cogan fails to indicate the standard or the criterion on which he would base the withdrawal of his opposition.  As reported in column 844, Volume 123, of the Official Report, he objects to this Bill on the general principle that it extends still further the principles of compulsion to the agricultural community. That is the purpose of every Bill in regard to some section or other of the community.  The State is an executive organ.  It exercises compulsion. The most harmless law passed in this House has the effect of compulsion.  We all use in this period of civilisation all these forms of compulsion, whether they relate to the regulation of traffic or to our respect for our neighbour's life and property.</P>
    <P>We saturated the citizens of the State with all types of compulsion and, therefore, on that general principle I think that Deputy Cogan is not on very good ground.  He himself is a legislator and the purpose of legislation, and his purpose in enacting it here is to extend compulsion.</P>
    <P>Compulsion to the agricultural community is no new thing.  The most benign and beneficent Minister for Agriculture, be he Deputy Smith, Deputy Dillon or Deputy Hogan, <Col N="1168" /> would have in the ordinary routine, apart from any emergency, to impose certain restrictions and to see that certain laws and regulations were carried out by the agricultural community. Every employer in the State, in particular every employer in the industrial and commercial sphere, is subject to this principle of compulsion and Deputy Cogan has failed to establish a case why the agricultural community should be immune from it.  He laments that under the Bill inspectors charged with carrying out its provisions will dictate to the farmer, having crossed his fence, which appears to be an unforgivable sin to the farming mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>And to the Minister. It appears to be an unforgivable sin that he should dictate to the farmer the number of hours of work he is to operate.  In actual fact, of course, if we obtain the goodwill, co-operation and common understanding between the workers and the farmers which Deputy Cogan just as ardently desires as I do myself, there should be, and there would be, very little of the inspection nuisance, no more than there is in the industrial field.</P>
      <P>Industrial workers have not only a half-holiday laid down by the law but in many industries they work only a five-day week.  This latitude has been achieved either by legislation or by trade union negotiation and I think that there are very few cases on record where inspectors were necessary to compel employers, once they had agreed on such general principles as these, to carry out the law or the agreement as the case may be.  I think, therefore, that there is very little substance in the first point made against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point that Deputy Cogan makes is that it will impose an extra charge on each farmer of 5/- per week or £13 a year.  Deputy Cogan, as reported in column 842, stated that the Bill if enacted will provide that each farmer&mdash;I presume each farmer employing labour&mdash;will have to make a minimum sacrifice of at least £13 a <Col N="1169" /> year or 5/- a week.  Then he goes into a calculation, spread over the whole industry, of what this would cost the agricultural industry per annum.  I am at a loss to follow his figures or his reasoning there.  I think myself his misconception has been caused by the very bad drafting of one sub-section of the Bill, a sub-section that I myself imagined, after I read it, would have the same result as Deputy Cogan thought.  That is sub-section (2) in which it is stated that an agricultural employer, who is required under the previous sub-section to allow a weekly half-holiday to an agricultural worker, shall be required &ldquo;to pay to the worker in respect of such half-holiday a sum not less than the equivalent of four hours' pay at the ordinary wage rate.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I understand from an explanation given to me by Deputy Dunne, that while he objected to the form of that sub-section, the drafting office considered that that was the way the section must be framed in order to safeguard, in a legal way, this right to a half-holiday.  It would convey, to our ordinary minds, that this is an extra imposition, as Deputy Cogan would say, of 5/- a week on the farmer, but it is not.  It does not mean that farmers will increase their expenses on wages by 5/- per man per week or £13 per year.  What it means, if I understand the Bill aright, is that it prevents farmers who grant farm labourers a four-hour half-holiday, from paying those labourers for 50 hours for the working week.  It compels them, in other words, to pay a full week's wages as at present existing before the implementation of this Bill. There will be no increase whatsoever in the wages account of the farmer as a result of this Bill.  It means, however, that farm labourers who benefit by this Bill shall have to perform in 50 hours what they now do in 54 hours. That degree of intensification of labour is by no means impossible or difficult.  This connotes an increase, an intensification, of labour of the order of 8 per cent.  It means that when the agricultural labourers enjoy the provisions of this Bill, they will have to work only one-twelfth harder or more <Col N="1170" /> intensely than they do at present and still maintain the agricultural output, about which Deputy Cogan is worried, at the same level as it stands to-day. In other words, if they work harder for five minutes in every hour there will be no diminution in the agricultural output, and if they work harder for six minutes there will be a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>That is the way any industrial capitalist would view the matter.  Labour is forced to work harder, to be more intensified, to be better organised, to have its time used in a better manner than heretofore.  If that is possible of accomplishment in all other industries, it is also possible of accomplishment in the agricultural industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite possible that their labour should be so organised that they could do more in the 50 hours that would then be available, whether the weather was wet or dry, than they do in the 54 hours that are now available to them.  If they are denied the benefits of this Bill, is not it commonsense that, with the frustration and disappointment they will feel, the farm labourers will not be inclined to work 54 hours in the 54 hours? There is a very old Scotch habit of &ldquo;ca' canny.&rdquo;  If you want goodwill, if you want co-operation between the farmers and farm labourers, farmer Deputies would be well advised to accede to the terms of this Bill so that, despite the pessimism of Deputy Corry and Deputy Maguire, they may try the possibility of getting the farm labourers to work, within the scope of the present employment, dry weather or wet, multifarious as their duties may be, in order to increase agricultural productivity.</P>
      <P>The Legislature that has the courage to carry this Bill and to enact a half-holiday for farm labourers will be pleasantly surprised at the increased production, as every understanding Minister for Agriculture could verify.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan, in further support of that objection of his, thinks that the net result of this would burden the agricultural community with an extra <Col N="1172" /> £1,500,000.  As I have shown, there will be no increase in the outlay for wages.  There will be no increase, whether the farmers or the labourers intensify their productivity or not.  It is difficult to see where Deputy Cogan obtains his figures.  I tried to obtain from the Taoiseach, by way of Parliamentary Question, figures relevant to this case.  In reply, the Taoiseach gave the information that the total number of farmers who employ labour was 47,000, roughly, according to the census of population, 1946.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to find out the number of small farmers whose case was very ably presented by Deputy O'Reilly, who employ one labourer, in order to contrast that number with the number of farmers who employ six labourers or more.  It appears that there is a defect in our present census statistics, as there is no such information available. As there is to be a census taken in a short time, I suggest that it might include, in its assessment of the agricultural community, some information as to the number of employers in the agricultural community and the extent of the employment.  It is a matter on which there have been merely wild guesses.  Those who have some knowledge of agriculture estimate this number variously but it would be as well to have actual figures.  Without these figures, we are led by Deputy O'Reilly into the complaint, if you like, that the major part of agricultural output is produced by unpaid family labour.</P>
    <P>The Deputy declared that the bulk of agricultural production is the result of unpaid family labour.  If that is so, and I assume it is correct, from what figures I can take out, it is not a complaint at all; it is the result of the natural fact that there are so many more farmers, farmers' sons and daughters and relatives employed on the land than there are farm labourers. According to the census figures, the total number of farmers' sons and daughters so employed is 191,300 and the total number of other relatives is 52,700, so that the total number of farmers and family workers is 397,000 males and 106,000 females&mdash;in other words, a total labour force of about 500,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1173" /> As against that, the total number of farm labourers at the time of the taking of the census was about 140,000. How could anyone imagine that 140,000 farm labourers, most of them until recently underpaid and many of them without the amenities and advantages of other workers, could produce anything like the same volume of production as the 500,000 farmers and their relatives?  It is impossible even to imagine.  If the bulk of agricultural production is the result of the work of this labour force of 500,000 unpaid family labour, then it follows that the effect of this Bill in the matter of production will be very little.  According to the opponents of the scheme, the volume of agricultural production depends on the farmers' sons and daughters and their other relatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In arranging things for that line of argument, one must take into consideration the need of a farm of reasonable size on which the farmer and his family can make a decent living; one must also consider uneconomic holdings and the difference in various pieces of land.  When you set out to make provision for these things, you will find the scheme is impossible and absurd and very unjust to the greater number of people who are in poor circumstances.  Obviously the Deputy has not considered the scheme fully at all.  He should take these factors into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the House to consider those figures as an answer to the contention of Deputy Maguire.  There are 503,000 farmers, farmers' wives, sons, daughters and other relatives, and that makes up the bulk of the labour force in agriculture. The number of agricultural labourers is around 100,000, I am told; it has diminished since the census figures; it has diminished owing to the flight from the land and the worsened conditions the farm labourers are enduring, and also to the fact that they have not a half-holiday.  One way of looking at the matter is that the farmers and their relatives have a labour force five times as great as farm labourers.  I suggest, therefore, that the half-holiday will not materially affect the bulk of the 500,000 and it cannot <Col N="1174" /> adversely affect, as Deputy Cogan appears to think, productivity in the agricultural field.</P>
      <P>I am trying to build up a logical case in reply to Deputy Cogan.  It appears to me that, so far as some of the Opposition Deputies are concerned, logic was not taught in their schools. They base their opposition to this Bill on their knowledge of agriculture and they assume that no one has any knowledge of those matters unless he be a farmer.  Everyone in Ireland is not very far removed from some agricultural past.  Whether you are a farmer or a farm labourer, it is quite possible to understand the points of a case presented in a logical manner and to follow them as logically as they are put.  The point Deputy Cogan made about the extra impost on the farming community is without foundation.  If anything, it is based on a misrepresentation, a misunderstanding or, if you like, a misinterpretation of the sub-section.  The farmers who employ labour number 47,000; that is the total number affected, not the 503,000 farmers with their sons, daughters and relatives.</P>
      <P>If the reply of the Taoiseach is correct, this Bill will affect 50,000 farmers, not many more, and it would not cost them one red penny, to use Deputy Cogan's term, by way of increase in their outlay upon wages. Also, it may not put one red halfpenny in the pockets of the agricultural workers.  That is one of the objections Deputy Cogan had to this Bill.  He says he would prefer that the agricultural workers' income, which is admittedly low, should be increased or that means should be found for increasing it rather than that we should take up time on the question of extending his leisure hours. That, too, appears to me to be an objection that is purely frivolous.  It is merely a device for side-stepping the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention of this Bill is not directly to benefit the farm labourers or to mulct the farmers by one red halfpenny, and it will not do that.  The intention of the Bill is to improve the amenities of the farm labourers and to give them more leisure.  The intention of the Bill is to give them time, if they <Col N="1175" /> so desire, in which they can do those things that Deputy Cogan advised the farmers to help them to do.  That is a matter I shall deal with later. Deputy Cogan puts forward quite a number of excellent ways in which the farmers can help the farm labourers in the latter's present rather straitened circumstances.  It is quite obvious that if the farmers are to implement the wishes of Deputy Cogan and adopt that form of co-operation that he desires by helping the farm labourers to till their plots and do for them the work that they should do for themselves and their families, this could be done to far better advantage by an extension of the free time of the farm labourers.</P>
    <P>If the farm labourers do not wish to use that extra four hours in recuperating their strength and if they do not wish to use it for pleasure, sport or culture&mdash;and many farm labourers are just as cultured as any member of this House&mdash;if they do not wish to use it for these reasons, since it is purely a matter of their own individual choice and volition, they can utilise it for work to their own advantage, the work that Deputy Cogan advised the farmers to help them to do.  They will thereby indirectly increase the agricultural productivity of the country and the farmers will indirectly contribute to that increase by allowing the farm labourers a little more time to work on their own plots.  In other words, these four hours will be transferred by the farm labourers from working for the farmers to working for themselves, and the farmers can help them in doing that.</P>
    <P>There is another argument that I think it would be difficult to answer: that this Bill will not automatically result in a decline in agricultural productivity but may indirectly produce a greater productivity.  Deputy Cogan's third argument is in the nature of a <i>reductio ad absurdum.</i>  He says there is very little point in this Bill, and there is very little point in the argument that the farm labourer should be put on an equal footing with the industrial worker.  At column 842 of Official Report of 15th November, 1950, he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1176" />&ldquo;If you apply the argument that the farm worker is as much entitled to a reduced working week as the industrial worker, why not go a step further and say that both farm workers and industrial workers should be given Civil Service hours, a still further reduction?  If the 54-hour week is too long for the agricultural worker, is not the 50-hour or the 48-hour week too long for the industrial worker?  Why not give them the 40-hour week, the same as many of our office workers?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>According to both Deputy Maguire and Deputy Corry that would be impossible. It would be impossible to reduce the hours.  Evidently the farm labourer must work from dawn to dusk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>We hope to convert him to a proper appreciation of the Bill.  I was endeavouring to follow Deputy Cogan in his argument that no half-holiday should be given to the farm workers because, if a 54-hour week is too long for them then a 50-hour or a 48-hour week is too long for the industrial worker: why not give them a 40-hour week?  The question is: why not?  It depends upon the extent to which the industrial machine has been geared up to the work that has been done in the past by the workers themselves in their trade unions in obtaining shorter hours.  If Deputy Cogan thinks that by reducing this to absurdity, by pushing the argument along this line, he is in any way shaking our understanding or our support of this Bill, I assure him that he has a long way to travel in his knowledge of the struggle of the working class for reduced hours.  While the industrial workers enjoyed&mdash;some of them&mdash;48, 45 and 40-hour weeks, as far back as I remember distinctly myself, the big labour strikes of 1920 in Britain, on the Clyde and elsewhere, the workers were then advocating a 30-hour week.  It was only by struggling for that that they achieved a 40-hour and a five-day week.  There is no argument in that method of approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the agricultural labourers are sufficiently organised and when the agricultural industry has achieved a higher level of production&mdash;as the Opposition and all of us wish it to do&mdash; and when it has achieved the state of <Col N="1178" /> stability and progress that would enable the work to be done in a lesser number of hours, and when the workers are organised sufficiently well to obtain from the farmers their just demands, then the hours of the farm labourers will be reduced.  They are working now far less than they worked 30 or 40 years ago&mdash;that seems to be forgotten by the Deputies who oppose this Bill&mdash;and no calamity has come upon the agricultural industry on that account; and no calamity will come upon it either because of the granting of this concession of a four hours' half-holiday.</P>
    <P>The next point is a very sore one, on which Deputy Cogan takes us to task very often.  It is in regard to the possibility of stepping up the productivity in industry, whereas there is a difficulty in stepping it up in agriculture. He states that agricultural output is too low, that the output per man hour is too low, but he does not give us a comparison or tell us by how much per cent.  it is too low.  By what standard does he measure its lowness? He says that we have been introducing improved machinery into agriculture. What is the effect of that improvement? Surely, it is not leading to a decline in agricultural productivity? If what he tells us is correct&mdash;and we all know it is&mdash;with the introduction of improved agricultural machinery, improved technique, improved knowledge of seeds, crops, growing methods, harvesting methods, and so on, the whole science of agriculture has been improving steadily.  Surely the result of this will tend towards increased productivity?  The figures are not so dismal as Deputy Cogan might make out and it would be well to examine them for a moment.  As far as I have gleaned them, there have been substantial increases in the agricultural price index number, particularly in 1950.  The figure runs around 260 and it was as high as 267 in April, 1950, while in July it was 262, compared with 100 for the base, the period September, 1938 to August, 1939.  That was the basic year to which Deputy Cogan referred. Therefore, the farmers generally, as anyone can see whether he knows anything about agriculture or not, have been getting two and a <Col N="1179" /> half times for their produce in 1950 what they got in 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking this as an indication that the farmers' wholesale prices have gone up.  We know that the value of the £ has gone down, and Ministers well qualified to speak here say it has gone from 20/- down to 10/- in value.  Over the same period, while the value of the £ has been cut in half, the farmers' prices, according to these figures, have gone up two and a half times; so there is a slight betterment in the position of the farmer, compared with that previous period.  The average for the three months ending July, 1950, was 262, compared with 249 for the corresponding period last year.  I think the Minister will bear me out&mdash;and he can give extensive figures, as he gave on one occasion I mentioned before&mdash;that despite the fluctuations, the figures show that agricultural productivity is on the increase.</P>

      <P>My argument is that, according to the figures available to us as non-agricultural people, the farmers are not doing so badly&mdash;and particularly, I would say, the 47,000 farmers, who are the only ones concerned directly in this Bill, who are employing farm labour.  It would be impossible of course to segregate them from the rest with regard to assessing their fortunes or misfortunes.  These index figures are quite general, but we could state fairly conscientiously and accurately that the 47,000 farmers of the class mentioned who employ labour come nearer to the industrial capitalist from the point of view of economics than do the farmers who depend upon their family and relatives for workers. In so far as they employ labour they exploit it.  They do not employ labour for the benefit of the labourers, but in order to make a profit from it.  So far as anything could be argued from this increase in prices&mdash;despite Deputy O'Reilly's argument about the low level of prices in 1938&mdash;the farmers who employ labour would benefit more because they are in that position.  The defect we find in agricultural statistics is their paucity&mdash;and the Minister might turn his attention to that&mdash;and the fact that it is very difficult readily to obtain figures bearing on such points as were raised by Deputies O'Reilly and Cogan.  A lot of these figures are free estimates, and we can use our common understanding or prejudices as the case may be to interpret them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point Deputy Cogan makes (column 843) on the question of machinery in agriculture and in industry is that we are dealing with living animals and growing plants in agriculture, and therefore he assumes that that sets agriculture on a plane where no comparison can be made between it and industry or any other form of human occupation.  It is an argument that may appear very sound to him, but it cannot appeal to a logical mind. He states that no machine can lay an egg or give birth to a calf.  Deputy Lehane, I think, told us of farmers getting up at six in the morning to produce the milk while non-agricultural Deputies thought that the cows did that.  Farmers evidently think <Col N="1181" /> that because they are dealing with living animals and growing plants farming cannot be classified as an ordinary industry where humane conditions of labour should exist and where the workers' amenities and leisure increase in accordance with the general trend of labour conditions throughout the world.  But we do not want to be as badly off as our fathers and grandfathers were.  If we are farm labourers to-day we do not want our sons to be farm labourers, who will work the same long hours for the same low wages.  We want to improve conditions. As human beings, as legislators, as members of this sovereign assembly, we would like to improve the conditions of all sections of the community and raise the standard of living. By that reasoning we should desire that social conscience which obtains in other fields of activity and other industries should spread to the agricultural community, the more so perhaps because they are dealing with living animals and growing plants.  We human beings are of that nature.  We are much removed from the inanimate things which according to Deputy Cogan are dealt with by industry. Because they are dealing with living animals and growing plants surely farmers should have more sympathy with the idea of ameliorating the conditions of their labourers.  Surely that is a good argument why farmers should support any measure which would confer benefits upon the human beings they employ.</P>

      <P>I have already answered the next points which Deputy Cogan makes as to how the farmer is to carry the additional burden.  He must increase his costs, he says, or reduce his output.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>There need not be an increase in the cost of living by farmers passing on the burden to consumers in the form of increased prices, even if the Minister for Agriculture were to permit them to do so, nor need they reduce their output if there is goodwill between the farmer and his labourer.  The farm worker is a most intelligent person who is most anxious to facilitate the farmer who is dealing with these living animals and growing things and with a little encouragement, a little of the human spirit which may permeate farmers on the implementation of this Bill, they will do that little extra to intensify their labour and do their work better.  Everyone in the House, particularly the Labour Deputies, would urge farm labourers to do that in return for this concession of increased leisure.  Everyone can improve his labour.  Deputy Corry thinks that the question of labour is limited to the number of hours but he and all of us and farmers in particular should know that being at a job is not working at it.  You may be 60 minutes on the job but you may only give 40 minutes actual work.</P>

What we desire is that co-operation about which Deputy Cogan has spoken.  If that co-operation is secured, there could be <Col N="1183" /> that intensification of labour which would result in increased productivity and, by increasing the volume of foodstuffs, permit of a substantial decrease rather than the substantial increase about which he talks.</P>

      <P>That is a hypothetical question.  I have made a statement and every economist, every person interested in industry and in the working of the human being, whether he be a solicitor, a Deputy or a farm labourer, will agree with me.  I say that, once labour can be organised in such a fashion, more will be produced in a given hour than is being produced at present.  If that were not so, there would be no such thing as progress in the world.  Everyone who can so organise his time, or, if he is employed, whose time can be so organised for him, can produce more units of whatever he is producing in that hour than he produced hitherto.</P>

      <P>My whole argument&mdash; and it is not based upon supposition, and not upon any question of a motive or high desire, but is scattered through the pages of economic history&mdash;is that increased production in industry has resulted from a shortening of hours, and no argument has been advanced as to why that principle should not be applied to agriculture.  Merely a pious hope has been expressed that it should not apply to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would be very little point in giving examples of this from American agriculture, the agriculture of Australia and New Zealand, and the agriculture of South America in particular, where they have rationalised agriculture and <Col N="1184" /> where, by the introduction of this labour-saving machinery, this scientific machinery to which Deputy Cogan has adverted, they have substantially raised the productivity of labour in these spheres.  We, however, have a different type of agriculture.  We have not got the mass of machinery they have in these other areas, but that does not mean that, because we are differently organised, because we have only a limited number of tractors per acre and because we are subject to the vagaries of the weather, we cannot organise the manpower at our command in order to get better results.</P>
    <P>If you say you cannot do it, you are confessing failure, confessing that you are a worse failure than any of your predecessors in the farmer's sphere. Farmers are doing better now than their grandfathers did, despite the vagaries of the weather.  They are doing very much better because, totalling it all up, they have been able to organise their time and to use each hour better than their grandfathers used an hour before them, by reason of the increase in scientific knowledge of agriculture and the introduction of better methods.  You talk about that on the Agricultural Estimate and you expand yourself, whether you speak for three hours or three minutes.</P>

      <P>The fact that the average farmer receives £3 10s. 0d. per week is surely no argument against the 47,000 farmers who are involved giving four hours of a half-holiday to their labourers.  The figure of £3 10s. 0d., however, is one of interest.  It would appear to be very low and, in so far as it is low and in so far as it is correct&mdash; I have no means of checking it&mdash;we would deplore it; but there is one aspect of that figure which has escaped Deputy Cogan, though he says there is no escaping this figure, that is, that, with that figure of £3 10s. 0d. per week as his actual cash income, Deputy Cogan has forgotten to assess the value of the security which the farmer enjoys and which the farm labourer does not enjoy.  Even if the farm labourer were getting £4 or £4 10s. 0d. per week, I would say that he would not be as well off as the farmer getting £3 10s. 0d. per week, because the farmer has what the human being prizes most, security, which the farm labourer has not got.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers have that security.  They know that, whether the weather is bad or not, they have some part of this earth which they can call their own.  At least it can be said, in the case of farmers, that they have some part of this earth which, as far <Col N="1186" /> as the laws of this State will permit, they can call their own.  There is a portion of land which Deputy Corry can call his own.  He can call it Corry land, but there is no part of Ireland which the farm labourer can call his own.  He has no title deeds to land which he can lodge in a bank if he wants an overdraft, whether it be large or small.  He is at the mercy of the economic vagaries.  Therefore, there is no need for us to be unduly pessimistic when we read Deputy Cogan's statement that the average income of the farmer is less than £3 10s. a week.  Because the farmer's income is so small, Deputy Cogan adduces that as one of the reasons why he sets his mind definitely and vigorously against this Bill, and why, as he has suggested, it should not be enacted.  Instead, he says we should raise the standard and status of agricultural workers by all means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all in agreement with Deputy Cogan there, but it is a mode of argument that has not much weight.  When one is trying to do one thing for a particular person, it is a very good way of evading one's responsibility by suggesting that something, which is not in the same category at all as that which you are trying to do for him, should be done for him.  We are trying to raise the standard of agricultural workers by one means; we are trying to improve his status and to bring him into line with the industrial worker.  Deputy Cogan has made the objection that we should do other things, and not this thing, for the farm labourer.  These other things may be good in themselves, but the fact that Deputy Cogan can give examples of those other things that can be done for the farm labourer is a very good reason why, in fact, he should support this thing that we are doing.  He has not made any good argument as to why he should exclude the one thing that we are discussing.  He says to us to do a certain number of things such as B, C and D, but not to do A.  If he is in agreement with us in doing B, C and D why can he not throw in his lot with us and do A as well?  That seems to me to be a logical question to ask him.  He says he is concerned <Col N="1187" /> about the agricultural labourer.  I honestly believe that he is, and that he will ultimately support this idea of reducing the working hours of farm labourers generally by legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan thinks that this case might be met by increasing the children's allowance by 1/-.  May I point this out to the Deputy?  I think I have abundantly proved that if the proposal in this Bill is accepted it does not follow that it will mean any impost on the farmers, any increase in wages, or any increase in the cost of living through an increase in the cost of foodstuffs. Yet, what he proposes for the farm labourer, an increase of 1/- in the children's allowance, will certainly lead to an increased impost on the farmer because he will have to pay his share of that 1/-, since the money required for the purpose is derived from general taxation.  I would not be so bold as to say that the farmer will pay the major part of that, but if the children's allowance is increased there will be an increase in taxation, and the farmer, to some little extent, will have to pay his share of that.  Of course, the farmer would be in a position to pass on some part of that to the general community by increasing the cost of foodstuffs.  At any rate, the point is that if the Deputy's suggestion were adopted there would be a greater tendency to increase the cost of living than there would be by giving the half-holiday to the farm workers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also suggested that farmers could co-operate with their farm labourers in other directions and help them to improve their status.  He suggested that they could help them to cultivate their plots and provide them with additional allotments of land for the growing of vegetables, and that farmers who have tractors or horses could help their workers in the cultivation of their plots.  I do not know very much about agriculture.  I am quite frank in admitting that.  I will just make this comment, that an agricultural worker would need to have a fairly considerable plot if he could be assisted in increasing his production from it by the aid of the farmer's tractor.</P>
    <Col N="1188" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of an agricultural holding, I think there are limits to the extent to which you can use a tractor on it.  However, the sentiment is very good.  I am sure that whether the farmer came with a tractor, a horse or a spade to help an agricultural labourer to cultivate his plot he would be very welcome.  If the farm labourer is given an additional allotment of land he will require more time to cultivate it, and so if you promise that the farmer is to help him by the aid of his tractor or his horses you should also make available to him the extra time that he will need for the cultivation of that land.  It appears to me that the Deputy's suggestion is like very many of his other statements in this that it is a very good argument in favour of granting the half-holiday to the farm workers.  It is an ideal thought that the farmers should share their land with those who are working for them and so enable a community of interest to be established between them.  It would, I think, not only directly but indirectly lead to an increase in the productivity of labour.</P>
      <P>If farmers were to carry out Deputy Cogan's suggestion, which I think most progressive-minded Deputies will agree with, and to grant the farm labourers these additional facilities and amenities, I am perfectly certain, from our knowledge of Irishmen, that the farm labourers would reciprocate very whole-heartedly and give the farmers full measure in return; that there would be no necessity to look at the loss of four hours in 54, a loss of a mere 8 per cent., but that by such a creation of goodwill and the relationship which would grow out of such a movement as that we could be sure of a substantial increase in productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Maguire, who has concerned himself so much about the vagaries of the weather, we have the advice of Deputy Cogan, who, I understand, is a competent farmer, who is evidently talking from the hearthstone and knows something about the subject, and who says that the farmers, as one of the things that could be done to ameliorate the conditions <Col N="1189" /> of the labourers, should give to their labourers a full week's employment irrespective of weather conditions. I should like the Deputy to mark that.  He is answered out of the mouth of the principal opposition speaker to this Bill.  I do not need to know anything about agriculture or to have any knowledge of the conditions.</P>
    <P>All I need is to go to column 846 of the Official Report and cite a competent authority.  The Deputy would not give this advice to the farmers if the thing could not be done.  He would not be talking through his hat.  Surely that is not a habit of Deputy Cogan's. I have only to cite that, irrespective of weather conditions, it is possible for a farmer to give a full week's employment.</P>
    <P>If that is so, it follows logically from the other arguments I have deduced for a full week's employment, meaning in this case 50 hours, that it would be possible for Deputy Cogan so to organise the time of his labourers, irrespective of weather conditions, that in 50 hours they could do the work that has hitherto been done in 54 hours.  It should be possible for farmers, with the aid of a few extra time-saving machines, and even without the capital cost involved in that, to find sufficient occupation for labourers in repairing dilapidated homesteads or dilapidated outhouses that require improvement or in doing many other items of work that should have been done and could have been done long ago to improve the capital value of their land and business so as to enable them to carry on their activities in better and more comfortable surroundings than they had hitherto by the provision of storage for crops, etc.  It is possible to organise sufficient work for the farm workers to enable that amount of output to be achieved in the lesser number of hours.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the rural workers are concerned, they have, as trade unionists, if I might put it this way, a most elastic conscience.  They have to have it.  They are conditioned by the rural conditions.  One knows that there are not so many rural carpenters, <Col N="1190" /> plasterers and so on about the country as there are handymen.  There are handymen who are carpenters cum bricklayers cum plasterers, etc.  As Deputy Maguire knows, trade unionism is most fruitful in its work in large industries where there is a large number of men employed in one factory or works.  Even on the large scale farms employing up to 20 or 30 workers or more, such as in County Wicklow, you will find a more rigorous application of trade union principles and rules than you will find in some out of the way place round Ardee or beyond Dundalk near the Border where there may be only two or three farm workers employed on one farm.  Therefore, there is no valid objection that I can see to the proper utilisation of the farm worker's labour indoor by the farmers in doing these things which are necessary.  Carpenters and other building workers are scarce because the Minister for Local Government and his housing commission have put a premium on carpenters, plasterers and other tradesmen who are employed in carrying out the housing programme. Deputy Maguire knows well that if there are handymen who are not in a carpenters' society or any other society and who are organised in the Rural Workers' Federation, there will not be any great objection to the spasmodic or occasional employment of farm labourers by a farmer for certain restricted types of work in order to get their 50-hour week in.  If that is the objection that Deputy Maguire makes, I think it is readily overcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why I make an appeal that those who feel an objection to this Bill should, out of their human <Col N="1191" /> sympathy and understanding and on the basis of ethics and morals, permit this Bill to have a Second Reading and then argue out a case with us section after section, and sub-section after sub-section, or by the provision of additional sections to safeguard anything about which they may be doubtful. Give us a chance of implementing this Bill for the sake of raising the standard of the farm workers and there is no doubt that you will find that you have done a good day's work for the farming community as a whole, for yourselves as employers and for the peace of the countryside because, if you are always in opposition to the just demands of farm labourers, you cannot expect them to tolerate that they should be held back while all other sections go forward.  They are not insulated from the workers in the towns.  The farm labourer goes into town probably every evening and certainly every week-end.  He is constantly mixing with the town workers, knows the conditions of the town workers and he is envious of them.  He knows the time they have to spare for cultural or other recreations and in that way he is likely to resent any continued opposition to his interests.</P>

      <P>I can prove that while the present situation is undoubtedly serious, at the same time since the advent of this Government unemployment in the areas to which I refer has been reduced by about 50 per cent.  The present position results from a seasonal occurrence in the area.  In the districts surrounding Balbriggan, Lusk, Swords and Skerries there is a good deal of agricultural cultivation.  The farmers in that area&mdash;who, I might mention, give a half-holiday to the workers every week and do a great amount of tillage, relatively a greater amount of tillage than is done in any other part of the country&mdash;employ ordinarily a large number of agricultural workers but when the threshings are finished, the mills come in off the road, as is the case in every agricultural area, and there is seasonal unemployment for a period of from a month to three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They give them three months' holidays without pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I know they give them three months' hard labour in East Cork.  In fact, they give them a lifetime of hard labour in Corryland, as it has been called, and it is a pretty extensive tract of country, as I am well aware.  However, I want to devote the time at my disposal this evening to the plight of the unemployed workers in Balbriggan, Skerries, Lusk and Swords.  I understand that the Dublin County Council which is constantly <Col N="1193" /> concerned with unemployment problems as they arise, has been notified that grants will be made available from the special employment scheme fund to amounts, approximately, of £500 odd in the case of Balbriggan, and £200 odd in the case of Swords.  I want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary that these grants are totally inadequate to deal with the problem in these areas.  The present unemployment is of an unusual nature and of unusual dimensions.  In Balbriggan, which is one of the largest towns in my constituency, a good deal of building work was in progress up to quite recently.  Houses were being built for the working classes&mdash;houses about which they had been hearing for years but which were not built until the last year or so by the present Administration. That work is now stopped and we are awaiting plans for a further building scheme in Balbriggan, which means there is a valley period in regard to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the fact that grants for the relief of unemployment are determined, to some extent at any rate, by the number of workers in receipt of unemployment assistance and registered at the labour exchange in a particular area.  The number registered, as everybody knows, never reflects the true position in relation to unemployment.  It does not take into account the number of workers who may have become only recently unemployed and who are in receipt of unemployment benefit.  Wherever the fault lies, there is something there which should be corrected, because I am not the only Deputy who has complained on the score of the calculation of unemployment figures where grants of this sort are concerned.  In each of the areas to which I have referred, there is liable to be a good deal of hardship and there is a considerable amount of hardship at present amongst unemployed workers.  It is, I admit, a transient condition.  We in North County Dublin do not like looking for grants for unemployment because ordinarily there is sufficient employment available to keep our people at work.  If the records are checked by the Parliamentary Secretary, he will find that there is no public assistance <Col N="1194" /> area in the country which has sought less for the relief of unemployment as the particular area of which I am now speaking.  I think, therefore, that when a situation of this kind develops it should receive special consideration.</P>
    <P>The consideration for which I am asking is that sufficient grants should be made available to the Dublin County Council to ensure that for this valley period during which there is unemployment&mdash;between harvest and spring and between the completion of one housing scheme and the start of another&mdash;work will be provided for these men.  I think that is a very reasonable request, a request that should be acceded to in view of the fact that to my certain knowledge the demands made by the Dublin County Council in respect of this type of problem are very small.  So far as I am aware the actual figures for unemployment in these areas are, 70 in Balbriggan, 30 at Skerries, roughly 20 in the Lusk area and between 40 and 50 in Swords.  These are the actual figures for the unemployed; they are not confined to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance.  These are the up-to-date figures.  The Parliamentary Secretary should remember that a number of workers would have had to sign at the labour exchange since the 1st November, which is a considerable time ago.</P>
    <P>The 1st November is the date to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred in his reply to my question.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate, in reply to my reasonable request to-day, whether or not his Department will be prepared to make adequate provision, not the niggardly provision which is proposed and which we were used to in years gone by, which would give a man only a couple of days work in a week.  I would ask him to make adequate provision for the men to ensure that they can be put to work immediately on useful, constructive work, such as the widening of dangerous roads.  There are important trunk roads in County Dublin which need widening.  There will be no dearth of schemes.  They are not schemes which will provide merely an excuse for expenditure of money in <Col N="1195" /> order to relieve unemployment.  They are schemes which will provide lasting benefit to County Dublin and the country as a whole.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, will he now assure me that steps will be taken to make adequate grants available to relieve these distressed workers.</P>

      <P>I notice that Deputy Dunne said that the area in question is the one area that never causes trouble or looks for assistance.  I want to point out to him that 12 months ago a question was raised on the Adjournment in connection with this area and there has not been a question raised since that in connection with any other area.  Therefore, to me at least, that area is causing a certain amount of trouble.  I am surprised at Deputy Dunne.  We are responsible for unemployment assistance. We are not responsible for unemployment benefit.  I want to make that plain.</P>
      <P>Two grants have been allocated&mdash;a grant for Balbriggan town and Balbriggan rural electoral division, of £530, and a grant in the Swords area, of £280. Work will commence in a few days.  I would like to know where Deputy Dunne got his figures.</P>

If the Deputy can make a case that in Balbriggan there is necessity for more work for these unemployment assistance people, I am the man and mine is the Department that will provide it, as we provided it 12 months ago.  I am sorry that the Deputy raised the question.  I do not like to go into these figures.  These are the figures from the local labour exchanges as of yesterday's date.  I am bound, according to the rules and regulations laid down by the Dáil, to spend the money according to the number of registered unemployed in the area. Our Department is doing that as fairly as it is possible to do it, and if Deputy Dunne or any other Deputy says to us that, instead of there being one registered in Lusk town, there are ten or 15 registered now, the Department will come to their aid, as is regulated by the rules laid down by Dáil Éireann.</P>
