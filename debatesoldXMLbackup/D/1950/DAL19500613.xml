      <P>As the areas mentioned are a considerable distance apart, this question would seem to envisage an extensive drainage scheme which would not come within the scope of the Land Commission's activities.  The Land Commission execute drainage works on lands in their possession and, on occasion, on lands' recently allotted. In this connection, they propose to drain certain lands in Ing and Ing East.  This work will, incidentally, benefit adjoining townlands, but not Ballinacragga, which is some three miles away.</P>

      <P>The embankment in Calanafercy East on the Marshall estate has been repaired as the occupiers of the benefiting lands made the required contributions towards the work.  The repair of the embankment in Calanafercy West on the same estate could not be undertaken as the persons concerned refused to accept the Land Commission's offer.  These persons recently intimated that they would now co-operate in the work, and the matter is being re-examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he is aware that in many parts of the country farmers are receiving not more than 1/9 per lb. for best quality farmers' butter, and if he will take steps to have this price increased or, alternatively, make provision for a creamery service in such areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The market for farmers' butter is entirely free, and, that being the case, the price obtainable by producers depends on the extent of public demand for the product.  I have indicated on more than one occasion that the public taste has become so accustomed to creamery butter that it will not readily take to farmers' butter, however excellent its quality.</P>
      <P>During the past two years, the Dairy Disposal Company has, at my request, taken steps to relieve the difficulties of home butter-makers by providing facilities, wherever practicable, for the collection of their milk supplies for manufacture into creamery butter, and I am happy to say that, in most of the principal home butter-making areas, notably Counties Clare, Galway, Cork and Kerry, a creamery service is now available where none existed formerly. In other areas where substantial quantities of farmers' butter are produced and where no creameries at present exist, the company is examining the possibility of erecting one or more factories to which farmers could send their milk for manufacture into cheese. Should this prove feasible, farmers in those areas will find it more remunerative to sell their milk to the factory, where it is hoped the manufacture of cheese will be associated with the fattening of pigs on a ration in which they will constitute a part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say how he can reconcile the price of 1/9 per lb. paid for good quality farmers' butter with the 3/6 per lb. charged for off the ration creamery butter?  Does <Col N="1475" /> not the Minister think that the margin is altogether too wide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>The terms of recent resolutions passed by county committees of agriculture regarding oats are in the nature of recommendations to the effect that imports of grain should be so regulated as to have no detrimental effect on the market for home-grown oats.</P>
      <P>As I have already indicated in reply to a question from Deputy Ormonde on the 15th March last, I am not prepared to fix prices for oats but there will certainly be a profitable market for all that is produced provided the producer is prepared to sell them converted into live stock or live-stock products whenever this course appears most profitable; in which connection it may be well to mention that under the oats purchase scheme operated in 1948-49 season out of a total estimated production of 794,000 tons of oats only 19,000 tons were offered for sale under the scheme to Grain Importers Limited.</P>

From the records available, it would not be possible without very considerable investigation to segregate the number of sanctions relating to 1949-50 applications, and to those submitted prior to 1st April, 1949.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to take any steps to alter the design of the crest used on communications from my Department or to replace the lettering in the centre of the crest.  As far as the information at my disposal goes, the crest in question was designed by the late Dr. Eoin MacNeill about 36 years ago.  The letters &ldquo;F.F.&rdquo; in the centre of the crest stand for the words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  Again, as far as my information goes, the original proposal to recognise the words &ldquo;Fianna Fáil&rdquo; as the Irish equivalent of &ldquo;the Irish Volunteers&rdquo; was made by The O'Rahilly, supported by the late Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald, and adopted at the Irish Volunteer Convention held in the Abbey Theatre in October, 1914.  In view of its historic associations, therefore, I do not, as I said at the outset, propose to interfere with the design of what is at present known as the Army Crest.</P>

      <P>On the assumption in the first part of the question, the present chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, on attaining the age of 65 years, would be entitled to a gratuity of £4,500 and to an annual pension of £1,687 10s. 0d.  The pension is based on his service with local authorities, the Civil Service and Córas Iompair Éireann.  The capital sum which would purchase a life annuity equal to the pension is calculated at £12,479.  On losing office after four years' service, the first chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann was compensated under the terms of his agreement with the company by a lump-sum payment of £10,557.  He had prior to that received compensation amounting to £16,388 in respect of his previous transport service.  No pension is being paid to the first chairman.  By agreement, his rights to pension were commuted for the two lump-sum payments which I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question refers to the selection of a site for a labourer's cottage on the lands of Mr. Matthew Hennessy, Cahir, which was included in a compulsory purchase order made by the Tipperary (S.R.) County Council in 1947.  The site was subsequently found to be incorrectly marked on the map deposited with the order and for this reason it had to be excluded from the order.  It is, however, open to the council to submit a fresh proposal for the acquisition of the site in question.  Pending the acquisition of the site and the decision of the county managers on applications in accordance with the Housing (Management and Letting) Regulations, 1950, I would not find it possible to comment on the eligibility of a particular individual.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As to (c), the cost of building a county council four-room dwelling including cost of site and site development has increased by approximately 152 per cent. since 1938-39.  With regard to (d), the cost of an urban type local authority house has increased by approximately 193 per cent., but a proportion of this increase is attributable to the improvement in standards of design, construction and accommodation of the houses now being provided. I might mention that the superstructure cost of a standard type house in Dublin County Borough in February, <Col N="1489" /> 1950, showed an increase of 147 per cent. over the cost in June, 1939.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government whether he is aware that there is a shortage of water in Rush, which badly affects tomato growers in the area, some of whom have to draw water in lorries and carts a distance of four miles; and whether, in view of the importance of this work, he will arrange to provide the area with an alternative supply of water as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out in reply to the Deputy's question of the 13th July last on this subject, the local authority's statutory responsibility is limited to the provision of a supply of <Col N="1491" /> water for domestic purposes.  The county council, while satisfied that the main supply in Rush is sufficient for domestic requirements, has nevertheless taken steps to augment the supply to serve other needs.  Two additional sources have been tapped, and a further improvement in the supply is expected within a short period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is in the summer time apparently that the county council starts to look for water when the warm weather comes and water is very low? Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the general supply in North County Dublin is bad?  I would like the Minister to state whether it is possible that he would consider the recommendation which was sent to his Department regarding the tapping of the Ward river as the North County Dublin regional scheme seems to be shelved.  The position is very serious in that area.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the position is as indicated by the Deputy except in the case of accommodation for tuberculosis cases.  There is need for improvements to the institution and a scheme for these improvements was suggested by my Department to the local authority last November. This scheme includes provision of ten extra beds for tuberculosis cases.  The extra accommodation can be provided without extending the building.</P>
      <P>The local authority have been informed that a sum slightly in excess of £1,000 available in the Sanatorium Grant Fund may be applied towards meeting part of the cost of this work. I regret that owing to the heavy commitments on the Hospitals' Trust Fund I am not in a position to supplement this by authorising a grant from that fund.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether he is aware that in 1933 under the hospitalisation scheme for Tipperary (S.R) provision was made for the erection of a cottage hospital at Slieveardagh, but that due to the outbreak of hostilities and the consequent scarcity of building materials the scheme had to be deferred; and, if so, whether he will now arrange for the erection of this hospital at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the establishment of a cottage hospital for the Slieveardagh area was agreed to in 1932.  I am sure the Deputy will be surprised to hear that no progress was <Col N="1495" /> made with the project before the war &mdash;a site was not even acquired.  On reviewing the outstanding hospital building proposals preparatory to the settlement of the short-term building programme, I decided that this project should be deferred for consideration when a succeeding programme is being settled, and the local authority were informed accordingly on 10th August, 1948.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that when the present programme of works is nearing completion, the case for the inclusion of this project in the further building programme will be fully considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The effect of this Bill is to confirm ten Orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, 1932.  Orders Nos. 1 and 6 in the Schedule relate to buckets.  Prior to the making of the Orders the duty on buckets was limited to the complete article.  Deputies are, no doubt, aware of the emphasis which is being placed on exports by nearly all countries since the end of the war.  A corollary of this policy is that wherever possible countries are concentrating on the export of manufactured or partly manufactured articles rather than on raw materials. These factors operated in the case of the raw materials for bucket making and, accordingly, there was a grave danger that, on the basis of the existing duty, the degree of manufacture of buckets carried on in the country would diminish and that the work would become restricted to the assembly or finishing off of buckets imported in a partially manufactured condition.  The two Orders in the Schedule confirm the duty imposed and extend it to component parts of buckets and partially manufactured buckets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Order No. 2 relates to woollen knitted wear.  The revised duties on clothing which were reintroduced in <Col N="1502" /> January, 1948, achieved, on the whole, the purposes for which they were intended, with the exception of hosiery. An examination of the position with respect to hosiery showed that the situation was not unsatisfactory in the case of cotton and rayon underwear and hose and in the case of woollen hose, including socks.  Imports of rayon hose are, however, subject to quota restriction in addition to the tariff.  The output, sales and employment of the concerns producing cotton and rayon underwear and hose and woollen hose, including socks, increased each year since 1946.  In the case of woollen outerwear, sales have remained static, while imports continued at the substantial rate of approximately £500,000 per annum.  In these circumstances, it was decided to increase the full rate of duty on woollen underwear and outerwear to 40 per cent. and to restore the suspended preferential rate of 33? per cent.  The restoration was carried out under an Order under the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act and the Order is not scheduled in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Order No. 3 is to remove a loophole in the main Order which it amends.  The cloths covered by this Order are used mainly as linings, and the Revenue Commissioners were authorised to exempt cloths which had been subjected to proofing.  It was found that cloths were being brought in which were intended for and were suitable for use as linings but had been subjected to a process of proofing merely for the purpose of evading the objects of the duty.  The effect of the amending Order is to restrict the exemption to cloths proofed by a process involving the use of rubber or rubber solution.</P>
    <P>Orders Nos. 4, 5, 8 and 9 may be taken together because their purpose is to protect a number of new industries. The first of these industries is the production of wide elastics suitable for braces and suspenders by a new company in Ennis.  Deputies are aware that the production of other varieties of elastic up to one inch in width has been carried on at Ennis for a number of years.  The second of <Col N="1503" /> these industries is the production of files and hacksaw blades at Newbridge. Apart from general economic considerations, there are definite advantages in having essential tools of this nature produced in the country. The third new industry is the production of wallboard from straw at Athy. This industry is valuable not only from the point of view that it produces an article which has a large and growing use and which has hitherto been entirely imported but also from the point of view that it uses straw as a raw material and provides a ready market in a tillage area for surplus straw.</P>
    <P>Order No. 7 merely gives statutory effect to what was already an administrative fact by exempting from scope of the duty elementary parts, fixed resistances and fixed condensers for the importation of which, in the past, duty-free facilities were given.  Elementary or completely unassembled parts are the raw material of the wireless industry in this country and, in fact, in other countries.  The production of elementary parts represents a separate aspect of wireless manufacture which is not yet being undertaken here.</P>
    <P>Order No. 10 was designed to meet a specific situation caused by the export from Hong Kong of cheap cotton shirts. The landed cost of these shirts was considerably below the price at which the raw material for similar cheap shirts could be bought by Irish manufacturers. It may be that the danger from this sort of competition will grow in other respects in future but at present it is intended to confine the Order to the shirts mentioned.  I may say that a number of orders were placed for these shirts and the danger to our manufacturing concerns was imminent.  In fact, I think at least one consignment had arrived here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the confirmation of each of these Orders.  I think, however, that one might comment on the fact that in no less than four of the cases under review now, it was apparently necessary to amend the Order after it was made. We were certainly given to understand <Col N="1504" /> that when the Industrial Development Authority got to work, it would so carefully examine every proposition that came to it that the possibility of error would be eliminated.  The cautious, careful systematic methods of the Industrial Development Authority were contrasted with what were described as the slip-shod methods of the Department of Industry and Commerce in the bad old days.  I cannot remember any case, however, even when tariffs were being multiplied much more rapidly than at present, in which in the course of a few months, four Orders made had to be amended because of errors, before being brought to the Dáil for confirmation. I think these errors were the result of the inexperience of the Industrial Development Authority, and that when they have gained a little more knowledge about the work that they have undertaken, these errors will not arise in future.  It is bad for trade when Orders of this kind are made and have subsequently to be altered.  Those who engage in trade are entitled to feel reasonably sure that when the Government takes a decision and announces that decision, it has fully examined the matter in all its implications, that the Orders will stand, and that they can make their arrangements accordingly.  It is, from every point of view, unfair if the Government subsequently find that they have to amend these Orders and issue new Orders with immediate effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Government have decided to rectify the position concerning Irish galvanised buckets.  Unfortunately they delayed so long about dealing with the situation that considerable damage was done to the existing industry, and it looked at one stage as if it might have to come to a stop.  The evasion of the existing duty which was being practised had previously been checked by an administrative arrangement, but substantial imports of partially manufactured buckets and component parts were faciliated by an administrative decision of the Revenue Commissioners. Possibly their decision was right in accordance with the letter of the law, but a proper liaison between the Revenue Commissioners and the <Col N="1505" /> Department of Industry and Commerce would, I think, have resulted in that administrative decision being followed by action to rectify the law, if the importance of the matter had been appreciated there.</P>
    <P>I am glad to know that the wallboard factory at Athy has now reached a stage where the undertaking to afford protection by way of a duty is to be implemented.  As many Deputies know, that factory was started before the war.  The company which built it was set up as far back as 1938 but, because of the war and the difficulties which it created, the enterprise could not be proceeded with.  The construction of the factory was started immediately after the war ended and those who were responsible for it had great hopes of getting an important industry located there which would contribute substantially to the solution of many building problems here.  It will, I think, be a successful enterprise and it is certainly one well worth supporting.</P>
    <P>The extension of the manufacture of elastics at Ennis to include elastics of a greater width was a likely development from the enterprise there, an enterprise which at one time was the subject of heated controversy in the Dáil.  We are glad that the days when that enterprise was the subject of controversy have long since passed and hope that, in its new development, it will be as successful as it was in the old.</P>
    <P>The manufacture of files, hacksaws and other tools of that kind is also an industry well worth supporting.  There were various proposals relating to these commodities submitted to the Department of Industry and Commerce from time to time, all of which had some merits, but all of which encountered difficulties of one kind or another.  I trust that the manufacture of files and hacksaws will be followed in due course by the manufacture of other similar tools, the production of which, in this country, is to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>None of the other matters requires comment except to say that I hope that the present arrangement relating to the examination of proposals for alterations <Col N="1506" /> of duties or the imposition of new duties will permit of expeditious action.  The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the importation occasionally of very cheap cotton shirts which might have seriously upset our own industry for a considerable time after it had taken place.  In pre-war days developments of that kind had always to be anticipated.  In a small country such as ours it is always possible to produce considerable dislocation by the importation of one occasional consignment, sold at an exceptionally cheap price for some exceptional reason. Because of that danger, powers were taken by legislation to act promptly and, in anticipation of consent of the Dáil, by Government Order.  These powers are still there, but we are not quite clear as to the extent to which the Government has delegated their use to the Industrial Development Authority; and, if such delegation has taken place, whether it is likely to involve delay. In the case of the cotton shirts, to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, he stated that one part of the total quantity ordered had reached this country and was on the market here before any action was taken.  I do not know whether or not that was a large consignment, but it will have done no harm if it teaches the officers of the Department and the Industrial Development Authority, whichever of them is responsible, the need for vigilance and prompt action in a case such as that.</P>
    <P>There are none of the Orders scheduled to the Bill to which we have any objection.  So far as we are concerned, the Parliamentary Secretary can have all stages of the measure to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy was entirely fair to the Industrial Development Authority.  I do not know whether anyone has ever yet described the officers of the Department of Industry and Commerce as being slip-shod in the past.  The Industrial Development Authority was established in order to have available advice on technical and other matters connected with industrial development.  It so <Col N="1507" /> happens that the section of the Department, formerly administering Orders and quotas covered by the Bill, is now transferred to the Industrial Development Authority.  I think it is reasonable enough to accept that human ingenuity will always try to evade these tariffs, quotas and restrictions.  That is precisely what happened in each of the cases mentioned.</P>
      <P>In the case of buckets, the duty was originally on unassembled parts.  Then the bucket was brought in assembled but not dipped, or blacked, as it is sometimes described; while that constituted a threat to certain existing industries, one particular industry engaged in these operations resisted the application of the tariff.  It may be that our responsibility is to those industries already established.  There was certainly a conflict of interest in that particular case.</P>
      <P>In the case of linings, the tariff originally imposed did not include the process to which these are subjected and, through some form of proofing in a rubberoid solution or through some technical process, certain parties succeeded in evading the tariff.  In that case, again, when the matter was examined, the position was rectified.</P>
      <P>In the case of hacksaws and files, it was considered there that the original duty was sufficient.  Shortly after its imposition, outside concerns took advantage of it to sell here cheap tools and dump consignments of low-priced articles on the market.  For a time they succeeded in swamping the market.  The result was the duty had to be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of wallboard, the rate of duty imposed there was originally 6d.  The promoters of the company, the officers of the Industrial Development Authority and the Department of Industry and Commerce considered 6d. adequate.  Events once more showed that it was not sufficient and the duty had to be increased to 1/-. I do not know whether it is wise in cases of that nature to work on the assumption that the higher the rate of duty the more successful it is likely to be or, alternatively, to start with a low rate of duty and increase it subsequently. <Col N="1508" /> One drawback in starting with a high rate of duty is that manufacturers may charge higher prices than would be justified.  The question is whether one will bring the duty up and increase prices or bring it down and so lower prices.  In each of the cases in which efforts were made to evade the duty, or to evade the quota, as the case may be, the efforts succeeded. In connection with Deputy Lemass's last remark in relation to the delegation of powers to the Industrial Development Authority, the examination of cases, such as the examination into the duty imposed on cotton shirts, is carried out by the Industrial Development Authority but, of course, their recommendations can only be implemented by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company (General Meetings) Order, 1950, proposed to be made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and laid in draft before Dáil Éireann on the 30th day of May, 1950, under sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, be approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Alliance and Dublin Consumers' Gas Company are subject to a peculiar disability in regard to the holding of general meetings and preparation of accounts.  Unlike other commercial concerns, the company are obliged, by the Alliance and Dublin Gas Act, 1866, to prepare accounts on a half-yearly basis, and to hold general meetings twice a year, and they have asked that an Order should be made under the Gas Regulation Act, 1920, relieving them of this obligation.  I am satisfied that the procedure laid down in the <Col N="1509" /> Act of 1866, which serves no useful purpose, is outmoded, and that there is no reason for continuing to impose on the company an obligation which does not apply to other commercial undertakings, and which involves the company in an annual expenditure of the order of £3,000.</P>
    <P>Under existing procedure, it is necessary for the company to hold a general meeting to approve of the payment of half-yearly dividends but, under the draft Order now before the House, the company will be able to follow the normal practice of commercial concerns and declare interim dividends, subject to ratification at the annual general meeting.</P>
    <P>The Gas Regulation Act of 1920 altered the method whereby statutory gas undertakings were obliged to secure their powers by way of private Act or provisional Order, and provided instead that powers could be secured by a special Order approved by a Resolution of both Houses.  The procedure, as now laid down, requires that the draft Order be prepared by the gas undertaking, and that full publicity of the intention to apply for the Order and of the content of the draft be given by notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and local newspapers.  Notification must also be given to the State and to private interests involved.  One month is given for the lodging of objections, the subsequent stages being dealt with in accordance with the Gas Regulation Act, 1920.  No objections were lodged in this case.  I, therefore, submit the draft for approval of the Dáil. Approval of the Seanad has already been obtained.</P>

      <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag caint ar an Meastachán seo ar an 23ú Bealtaine bhí mé ag tagairt do mholadh a rinneadh ag Teachta ar an dtaobh thall chun dream éigint a chur ar bun ar nós Bord na gCeantar Cumhang.  Tá mé ag cuimhneamh ar an deacracht a bheadh ann a leithéid de mholadh a chur ag obair anois.  Do lua mé cuid de na sheirbhísí a fhreastalaíonn <Col N="1510" /> ar an nGaeltacht&mdash;cuid acu atá i bhfad níos tábhtachtaí ná Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta iad fhéin.  Tá mé ag ceapadh, má bhreathnaíonn aon duine ar an gceist seo go bhfeicfidh sé go bhfuil sé cosúil le rialtas nua a bheadh ar bun leis an leas atá molta ag na daoine a dhéanamh don nGaeltacht. Dar ndóigh, nílmíd ag iarraidh aon tsaghas eile partition a dhéanamh ins an tír agus níl muintear na Gaeltachta ag iarraidh bheith faoi rialú fé leith. Teastaíonn uathu bheith páirteach comh maith leis an chuid eile san náisiúin Ghaelach agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil siad ag iarraidh aon rud mar sin agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil gá le aon saghas rud mar sin chun leas na Gaeltachta do chur chun cinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí mé ag caint faoi thagairt a rinneadh anseo ag cainteoir ón dtaobh thall den Tigh go mba í seo an tsuim airgid ba mhó a soláthraiodh go nuige seo don nGaeltacht.  Thóg mé féin ceist faoi sin.  Do chur duine éigin isteach orm agus d'fhiafraigh sé díom arbh fhéidir liom é do bhreagnú.  Ar ndóigh, bíodh is nach bhfuilimíd ag iarraidh coimhlint lena chéile ach amháin le leas na Gaeltachta do chur chun cinn, mar sin féin má tá faillí déanta ar mhuintear na Gaeltachta ní féidir an faobhar a bhaint den fhaillí sin le pointí beaga díospóireachta a déantar faoi méid an tsuim airgid atá á shólathár anois agus a soláthraíodh cheana.  Ba chóir na figiúirí do thabhairt le haghaidh an bhliain deireannach a bhí Fianna Fáil i réim.  Ó Leabhar Meastachán tá sé le feiceáil ag aon duine a thógann an trioblóid air féin breathnú air, go raibh beagnach £400,000 ins an Meastachán le haghaidh na bliana 1948-49&mdash;agus an tiomlán ar fad i Leabhar na Meastachán le haghaidh na bliana sin, dob é £72,000,000 é.  I mbliana tá laghdú de £50,000 ar an méid airgead sin sa méid atá á sholáthair, agus tá iomlán an Leabhar ar fad árduithe go £78,000,000.  Taispáineann sé sin go raibh an tsuim fén gcéad, nuair a bhí Fianna Fáil i réim, níos aoirde ná an tsuim atá á sholáthar i mbliana.  Bíodh sin mar atá, fé mar adúirt mé, níl aon mhaith bheith ag deánamh coimhlint mar seo agus ní maith liom é gur tugadh isteach é.  'Sí an pointe is tábhachtaí sa Mheastachán <Col N="1511" /> seo, i gcónaí agus i mbliana, ná go mbreathnaíonn sé go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó ag dul do chostas riaracháin ná mar ba chóir.  Mar shompla, tá dá chuid den Mheastachán ag dul do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus trí chuid de ag dul do chostas riarcháin ar an nGaeltacht. Níl mé ag cur aon mhilleáin ar an Aire faoi sin mar is é an córus oibrithe atá ann atá ciontach leis.  Ach má tá daoine ag iarraidh cás a dhéanamh faoin dream a bhí in oifig go dtí dhá bhliain ó shoin tá freagra le tabhairt air agus tá dualgas orainn an freagra sin a thabhairt.  Do laghdaíodh ar an tsuim airgid atá ag dul do na daoinibh ó anuraidh.  Tóg mar shampla tionscail na tuaithe.  Anuraidh, do réir na figiúirí, do soláthraíodh £209,000 agus tá sé sin anuas imbliana go dtí £201,000. Sin laghdú de £8,000 an méid atá ag dul dóibh.  Tá tionscail na gcladach gearrtha anuas ó anuraidh freisin.  Ón méid sin go léir, chím ón Leabhar nach bhfuil ag dul don oibrí ach £71,000.  Nílim, fé mar adúirt mé, ag fáil locht ar Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta.  Tá fhios agam go rí-mhaith chomh deacair is atá sé tionscail do chothabháil sna háiteanna sin.  Nuair a bhí an t-Aire ag tabhairt isteach an Meastachán seo sa Dáil ní dúirt sé cé mhéad daoine atá ag obair sna hionaid cniotála, agus eile, agus ba mhaith liom an teolas sin d'fháil uaidh nuair a bheidh sé ag tabhairt freagra ar an ndíospóireacht seo.</P>
    <P>Níl ins an Meastachán seo acht dhá rud a scarann airgead ar mhuintear na Gaeltachta&mdash;an tionscail tuaithe agus an tionscal cladaigh. Le dhá bhliain anois tá laghdú mór ar an tsuim airgead a scaptar ar fud na Gaeltachta ón dá rud sin.  Rinne an tAire beagan gaisce as luach na slata mara a árdú go £4 10s. an tonna. Ní dóigh liom féin gur ábhar gaisce é sin.  Más eadh ba mhaith liom a insint don Aire an sciolladh a fuair mé féin riomh an gcogadh nuair a dúirt mé anseo sa Dáil go raibh luach de £3 10s. an tonna réasúnta maith. Scapadh an scéal ar fud Chonamara go raibh mé ag iarraidh luach na feamainne a choinneáil anuas agus go ndúirt mé anseo gur leór sin, agus nach raibh mé ag iarraidh níos mó ná £3 10s. a thabhairt do lucht na <Col N="1512" /> feamainne.  Cé déarfadh anois go bhfuil £4 10s. chomh maith i mbliana le £3 10s. roimh an gcogadh?</P>
    <P>Is maith liom go raibh se le haithri go raibh sé gafa suas rud beag.  Níl sé cho maith leis an bpraghas a bhí le fáil roimh an gcogadh.  Ar ndóigh, sin comórtas is ceart a dhéanamh freisin, idir an méid a caithtear anois agus an méid a caitheadh roimh an gcogadh. Caithfear luach an airgid a thabhairt isteach sa chuntas.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí a rinne, mar adúirt mé leas-maith don Ghaeltacht agus tá aiféal orm go bhfuil cuid aca i meath nó go bhfuil siad stopaithe.  Tá's agamsa nach bhfuil airgead sa Meastachán seo lena n-aghaidh ach tugann an Ceann Comhairle, ar an Meastachán seo, cead do dhaoine tagairt a dhéanamh do na seirbhísí eile atá ag déanamh leas na Gaeltachta agus na seirbhísí atá, nó ba cheart go mbeadh, Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta mar cheangal eatorthú.  Bé mo thuairim féin, cuirim i gcás, maidir leis an Act Parlaiminte a bhaineas le iasachtaí a thabhairt do na daoine ins an Ghaeltacht le seomraí breise a thógáil le daoine a choinneáil sa Samhradh, go bhféadfadh an Roinn seo an-chuidiú a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta le buntáistí a bhaint as an Acht sin. Ba cheart, freisin, go mbeadh cúnamh na Roinne seo le fáil ag an nGaeltacht le buntáistí a bhaint as an Údarás Forbartha Tionscail a cuireadh ar bun le goirid le tionscail nua a bhunú ins an nGaeltacht.  Ba cheart, freisin, go gcuirfeadh an Roinn seo fá bhráid Roinn na Talmhaíochta go bhfuil seirbhísí éigin stopaithe ins an nGaeltacht a rinneadh leas ann, sin é míntíriú na talún.  Tá an-chaint faoi scéim mór míntíriú a bhfuil suas le £40,000,000 le caitheadh air.  Is é an chuid is aistí den scéal sin go bhfuil an cineál oibre a bhí ar siúl sa Ghaeltacht stopaithe ar fad agus nach bhfuil an deontas beag a bhí le fáil as acra nó dha acra talún a mhíntíriú le fáil anois. Ní fadó ó scríobh mé chuig Roinn na Talmhaíochta agus a dúradh liom gur cuireadh ar ceal é.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart, freisin, go mbeadh cúnamh na Roinne seo le fáil ag na coistí áitiúla i ngach paráiste sa Ghaeltacht le deontas nó airgead fháil ar iasacht le hallaí a <Col N="1513" /> chur ar bun áit ar bith a bhfuil coiste ann le cúram ceart a thabhairt dá leithéid.  Ba cheart, freisin, go mbeadh cúnamh na Roinne seo le fáil nuair atá aon dream eile den Rialtas ag bagairt ar sheirbhís ar bith atá ann agus atá ag iarraidh an leas sin a chosaint agus a choinneáil ar siúl i gcónaí.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart, freisin, go mbéadh a fhios ag an Roinn seo an méid dochair a rinneadh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta de bharr tionscail na móna lámhbhainte a stopadh, agus ba cheart go mbeadh a fhios ag an Roinn dá dtugtaí deontas don tionscal sin go bhféadfaí é choinneáil ar bun i gcónaí sna bailtí in aice na bportach.  Ar ndóigh, tá margadh na móna le fáil istigh i gcathair na Gaillimhe agus sna bailte móra san Iarthar.</P>

Níl ann ach dhá rud&mdash; tionscail tuaithe agus tionscail Chladaigh.  Léifidh mé amach an méid a caithtear ar an dá rud sin le leas na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh i mbliana: Ar thionscail na tuaithe, ní scaipfear ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach £71,000 agus ar thionscal Chladaigh, £19,000 nó £90,000 ar fad.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil ós cionn £300,000 soláthraítear sa Meastachán seo ach ní dóigh liom gur ceart seirbhísí Gaeltachta a thabhairt orthu.  Tagann gach duine isteach sa Teach agus tosaíonn sé ag cur síos ar an nGaeltacht agus ar an méid seirbhísí atá sa Leabhar seo.  Tionscail na feamainne agus na cniotála níl siad ar fad sa Ghaeltacht. Is ar mhaithe le muintir na Roinne seo atá mé ag caint mar tá a fhios agam go bhfuil gach Teachta ag brath orthu leis an Ghaeltacht a shábháil.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá rud amháin a cuireadh ar bun sa tír a cabhaireos leis an Roinn seo le tuille a dhéanamh i dtaobh tionscal tuaithe a chur ar bun&mdash;tagraim do aibhléisiú na tíre.  Díreach tar éis an chogaidh, chuir an E.S.B. an obair sin ar aghaidh.  I 1945 nó 1946 fuaireamar an tuarascáil sin fé aibhléisiú na tíre. Tá an obair sin ag dul ar aghaidh ó shoin i leith agus is obair mhaith. Chuir sé áthas orainn nár cuireadh deireadh leis an scéim sin mar cuireadh deire le scéim na móna.  Tá sé ag brugh isteach siar sa Ghaeltacht anois agus táimid ag súil sa Ghaeltacht go dtiocfaidh rud maith as.  Tá díombá orainn nach raibh tuarascáil an E.S.B. fábharach, do réir na suirbhéarachta, i dtaobh an chumhacht uisce sa cheantar sin.  Duirt an tAire Tionscail agus Tráchtála nach raibh ann ach &ldquo;preliminary report,&rdquo; ach nuair chuir mé an tarna cheist air níor thug sé mórán dochais dom.  Níl an locht ar an E.S.B. mura bhfuil an chumhacht uisce ann. B'fhéidir go bhféadfaí an chumhacht uisce a sholáthar le slám mór airgid a chaitheamh, ach sin ceist eile.  Ar chuma ar bith, go dtí go mbeidh an chumhacht leictreachais ann, is dócha nach mbeidh an deis ag Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta leathnú amach a dhéanamh <Col N="1515" /> ar na tionscail atá ann cheana.  Mhol mé, agus molaim arís, iad as an méid atá siad a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt do locht fé leith a bhaineas le tionscal cniotála. Tosaíonn na cailíní ag obair ar a 9 a chlog ar maidin agus bíonn siad ag cniotáil i rith an lae agus an chuid is mó den am bíonn siad ina seasamh.  Ní fada an sos a bhíonn acu i rith an ama sin.  Bíonn sos acu le haghaidh dinnéar. Tógann siad abhaile leo sa tráthnóna an méid stocaí atá cniotálta acu ar feadh an lae agus annsin, tar éis tae, caithfidh siad tosnú arís agus na stocaí sin a fhúáil, agus iad a thabhairt arais go dtí an t-ionad lá arna mháireach.  Bíonn síad ag obair ag fúáil sa bhaile mar sin go méan oíche agus bíonn sé sin go cruaidh ortha. Tuigim go bhfuil maisín ag cuid de na háiteanna leis an bhfúáil sin a dhéanamh.  Tá mé ag moladh don Aire go soláthrófaí na maisíní fúála sin, i riocht is go mbeidh an obair sin dhá dhéanamh san ionad i rith an lae agus go mbeadh an tráthnóna tar éis tae saor ag na cailíní le siúl amach is an t-aer a thógáil.

      <P>Tá cuid den Meastachán curtha i leataoibh le tithe a dhéanamh.  Tá a fhíos ag an Aire é féin, gidh go bhfuil an rannóg seo ag iarraidh tithe nua a sholáthar, go bhfuil cuid eile den Roinn céanna ag coinneáil na hoibre sin siar.  An chuid is mó de na gabháltaisí ins an nGaeltacht, an chuid is mó de na heastáit, tá siad measctha suas agus teastaíonn athshocrú a dhéanamh orthu.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil cuid mhaith de na heastáit sin nach féidir iad a shocrú gan cuid de na tionóntaí a athrú as.  Tá cuid eile agus is féidir iad a shocrú gan é sin a dhéanamh.  Má cuireann duine isteach ar theach nua agus má tá an áit le socrú, geobhaidh an fear sin freagra ar ais ag rá nach féidir deontas nó iasacht a thabhairt leis an teach a dhéanamh go dtí go mbeidh an áit socraithe ag Coimisiún na Talún.</P>
      <P>Tá an scéal sin amhlaidh le fada an lá agus ar ndóigh níl an locht ar an Aire seo ach an oiread le Aire ar bith eile a tháinig roimhe.  Tá fhios ag muintir Sheirbhísí na Gaeltachta go bhfuil mé ag inseacht na fírinne. Más féidir le Seirbhísí na Gaeltachta aon chúnamh a thabhairt leis an fhadhb sin a réiteach béidh siad ag déanamh leas na Gaeltachta.  Ar ndóigh, ní haon charnán airgid atá ghá sholáthar i mbliana, le tithe a dhéanamh.  Ní thógfaidh an méid atá sa Leabhar Meastachán ach céad agus trí scór teach&mdash;sin má caitear ar fad é.  Cuirfear cuid de na daoine seo siar arís de bharr na faidh be a bhfuil tagairt déanta di agam anois.</P>

    <P>Tá fhios agam go bhfuil tionsca an bhréidín gaite anuas ar fad le tamall.  Soláthraíodh anuiridh £11,000 agus i mbliana níl soláthraithe ach £275.  Níl ann ach go bhfuil an t-seirbhís sin luaite sa leabhar.  Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire nuair a <Col N="1517" /> bheas sé ag cur deire leis an díospóireacht seo céard a thárla de bharr an aontais a rinneadh idir an tír seo agus an Fhrainc i dtaobh margadh a fháil sa tír sin don bhréidín.  Rinneadh gaisge mór as an aontas sin i dtús báire ach is beag a bhí le cloisteáil againn ó shoin i leith faoi.  Tá sé fíor-riachtanach breathnú thart i dtíir éigin le margadh a fháil don seantionscal sin.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin a fháil amach ón Aire nuair a bheas sé ag caint céard is ciontach le tionscal na múnlaithe luaidh a stopadh.  Caitheadh níos mó ná dhá scór oibrithe as obair thiar sa Spidéal.  Gheall an tAire dhúinn go soláthrófaí fostaíocht dóibh ar thionscal éigin eile agus ba mhaith liom a fháil amach uaidh ar eirigh leis na daoine a chaill a gcuid oibre ar na múnlaithe luaidh a chur ag obair ar rud éigin eile.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar go bhfuil baint ag an Roinn leis an gCoimisiún a cureadh ar bun, Coimisiún na hImirce, ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire an bhfuil aon scéal aige chomh fada agus a bhaineas sé leis an nGaeltacht. Tá tagairt déanta ag an Aire dhó san ráiteas a thug sé agus dúirt sé go raibh trí deacrachtaí ag cur isteach ar thionscal sa nGaeltacht agus á choinneáil siar:</P>
    <P>(1)  Unsettled conditions of trade both in the home and in the export market;</P>
    <P>(2)  Abnormal movement of trained workers from Gaeltacht areas;</P>
    <P>(3)  Delays in the delivery of materials.</P>
    <P>Dá n-abradh aon duine ón taobh seo go raibh &ldquo;abnormal movement of trained workers&rdquo; ann, bheadh sé le rá faoi go raibh sé ag déanamh bolscaireachta, nach raibh ina chuid cainte ach bolscaireacht páirtí, ach tá sé anseo ag an Aire é fhéin.  Taispeánann sé sin, má tá an imirce ar siúl tar éis an díograis a chuir an tAire seo isteach ina chuid oibre ar nós &ldquo;new broom,&rdquo; nach bhfuil aon mhaith locht a fháil ar an dream a bhí roimhe, go mor mhór nuair a bhí níos mó fostaíochta agus <Col N="1518" /> níos mó páighe le fáil i Sasana ná mar atá le blianta beaga anuas.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá rud nar soláthraíodh aon airgid dóibh agus ba mhaith liom iad a mheabhrú don Roinn: ba mhaith liom go bhféachfadh siad chuige go mbainfeadh siad an buntáiste is mó agus is féidir leo a bhaint as iasachtaí ó Bhoird na gCuartaíochta le guest houses do chur ar bun sa nGaeltacht; agus an fheidhm is mó agus is féidir a bhaint as an aibhléis a bheith ar fáil i gcuid de na háiteachaí sa nGaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Ar ndóigh, níor cheart gan tagairt a dhéanamh do cheist na dtithe.  Fuair mé freagra ón Aire tamall ó shoin faoi'n méid a tugadh amach ar iasacht.  Ní hé an méid airgid is mó atá i gceist agam, a mhéid nó a laghad ach an méid úis atá le n-íoc ag na daoine ar an airgead sin.  Ní mór dóibh 5 faoin gcéad a íoc ar an méid ar fad ó tosnaíodh ar iasactaí airgid a sholáthar faoi Achta na dTithe (Gaeltacht).  Tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil sé sin ró-throm agus ba cheart go mbreannochadh an tAire isteach sa scéal seo ós rud é go bhfuil airgead dhá sholáthar anois do na daoine sna bailte móra ar 3 faoin gcéad.  Ní ceart go mbeadh an t-ualach úis sin ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Séard a thagas as go mbíonn le hais-íoc ag na daoine a fhághas na híasachtaí seo dá oiread an méid a fuaireadar agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil cothrom na Féinne annsin.  Na tithe atá á dhéanamh, tá siad go maith, agus tá tóir níos mó ar theac faoin scéim seo, mar, sa chéad dul síos, soláthraíonn an Roinn an t-abhar tógála don duine atá ag iarraidh an tí agus tá níos mó faoiseamh rátaí le fáil freisin.</P>
    <P>Tríd is tríd agus mar adúirt mé, tá meath mór ar an nGaeltacht ceal fostaíochta agus ní hé an Roinn seo atá ciontach le sin.  Is minic a dúradh linn nuair bhíomar ar na binnsí thall go rabhamar in ár gcaoirigh balbha smachtaithe, gan gíog nó focal asainn.  Ní féidir, is docha, é sin a rá faoin dream atá anois ar na binnsí ceana, ach chomh fada agus tá eolas agamsa ar an nGaeltacht thiar, bhfearr go mór i bhfad le muintir na Gaeltachta, agus b'fhearr i bhfad dóibh freisin, dá mbeadh na caoirigh balbha, smachtaithe céanna ar na binnsí sin thall <Col N="1519" /> agus an scéal a bheith amhlaidh díreach mar a bhí sé nuair a bhíomar ann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickWPalmer" hpid="Mr. Palmer Mr. Palmer">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Palmer</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time during the lifetime of the various Governments, it seems to be the popular thing to render at least lip-service to the inhabitants of the Gaeltacht.  Having regard to the circumstances prevailing there, I will admit that it is a most difficult problem to deal with.  In spite of the efforts of previous Governments, I do not think that the circumstances of the people living in these areas have been improved to any appreciable extent.</P>
      <P>I intend to deal with just two matters on this Estimate&mdash;industries in the Gaeltacht areas and Gaeltacht housing. In the Gaeltacht area I represent, scarcely anything at all has been done to promote industries.  In the centre of the Fíor-Ghaeltacht there, there is a very large building which was at one time owned by the British Government as a cable station and it was afterwards used as an Irish college. It has been vacant during the past seven or eight years and representations were made to the present Minister to see if anything could be done so that it could be used for the promotion and development of Gaeltacht industries.  The Minister had the building examined, but I am not sure what was the nature of the report.  I am referring now to the area of Ballinskelligs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In an area such as that, as in all Gaeltacht areas around the coast, there should surely be some local industry to entice the people to stay at home. If the Irish language is to be preserved some endeavour must be made to give the people an occupation supplementary to the type of economy that prevails in those areas, and that type is small farming and part-time fishing. In connection with fishing, I would imagine that some occupation such as net making or net mending could be, first of all, taught, and then carried on. In those places they could hold classes so as to teach the fishermen how to repair their boats and engines, and there would be some inducement offered to them to carry on their <Col N="1520" /> calling at less expense.  Any time a boat or a net would require repairs they need not send for an engineer to another part of the country or to the Fisheries Department.</P>
    <P>In the mountainous areas of the Gaeltacht there is a plentiful supply of wool and that could be used for the purpose of making mats and rugs and so forth.  When industries of this type were set up in Donegal, industries such as the making of toys, they appeared to be very successful.  There would be ample room for industries of this sort in the different areas in South Kerry. Even though the industries would be on a small scale they would serve to keep at least some of our young people at home and they would encourage them to remain there.  The setting up of these industries might not meet with success in all cases&mdash;there might be some failures&mdash;but I believe it would be well worth while trying.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will examine carefully the report of the inspector who visited Ballinskellings and that something will be done there.  That is the centre of the Gaeltacht area in South Kerry.</P>
    <P>As regards Gaeltacht housing, up to the present there have been hundreds of applications for grants and most of these are awaiting sanction.  I admit that the Minister recently, by the appointment of extra inspectors, made an effort to expedite the examination of the applications and the issuing of grants.  I should like to point out that various difficulties arise in connection with these grants.  If the inspectors, perhaps under instructions from the Minister or high departmental officials, could use greater discretion in the sanctioning of grants, such as in cases where all the members of the household would not have a sufficient knowledge of the Irish language, it would be helpful.  For instance, a young man from the Gaeltacht area, a native speaker, may marry a lady from the Galltacht area, and in that case no grant is sanctioned because the rule is that members of the household must have a sufficient speaking knowledge of Irish.  We should make some effort to entice people to build good homes in those areas.  The homes must be of <Col N="1521" /> the best if we are to encourage people to stay there.  I would like some instructions to be issued to the inspectors giving them certain discretion in the allocation of grants.</P>
    <P>Because of the remoteness of those areas, according to present regulations it is unlikely that the Electricity Supply Board will ever reach them with an electricity supply.  There are long distances between the villages and the expense would be so great that it would not be possible for people, with the small means that they have, to meet the expense of installation. Perhaps the Minister, in conjunction with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, might be able to arrange some scheme by which the Electricity Supply Board's services would be made available to the people in these areas. I feel that the Minister, just as other Ministers for Lands in the past, is anxious to do his best for the people in the Gaeltacht areas.  If the Irish language is to be preserved, everything possible should be done to encourage the people to settle down in these areas.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> This Estimate deals with a very poor uneconomic area, an area which, in the opinion of anyone who has regard for the language and for our native culture, deserves more from the Government.  As the Minister, who is now in charge of the Gaeltacht services, is well aware, life in the Gaeltacht is a very hard, grim proposition.  It is always a struggle for existence so far as the majority of the families there are concerned.  The Minister is well aware that the land is very poor, and that it is impossible for the families who live there to eke out even a decent livelihood from it.  In the Donegal Gaeltacht, the poor law valuation of most farms is about 30/-.  Anybody who knows anything about land realises that it would be impossible for the people to survive on such small holdings. That is all the more reason why a native Government should pay more attention to the people of the Gaeltacht and to their needs than has been done for some time past.  We have, unfortunately, in Donegal the greatest emigration that we have had there for very many years, and so, unless something is done, and done very quickly, the Gaeltacht, as we know it and as we have known it for many years, will have disappeared altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Minister is as sympathetic to the Gaeltacht as I am, and that he knows the problems there.  In view of that, I feel that more money should be spent on industries and on various schemes to help the people of that area.  As I have already said, the land is so poor there that there is no possibility of the people taking advantage of the large schemes of development put into force by various Governments.  They do not come under any of the headings in respect of those schemes because their holdings are too small and uneconomic. That is all the more reason why special consideration should be given to that very poor part of the country.  I feel that it is asking too much of the Minister for Lands, or of any Minister for Lands, to take the Gaeltacht services under his wing and to make a <Col N="1523" /> success of them.  I am not making any reflection whatever on the present Minister.  What I feel is that, after giving attention to the various problems that arise in the Land Commission in connection with land and to forestry and to the various other matters that arise in connection with his Department, the Minister will have very little time to spare to look after such an important part of the country as the Gaeltacht.  In my opinion, until such time as we have a Minister for the Gaeltacht, a Minister who will have Gaeltacht problems alone to deal with, there is very little hope of anything being done for the Gaeltacht in the way that we would like to have it done.  The Minister should co-ordinate the various schemes which are being carried out by other Departments and in that way a better success might be made of them than is being made at present.  He should, for instance, look after the rural electrification of the congested areas. He should look after the fisheries and not leave these sandwiched in as part of the work of the Department of Agriculture.  If these schemes were coordinated in the way I have suggested, life in the Gaeltacht could be made more pleasant for the people in it than it is at present.</P>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister cannot hold forth any hope for the homespun industry.  For centuries that was one of our main industries in Donegal.  It is sad to think that most of our weavers and craftsmen have left their looms and sought employment across the water. At one time the homespun industry was the mainstay of the Gaeltacht.  I would be glad if the Minister could hold out even a little hope that this industry would be brought back into at least part-time production in the near future. I feel that something must be done to put fresh industries into the congested areas in an effort to keep our young people at home.  Unless that is done the outlook for the people in these areas will be a very bleak one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago I <Col N="1524" /> listened to a Deputy on the Government Benches saying that the young people in the Gaeltacht were only too fond of running away to other countries and that, even if work was provided for them, they would not stay at home. I think that statement is not correct. I do not think a Donegal representative should make that statement.  During the war when the homespun industry was booming and the turf industry was well under way there was no difficulty whatsoever in getting workers.</P>

I do not think that these people are bitten by the bug for travel all over the world if there is work for them at their own doors.  When there was work for them they stayed at home.  It was only when the industries closed down they left.  I am very sorry to see them go.  I am sure the Minister is also very sorry, but I think the onus is on the Minister, who is in charge of the Gaeltacht areas, to ensure that as many as possible of these people will be brought back and that those who are at home will get an opportunity of doing some kind of work.  We are not satisfied with the work that has been done by the Gaeltacht Services Department.  We know the difficulties the Minister has.  I think a Minister who sandwiches in Gaeltacht Services with other duties is not fair to himself and not fair to the inhabitants of the particular areas under his jurisdiction.</P>

      <Col N="1525" /> Aontáim leis an tuairim atá aige mar gheall ar na tionscail sa nGaeltacht.

Ní leigheasfaidh obair do na cailíní agus na mná amháin, an scéal go deo.  Caithfear obair fhónta do chur ar fáil do na fir.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Ó Liathaín, bé toil Dé go mbeadh an dualgas ar na cinn tí a líontí do thabhairt suas agus do choimeád suas&mdash;a ndóthain do thuilleamh leis an gclainn do chothú do réir mar is dual do dhuine.

      <P>'Sé mo thuairim láidir é nach bhfuil tuiscint cheart ag an gcuid is mó againn ar a thábhachtaí is atá an Ghaeltacht agus a mbaineann léi, mar dá mbeadh tuiscint cheart againn ní bheadh an scéal mar atá sé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá ár ndícheall á dhéanamh againn chun deire a chur le crích-dheighilt na tíre.  Cé acu is tábhachtaí?  Tá, a fhios agam go bhfuil daoine san tír agus san Tigh seo freisin gur cuma leo an Ghaeltacht agus a mbaineann léi a bheith ann nó as.  Agus tá daoine anseo a bheadh sásta, dá bhfaghaidís a rogha, ligint don Ghaeltacht bás d'fháil ach aontas na hÉireann do bhaint amach.  Ach an gnáth-dhuine sa tír seo, dá mbeadh a leithéid sin de rogha aige, ní bheadh sé nómeat amháin idir dhá chomhairle, seasóchadh sé ar taobh na Gaeltachta agus ní dhéanfadh sé í do thréigint ar aon phraghas fiú amháin aontú na tíre maidin amáireach. Taispáineann san a thábhachtaí is atá sé an Ghaeltacht do shábháilt agus í d'fheabhsú i gach slí is féidir linn.  Ar an abhar san nílimídne san Pháirtí seo lán-tsásta leis an méid atá san Vóta seo.  Bheimís toilteannach i bhfad Éireann níos mó a thabhairt don Aire, i gcóir na seirbhísí seo.  Tá géar-ghá <Col N="1527" /> le i bhfad níos mó, mar tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil áiteanna sa nGaeltacht atá fíor-bhocht&mdash;áiteanna ar nós Rosamhíl agus Leitir Mealláin. Níl aon eolas agam ar aon Ghaeltacht ach amháin Ciarraidhe agus cuid de Chonamara ach cloisim ó dhaoine a bhfuil eclas aca ar an nGaeltacht go bhfuil a lán áiteanna ann fíor-bhocht, agus mar is eol do chách nuair a bhíonn duine fíor-bhocht, gan aon talamh aige ach an leac lom, cailleann sé misneach agus cailleann sé a fhearúlacht. Molaim don Aire maidir leis na daoine bochta san, muna bhfuil sé ar a chumas obair fhónta do sholáthar dóibh, iad d'aistriú as na háiteanna ina bhfuilid agus iad do shocrú ar an talamh maith i lár na hÉireann nó in áit éigin eile a mbeadh talamh maith le fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá rudaí eile a bheadh ar chumas an Aire a dhéanamh gan mórán moille. An talamh do dhreineáil agus a chur i n-oiriúint ionas go bhféadfadh an t-aos óg peile agus cluichí eile d'imirt. Pinniúireacha do thógáil.  Tá na clocha go flúirseach san gach Gaeltacht. Ní fheadar cén fá nar chuir Cumann Luth-Chleas Gael spéis éigin san nGaeltacht go nuige seo&mdash;rud a mbeifeá ag súil leis.</P>
    <P>Ar aon chuma tá leigheas an scéil i lámha an Aire anois.  Ní gá dó bheith ag brath ar aoinne eile nó ag fanúint le húdarás.  Tá a fhios aige go bhfaighfidh sé pé méid airgid atá de dhith air ón Tigh seo.  Ná bíodh eagla air margheall air san.  Tá an t-eolas aige.  Ní gá dó bheith ag brath air éinne eile eolas do sholáthar dó.  Ní féidir fanúint a thuille.  Tá an scéal práinneach agus ar an abhar san iarraim ar an Aire luí isteach san obair agus geobhaidh sé uainne go léir pé cabhair a theastaíonn uaidh.</P>

Ní théann an rud deacair féin ó réiteach má téitear ina cheann mar is eóir agus toil a bheith lena réiteach.</P>
    <P>Choinnigh an Ghaeltacht oidhreacht ar sinsir nuair a scaoil an chuid eile den tír uathu í.  Ach tá faitíos orm go bhfuil sí ag imeacht uainn go tréan. Tá na sean-daoine ag imeacht uainn agus an chuid is fearr dar n-oidhreacht ag imeacht leo.</P>

    <P>Tá an aibhléis anois i gceantair i gConamara.  Tá se sa Spidéal agus i Magh Cuilinn cheana féin, dhá cheantar an-Ghaeltach.  Ach ní stopfa sé ansin. Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire a dhícheall le déantuis a chur ar bun sa dá cheantar sin le saothrú a thabhairt do na daoine ann agus a gcoinneál ann.  Ach caithfe an aibhléis dul ar fud Chonamara.</P>
    <P>Dúirt an tAire Tionscail agus Tráchtála nach féidir é a dhéanamh, nach féidir aibhléis a chur ar fud an cheantair.  Ní hé sin é ach caithfear é a dhéanamh.</P>

    <P>Tá an Ghaeltacht ós ar gcionn uilig. Is ann a chuaigh an Piarsach, agus Eoin MacNéill a chuaigh go hArainn, agus is mór an lán d'fhoghlaim an Piarsach ann agus ba mhór é a ómós don Ghaeltacht.  Ach tá sí ag fáil bháis. Tiocfaidh an tráth nach mbeidh sé <Col N="1529" /> ann do réir mar atá an chosúlacht anois.  Agus tiocfaidh an tráth nuair a bheas muide imithe, go mbeidh daoine ina suí ar na bínsí seo ag fiafraí céard a rinneamar nuair a scaoileamar uainn í.

Níl a chothrom sin dá fháil againne ar aon chor.  Ní mórán tithe ar bith atá dá ndéanamh sa nGaeltacht. Caithfear tuilleadh tithe a dhéanamh ann.  Tá súil agam go ndéanfamuid cuid mhaith seachas sin don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Na deontais atá ann is mór an lán maitheasa atá siad a dhéanamh ach ní mór tuilleadh ina gceann.</P>
    <P>Tá mé cinnte gur fear é an tAire a bhfuil croí mór fial aige don Ghaeltacht. Is aisti a fáisceadh é.  Bhí an Ghaeilge ag a athair agus ag a mháthair agus tá gnaoi agus gean dá réir aige don dream ar díobh é féin.  Tá mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé a dhícheall don Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick) Joseph Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Gaeltacht Services Vote is one that does not arouse a lot of debate in the House.  I do not think that that is as it should be.  While it is a small Vote, nevertheless, the work that the Gaeltacht Services division is engaged on makes it one of the most necessary and most important of all Government services.  It is important because it caters for a section of the people who are poor through no fault of their own or, at least, they have not the same facility to make good as people in other parts of the country.  They are poor because the quality of the land is poor in practically all these areas and they are poor because of an event which happened a couple of hundred years ago and which caused an overcrowding of the poorer areas.  That overcrowding is with us to a certain extent down to the present day.  Congestion is rife there and it is showing itself in many <Col N="1530" /> ways.  It is lowering the standard of living there and it is one of the causes of emigration.</P>
      <P>A mistake which quite a few Deputies made was that the Vote this year was reduced, despite the fact that I stated very clearly in my opening statement that it was increased this year.  It has actually been increased by over £50,000 of that is going to mately £30,000 of that is going to housing, which I will deal with later, but it is not decreased.</P>
      <P>Another mistake that Deputies make is that they regard this Vote in the same light as other Votes, in other words, they believe that the Government is doing good for the people the more money they spend under the Vote. That is not an indication of what is happening because, with the exception of housing, Gaeltacht Services are selling the produce of industry and that produce is accounted for by Appropriations-in-Aid which can be seen in the Estimate.  Most of it can be used within the current year.  Apart from salaries and travelling expenses, most of the money asked for is needed for wages or the purchase of materials required to keep the industries going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there was a temporary setback in quite a few branches of Gaeltacht Services immediately after the war, on the whole, things are beginning to brighten up again.  Mention was made of the homespun industry.  There is no great prospect for that at present. As a matter of fact, the records show that during the first world war homespuns enjoyed a boom, between the two wars slumped heavily and during the last war enjoyed another boom, due to the scarcity of textiles and other clothing materials.  At present there are approximately 77,000 yards of homespun, which were manufactured during the years since the war ended, on hands yet and sales are very, very poor.  Last year we succeeded in disposing of only 12,000 yards, although the materials is first class.  It is absolutely useless to ask weavers and spinners to manufacture a material for which there is no outlet either in the home market or in any world market that we have tried.  We have spared <Col N="1531" /> no effort or expense in pushing the sale of homespuns and in trying to sell the stock that is still on hands but, in my opinion, is will take another two or three years to liquidate that stock.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Breslin who said that the homespun industry was closed down.  It was not closed down. No industry was closed down.  The homespun industry was purely a cottage industry.  The last Government stepped in in 1943 and bought the material for the purpose of preventing black marketing and preventing the quality of the material from being cheapened. That could possibly have happened.  It was not true to say that Gaeltacht Services had full responsibility for the homespun industry, as it has for the Round Tower hand-woven tweed, for instance, or will have in future for the sea-rod industry and hand knitting, glove making and all the other various industries in which they are engaged. The homespun industry was a separate industry, principally in the Gaeltacht, and only in certain parts of the Gaeltacht. Gaeltacht Services were asked to step in to prevent abuses which could possibly have arisen during the war years when there was scarcity of materials on the one hand and a good deal of money in circulation on the other hand.  It is very easy to see that prices could soar to a dangerous point and that the quality of the material could deteriorate.  Either of these possibilities was not desirable at that particular time.</P>
    <P>The sea-rod industry is very promising. The future for kelp is practically nil.  Sea-rods have come into their own and I am glad to say that last year there were 3,250 tons collected and paid for as against 2,475 tons in 1948-49 and 2,683 tons in 1947-48.  A sum of £114,247 was paid to the gatherers of sea-rods last year as against approximately £9,000 in the previous year.  The increase is due to two factors&mdash;an increased tonnage gathered and an increase in price which was found possible during the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kissane and other Deputies asked why sea-rods were not gathered in Kerry, Cork and along the south <Col N="1532" /> coast.  We are investigating that.  We can only gather sea-rods where they come up on the shore.  During the passage of the Alginates Bill, about 18 months ago, I explained that sea-rods of the particular type needed grow in a certain type of sea-bed, that is, a bed that shelves gradually from the shore. You will not get sea-rods if the shore drops steeply.  They grow in that part of the sea-bed which has normally about 18 feet of water.  Naturally, the size belt depends on the gentle slope of the bed and if the bed shelves deeply you only get a narrow belt of sea-rods, which is useless.  If there are sea-rods available in Cork, Kerry or any other place, we will be only too glad to take them.  The newly reorganised factory in Kilkerrin will handle much more than they are getting at present and I anticipate a very favourable expansion of that particular branch of the industry.</P>
    <P>A good deal of discussion arose in regard to the fact that only 36 new houses were erected and only 11 reconstruction grants were paid during the year.  That is so but it is no indication of what is happening.  I think it was Deputy Con Lehane who asked for the figures.  In actual fact £63,466 was sanctioned for grants for new houses and reconstruction grants last year and the amount actually paid last year was £30,781.  In reply to a parliamentary question, I gave the figures, 36 new houses constructed and 11 reconstructions completed.  That was the position but it must not be forgotten that it takes a year and sometimes 15 or 18 months to complete a house under the Gaeltacht Housing Act.  At present, it may be of some assistance to Deputies to know there are 225 new houses under construction, grants for which have been sanctioned and 133 cases of reconstruction in progress, for which grants have been sanctioned.  The number of applications for new houses is 658 and for reconstruction 438.  These grants have been sanctioned but the work will not be completed, perhaps, by the time the Estimate comes before the Dáil next year.  Some of them will be completed but I can foresee that quite a number will not be completed. It depends on the speed with which the <Col N="1533" /> applicant goes ahead with his house. We will not hurry him.  If he takes 15 to 18 months in building a house, it is not our business to say: &ldquo;Hurry up and complete it.&rdquo;  All we are concerned with is to give the maximum grant and to allow the applicant to erect his new house in his own way, provided it conforms with the regulations laid down by the Department.</P>
    <P>It is unfair criticism, cheap criticism, to say that because only 36 grants were paid last year, it is an indication, of what the Department is doing.  Nobody asked how many houses were under construction at the moment.  The number is 225 and there are 133 reconstruction cases.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the fact that Irish is a statutory requirement before a grant can be sanctioned.  That is so.  A few Deputies deprecated any move towards changing that position. I want to see Irish the spoken language of this country, if it is at all possible, and nobody regrets more than I do any decline in the Irish speaking areas, but we must face facts.  It has been put to me several times that it is unfair that, where there is a married couple, the husband being a native speaker and the wife perhaps from an English speaking area with no knowledge of the language, the man is debarred from getting the grant.  I do not think that is exactly fair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not happening. Where there is Irish in the house, sanction is given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Then those who have been writing in and complaining to me must be making a purely fictitious case, and I do not think that is so. <Col N="1534" /> The handwoven tweed branch of the industry is doing reasonably well.  It is centred in County Donegal, in which Deputy Breslin and Deputy McFadden are interested.  Last year 120,000 yards were manufactured, and the fact that we have orders on hands at present&mdash;firm orders on which we can rely&mdash;shows that we will be very busy during the coming year.  Towards that end, certain extensions and improvements in the spinning mill at Kilcar are contemplated.  There is no doubt about the quality of the Round Tower handwoven tweed.  It is first class, and is certainly booming at the moment, and I think I am safe in forecasting that it will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Another very useful branch is the toy industry.  We have three factories &mdash;Crolly, County Donegal; Cashel, County Galway; and Elly Bay, North Mayo.  I want to pay a compliment to the workers there on the quality of their work.  It is excellent and second to none in the world.  The leaden metal industry fell on evil days after the war.  It was one of those things that boomed during the war for some unaccountable reason and which, as soon as the war was over&mdash;principally, I suppose, because they were confined to a military type of toys&mdash;the demand for them fell off, and we found it necessary to discontinue their manufacture completely and to change over. Fortunately, from previous experience, the Department was aware that a falling off would come, and when it came, it came as no surprise.  The Department was prepared for it, and was able to switch over and to replace the leaden metal toys with another type of industry, the making of parts for soft toys, which up to about a year ago we were purchasing principally from Canada.  The three factories are going fairly well and, as I say, not alone is the output satisfactory, but the quality is second to none, due to the skill of the workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One Deputy mentioned that the sub-head for materials was down by £8,000.  The Minister asks the House each year for a certain amount of money which he anticipates will meet his requirements in respect of materials for the coming year, and the <Col N="1535" /> reason that sub-head is down is that we have £108,000 worth of material on hands this year as against £93,985 worth last year.  In other words, we have almost £15,000 worth more material this year than last year, and we anticipate that will be quite sufficient for our needs.</P>
    <P>Emigration from the Gaeltacht was commented on by practically every Deputy.  No Deputy on any side wants to see it, if it can be arrested or stopped, but it is true that Gaeltacht Services cater more for the employment of girls and women than the employment of men.  It is correct to say that, and until something is done for the male population in the Gaeltacht I am afraid the emigration will continue. It is for that reason that the Government has decided on the forestry programme which has been announced and which is known to everybody in the House and outside of it and which therefore needs no further comment from me.  We must give employment to the natural breadwinners in any area if we intend to nail down the population there.  It is for that reason that I caused a survey to be made of the suitable plantable land of the country and my first ideas in that connection have proved to be correct, that the greatest area of plantable land lies in the Gaeltacht and that a big industry like forestry is the only industry which will meet the problem and serve to hold down the population.</P>
    <P>The land is of poor quality from an agricultural point of view, but I say without any hesitation that it is not of poor quality from a forestry point of view.  In a great many areas the first crop of timber may not be of first-class quality, but the second and succeeding crops certainly will.  We can continue to export money to buy our requirements of timber and to export our population to work abroad if we want to do so, but if we want to stop it, or at least make a beginning on the stopping of it, we must get down to the one big industry which will save the Gaeltacht, and that, in my opinion, is forestry.  I am going all out for that, as are the present Government.  I have said repeatedly that arable land and semi-arable land capable of being <Col N="1536" /> reclaimed should be utilised for the production of food.  The land which cannot be reclaimed, or which it would be too costly to reclaim, should be kept under timber, as has been done in other countries.  This country is badly denuded of timber.  We have to pay out over £3,000,000 each year for our timber requirements, and between actual timber and wood products we pay out something like £8,000,000.</P>
    <P>We can keep all that money at home. It will not be done, no matter how we try, this year, next year, the year after or in 20 years' time; but if we do not start now, a start will not be made. Every day it is put off will see the same poverty in the Gaeltacht areas, the same emigration from these areas and the same money leaving the country for material which we could produce equally well at home.</P>
    <P>This Government has done a great deal for the Gaeltacht areas, through Gaeltacht Services.  It means to do more through forestry, and through land reclamation in arable areas that lie in pockets in the Gaeltacht areas. In the improvement of stock a great deal has been done by the Minister for Agriculture, who intends to do a great deal more in the improvement of strains of stock and so on.</P>
    <P>Taking it on the whole, the picture I had to present to the House this year was much brighter than that presented last year or the year before.  Whatever little slump or upset occurred as a result of the cessation of the world war has, thank God, come to an end and things are looking much brighter for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if the 46 people who lost employment through the closing down of the Spiddal lead model industry have been re-employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that. We mean to re-employ as many as possible, to hold them.  The change over from leaden toys to hard body parts, which is an innovation in Gaeltacht Services, is meant to absorb them.  The number in the leaden industry was falling for a number of years until it had dwindled from 90 to 43, and of the <Col N="1537" /> 43 at the time these toys were completely shut off, I think only 25 were working.  The workers were inclined to leave us, in any case.  Apart from that, we are anxious to re-employ those displaced as a result of the failure of the lead toy market.  I have not details for the Deputy, but I will let him know by letter if he wishes.</P>

In Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, and particularly in Donegal, there are fairly large areas, some of them in the hands of the Land Commission and some privately owned, and we are doing all we can about them.  There is a shortage of acquisition officers.  There was only one acquisition officer for the whole Twenty-Six Counties.  We have increased that to eight and hope to get five or six more.  We have not sufficient at present.  As soon as the Land Bill is passed, a section of which contains a special clause to enable us to subdivide commonage at the request of the owners, we will speed the work up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Blowick)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6, a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>6.&mdash;Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) possession has, whether before or after the passing of this Act, been taken of any land under Article 38 of the Emergency Powers Order, 1939 (S. R. &amp; O., No. 224 of 1939), and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the value of the land has been increased by any works carried out on the land at the cost of <Col N="1539" /> a Minister of State, the former Turf Development Board, Limited, or Bord na Móna during the period for which possession of the land was retained under the said Article 38, and</P>
    <P>(c) the land is, within five years after possession thereof under the said Article 38 has been terminated, acquired or resumed under the Land Purchase Acts,</P>
    <P>then, in fixing the price or compensation on the acquisition or resumption under those Acts and notwithstanding any other provision of this or any other Act, no account shall be taken of, or compensation allowed in respect of, any such increase in value.</P>
    <P>This new section proposes to deal with land taken over by the Turf Development Board or the Department of Industry and Commerce in the same way as the present Section 6 relates to land taken over by county councils.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to be sure that the increased value of the land in this case should be the increased value from the point of view of the farmer and not the increased value from the point of view of the invading Department.  Also, there is a limit of five years.  If an increase in value has been created, has it been destroyed by the passing of the years? If five years, why not three years? After all, five years is a long span.  I think the Minister should lessen that period.  Principally, I want to be assured that this is a proposal in regard to an improvement from the farmer's point of view and not from that of the invading Department.  It is quite possible that certain drains necessary by Bord na Móna or somebody else would make a farm of more value to that Department while it might not make it more valuable from the point of view of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to charge and impose certain duties of customs and inland revenue (including excise), to amend the law relating to customs and inland revenue (including excise) and to make further provisions in connection with finance, it is expedient to authorise:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas in the financial year ending on the 31st day of March, 1951, of a sum not exceeding £2,000,000 into the Transition Development Fund;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  that a sum of £655,432 to redeem borrowings, and interest thereon, in respect of capital services shall be charged annually on the Central Fund in the 30 successive financial years commencing with the financial year <Col N="1548" /> ending on the 31st day of March, 1951.</P>
    <P>This Money Resolution is necessary because of the charges out of public funds which arise under Section 21 and Section 22 of the Finance Bill.  The first is the one which gives authority for payment into the Transition Development Fund of a sum not exceeding £2,000,000 in the current year.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a reference to borrowing.  The Minister is seeking power to borrow for the purposes of capital services and I think, in that connection, one is entitled to reply to a recent statement by the Taoiseach, pointing out that the Government are providing the enormous sum of £30,000,000, or some such figure, for capital expenditure during the present year, as against £5,000,000 during the last year Fianna Fáil were in office.  I do not know whether the Taoiseach wishes the country to believe that the circumstances in 1950 are comparable to the circumstances in 1947 so far as the implementation of large scale expenditure programmes is concerned; but we remember that when the present Minister for Finance was confronted in that year with the proposals of the then Government, he expressed astonishment at the, as he termed it, fantastic nature and size of the expenditure, which he severely criticised.  As as a matter of fact, I do not think that <Col N="1549" /> he even troubled to criticise it so much as rather to dismiss it&mdash;a mere question of £100,000,000 or £200,000,000. It was all the same to the Minister at that time; it simply meant that the Government had embarked on a thoroughly foolish or even a lunatic policy at the time, if we were to take the Minister's observations seriously.</P>
      <P>I called attention, in the debate on the Financial Resolutions, to the Minister's references on that occasion to capital expenditure on such services as roads, telephones and so on.  He saw no necessity for them, and I think the general gist of his remarks was fairly well summarised when he concluded by saying that, fortunately, the programme presented by the then Government was merely a programme, and would probably never be carried into effect.  It seems to denote a belief in an extraordinarily short memory, not alone in the minds of the public, but in the minds of political persons, if it were to be assumed that we were going to let the occasion pass without calling attention to it when the Taoiseach boasts of the large scale capital expenditure at the present time compared to what was contemplated in 1947.</P>
      <P>I need not worry the House by going into details of the position as it existed then, or the circumstances that operated to prevent the carrying out of a large scale programme with the speed and to the extent that the Government would have wished.  Suffice it to call attention to one particular aspect, and that was the shortage of materials which everyone knows made it impossible to proceed with housing or road works or telephone development on the scale one would have wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach's remarks, which contained the gem that the country was overtaxed when this Government came into office, must have been rather in the nature of a smoke-screen to try to persuade people that there is some consistency about a Government, the chief members of which&mdash; and they are now mainly responsible for this capital investment policy&mdash;expressed an entirely different view and adopted a severely critical attitude a <Col N="1550" /> few years ago.  The mere fact that conditions have changed, in the sense that supplies are more freely available and we are nearer to normal trading conditions, could not possibly explain the extraordinary change that has taken place; neither could the change in the views of the political economists who advise the Government.  The fact is that the Minister has been driven from the philosophy and the policy he then advocated and he has been driven, we do not know why, but we can surmise, to accept and to try to put across the country a policy of which he was, perhaps, the most outspoken and severe critic in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back over what has been said on the Financial Resolutions, but I think it is necessary, at least, to refer to them and to the fact that the grandiose schemes which were so severely condemned as being symtoms of megalomania and squandermania and all the other manias, have now become virtues and are to be exalted.  Of course, those unusual changes of mind and attitude are perhaps to be explained by a better idea and a better realisation of political necessities.  You have the same Government which, when it took office, announced its intention to enforce retrenchment over a very wide field and cut out expenditure unless it was absolutely essential&mdash;to embark on a courageous policy of cutting down the cost of Government&mdash;now presenting us with a bill for £87,000,000 in respect of Government services while, in the year when the Minister was so outspoken in his criticisms, the cost of corresponding services amounted to only £65,000,000.</P>
    <P>Far from trying to justify his departure from the policy he announced regarding the careful scrutiny of expenditure and the necessity for justifying up to the hilt all projects of a capital nature, the Minister now seems to have thrown discretion to the winds. Instead of, as he told us, being ashamed that out of an expenditure of £70,000,000 he could only account for some £6,000,000&mdash;he hoped to be able to argue that he had made economies but £6,000,000 out of £70,000,000 he described as very little&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Financial Resolution springs out of Sections 21 and 22 of the Finance Bill and raises what is really the fundamental difference in policy between Fianna Fáil and the present Government.  We are not against loans for any productive purpose, especially if they are of a dollar-earning nature rather than of a sterling-earning capacity.  I think I remember the present Minister for Finance referring at one time to the coming of sterling into this country as paper money.  While we would not go so far as to say that now, we think there is a grave defect in Government policy in this way, that they did not at an earlier stage devote a great deal more time to directing their financial policy to the earning of dollars rather than to any form of external assets. The fundamental difference between us is this: that while we would raise loans for productive purposes, or even in time of emergency for non-recurrent liabilities, we feel that to raise money for recurring non-productive liabilities is to break down a very important principle.  Once you break that barrier the public, especially the public that is sensitive to financial considerations and to the economic prosperity of the country, will feel that the painter is cut and that the boat is, shall we say, drifting, because a grave principle has been breached.  It is all very well to <Col N="1552" /> say that it is only a small breach.  I think the Minister, in his concluding speech on the Budget, argued that it was only to the amount of about £2,000,000.  Still, it was a breach.  That gives the public a feeling of insecurity &mdash;that, if it can be broken in this matter, the breach can be widened in other matters.  We hold that social services should depend upon the standard of living in the country.</P>

      <P>There are two sums of money referred to in this Financial Resolution.  Any remarks made have been directed to the second part of it &mdash;the £655,432.  That sum has nothing <Col N="1553" /> to do with telephone development or most of the things which Deputy Derrig mentioned.  The £655,432 is the sum, calculated at a rate of interest of 3½ per cent., with sinking fund, that is necessary to redeem the £12,000,000 found in the Estimates.  It has nothing to do with roads or any of the other matters which have been spoken of.</P>
      <P>Deputy Derrig feels that no great changes have occurred either to Deputies or to economists outside to make them change from the point of view which people had in 1947.  The change that has taken place is significant. The change is that supplies are much better.  The supplies of consumer goods are much better than they were before.  I gave the figures when closing on the Budget Resolutions.  Industrial production, in volume, is up 43 percent, since 1948; agricultural production, in volume, is level with pre-war; the exports of agricultural goods are running something about 10 per cent. below the 1938 level; imports are higher than they were pre-war. That means that more goods are being produced here, that less are being exported, and that more goods are being imported.  In these circumstances, the danger there was of spending a vast amount of money during the war, or even as late as 1947, is certainly, if present at all, nothing like the danger there was in those days.  Conditions have changed.  That is why a policy that would have been a danger, and that quite clearly was open to criticism in 1945, 1946 and 1947, should be accepted as an acceptable policy now. Deputy Little has objected to housing being financed by borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we not entitled to question the raising of money unnecessarily for purposes which could have been avoided by the proper discharge of the Minister's duties?  With regard to income-tax, it is a very substantial portion of the tax revenue of the country, leaving out of consideration for the moment surtax and supertax lest it might be suggested that we are only interested in those bloated capitalists, who, we were told a few years ago, were lining their pockets while exploiting the unfortunate poor people here and elsewhere.  The receipts from income-tax in 1947-48 came to about £12,000,000 out of a total sum of £56.6 million; that is a little over one-fifth of the total sum.  In 1948-49 the £12,000,000 had increased to £14.6 million and formed a still higher proportion of tax revenue.  In that year also the Minister for Finance was able to announce that receipts from income-tax and surtax had actually brought him in £1,500,000 more than he had estimated.  It seems incredible that the estimates from this important source of revenue, a great deal of which must come from taxation paid by persons in receipt of fixed incomes, should not have been calculated more accurately.  I think the point in that is that, when the Minister tells us that he expects a certain amount, for example, during the present year some £16.7 million from this source of taxation, it is quite likely that it will be at a much higher figure.  Of course, some catastrophe may occur, but if the trend continues&mdash;and there is no evidence in the conditions governing the circulation of money that it will not so continue since the Minister has emphasised to us that conditions are rather favourable&mdash;I think some of the pointers that he has given are not perhaps quite as favourable as he anticipates; for example, agricultural exports which might be very favourable if we were to adopt the very optimistic policy based on them.  However, assuming that conditions are relatively prosperous in so far as the circulation <Col N="1556" /> of money is concerned and that these conditions will continue&mdash;and I think it is quite likely that as in 1948-49, when the Minister for Finance got in £1,500,000 more than he had estimated from income-tax and surtax, and last year when he got in over a million pounds more than he had estimated, I think it is quite likely to continue and that sufficient consideration has not, perhaps, been given, in view of the fact that the buoyancy of revenue is being maintained, to the possibilities of reducing the burden particularly upon those in the lower income groups. I think that if the Minister's financial rectitude is so very exacting that in relation to his borrowing policy he did not find it possible to give a reduction on the flat rate of income-tax, there were other methods open to him by which he could justify the policy of giving incentives, for example, to those in industry, whether as employers or employees.  He could have increased the allowance; he could have made adjustments that would encourage both employees and employers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A significant feature of this income-tax question is the big increase in the number of working-class people who are now paying income-tax.  The Minister attributes part of the surplus over and above his Estimate, which has accrued to the Exchequer, as in measure due to this fact.  I daresay we shall be told, as indeed we have been told even from the Labour Benches, that the working-class people having received, according to those who claim to be their spokesmen here, compensation for the increased cost of living are not suffering to the extent they might otherwise have to suffer.  It might be argued that they are not suffering from taxes since they are paying at a lower rate of tax.  They have more money available to them.  But I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce made it quite clear last week that the cost of living is going up largely because of factors over which he claimed he has no control.  To that extent he disagrees with the Minister for Finance, who claims that there is no increase in the cost of living.  If there is an increase and if the income-tax figure does not represent the realities of the situation and if people have more calls <Col N="1557" /> made upon them&mdash;if in other words, although goods are more plentiful they have not sufficient cash at their disposal to purchase their necessities because of high prices, that means that, if taxation is kept at an unduly high level, more appropriate to acute conditions of emergency or very severe inflation, they have less money at their disposal to spend in whatever way they think best.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, believes that it can spend the money better and the policy that was described long ago as leaving the money in the pockets of the people so that it might fructify there and accrue to the general national benefit in a free economy is now being increasingly trespassed upon by the belief of the State that it can take an increasing share of the earnings of the people, whether through income-tax or contributions.</P>

      <P>If a working man has £5 per week and if he has to pay income-tax on that, in addition to the other taxes he pays on the commodities that he consumes, and if whether through conditions over which the Government has or has not control, he finds a big increase in his weekly housekeeping budget, I think it is germane to argue that, in order to enable him to fill his requirements of food and clothing and household necessities, the Government should have made a greater effort to reduce income-tax.  Or if they could not reduce the flat rate in existing circumstances, they should have been more generous with regard to the allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister spoke in the Budget statement of private investment which occupied a very subordinate place, indeed, with reference to the capital investment lay-out which he has put before the country.  I think it is the general belief that if the policy of State capital investment is carried to an undue degree, it must necessarily interfere with private investment.  If the Minister, however, feels that the policy <Col N="1558" /> of capital investment is now going to be justified&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>How the policy of capital investment arises on a section dealing with income-tax, I fail to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is not the right place to raise it.  I was leading up to the point that, as far as the investing public are concerned, their capacity to invest, just the same as the capacity of the workman to purchase his requirements, must be affected by the direct or indirect taxation they have to pay.  The capacity and the will of the investor to put his money into Irish industries or Irish industrial development, and particularly to realise the securities he holds in investments or funds elsewhere, will be affected&mdash;I think it is a legitimate argument&mdash;by the level of taxation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce stated that one of the functions of the Industrial Development Authority is to get in touch with persons in Great Britain and elsewhere who might come into this country to start industries here.  Whether they are persons who have been invited here to start industries, or whether they arc our own citizens who are being encouraged to realise their savings and invest them at home, the level of taxation must certainly influence them in the decisions they are going to come to. In the case of a person who has invested his savings or his capital in his own industry, I suggest the argument is more germane still.  It has been suggested that capital in business requires replacement to the extent of at least 10 per cent. every year.  That, I think, is not considered excessive in general accounting practice for depreciation of a great proportion of the plant and machinery and for re-equipment.  I think it is a fairly representative figure, particularly at a time when conditions are changing so rapidly and when industrialists or others conducting businesses are in danger of finding themselves driven out of the market almost over-night, through the adoption of better methods by their competitors.  If it is the attitude of the <Col N="1559" /> Ministry, as seems to be indicated by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that since those in charge of protected industries are having a very good time and the Government is doing so much for them, it seems a rather troublesome way of collecting revenue to allow the consumer to be mulcted by increased prices which the Minister says almost invariably accompany protected industries, and then try to get back these profits into the revenue through a high level of taxation. Supposing an industrialist is carrying on his business honestly and fairly and making every effort to sell his produce at a price that is fair to the consumer, he has certain risks such as the one I have spoken of.</P>
    <P>If he proposes to go into the export market&mdash;and the Government have set up a special committee to deal with exports&mdash;he is going to undertake greater risks and it is doubtful, if without very considerable incentives and encouragement, even our most successful industrialists would feel themselves called upon to take risks that they may feel are unnecessary in order to develop our export trade.  The Minister is in a position to give the most direct and most beneficial incentive, I suggest, to entrepreneurs, exporters or industrialists by showing them that he appreciates the value of their contribution to the national economy and is anxious to encourage them further by reducing taxation.  I regret very much that the Government has not seen its way to increase the allowances.</P>
    <P>Turning again to the ordinary income-tax payers with a regular income in the lower grades, we find that there has been no change, so far as I know, in the earned income allowance for a considerable period.  With regard to the allowance for children, although we are supposed to have more normal conditions now and to have put the war emergency situation completely behind us&mdash;in fact we were looking with such confidence to the future that we were embarking on these very large schemes &mdash;these allowances are the same as they have been for some years.  The Minister in giving the allowance for children from the date of birth was surely not being over-generous from <Col N="1560" /> the social point of view.  If the children of the country are to be educated and are to have a background that will enable them to take a prominent part in the development of the State and the building up of the country later on, it is surely of the greatest importance, remembering the great cost of everything connected with a family at the present time&mdash;the cost of education, travel and of securing professional qualifications being so extremely high &mdash;that the Minister should go much further than he has to increase these allowances.</P>

      <P>Certain costs have risen considerably.  There has been an increase in the cost of living although I am sure the Minister does not like to admit it.  The allowance is £260 for a married income-tax payer and £140 for a single person.  Will the Minister agree that I am right about the 1947 Act having raised the married allowance and the personal allowance?  The personal allowance is £140 and the married allowance is £260.  Up to that there was an exemption.  My point is that it is very hard on certain classes of people to whom a living wage would only be about £5 or £6 a week&mdash;people of the clerical classes and those who are very heavily hit because they have to pay income-tax on their wages.  I suggest that the Minister should reconsider that matter.  It probably would not mean a great deal if he were to introduce on the Report Stage an increase so as to raise the figures from £260 and from £140 to some other figures more suitable to the present economic position of those classes.</P>

      <P>I suppose one would not be allowed to hark back to the jeremiads which used to be the habitual song from these benches about the hapless position of the income-tax payer because, if one were, it would be rather pleasant to see with what patience the Minister would listen to some extracts from his own speeches and the speeches of some of his present colleagues.  However, it is not necessary for us to torment the Minister by awakening the recollections of some of the statements which he made from these benches.  The only difference between then and now is that what the Minister said then was not well-founded but that what we are saying now is well-founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income-tax is the tax of all taxes that bears most heavily upon the man who is in receipt of a fixed income of moderate dimensions.  Nobody will waste many tears upon the person who pays surtax, particularly in the higher ranges.  There is, indeed, even there, of course, something to be said as to the wisdom and expediency of taxing a man who is able to earn a substantial income so heavily that he will refrain from bringing his talents for direction and administration into full play because he may regard the remuneration or reward which he is permitted to retain for his own use as not being commensurate with the trouble and worry which these greater activities would involve him in.  Therefore, as I have said, while I am not asking the House to commiserate unduly with the position of the person who is fortunate enough to be a surtax payer within the higher ranges of surtax, I do not want the House to take it either that I believe that it is, from the point of view of public policy and <Col N="1562" /> interest, a good thing to overtax any element in the community no matter how great the taxable capacity of that element may be.  I propose, instead, to ask the House to consider the position of those people who earn moderate incomes and who find themselves in the position that, in addition to paying all the other taxes which the more vocal and better organised elements in the community have to pay, they have to accept and to meet as best they can the present heavy impost of income-tax. The position of these persons who are in the enjoyment of moderate incomes and particularly those who are in the lower ranges was one that some years ago moved the members of the Labour Party&mdash;who are conspicuously absent from this debate&mdash;to plead on their behalf that something should be done to mitigate their position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Little has referred to the fact that in the Budget for 1947 and the Finance Act of 1947 the personal allowances were increased to their present figures of £260 in respect of a married income-tax payer and £140 in respect of the personal allowance of an unmarried income-tax payer.  The fact that in that particular year, when things were much more difficult than they are now, when we had just emerged from the six or seven anxious years of the war, the personal allowance was increased&mdash;in those particular circumstances&mdash;was evidence that the Government of the day was seriously concerned about the position of that respectable element in the community which is known as &ldquo;the middle classes&rdquo;.  But, despite the fact that the increase was granted in those circumstances, it was not sufficient to meet the situation so far as the Labour Party of the day regarded it.</P>
    <P>When he spoke on the finance statement of that year, the present Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Martin O'Sullivan, expressed his bitter disappointment that the increases in the personal allowances had not been substantially greater and he went on to make a very eloquent plea for the smaller income-tax payer.  He was supported in that view by many members of the Fine Gael Party who were then in Opposition.  It is very regrettable <Col N="1563" /> that, now that they are in a position to give effect to their opinions in regard to this matter, in this year, when so much more is being taken from the taxpayer in indirect taxes than was taken in the year 1947-48, neither the main element in the Coalition, the Fine Gael Party, nor that other key element in the Coalition, the Labour Party, have felt it incumbent upon them to give practical effect to the opinions which they expressed in 1947-48.  I say it is highly regrettable, regrettable from many points of view, regrettable from the point of view of the taxpayers who are going to be affected by this but regrettable also from the point of view, if one may so put it, of political morale.  How can anybody believe that the statements which were made on that occasion were made sincerely?</P>
    <P>It cannot be alleged against us that we had not regard, when we were in office, to the position of people who enjoyed the more moderate incomes which were subject to income-tax because, as I have said, even in the year 1947-48 we gave a practical expression to the concern which we had for their position.</P>
    <P>But, what is the position to-day in relation to these people?  At the standard rate of income-tax of 6/6 in the £, it is approximately true to say that there are very many people in this State&mdash;far too many people in this State&mdash;who have to give at least one day out of three in forced labour, if you like, to the Government because that, if you look at it in one way, is what the standard rate of 6/6 in the £ means.  For every over and above his personal allowance and earned income allowance which a man earns he has to give away 6/6 of that to the Government.  It is a rough figure. If it were 6/8 it would be exact.  If you try to appraise that or express it in terms of time, it really comes to this, that, in addition to paying his due share of all the customs and excise duties, the man who earns more than his personal allowance and his earned income allowance works one day in three for the Government and a lot of people who are capable of rendering productive service to the community <Col N="1564" /> as a whole are beginning to wonder whether, from their point of view, from the point of view of their health, from the point of view of their ease and personal comfort, it is worth continuing to do that any longer.  That is one aspect of this question to which enough attention is not being devoted.</P>
    <P>There is another, of course, and that is the hardship which income-tax represents so far as the family of moderate means is concerned.  It is a tax which is imposed arbitrarily, collected in many cases at its source. The individual who has to pay it has to pay, as I have said, his share of all the other taxes as well.  This tax takes priority.  It is now in the same position as any ordinary indirect tax so far as the majority of the income-tax payers go.  Therefore, before a man can provide for his family, he has to pay this tax.  Rents are going up.  The cost of living is going up.  The Labour Party have been very vocal about the cost of living outside this House. Demands are pouring in from all the organised elements in the community for greater remuneration but the small income-tax payer who does not belong to the Workers' Union of Ireland or the Transport Workers' Union or any of the other consolidated vested interests in the State, has no redress.  There is nobody who can put in a demand for him that he will secure increased remuneration to compensate him for the increase in the price of boots, the increase in the price of clothes and the increase in the price of food, which is now admittedly the common experience of every one of us.  He has to pay for his children's education.  He has to meet all his obligations in respect of insurance policies, mortgages and one thing and another, and, on top of that, he has to give one day's labour in three to the service of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not think that, from the point of view of the public policy and from the point of view of social justice, that position should obtain any longer and I particularly do not think that it should obtain when we consider what is now the yield from income-tax, as it is estimated to be, by comparison with what it was in the year 1947-48. The figures, when they are quoted, will <Col N="1565" /> be admitted, by all who look at them impartially, to be startling.</P>
    <P>We remember the outcry there was in 1947-48 about the burden of taxation. We remember all the speeches that were made about reducing taxation in order to bring down the cost of living.  Let us see how that condition has been fulfilled so far as this particular tax which we are now discussing is concerned.</P>
    <P>The net receipt for the year ended 31st March, 1948, from income-tax, after repayments and allowances, amounted to £11,705,633.  For the year 1948-49, the net receipt had increased from £11,705,633 to £14,500,000, that is to say, in one year, under the Government which was to reduce taxation, the net receipt from income-tax had gone up by £2,800,000.  What is going to be the position this year?  In this year, according to the Minister's statement, the estimated yield from income-tax is going to amount to £16,715,000.  Let me give the figures again.  The net receipt for the year ended 31st March, 1948&mdash; that was the year in which the Fianna Fáil Government went out and the Coalition Government came in&mdash;was £11,705,000.  The estimated yield for the current year from income-tax only &mdash;I am neglecting supertax and surtax because, as I said at the beginning, I am not so particularly concerned with that class of taxpayer&mdash;is £16,715,000. We can all do a simple sum in subtraction, and, if we take £11,705,000 from £16,715,000, we get an increase in the amount of income-tax to be collected as compared with what was collected in 1947-48 of no less than £5,010,000.  To put it another way, the income-tax payer is now paying £3 for every £2 he paid in 1947-48.</P>
    <P>Some weeks ago, I put down a question to the Minister for Finance asking what the net loss would be to the Exchequer if the standard rate of tax were reduced by 1/- in the £.  I cannot give the exact figure he gave me, but, speaking from recollection, I think it was £1,484,000.  To what extent could he reduce the standard rate if he were to be content with collecting from the income-tax payer in 1950-51 the same amount as was collected by the Fianna Fáil administration in 1947-48?  It will <Col N="1566" /> not, of course, represent the dividend you would receive if you divided £5,000,000 by £1,484,000&mdash;I admit that &mdash;but nevertheless, you can see that if the Minister were content to collect only the same amount in income-tax in this year as Fianna Fáil were content to collect in their last year of office, a very substantial reduction could be made in the standard rate of tax, or, if that method of relieving the income-tax payer did not appeal to the Minister and to sections of the House, the problem could be approached in another way, and a very substantial increase given in the earned income allowances, the personal allowances or the allowances in respect of children under 16 or still being educated.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that, bearing in mind that the Government and members of the House who now support it generally regarded taxation as being excessive in 1947-48, there is in this one tax an ample margin for giving practical effect to the opinions expressed when in opposition and before they became the Government.  I think, therefore, the House requires to consider very seriously the proposal the Minister has put before it and the House ought to receive from the Minister a reasoned defence of this proposal.  Having regard to the Minister's own record in the matter, it seems to be a completely indefensible proposal, because, as I have pointed out, the yield from income-tax in this year is estimated to be £5,010,000 more than was collected by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1947-48, or, for every £2 the income-tax paying classes were paying in 1947-48, they are now paying £3.</P>
    <P>Surely when we remember how very vocal certain satellite organisations of Fine Gael were in regard to the position of the professional classes during 1947-48, it is up to Fine Gael, which used to profess to represent the salaried classes in the community, to justify the manner in which it has completely ignored the interests of these classes.  Shopkeepers' profits may be going up; manufacturers' profits are not going up.  The salaries of public officers undoubtedly have increased, but the increases which public officers have received by way <Col N="1567" /> of salaries could not possibly account for the enormous increase in the amount of money now being collected in the way of income-tax, and the only conclusion one can come to is that in this year, when things, to the common knowledge of everybody, are very much more difficult than they were in 1947-48, the Minister is going to collect £5,000,000 more than was collected during that year.</P>
    <P>We know that the fact is that the tax is levied upon the income of preceding years and it means that, perhaps, in any given year, more will be collected than the personal circumstances of the taxpayer would warrant in justice and equity.  It is not always possible for a person to meet the exigencies and vicissitudes of a year and make due provision for payment next year of the tax upon the income he earned this year. The probabilities are that there are very many people going to be called upon to pay tax in this year whose capacity to pay that tax is very much less than it was during the year in respect of which the tax was levied. That, again, is an argument for reducing the standard rate of tax when the circumstances of the times are becoming more difficult.  That is admittedly the position now, as I have said.</P>
    <P>When devaluation took place, we were told there would be no increase in prices within any foreseeable period. The foreseeable period has proven to be a very short one, and, before the end of this year, there will, I think, be a spectacular rise in prices, which is going to intensify the hardships which the people called upon to pay income-tax will experience.  Accordingly, having regard to that fact, having regard to the fact that the tax is levied upon an income which in many cases is already spent, having regard to the fact that, with the rising cost of living which is now tending to get out of control, the margin which will be left to the taxpayer, after the needs of subsistence have been met, to meet the demands of the Government will be so much less, it seems to me that there is a very strong argument in favour of reducing the standard rate of tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1568" /> This proposal has been put before the House by the Minister in almost a contemptuous way.  He did not, when moving it, give any reasons why the standard rate should be maintained. He refused to reply or apparently was not in a position to reply&mdash;I am not going to charge the Minister with that sort of discourtesy to the House&mdash;to the criticisms of Deputy Derrig and Deputy Little and, accordingly, the matter would have gone by default.  I do not think it can be let go by default. The Minister will have to make a case for maintaining in the year 1950-51 the standard rate of income-tax at such a level that he proposes to take from the income-tax payers £5,000,000 more than was taken in 1947-48.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the other side are very angry that we have discovered that prosperity pays a dividend. So it does.  All the ranting from the opposite side to-night, in lieu of a reasoned type of speech, simply goes to show that on a reduced rate of income-tax more money was collected than estimated, by a considerable amount, and Deputy Derrig has this evening announced that, even with the same reduced rate continuing this year, he expects that more money will accrue to the revenue.</P>

Can anyone tell me how what Deputy MacEntee said is occurring could be done?  I would like to hear the explanation. He says that things are worse and that the main revenue officials will be levying this year on incomes already spent and yet on that we are to get this vast sum of money. I do not know how that could be done at all.  I know another side of the story, that if there is a more abounding prosperity in the country, then the reduced rate of tax will bring greater revenue.  I suppose the same complaint would come from the other side of the House if I had found it possible this year to reduce the standard rate to 3/- and had got an extra million.</P>

I have taken less.  I must say that a gallant effort was made by Deputy MacEntee to get back on his own past.  In 1931 we left him with income-tax at 3/- in the £ and that was raised in the autumn of 1931 to 3/6 and the next year to 5/-.  His first lick at the income-tax was to put on 1/6.

Two years before his Government left, it was at 7/6.  In addition to that, the personal allowance about which the Deputy is so concerned was £135 for a single person in 1930-31: and his first effort was to reduce it by £10 and some years later <Col N="1570" /> by another £5.

      <P>If the Deputy thinks there is any point in them, let him tell me what they were.  He raised the rate by 1/6 in his first year and reduced the personal allowance by £10 and in 1939 he reduced it to £120.  That is the person now crying about the allowances.  The tax stood at 7/6 in 1945-46.  I am getting this money.  I have not made any change in the income-tax rate this year.  I cut it 6d. last year and got in more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, there is apparently a view in the House to-night that, even by keeping the reduced rate, there will be still more revenue accruing to the Exchequer.  That will be a welcome result, as it argues that there is more national income and argues that I am getting a certain amount of money more easily than used to be the case. Deputy Derrig thinks that workmen here are paying more in income-tax than before.  They are not.  The rate is down.  Then he added&mdash;forgetting his own immediate past&mdash;that as well they are paying more in customs and excise.  Surely the Deputy's memory is not so short as not to remember the £6,000,000 on beer and tobacco, which broke the backs of Fianna Fáil in the end?  That was given back to the working man.  He is <Col N="1571" /> paying a reduced rate of tax and paying less on beer and tobacco than he did when Fianna Fáil left.  The Deputy also holds that the policy announced, of leaving more money in the pockets of the people, is not apparently working out, as he argued that people are not able to buy as much as they could.  The facts are against the Deputies who argue that way.  May I give the figures again?  Agricultural production in volume is at the pre-war level.  Industrial production is running 43 per cent. in volume above the pre-war level.  Exports are less by 10 per cent. than they were pre-war and imports are running in volume at about 27 per cent. over pre-war.  All that means that there are more goods in the country to be purchased by the people &mdash;and they are being purchased.  That certainly does not argue that people are not able to buy.  In addition to that, the savings of the community are going up.  The Post Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates between them have shown a remarkable advance in the last two years over what they were when the Deputies opposite were last members of the Government. Therefore, we have the reduced rate of tax bringing in more revenue and more goods being purchased, we have less exported and even more imported than pre-war, and these goods are being bought.  People find it possible, with the incomes they get at home, to buy an extra store of goods and also find it possible to save money.  That argues prosperity and we have discovered that that type of prosperity pays a dividend, even though it may not be the one of paying the dividend in the rate of return of tax to the State.</P>
    <P>Deputy Derrig is very concerned about the level of investment in this country.  The investment rate will not be disturbed by any borrowing the State will do.  I showed that last year. We have given an indicator as to the room for private investment and also for State investment.  As to whether people are frightened of investing in this country and the English example the Deputy gave, I gave certain figures on the Financial Resolution and wish to give them again.  Anyone investing in <Col N="1572" /> business here at the moment is paying income-tax of 6/6 on each £1 under £2,500.  On each £1 over that, as compared with income-tax in Great Britain, he will be paying 7/10.2. In England on each £1 under £2,000 the investor will find himself mulcted at 9/-.  On each £1 over £2,000, if no profits are distributed, 10/1, and if 50 per cent. of the profits is distributed 11/2; and if all is distributed, 12/4. We have got a rather attractive situation for the investor from the far side.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Aiken, I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1. Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The duty of customs imposed by Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935) shall in respect of hydrocarbon oil chargeable with that duty be charged, levied and paid as on and from the 1st day of June, 1950, at the rate of 9d. the gallon in lieu of the rate now chargeable by virtue of sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1948 (No. 12 of 1948).</P>
      <P>(2)  The rebate allowable under sub-section (2) of the said Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, shall in respect of hydrocarbon oil on which such rebate is allowable be allowed as on and from the 1st day of June, 1950, at the rate of 9d. the gallon in lieu of the rate now allowable by virtue of sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1948.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The duty of excise imposed by the said Section 21 of the Finance Act, 1935, shall in respect of hydrocarbon oil chargeable with that duty which is sent out on or for sale or otherwise from the premises of the manufacturer thereof on or after the 1st day of June, 1950, or is used by such manufacturer on or after that date for any purpose other than the manufacture or production of hydrocarbon oil be charged, levied and paid at the rate of 7d. the gallon in lieu of the rate now chargeable by <Col N="1573" /> virtue of sub-section (3) of Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>(4)  The rebate allowable under sub-section (4) of the said Section 1 of the Finance Act, 1935, shall in respect of hydrocarbon oil on which such rebate is allowable and on which the excise duty mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section was paid at the rate of 7d. the gallon be allowed at the rate of 7d. the gallon in lieu of the rate now allowable by virtue of sub-section (4) of the said Section 4 of the Finance Act, 1948.</P>
    <P>The amendment seeks to put the taxation on petrol and hydrocarbon oil at the level which obtained before it was increased by 5d. a gallon in 1948. According to the answer to a parliamentary question to-day there seems to be a very substantial increase in the amount of petrol consumed in the country. Perhaps that may arise from the tourists to whom so much objection was taken in the past when they were &ldquo;coming in here and eating our food.&rdquo; There has also been a big increase in the registration of cars and we know that the private car is now almost a necessity.  It looks as if outside our cities and towns the car would take the place of the trap or governess car to which we were accustomed in the days of the first world war.  That is only natural in a country where half the population is on the land following agricultural pursuits and living in villages or far from communities. Because of the distance to market or to the place where they must transact their business these people find it more convenient to have a car and there is undoubtedly a big increase in the number of cars in the country.</P>
    <P>If there is truth in the Minister's prognostication that it is a sign of prosperity that the increased consumption of commodities which are taxed enables a reduction in the rate to bring in a larger revenue, perhaps even a substantially larger revenue, maybe the Minister would consider reviewing the position regarding petrol.  When the claim is made that taxation was reduced by the present Government we can point to the present instance&mdash;there being no yea or nay about it&mdash;where it was <Col N="1574" /> definitely increased by the Minister's action.  The only excuse or pretext that seemed to be offered was that there was some offset in the case of a subvention for tea.  I do not know what the extent of this subvention may be but it is scarcely so considerable as to offset to any great degree the increase in the tax on petrol.</P>
    <P>In the last year in which we were in office petrol brought in something over £1,500,000.  Last year it brought in £3,213,000.  Some other oils are included but if that is the actual figure 98 per cent. of it represents the tax on petrol.  This year it is expected that the revenue will be £3,250,000.  It is an increase of 150 per cent. since 1947-48. There was an increase in price towards the end of last year.  According to a parliamentary answer to-day the landing price per gallon of petrol from sterling areas is 10½d. and from the dollar areas from 1/1½ to 1/2.  When Deputies realise that the vastly greater part of the retail price which they are paying of 2/11¾, I think, is going to the Exchequer they will realise that the motorists are certainly paying a very considerable contribution.  In our circumstances in this country if we have all these factors of prosperity about which the Minister speaks it should not be necessary to tax the users of cars. Very often they are professional men who pay income tax and carry on with fixed salaries which cannot be described as excessive.  In the case of agricultural producers there is no doubt but their cars are an amenity.  They can use them to transport their goods to a certain extent and to do their business together with whatever limited pleasure they may take such as going for a holiday and so on.</P>
    <P>We have put down the amendment to get the opinion of the House on this question and we challenge the Minister's contention that he has not increased taxation by pointing to this specific case where he definitely has increased it.  If the hypothesis that reducing the rate brings in more money why would the Minister not try it in this case?  It is quite evident that we are not trespassing on the dollar pool to an undue extent.  I am glad to see that the proportion of petrol taken from sterling sources is increasing and <Col N="1575" /> if that trend is likely to continue then the Minister, I think, could adopt a more generous policy towards private motorists.</P>

      <P>Now that the Government's attitude is showing signs of change on the question of tourist traffic they might give an indication to the country generally of that change by helping to reduce the price of petrol, which has risen only recently.  It is a very high price and there is no doubt but that the number of cars coming into the country is increasing very considerably. I have not got the figures but I know that in some towns in Waterford the number of cars registered is continually increasing.  The private car traffic in Ireland is also well distributed all over the country and is not by any means a city activity.  As compared with other countries, a great many more cars here are registered by farmers and by people in the country.  For that reason it helps a great deal the decentralisation of our population.  Again, there is the question of the cost of transport of agricultural produce, which is a very serious matter, and the question of putting goods which deteriorate rapidly on the market quickly where they can be sold quickly.  On the whole I think it would be a very helpful thing if the Minister were to consider this amendment and make the reduction which it proposes.</P>
      <P>I do not pretend to know anything about hydrocarbon oil or what it includes, but I imagine that it must also include paraffin oil, which is such a valuable asset to the poorer people.  It is sometimes substituted for heating and cooking purposes by the poor, and for that reason a reduction there, too, would be of great advantage to those people.</P>

      <P>There is a good deal of truth in what has been said by Deputy Derrig and Deputy Little in regard to the big increase in the number of registered cars, but does it strike them when they proceed to talk along those lines the extent to which these cars are tearing up the main highways and giving far less opportunity to the ordinary <Col N="1576" /> ratepayers in the rural areas to use those roads?  As Deputy Little and Deputy Derrig should know, the increased cost of maintaining the main highways, the county roads, falls on the ratepayers.  Is it suggested that the tourists and the owners of motor cars should not pay a fair share of the increased cost of maintaining the roads?</P>

      <P>If transport is to be transferred from the iron rail to the roadways I can see the Government being faced with demands for millions to widen as well as to maintain the roads.  Is it suggested that the ratepayers, who are kept off the main roads, the trunk roads, should bear all the cost?  These roads are a menace to the ordinary ratepayer in a rural area as a result of the increased use of them by motorists, including tourists and those who run motor lorries and private cars.  No doubt, the tourists will be welcomed here and should be given facilities equal to what are given tourists in other countries, but I am not prepared to give any tourist an advantage over our ordinary citizens in regard to rights on the roads and the circumstances under which they are permitted to use the roads.  If a tourist takes a car into this country he should pay a reasonable amount for the use of our highways while he is enjoying himself on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a clamour for the stabilisation of rates and for a reduction of rates and nobody has taken a greater part in that clamour than the Fianna Fáil members of local authorities.  Of course, they do it to embarrass the Government.  There are some Deputies here on the Fianna Fáil Benches who are members of county councils.  They talk a lot about the increasing rates, but what additional means can they suggest to get the money to maintain the highways, which are becoming an increasing burden on the community? Are the ratepayers to pay further increases in rates to maintain these highways for tourists and private car owners to the disadvantage of the ordinary country people?  Deputy <Col N="1577" /> Corry, no doubt, will tell us more about this aspect, because he takes a leading part in the discussions of the Cork County Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now going to relate it solely to the reduction of income-tax.  I listened very carefully to the Minister's argument against speakers on this side and what he said was that he had proved by a reduction in the rate of income-tax that it brought in a bigger revenue. He related it to general prosperity and he gave us certain figures.  He mentioned that industrial production was up some 40 per cent., that agricultural production was up 27 per cent., that exports were down 10 per cent. and imports had gone up about 20 per cent., proving that the national consumption of goods must have gone up, if one gets these figures together, some 30 to 35 per cent.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister will be able to prove that it is actual consumption that has gone up as distinct from an increase in the price of commodities, but if we are to accept what the Minister said and relate it to this amendment, obviously he must be convinced, firstly, that if you are going to reduce the rate of tax on petrol then you are going to have increased use of it and the net return to the Exchequer will be higher, and, secondly, if the national consumption of goods has gone up by 30 per cent., one is safe in assuming that the consumption of petrol has gone up equally, if not more. The Minister, in view of his own argument, should accept this amendment and be satisfied that there will be the same result here, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin mentioned something which is not quite correct&mdash;perhaps he does not know.  Is he not aware that one of the grievances the representatives <Col N="1578" /> on local authorities have since the change of Government is that the contribution for the upkeep of roads from the Road Fund has been reduced? Deputy Davin spoke as if it had been increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is down some £300,000 this year compared to what it was before the change of Government.  We have got&mdash;and I think it is admitted&mdash; increased numbers of motor cars on the road from the owners of which a registration tax is taken.  The arrangement that existed over many years was that out of this registration fee very substantial contributions were made to local authorities for the upkeep of the roads.  If that is withheld or reduced then Deputy Davin ought not to have a grievance against motorists&mdash;private car owners or those who use motor vehicles for business purposes&mdash;and particularly against tourists who, he says, come here and tear up our roads, and put the burden of making them good on the backs of the ratepayers.</P>
      <P>We must relate all this matter to common sense.  All of us in this House now recognise the value of the tourist trade.  In connection with that trade there will be a certain number of people who will bring in their motor cars.  Surely, if we want to attract good-type tourists who will spend sufficient money while here to make the tourist trade worth while, one of the things we must have is good roads?</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin referred to tourists coming here and tearing up our roads and the implication was that it might be better for the tourist not to come in if he was bringing a motor car.  I suggest to the Minister that if we are to accept his formula that a reduction of taxation will bring a substantial increase of revenue, here is an opportunity to try it out.  We are making it possible to do so by this amendment.  We can reduce the rate of taxation on petrol.  Incidentally, I <Col N="1579" /> agree with Deputy Little that it will also affect&mdash;not to the same extent, perhaps&mdash;the users of paraffin, particularly in areas where the people are not going to get rural electrification in the near future.  If we can get increased consumption of petrol, and if that increase can be related to the figures given by the Minister, then we will have not only additional revenue but a sufficiently large increase in the revenue to enable the Government to restore the full grants to the local authorities. If that is done, the local authorities will be in a position to maintain the roads in their present condition.  In fact, they will be able to improve them, and so make them attractive for the people who are using motor cars.  The more attractive the roads are, the more often they will be used and the more petrol will be consumed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Davin wants us to come to a standstill whereby we would make the roads less attractive for people to use their motor vehicles on them.  I suppose less use of the roads will mean less damage to them.  Consequently, there will be less need to raise money to repair them, and so we might gradually get back to the position of having little byways and highways. Is that how we are to try and abolish the use of the motor car?</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Davin was allowed to attack the users of the roads.  I did not introduce the Road Fund.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he should be consistent in the case of this amendment and accept it because it will be a definite proof of the formula which he himself has suggested with regard to the raising of revenue.  It will, at the same time, be beneficial to all those who are users of petrol and who have to pay a high price for it.  In view of the Minister's previous remarks, I would ask him to accept the amendment on those grounds alone, if for no other reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many <Col N="1580" /> problems that confront the people at the moment.  The principal one that is worrying them is the high cost of living.  I think the people desire that we in this House should give very serious attention to this question of a reduction in the cost of living.  While I have heard very many complaints on that score I have heard no complaints in regard to the cost of petrol.  In fact, motorists generally were relieved when they learned that in the recent Budget there was to be no increase in the cost of petrol.</P>
      <P>I think that this amendment, asking for a reduction in the price of petrol, is, in these circumstances, not genuine, that it is not sincere, and that it has been put down here for debate for political purposes only.  I agree with what Deputy Davin says, that, whether the roads of the country have to be maintained from local taxation or from the Road Fund or from general taxation, the position seems to be perfectly clear. If our highways are to be maintained in the way they ought to be for the increasing motor traffic, then it seems obvious that the Central Fund and the revenue from taxation will have to be utilised to a considerable extent for the maintenance, improvement and development of those highways.  For that reason I think motorists, as a whole, are satisfied with the position as it is. If the Minister is able to get £3,500,000 or £3,250,000 out of motor taxation this year, then that £3,250,000 is necessary for the purpose of balancing the Budget and of running the State.  If that money cannot be obtained in that way it will have to be obtained from some other source.  Having heard the Minister's Budget statement and the debates on the Financial Resolutions, the Deputies who want a reduction in this particular tax should, I think, suggest to the Minister where he is going to get the revenue to replace the loss that would fall on the State if this reduction was to be granted.  Clearly, there is no foundation whatever for the suggestion made by the last Deputy who has spoken that if there is a reduction in the taxation there will be an increase in revenue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that, by a reduction in income-tax, he was able to get an increase in revenue which is, of course, a completely different thing. That increase comes from the fact that salaries and wages have increased, and that profits from business and other ventures have increased.  If I have any quarrel with the Minister it is that he is not digging deeper into the profits of those business people in regard to income-tax.</P>
      <P>Petrol is a thing that we have to import under considerable difficulties. The more extensive use of petrol here is endangering another industry.  It is endangering the horse.  The existence of the horse is threatened, and the position of all the people who find employment, directly or indirectly, through the use of the horse is being threatened by the more general use of petrol.</P>
      <P>We cannot fly in the face of progress, but we have to face the situation that, while supplies of petrol at the moment are adequate and may be adequate for some time, it is quite possible that in the near future those supplies may not be available.  The more extensive use that we make of petrol now may react to our disadvantage in the near future. However, I think that the arguments which were advanced in support of the amendment were not honest arguments, and the appeals which were made to the Minister to reduce this particular tax were not honest appeals.  The State must be run.  We must pay our way. Revenue is vital.  If revenue cannot be maintained, then these people who want this revenue to be reduced ought to be able to suggest an alternative method of finding the revenue that must be found instead.  As I have already said, we could more profitably employ our time here by devoting our consideration to the question of a reduction in the cost of living rather than to the question of a reduction in the cost of petrol.</P>

      <P>It is rather a pity that the Deputy who decries the internal combustion engine as a method of propulsion when applied to vehicular traffic should at the moment be calling for volunteers for a mechanised division. Apparently, the Deputy's anxiety is that the cost of petrol to the ordinary consumer should not be so reduced as to deplete unduly the stocks of petrol before his army calls upon them.  However, let us examine the jejeune argument that has been advanced here by Deputy Cowan and, I understand, by Deputy Davin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there anybody so misguided, is there anybody so ill-informed about the ordinary everyday life around him that he any longer believes the price of petrol is mainly the concern of the private motorist, of the individual who uses a motor car for his private pleasure?  Does not everybody know that the vast bulk of the country's commodities is now being transported on the roads in vehicles which use in one form or another oil fuel? Does not everybody know that the workers of Dublin have to find their way from their homes to their places of employment and from their places of employment back to their homes again in the evening on vehicles that rely either on hydrocarbon heavy oil or hydrocarbon light oil for their propulsion? Are not the people who are most <Col N="1583" /> closely interested in this question of the price of petrol and the most seriously concerned about it that very section of the population on whose behalf Deputy Cowan and Deputy Davin were elected to speak here?  Are not they the people whose interests are allowed to go by default on every critical division?  In consequence of the increase in the cost of petrol, is it not a fact that bus fares, which had been kept constant throughout the whole of the war period, were increased until now one cannot travel 100 yards in the City of Dublin without having to pay 2d. for it?</P>

      <P>It is all very well for Deputies in easy and affluent circumstances to gibe at the unfortunate individual in whose household budget the cost of transport for himself and his family looms as a very large factor, looms as a larger factor to-day than it did in the year 1947-48.  This is one of the commodities in respect of which the Government's undertaking to reduce taxation has not been fulfilled. This is one of the commodities in fact where the Government, by its own deliberate act, has considerably increased the price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The characteristic about an increase in a tax of this sort is that it is an increase in the cost of a fundamentally essential commodity and the ultimate incidence with which that tax falls upon the ultimate consumer is very much greater than the original increase in the mere rate of tax; that is to say, when the Government increased the tax on petrol by 5d. per gallon, by the time that the user of the bus or the purchaser of the goods that had been transported, first as raw material on the roads by lorry and ultimately as the finished product again by lorry, by the time that the user of the passenger transport service or the purchaser of the finished commodity comes to pay, that represents very much more to him than a mere increase of 5d. per gallon in the cost of petrol because every incidence of charge has been added in the meantime.  That is why it is such a <Col N="1584" /> very serious tax from the point of view of the general public.</P>
    <P>It has become, in fact, a tax upon a necessary of life.  People who live out in Drimnagh and who have to work on the other side of the city, must take a bus to and from their work as a rule. There are a number of reasons why they are compelled to do so.  Similarly, if goods have to be moved from the factory to the market, from the market to the retailer and from the retailer ultimately to the purchaser's house, petrol has to be used.  It is as essential an element in our everyday life as food or clothes and a tax upon hydrocarbon light oils, whereas it might have been regarded 20 or 30 years ago as a luxury tax, has now become a tax upon an essential element in the life and productivity of the community as a whole. Therefore, it is no use Deputy Cowan saying that we are asking&mdash;and this is something that he should have been asking&mdash;that this tax should be reduced and that we are doing that for a political purpose.  Even if we were doing it for a political purpose, we would be justified in doing it.  If we were doing it from the high political motive of making Captain Cowan and his friends live up to their promises, we would be justified in asking for a reduction in this tax.  As Deputy Derrig has already explained, for the year 1947-48 the amount collected in this tax amounted to £1,514,000.  This year the Minister expects to collect £3,250,000.  The difference between the two figures is £1,700,000, £1,700,000 which should be left in the people's pockets to enable them to pay their way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan has asked us where are we going to get the revenue to make up the deficit.  The deficit, I suggest, should be made up by the Government's making the economies which it undertook to make when it brought in its first Budget, in the year 1948.  That is the way to make up the deficiency. In this year what is the position?  If I am permitted to speak on this aspect, since Deputy Cowan has put it to us, in this year due to the wasteful expenditure of the Government upon works which are embarked upon for a political motive, there is provision in the Finance Bill to saddle the taxpayers <Col N="1585" /> of the State for the next 25 years with an annual payment of £600,000.  Wipe that out and you have one-third of the deficiency which would have to be made good if we reduced the tax upon hydrocarbon light oils to the level at which it stood in the year 1947-48.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other things which we might examine where economies could be procured to make good the deficit, but we are no longer responsible for the administration. There are varying examples of waste and extravagance, of instances where money could be saved if the Government was really sincere and earnest in the pledges which it gave to the people that it would reduce expenditure and thus enable taxation to be reduced. I do not want to detain the House unduly on this matter but it is a remarkable fact that the very sections in this House which, a few years ago, were clamouring when it was necessary during the war years to raise revenue to defend this country, and who were crying out then about the level of taxation and about the ill-effects which the taxation upon petrol and hydrocarbon light oils would have on the general life of the community, are the people who now get up and defend a tax which in this year is going to take £1,700,000 more out of the people's pockets than it took in the year 1947-48.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee, of course, is irrepressible and he leaves nothing out of his particular form of attack, whether the matter under discussion is one concerning national affairs or otherwise, if he can make what he considers some political point out of it.  One would have imagined, after his long experience as a Deputy and as a Minister, that he would feel that there are certain things that might be left out of the cut and thrust of debate in this House.  Deputy MacEntee referred to the cost of bus fares.  Undoubtedly, and the matter has been raised and debated here in the House, bus fares are high in this city.  They are unnecessarily high, but if they are high in this city, it is because our Dublin City transport was taken away from us by Deputy MacEntee and his colleagues and was made carry the burden of the whole transport of this <Col N="1586" /> country.  That is why fares are high from Drimnagh and from Donnycarney into the centre of the city.  It is one of the problems that it is almost impossible now to solve, but the responsibility for that state of affairs must rest with Deputy MacEntee and his colleagues of the former Government.  If Dublin City transport had not to subsidise and bear the burden of transport elsewhere&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As I have already said, whatever other claims or demands have been made, there has been no demand or claim made by private motorists for a reduction in the tax on petrol.  The suggestion has been made by Deputy MacEntee that because the revenue from petrol has gone up in the past three years from £1,500,000 to £3,250,000, another £1,500,000 is being taken out of the pockets of the ordinary people. That is an absurd argument because it is only within the last year that we have been able to get in petrol in quantity. We were on a very restricted ration three years ago.  Since then petrol has come in in larger quantities.  It is obvious to any intelligent person that if more petrol came in, there would be more revenue from that particular tax. I asked the question, if this tax is reduced and if the revenue is necessary to run the State, by what alternative <Col N="1587" /> method can revenue be found?  Deputy MacEntee says that there is £600,000 you could save right away.  How are we to save it right away?  By not engaging in the great schemes of capital expenditure that have been announced by the Government.  In other words, do not engage in any large scheme of capital expenditure.  Do not involve yourself in expenditure that will give employment to the people and that will enrich the country.  Do not do those things and you will save £600,000 a year for the next 30 years.  That is the idea of Deputy MacEntee's economics. The ordinary people who are interested in the development of this country know that these schemes of large capital expenditure are vitally necessary.  They know that it is necessary under present circumstances that that money should be borrowed and that it should be repaid over a period and, for that repayment of £600,000 a year, the country is going to be enriched: unemployment is going to be eased very substantially and the country is to benefit generally.  Deputy MacEntee says: &ldquo;Wipe out that £600,000 and then you can reduce the tax on petrol.&rdquo; Even from the point of view of a debating point it is a very poor and a very bad debating point.</P>
      <P>I have already said that this amendment is dishonest politically and that it is an amendment that cannot be supported in the particular circumstances in which the country is at the moment. If Deputy MacEntee can support a reduction in bus fares in the City of Dublin, that can be brought about in a very easy way without any interference with this general tax.  I am a city Deputy, just as Deputy MacEntee is, and I am naturally concerned about the cost of bus fares.  However, it is vital and essential that we should have a city bus transport and it is quite possible that if, during the past ten years, there had been a different organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann we would not have this very high cost of bus fares and bus transport at the moment.</P>

      <P>If Deputy MacEntee or Deputy Little or Deputy Derrig will suggest what reduction in bus fares the reduction in taxation that they recommend here would effect, it would be some help.  But they cannot do that: they do not do that and they will not do that.  However, they make a general appeal to everybody&mdash;to persons who use the buses, to persons who have to use cars in their private business and to persons who use cars for pleasure&mdash;that the petrol tax ought to be reduced.  In debating matters of that kind in this House we should have regard all the time to the practicability of the proposition put forward.  If this amendment were carried the revenue that would be lost as a result of its adoption would have to be found elsewhere.  My question to the Deputies who support the amendment is this: where do they suggest this revenue can be obtained if the House were to agree to the amendment?</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Cowan's suggestion that there is nothing substantial in this&mdash;that is, if I took him up aright&mdash;I think that if the amount of money that would be saved by this amendment to the taxpayer, that is, the amount of money that is collected, were to lie there, so to speak, as a subsidy or to be given back as a subsidy to keep down bus fares it would represent a very considerable figure.  That is the first answer.  The second answer is that Deputy Cowan is, like many other Coalition Deputies, acutely conscious of the fact that Dublin bus fares have gone up during the period of office of the present Government.  They are also actuely conscious of the fact that such an increase is a real increase in effect in the cost of living, because a very large number of lower-scale salary workers and workers generally in this city have to travel to their place of employment and back twice a day at least by public transport and they have to pay for that day in and day out and that is part of their cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1589" /> The Government, by allowing that cost to increase have, as Deputy MacEntee pointed out, not only failed in their promise but they have allowed the cost of living in that particular direction to increase.  In view of these incontrovertible facts, Deputy Cowan has taken the line: &ldquo;No, this increase was due to the amalgamation of the transport in the country and the petrol has nothing to do with it.&rdquo; I do not want to digress on that line but perhaps the Chair will permit me to give the net answer to that.  In the amalgamation there was nothing inherent in this system that necessitated Dublin's carrying the load.  If the Government succumbed to the temptation of allowing Dublin to carry the load at any particular period, that is another question which, the Chair says, has very little to do with the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowan cannot sidetrack the issue because Dublin bus fares have increased.  He has asked how that could be compensated for.  The straight answer is that if the money being collected in this higher taxation under the present Government were not collected and were available as a subsidy, so to speak, in regard to Dublin bus fares then the increase in Dublin bus fares could be obviated and the cost of living in that direction need not have increased. The same, I understand, could have applied to Cork buses, as I am reminded by a Deputy who is sitting behind me.  The net point of the amendment is that here the Government is choosing by taxation which has increased since they came into office to collect more in this particular regard than in other directions.  The amendment is a suggestion that that particular increase would be nullified.  I might be permitted to comment also at this stage that here is a very good example of what the Minister for Finance has done in trying to make a political appeal.  Deputy Cowan talked about dishonest motives and so forth but I do not intend to follow him on that line.  The Minister for Finance has, it is true, made reductions in certain <Col N="1590" /> directions and he claims that he has reduced taxation.  However, here is one of the specific instances where he has to balance his reduction in one direction by an increase in another direction.  Here, that fact, taken in conjunction with the fact that over-all from the ordinary citizen, the taxpayer, he is collecting more tax&mdash;it does not matter how it is collected&mdash;than was ever collected before, justifies the argument of people who say that all the Minister for Finance has done is to readjust his accounting and that the over-all burden which the community has to bear and the sum it has to find to service the State and supply the needs of the Minister for Finance is of greater magnitude than it was ever before.</P>
      <P>This amendment advocates that in this particular direction there should be a reduction.  It is a case which I think can strongly be made if the Government is sincere on the question of reducing the cost of living.  It is a direct tax which benefits nobody directly except the Exchequer.  It is not one of those things like a subsidy or traffic which will not only help in one direction but will help particular groups, and so forth.  In this case, it has not any other beneficial effect than helping the Exchequer.  It is what might be called a pure tax.</P>
      <P>The cost of living has been the subject of complaint, as Deputy Davin and his Party know, in Dublin particularly. We must reckon in the cost of living the cost of transport for Dublin workers.  For all these reasons a very strong case indeed is to be made for this amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera is quite right when the says that Deputies on this side of the House are acutely conscious that Dublin bus fares have been gone up.  May I remind Deputy de Valera that Deputy Cowan and myself and Deputy Alderman Byrne at least had the courage to raise that matter in the Dáil at the time when the bus fares were increased? We were acutely conscious of it and we made our voices heard and our views known in this House at the time when Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Lemass were accusing this Government <Col N="1591" /> of bankrupting Córas Iompair Éireann because they had not increased the bus fares earlier than they did.  Is not that a fact?  Will Deputy Vivion de Valera deny it or will Deputy MacEntee deny it?  We all remember the type of speech that was made at that time.  I do not want to go into it any more fully than to point out those facts in the hope that even Deputy Vivion de Valera will possibly admit that the Deputies sitting beside him are not all white and that the Deputies here are not all black.</P>

      <P>I could make some personal remarks also but, in the interests of the standard of debate in this House, it might be better if I were to restrain myself when facing Deputy MacEntee.  Deputy MacEntee in his contribution to this debate has made some suggestions which could only be made by Deputy MacEntee and I was glad to witness the very effective manner in which Deputy Cowan disposed of them and disposed of the Deputy.  I can only recommend that Deputy MacEntee should consider very carefully the words of advice which he has received from Deputy Cowan.  Deputy MacEntee, despite the fact that he occupied the post of Minister for Finance for a number of years, has shown by his utterances on financial questions that either the period during which he was Minister was a very simple period to deal with or that someone else did the work.</P>

      <P>It would be interesting if we did endeavour to analyse the position created by the increase in the tax on hydrocarbon light oils which was provided for in the Budget of 1948 and which we are now endeavouring to have removed.  According to figures given by the Minister in reply to a question some few weeks ago, the average cost of the petrol imported into this country is less than 1/- per gallon.  Its total value amounted to something like £1,200,000.  On this commodity, the net value of which when imported into this country is £1,200,000, the Government propose to collect not less than £3,250,000 and that sum of £3,250,000, let me repeat, is nothing less than a tax upon the people's means of subsistence.  We can rule out as being comparatively insignificant the amount of petrol consumed for purposes of private pleasure. The main consumers in the country are the public transport services&mdash;transport services for passengers and goods&mdash;and therefore it is no insignificant matter that petrol is now almost as heavily taxed as beer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a queer commentary that the Government which reduced the tax upon beer by 1d. a pint should immediately increase the tax on petrol by 1/2d. a point in order that it might compensate itself for the loss the Exchequer substained by the reduced tax, but I know that there are people, and particularly people who claim to be representatives of the workers, who think that it is more important that a man <Col N="1597" /> should have cheap beer than that his children should have cheap food and cheap transport.</P>

      <P>I am merely pointing out why it has become necessary to maintain this tax at its present level. I have pointed out that a commodity, the net landed value of which is less than 1/- per gallon and the total value of the import of which, landed into the petrol tank, is about £1,200,000, is to carry a tax of no less than £3,250,000. I think the position in that regard is absurd and unjust.  I think we are failing to recognise that petrol is now an important element in our whole productive economy.  If the price of petrol goes up, the price of transport to the farmer, the manufacturer, the shopkeeper and the individual goes up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was addressing myself to a serious question.  I know that, when a Deputy endeavours to do that, he does it at some risk to his personal feelings, at some risk to the code of good manners which ought ordinarily to prevail in this and other assemblies. If I have infringed that code, I am sorry for it.  I do not regard the fact that I was provoked into it as any justification.  I should, in fact, now be in the position in which I would ignore these provocations, coming from the source from which they did come. If I could get back to this, I should like to emphasise the figures which I have given, that the cost of petrol landed in this country is less than 1/- a gallon, that in the City of Dublin we have to pay 2/9 and down the country it is 2/10 or 2/10½.  The people who buy it down the country are mainly people who use petrol for business purposes, whether they be engaged in the livestock industry or as farmers, merchants or shopkeepers.  All the difference between the 1/- and the 2/10½ goes in one of two ways, either to remunerate those who are handling the petrol or <Col N="1599" /> to pay the Government tax, and it is the Government which takes the heavier portion.  Accordingly, I think those Deputies who came into this House pledged to reduce taxation ought to avail of the opportunity of helping us to ensure that the taxation will be reduced.</P>
      <P>A point was made as to what the effect would be upon bus fares.  I do not know what the effect would be on bus fares, but quite understandably if we were to bring back the amount collected from petrol to the level at which it stood in 1947-48 we would, as Deputy de Valera has pointed out, have £1,700,000.  At least, the public transport undertaking, the private hauliers, the merchants and shopkeepers and the manufacturers would have £1,700,000, which would go in the reduction of transport charges generally.  No matter how we may try to blind ourselves to the facts that must have an appreciable effect upon the cost of living.  If £1,700,000 were left in the pockets of the people, it means something substantial in the end.  I am suggesting that those concerned about the cost of living, those who wish to avoid any further increases and the consequences that flow from those increases in the cost of production ought to vote with us in support of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that there is some insincerity in the arguments advanced in support of this amendment. Deputy MacEntee and Deputy Major de Valera have suggested that if this amendment were passed there would be or could be a reduction in bus fares in the City of Dublin or all over the country.  Deputy Lemass smiles, and quite rightly, as he knows that there is no validity or substance in such a suggestion.  If this amendment were passed, there would be a reduction in the running expenses of buses of less than 1/2d. per mile&mdash;and how 1/2d. per mile is to be spread over 60 passengers I certainly cannot understand.  That is the suggestion made seriously in this Dáil and made seriously to people outside&mdash;that if you can reduce the running cost of a bus by 1/2d. per mile and divide it amongst 60 people you could reduce bus fares.  Clearly, that is nonsensical <Col N="1600" /> and absurd.  That is why I have said that the arguments in favour of this amendment are not honest or fair arguments and can convince no sensible person.</P>
      <P>Even charging the bus fares we have to charge, only a few short months ago we had to subsidies Córas Iompair Éireann to the extent of £4,000,000, which is something more than the complete revenue that would be received in this year from the tax on petrol and hydrocarbon oils referred to in the amendment.  I would ask Deputies opposite to be fair to the general public in the arguments they advance. There are some persons in this country who will read Deputy MacEntee in tomorrow's <i>Irish Press</i> and who will feel that he has been making a case for a reduction in the cost of transport in Dublin City.  It is unfair to those city people to have an argument such as that advanced in this House.</P>
      <P>It is not only unfair but I think it is dishonest, as the Deputies advancing the argument know very well how invalid it is and nevertheless are endeavouring, through the publicity this debate will get, to induce certain simple-minded people to think that they are concerned about the bus fares that citizens of Dublin have to pay.  Their own amendment, if it were carried by the House, would mean that each passenger would be entitled to a reduction in his fare of the 1/60th part of a 1/2d.  I do not think we have a form of money operating in this country at the present time that would enable such a reduction to be made effective.  That is why I say it is unfair, it is improper and it is dishonest, and I would ask the Deputies opposite to give up trying to cod the people by that type of argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The simple answer to much of the talk that has gone on here is this, that owning to the increase that has taken place under the present Minister a substantial sum of money, estimated by some in the region of £1,000,000 to £1,750,000, is an increase in taxation.  In the net, that is taxation, that is getting money from somewhere. The suggestion here is that here is a place where taxation can be reduced and it does quite clearly affect <Col N="1601" /> transport, both public transport and also commercial travellers' transport and people who use cars for business purposes and so on.  This amendment is a suggestion that that taxation could be alleviated and reduced.  That is the net point in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had better get a little history on this.  In 1939, the Fianna Fáil Government put a tax on petrol of 1/3 and despite all their wails about the evils that would result from an increase in the cost of petrol they kept it there for five years.  Now they think one night's debate is going to wipe out the stain of that.  Deputy Cowan is quite right in asking them to stop deluding themselves in the belief that they are deluding anyone.  For five solid years it was kept at 1/3 and all the people who are now wailing about the effect on transport, the effect on production and the effect on the cost of living were all dumb apparently in those days.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan again was right in saying that there was not a sould in the country who operates a private car, a commercial vehicle or a public service vehicle but expected the tax to rise by 4d., 5d. or 6d. in this Budget and they got the thrill of their lives when I left it at the old point.  Its effect on the users of vehicles was that in 1947 private vehicles registered in this country reached the very high figure of 8,294; in 1948 it was 12,910; and in 1949 15,118 cars were registered.  It does not look as if the increase in the cost of petrol impeded people from going on the roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make clear one point of confusion and that is really all I want to say about petrol.  Deputy Briscoe appears or rather pretends to be labouring under another misconception. I said that people here must be better off than they were pre-war and I gave four indicators: the volume of agricultrual produce is pretty well at the level it was at pre-war; the volume of industrial produce, transportable goods, is up by 43 per cent.; our exports are running at 10 per cent. below what they were pre-war; our imports are 27 <Col N="1602" /> per cent. above.  More goods are produced in this country than were produced pre-war.  Not as many of these goods are being exported and more goods are coming in here.  The people have the money with which to buy these goods and in addition while they are buying these goods which are there in greater plenty than ever they are saving more money than ever they did in the whole of the Fianna Fáil régime year by year.  All that argues a higher standard of living.  Deputy Briscoe seemed to form his case on amount and price and so on, but I am talking about volume, the amount of goods, the quantity of goods and the number of goods which are produced along the rates I gave.  They are not being wasted, somebody is buying them; the community is buying them.</P>
    <P>There is a third point about which there is a lot of misunderstanding. Deputy Cowan made this point for me but I should like to emphasise it.  I said with regard to income-tax that it was found that if you increased the prosperity of the country a lower rate of tax on incomes could bring in a higher revenue and that we were getting under the auspices of the present Government in this country a dividend on prosperity.  I want to stick to that. That is clear from the facts but it is not correct to say on that basis that that was a formula.  Of course it is not.  With an increase in incomes the tax clearly rises, but give away the whole of the petrol tax and you do not get any return.  You cannot argue that it should be reduced by 3d. a gallon because income-tax gives a better return with 6d. relief.  Reduce the tax on petrol and you will get nothing out of petrol.  The things are totally distinct and there is nobody on the other side of the House but can make that distinction for himself.  In any case the point was only made for the sake of argument.</P>
    <P>The community has been suffering that tax for a number of years.  They bore it and the number of vehicles which are registered shows that it has been no impediment to increased motoring in the country.  The people here were reconciled to an increase on the tax on petrol and I am getting all the benefit as if I had reduced the tax <Col N="1603" /> because I did not raise it and that of course is what is annoying the Oppositions.</P>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned £1,250,000 and he wants to know where he would get it.  Appearently the Minister and the Government are in a position to abolish rationing so free supplies of petrol should be available.  Users of cars who at present are confining the use of their cars strictly to business purposes because of the high cost of petrol would use more if the price were not as acute as it is. Probably, at least it is arguable&mdash;I would like to see the figures before I would commit myself in detail&mdash;that under these circumstances if the Minister went back to the rate at which he took over he would make up a large amount of the money which he would forego by reducing the tax as is requested by this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 6 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in any previous enactment the excise duty referred to as entertainments duty in and chargeable under Section 1 of the Finance (New Duties) Act, 1916, as amended by subsequent enactments shall not be charged or levied on payments for admission to any ball or dance on and after the 1st day of August, 1950.</P>
      <P>(2) Sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the Finance Act of 1948 shall not be construed as including any ball or dance.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment, which appears on the Order Paper in the name of Deputy Aiken, is to restore the position which existed before the Finance Act of 1948 was passed.  Under sub-section (2) of Section 10 of that Act, halls and dances were made subject to tax.  The Minister made a concession in respect of certain areas. The tax is still there, and is felt to be a very oppressive one in the case of ballrooms throughout the country and in provincial centres.</P>
      <P>I think that a tax on the entertainment of young people is bad.  It is frequently stated that one of the reasons for the flight of young people from our provincial centres is that they have not sufficient social amenities. Dancing provides social intercourse for our young people, a means for their coming together which, I think, is necessary in any civilisation.  Anything that encourages legitimate and proper recreation is, I think, all to the good, and anything that discourages it is not helpful.  If we bear in mind that young people at the present day demand these amusements then, to the extent that they are deprived of what they consider legitimate recreation, there is the danger, I think, that they may seek recreation in less desirable ways.</P>
      <P>It was noticeable that this tax was imposed at a time when the Minister, having boasted of his reduction on beer, went further and reduced the tax on wines.  Why it should be considered to have some special virtue that taxation on intoxicating beverages should, in some way be particularly sinful, and that reductions should be made in the view of the Government, while at the same time legitimate entertainment for young people properly run and controlled should be subjected to this burden, is a thing I have never understood.</P>
      <P>When the Minister announced the tax in a previous Finance Act, it was pointed out that one of the reasons which Deputy Aiken, as Minister for Finance, had in abolishing this entertainment duty was owing to the difficulty of collecting the tax.  It was pointed out that evasion went on.  This is a tax which affects the social life of young people.  If it is the case that, in respect of it, there can be considerable evasion and that the law can be defied and tax obligations evaded, then it seems to me that may be a very good reason for abolishing it.  It may not be a reason which appeals particularly to a Minister for Finance if he is very keen on securing revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister stated, when he <Col N="1609" /> introduced this proposal, that he expected to get £75,000 in the way of revenue from it.  According to the figures given in reply to a Parliamentary Question to-day, the tax on dances and balls came to £108,000 last year. It is expected to yield £130,000 this year.  The owners of these places in which this entertainment and recreation is provided have heavy overhead expenses.  They have to maintain staffs. They have their off-seasons.  It is a business, like other entertainment, catering, that is subject to very serious fluctuations.  In times when money is in circulation, dancing and entertainment generally, and the catering industry, are likely to be fairly prosperous, but they are the first to feel the pinch when there is any change in conditions.</P>
    <P>These places of entertainment gave a considerable amount of employment in areas such as the metropolis.  They have a certain connection with the musical life of the country.  They provide an opening for young musicians and bands, and to the extent that we are trying to get employment for both in our own country, we ought not to take any action that would discourage it.  There can be no doubt but that this tax has a very serious effect on the income of these ballrooms.  The position is that halls in country areas have not to pay the tax.  They have substantially the same accommodation and they can take in almost the same income as the ballrooms in provincial centres, and yet they are free of tax. It seems to me that that is contrary to the fundamental principle of taxation which is that there should be equality.  The distinction is entirely arbitrary in this case as between the city and town ballroom and the rural one.  If there is a case for relieving the rural areas proper, there is the same case for relieving the ballroom in the provincial town to which the rural people come.  The members of a young farmers' club or of other local associations are more likely to have their functions in the bigger centres if the conditions are as attractive, but there is a heavy excess cost at the present time on the ballroom in the city or town.  If a country hall can secure the attendance of 400 people, it can <Col N="1610" /> save, I am informed, up to £20 as compared with the hall in a neighbouring town.  That, of course, is a serious consideration.  Those halls would normally have a band which might cost anything up to £40.</P>
    <P>If the Minister persists in maintaining this tax on entertainment, entertainment which is universal in the country and which there is no particular reason to discourage, I think it should be imposed on a fairer basis.  Some consideration should be given to the principle of equality and equality should consist in having either a flat rate of tax applicable to all halls or in relation to the capacity and the income of the halls or ballrooms so that when they are assessed for taxation purposes the burden would be more or less the same having regard to the income.  In the case of this amendment as in the case of the last amendment, which I proposed in the absence of Deputy Aiken, this is a further tax imposed by the Minister as a set-off to certain taxes he abolished.  It is of a special character.  Its imposition has aroused great resentment.  It has created a certain amount of unemployment in a service that is peculiarly susceptible to sudden fluctuations and that depends a great deal upon the circumstances of the time.  I hope the Minister will change his mind in this respect.  In view of the amount of tax collected, I do not think it is worth the trouble, the expense or the hardship that it has imposed upon those who have invested their money in providing modern facilities for dancing in our cities and towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>We made a plea last year for exemption from this tax for our halls.  It is true that a good many beagle clubs and rural sporting clubs prefer to hold their dances in the big centres of population.  In that way, they come under this tax.  The Minister considered one proposal put forward by the Opposition.  I think he should go further now and reconsider this. Deputy Fitzpatrick put up a strong case for those employed in these dance halls and for the members of the band. These people have suffered very severely because of this tax.  I am <Col N="1611" /> convinced that the cost of collecting the tax must be very high indeed.</P>

I have here a number of balance sheets from clubs that have been trying to run dances for charitable purposes.  In one balance sheet a club had to pay £10 in tax.  Their expenses came to £50 and they took in £52.  The local clubs are up against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The rural areas that the Minister has in mind are some small little areas in the centre of the country, where there is not even a village and where there is practically no dance hall at all, but every area in my constituency, that you could classify as rural, which has a hall has to pay a tax.  Again, as my colleague, Deputy Derrig pointed out, the hall proprietors in those areas are finding it very hard to carry on, but my chief concern is to give local clubs an opportunity of carrying on in the areas which I speak of as rural.  One could not call these areas towns or cities.  They are the rural portions of County Dublin.  There are at least nine or ten areas that could be classified as rural.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small areas throughout the <Col N="1614" /> country to which the Minister referred are very few and far between.  Again, with reference to charitable organisations, I do not see why the Minister should have reimposed this tax because charitable organisations have been doing a good deal of work which would have to be paid for by the State if it were not for the self-sacrificing efforts of members of these organisations in trying to raise money to finance work that should be the responsibility of the State.  Unless these people collect so much at the door, they will not be allowed a refund no matter how deserving the cause is.  That is a point of view that is apparently supported by the members of the inter-Party Government who are giving these charitable organisations no opportunity at all of carrying on their good work.  When these self-sacrificing people organise these functions to raise funds to help their less fortunate brethren, who find themselves temporarily in difficulties, the State steps in and says: &ldquo;Unless you make a return of 30 per cent. or 50 per cent. as the case may be, we are not going to give you any money back.&rdquo; I had the experience of being associated with a welfare dance in Skerries and it took us 12 months to get the money back.  Meanwhile, all sorts of examinations and inquiries were carried out.  This money was devoted to a certain benevolent fund but we were persecuted by inspectors coming along asking us to certify this, that and the other thing.  That is the outlook which is supported by those supporting the inter-Party Government, people who are supposed to be charitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite correctly pointed out to Deputy Burke that the purpose of this amendment was to put the cities and towns upon an equal basis with the rest of the country in regard to the amusement of the people.  I should like if the Minister would be good enough, when he is replying, if he ventures to reply, to tell us why they should not be put on an equal basis, to tell us why, in the matter of popular amusements of this sort conducted under proper auspices, the people of the constituency of Dublin North-Central, for instance, should be discriminated <Col N="1615" /> against as compared with the people in some rural areas.  Why are we making fish of one section of the population and flesh of the other?  Is there any justification for that?</P>
      <P>The amount which this tax yields is, as the Minister admitted, comparatively small&mdash;somebody said £108,000 last year and maybe £130,000 this year. What is that to a Government which proposes to spend in one year £107,000,000?  Does the Minister discriminate against the people of Dublin North Central as a punishment because they returned Deputy de Valera before they returned him?  People who regard dancing as an agreeable pastime have to pay much more when they go to dances in one of the places of popular resort than they would have to pay if they had to go down to rural areas where dance halls have been erected.  That is the discrimination which the Minister has to defend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we talk of balls and dances, we are inclined to think of the more expensive ballrooms in the city such as the Gresham, Clery's and the Metropole, but I can say that not 5 per cent. of the people of the City of Dublin, who dance for pleasure and for company as a social amusement, go to these places.  The places which are most heavily affected and hit by this dance tax are the dance halls and the ballrooms which cater for the workers of Dublin.  This tax falls, not upon the wealthier people and not upon those who go to dances because they want to figure prominently in the social rôle, but on the domestic servants, the working boys and the shop assistants and others who go to these places because they prefer to go there and meet congenial company rather than go to the public-house or the cinema.  If it is no longer regarded as being socially disreputable to go to a public-house, why should it be regarded apparently as something reprehensible to go to a public ballroom or dance hall?  Why should it be regarded as socially reprehensible to do this in a city or town and why should you be taxed in order that you may be deterred from going there?  So far as the importance of this tax as a source of revenue is concerned, <Col N="1616" /> it has become completely insignificant so the whole thing has now been put on a moral basis, so to speak. We cannot, surely, justify the tax as a source of revenue, having regard to the fact, as I have said, that the Government proposes to spend £107,000,000 this year.</P>
    <P>To a Government that is so affluent and so open-handed, what does a matter of £108,000, taken mainly out of the earnings of the workers, signify? They cannot regard it as a serious contribution to the revenue.  The only justification I think that can be afforded for it is that the Government look upon this matter in a puritanical way so far as the workers in the towns and cities are concerned.  If you happen to live in the country it is not morally reprehensible to go to a dance.  If you happen to live in the City of Dublin, in the City of Cork, in the City of Kilkenny or in any of the urban centres then, apparently, there is an element of moral turpitude in going to these places and the paternal puritanical Government steps in and imposes a tax in order to discourage people from going to them.  I think that this is a piece of discrimination as between one section of the population and another which cannot be justified on any grounds.  It certainly cannot be justified on the grounds that the tax collected is necessary in order to enable the State to maintain itself.  The Minister, I am sure, will not make that sort of a remark.  It certainly is not, I think, the sort of tax that can be justified on the ground that the dance halls and public ballrooms are places of ill-resort or ill-fame out of which our young people should be kept.  They are, as everybody knows, well conducted, very well conducted, in the City of Dublin.  They give a considerable amount of employment not merely to attendants but to musicians&mdash;to those people who try to live by the practice of an art.  Surely, if we can afford it&mdash; and I suggest we can in this case&mdash;we ought at least to make it no more difficult for these people to make a livelihood now than they did before this tax was reimposed.  That, I think, is the case that can be made for this <Col N="1617" /> amendment and I hope that those who make it will not be confined to this section of the House.</P>

      <P>Last year I appealed to the Minister to abolish this tax.  I did so because at that time I was assured by representatives of the Ballroom Owners' Association and the Federation of Irish Musicians that unemployment would accrue.</P>
      <P>Prior to the debate on the Finance Bill the Minister was asked by the Federation of Irish Musicians to meet them and to discuss the matter.  The Minister did not do that last year.  I do not know whether he has done it this year, but certainly he must have got the same memoranda as I and others got this year from the Federation of Irish Musicians.  Last year he doubted my statement that unemployment would accrue.  Does he still doubt my statement?</P>

      <P>If men come to me and assure me that they are not now getting the employment&mdash;that they are now getting only three nights employment whereas previous to the imposition of the tax they got six nights' employment&mdash;and if I know these men and if I take their word, as I do, surely that should be sufficient evidence for the Minister.  But if that is not sufficient evidence, surely the word of one of the Minister's colleagues in the benches opposite, that of Deputy Fitzpatrick, should be taken.  His association have assured me that that is a fact&mdash;that unemployment has accrued; that musicians have been laid off; that all sorts of personnel employed in the Dublin ballrooms have been laid off.  I am not going to make any exaggerated statement as to the number involved.  I do not know accurately the number because the information which I had before me dealt with man hours.  However, if there is <Col N="1618" /> an appreciable number&mdash;and there is an appreciable number of people unemployed through the imposition of this tax&mdash;and if the revenue which is being derived is in the neighbourhood of £100,000, then I think it is a miserable tax.  Again, I say that unemployment has come about.  Deputy Fitzpatrick will bear me out in that. Last year, the Minister thought fit to describe my statement as a falsehood. He said here that I was uttering falsehoods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the Minister has found it fit to continue this tax.  Last year I made what I thought was a reasonable suggestion&mdash;that, instead of worrying and annoying people who go to dance halls and ballrooms to enjoy themselves and making them feel they have to pay an entertainment tax for the purpose of entertaining themselves, if he felt as he did and seemingly as he was advised that the owners of ballrooms in the cities, especially in the larger cities, were making money, he should impose the tax on the ballroom proprietors. Had he accepted that suggestion and given it careful consideration during the year and put it into operation this year, I believe a lot of the opposition would be and should be withdrawn for the simple reason that there would then be no difference between ballroom proprietors and the conduct of ballrooms and dance halls all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the debate here to-night and to the Minister's replies, it would <Col N="1619" /> seem that confusion still exists in the minds of Deputies on the Opposition Benches and that of the Minister responsible for this tax as to the people who are actually paying and where it is imposed.  Certainly no one has any doubt but that those who attend ballrooms in the larger cities&mdash;Kilkenny, Cork and Dublin were mentioned&mdash;have to pay tax.  But there seems to be confusion as to how far that extends into rural areas.</P>
    <P>The possibly very good intention of the Minister when he reimposed this tax was to exempt rural areas where small halls were catering principally for the local people but it did not work out that way.  I have had complaints made to me, as chairman of the ballroom proprietors, from villages throughout the country with a population of 150 to 200 but which are situated near other villages with a population of 550 to 580.  I took the precaution of inspecting the books of a ballroom in one of these villages where a dance is held for parochial purposes once a month.  The takings at the door averaged £7 to £10, never any more.  In view of the fact that this village is near another village with a population of 580, entertainment tax must be paid.  These people are perfectly satisfied with their average profit of £1 to 30/- but that £1 to 30/- and perhaps a few shillings more is now collected by the revenue as entertainment tax.</P>
    <P>The scheme introduced by the Minister may have been good from his point of view but I stated last year, and I repeat, that it was not a question of benevolence as far as the Minister and his advisers were concerned but was inspired by the difficulties experienced in collecting this entertainment tax.  There was great expense involved in trying to collect it from small villages where there was not a resident revenue officer and where the revenue officer had to hire a taxi and go from one district to another for the purpose of inspecting the ballroom and checking the tickets. They found that the position was impossible.  I believe that one of the arguments that had the greatest <Col N="1620" /> influence with the previous Minister was the impossibility of collecting the tax in rural areas.  The Minister felt, on the information supplied to him, that it would be quite a simple matter in the larger cities and towns, that the collection of the entertainment tax would not entail any great expense and that the proprietors of ballrooms and promoters of dances in those areas should pay the tax.</P>
    <P>I explained that there should be a proper approach to this matter.  I felt that the proper approach was to put a duty on the licence fee for ballrooms annually on the same principle as is applied in the case of public-houses. That could be done in the towns and could be very easily worked out for country areas.  When a licence is issued, it is on the basis of the size of the ballroom, whether it can accommodate 300, 400, or 500.  There is a fee of £10, £20 or £30.  In that way the Minister could have collected the revenue just as easily as by the method of collecting entertainment tax as an admission charge.  I know from experience, and I am sure the Revenue Commissioners also know, that people who attend dances resent that charge.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister has made up his mind and that there is no possible hope of getting him to accept the amendment proposed by the Opposition and to drop this tax altogether this year but I would once again appeal to him to have the whole matter reconsidered in the light of the facts I am placing before him.  I hope that, next year, if he still feels that this form of amusement should pay entertainment tax, it will be levied in some other way which will ensure easier collection and more universal application.</P>
    <P>The Minister is not satisfied with the statements made by the Opposition that the reimposition of this tax has caused unemployment.  The Minister is badly informed there.  I can tell him that quite a number of ballrooms in the larger cities found that they could not pass on this tax to the patrons in the case of house dances in view of the fact that the whole system and organisation of ballroom entertainment has changed during the past ten years. When many of the Deputies here were <Col N="1621" /> young, balls were not organised for financial purposes.  They were generally run for entertainment.  The gentlemen paid and the ladies were admitted free. That is many years ago.  A change has taken place.  Ballrooms have been commercialised. It is correct to say that, in the last years of the war, proprietors of ballrooms and promoters of dances made considerable profit.</P>
    <P>At the end of the war, the number of visitors seeking ballroom entertainment diminished.  The greatest factor in reducing the number of people attending dances in the larger halls at present is the facilities that the public have to get out of the cities.  Two or three years ago the best season from the point of view of proprietors of dance halls and promoters of dances was the summer period.  That is difficult to credit.  People who do not know anything about the business believe that the season starts in the winter.  For the past seven years the profitable season ended in the winter and the best season was the summer period.  Transport was restricted and it was impossible for people to get away from the cities and they resorted to the ballroom for recreation.</P>
    <P>I want to point out to the Minister, for future reference that, since the reimposition of the tax, some ballroom proprietors reduced the hours of dancing.  Where, formerly, dances were of four hours' duration, they reduced it to three.  The personnel of the band numbered very often eight to 12.  The band is paid, according to agreement between the proprietors and the Federation of Irish Dance Musicians, at the rate of 7/6 per hour per man.  By reducing the number of the hours by one, a saving of 7/6 per hour per man was effected.  Consequently, the members of the band lost 7/6 per night for seven nights in the week. While gaining in one way, the Minister lost in another.  He derived certain revenue in income-tax payable by professional musicians.  He lost on income-tax by the reduction in the income of the musicians.  While, in a number of ballrooms, as I have said, the hours of dancing were reduced by one hour, in others they closed one or two nights a week.  I notice that one of the principal <Col N="1622" /> ballrooms in this city is closed for three nights in the week.  There are ten musicians employed.  Therefore, ten men are idle for three nights a week.  That is one of the results of the reimposition of the tax.</P>
    <P>According to the information that was disclosed here to-day, the Minister not only got what he budgeted for but twice as much.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that that state of affairs encouraged you to continue the tax.  Ballroom proprietors in Dublin, Cork and other cities generally run dances one or two nights in the week and they let the premises for the other nights to clubs which hold dances for the purpose of raising funds.  In Dublin, some of these clubs had booked 12 months in advance.  Quite a number of them continued their bookings in the hope that the tax would be dropped.  When a number of the clubs which hold weekly or monthly dances found, after two or three engagements, that they were not making money, they dropped them and the ballroom proprietors were forced to close down or to run the dances themselves.  Everytime <Col N="1623" /> a ballroom is closed the band personnel and staffs are disemployed.</P>
      <P>The people who supply the restaurant and buffets attached to the ballrooms lose a certain amount of revenue and it is only natural to expect that those catering for the ballrooms and buffets, especially confectioners have to dispense with some of their employees. The mineral water manufacturers, the ice cream manufacturers and even the taximen who derive a certain amount of their custom and patronage from people going home from dances&mdash;all these suffered as a result of the imposition of this tax and the position created by it.</P>
      <P>Last year, when this tax was being reimposed, we complained that it was unfair, inasmuch as some people would have to pay and others would not.  Some very glaring examples of that were brought to the Minister's notice particularly in the case of holiday camps.  In one case, entertainment tax has to be paid, while in the other it has not.  I will not say that the Minister gave us a guarantee but he said that if at any time it was brought to his notice that these holiday camps, by virtue of the fact that they were established in areas which had not got 500 population, were escaping the tax, he would take serious notice of it.  I saw last week one of these very large holiday camps advertising public dances three nights a week and I think that is very unfair. In the case of the holiday camp run by Irish Holiday Camps, Limited, in Skerries, they have to pay entertainment tax, but ten miles further away, Butlin's Holiday Village can organise dances and run excursions from the City of Dublin, taking away the people who in the ordinary course might attend the ballrooms here, without having to pay entertainment tax.  There are quite a number of aspects of this matter which I am afraid the Minister has not considered and I appeal to him, if he cannot see his way to drop it this year, to have this matter investigated next year and try to devise some more reasonable form of tax in respect of which everyone will be treated on the same footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention <Col N="1624" /> of the House to a statement the Minister made in connection with the expense of collecting this tax.  I do not know exactly what is taken into consideration. Does he take into consideration the tax he loses from the ballroom proprietors and their loss of profit?  Does he take into consideration the tax which the personnel employed in ballrooms, bands and staff, would have paid, if things were normal?  Or does he take into consideration only the actual printing of the tickets?  Is a quota allowed for the staff that sell the tickets and the rental of the offices from which the tickets are sold?  Does he take into consideration the expenses incurred by inspectors having to go to different areas?  If all these matters are taken into consideration, I am at a loss to know how the Minister can be satisfied that he can collect this tax on the very moderate basis of 2 per cent. Previously, when inspectors had to go out to rural areas where it was generally admitted it was wellnigh impossible to collect or to enforce this tax, the percentage was a whole lot less than 1 per cent.  The general impression amongst the people concerned in this business is that 2 per cent. would not pay for the staples in the tickets printed by the Department.  I am afraid that the Minister will continue with this tax, due to the success it had last year, and, from the knowledge I have, I believe that a number of people who have booked ballrooms will continue their bookings or try to hold on to them, in the hope that the tax will be abolished, but, unless the Government in power in, say, three years' time want to abolish dancing in this country, the tax will be discontinued for ever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Wednesday, I addressed a question to the Minister for Finance asking him if he were aware of the delay that had arisen in rendering a decision in relation to the submission made on behalf of the employees of the Board of Works in the <Col N="1625" /> Phoenix Park and St. Stephen's Green for improvement in wages and conditions of employment.  In the course of the reply, the Parliamentary Secretary stated that these particular employees had been granted and increase of 11/- a week in 1948, that the claim at present under consideration involved a number of varied items and called for careful consideration, and that he hoped to have a decision in a short period.</P>
      <P>I would particularly draw the attention of the House to the actual form of the question, because the question is so framed as to inquire from the responsible Minister if he is aware of the delay that has taken place on the part of the Commissioners of Public Works in dealing with the claim.  It sets out certain dates and finally raises a query as to whether the Minister feels that such delay is desirable in dealing with low-paid Government employees.  I would like to describe the particular type of employees we are referring to in the question.  They are known in official circles as being in what is known as &ldquo;the industrial fringe.&rdquo;  Those are proper words, as they also describe the back of beyond or no man's land, in so far as the attention given to the employees is concerned.  They consist of garden labourers, gardeners, gate keepers, and park constables, carrying out the duty assigned to them on behalf of the people in these two public parks. They are employed by the Board of Works and are directly under the control of the commissioners.  They are classified as being part of the industrial fringe, as their wages and conditions of employment are not set down in respect of those applying to the general service classes of the Civil Service, nor are they in the fortunate position of other employees of Government Departments whose wages and conditions of employment are automatically regulated in accordance with and following the agreements arrived at between trade unions and employers in outside employment.  The result is that this particular group of workers is completely dependent upon the good sense and the fairness and understanding of the responsible officials, the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not to raise the merits of their <Col N="1626" /> claim that I put down this question but to draw attention to what I regard as inexcusable delay and neglect in dealing with the submissions made by these employees, in order to show the need of at least giving some expedition to the consideration of these matters.</P>
    <P>Without, as I say, discussing the merits of the claim, it is well to point out that these employees are not part of the well-paid, well-remunerated class of Government employees enjoying fair and reasonable conditions of employment. They are working in, and the majority of them live in, the City of Dublin and in this city, where the average wage for a labourer in private employment is admitted by the employers' organisation to be not less than £5/- per week, the Government is paying these men a wage of £4 8s. 6d. For that wage, in addition to possession of a rent free lodge, some of these men are required during the summer months to be on duty for no less than 16 or 17 hours per day at a time.  They are not established, they have no pension rights and only within a recent period have they had extended to them the annual leave that has become the common enjoyment of organised workers in private employment.</P>
    <P>If there is any reason for expedition of a claim of any section of workers, this is the type of worker entitled to that extra consideration.  Instead of getting that, they are treated continually, not merely in respect of this claim but over a period of years, to the same irritating delay and neglect of their rightful submissions.  The effort that is being made by these men to secure consideration for their claims has not been confined to the present Government. I am personally aware that, both in respect to the last Government and under different Ministers for Finance, repeated efforts have been made by these men through their organisations and by other channels to try and secure from the commissioners reasonable consideration of their claim.</P>
    <P>I want to say in all fairness that it has been only from the present Administration that there has been any reasonable consideration given.  In the past they at times did not even get the <Col N="1627" /> courtesy of a reply.  I am myself aware that a period of nearly six years elapsed during which practically no consideration was given to repeated representations they made.  On the present occasion when the Parliamentary Secretary replied to my question, he referred to an application and an increase that had been given to them in 1948.  May I point out that exactly the same delay that is now being objected to took place in 1948?  An application was made.  It was supposed to be referred to the inter-Departmental Wages Committee for their consideration. Week after week went by, continual inquiries being made on behalf of the employees as to when the decision would be given, and finally we found that the committee had not even met.  I want again in fairness to the present Minister to say that the committee only met when personal representation was made direct to the Minister and he gave an instruction for a meeting of the committee to be convened. The committee met and again interminable delay took place before we could find out about the decision and again the decision was available only when a personal approach was made to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The increase given in 1948 was part of the general increase in wages given to all types of workers in the period following on what is known as the 11/- agreement in respect of general employment outside.  It was an increase given in respect of an increase in the cost of living, but given in lieu of an adjustment in the basic rate that had been claimed on behalf of these employees in 1948.  The claim in 1948 was deferred and re-entered in 1949, and formally submitted to the commissioners on the 2nd November, 1949.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties in respect of this group of workers is that they are not included in the general service classes of the Civil Service, they are not covered by any of the recognised Civil Service organisations, they have no access to the newly-established arbitration or conciliation machinery available in the Civil Service and their only recourse is to the ordinary industrial type of trade union which <Col N="1628" /> organises them and makes direct representations to the Department of Public Works.  Following upon the submission of the claim in November of last year, the question was raised with the Minister that, in so far as this group of employees along with many other Government employees up and down the country were not provided with a system of arbitration or conciliation similar to that available to industrial workers in the Labour Court or to civil servants in the arbitration board now established, some provision should be made to provide similar machinery for this type of worker.  The Minister took steps to make that type of machinery available.  The result is that to-day a claim is served upon the commissioners, it is negotiated, a decision is made and if that is not acceptable it can be raised with the special appeal board set up by the Minister, which will be constituted of two members of the inter-Departmental Wages Committee together now with an outside chairman in the person of the vice-chairman of the Labour Court.  Those who speak on behalf of these employees welcome that advance as a proper and legitimate meeting of the claims of these workers.  The important thing is that when that claim was made in November, 1949, and while the Minister was dealing with the question of providing conciliation machinery of a suitable sort, consideration by the Commissioners of Public Works of the actual wage claim was put to one side completely. Why that should be necessary I do not know because the whole value of that conciliation machinery was that it could take up a claim when employees and employers had failed to reach an agreement.</P>
    <P>Following on the submission of the claim in November representations had to be made direct to the Minister.  In February he indicated that he would arrange to have a conference at an early date.  The conference took place on March 9th under the chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary but from 9th March to 13th June we are still waiting for a decision.  A period of nearly seven months has elapsed since the claim was first submitted to the Commissioners of Public Works.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1629" /> I am well aware that the Commissioners of Public Works have a reputation for moving slowly.  The only time they can move quickly is when they are erecting monuments or erecting eyesores like the one we have outside this building.  They also seem to take pleasure in erecting monuments to the dead but it would be better for them if they would pay more attention to the living so that there would be no need to put up monuments to them when they are dead.  Some of the men who are making this claim and asking consideration from the commissioners have as fine a national record as some of the men to whom we now propose to erect monuments in the vicinity of this House and they are just as entitled to consideration.</P>
    <P>They are working in the City of Dublin for a wage as low as £4 8s. 6d. a week.  For the very same type of work, if they went into the employment of the Corporation of Dublin, they would be paid £5 7/- a week and they would work two hours less per week. In St. Stephen's Green if you work on the inside of the railings for the Government, the biggest employers in the country, the employers with the greatest financial resources, you are paid £4 8s. 6d. a week, but go outside the railings, work for Dublin Corporation and do exactly the same work and you are paid £5 7/- a week.</P>
    <P>Why has this Government set a record as bad employers instead, as they have been told repeatedly, of setting a headline and extending to their own employees what are regarded as their ordinary rights in Christian justice?</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the wages of men employed by a Government Department in Dublin must be the same as the wages of men employed by a Government Department in other parts of the country.  That is a fair and reasonable argument, but we are repeatedly told by Government spokesmen that the cost of living is less in small towns and rural areas than in Dublin and that there must be a lower rate of wages in these areas than in Dublin, and if there is to be a lower rate of wages in rural areas for industrial employees why not have a higher <Col N="1630" /> rate of wages for the employees of the Commissioners of Public Works in the City of Dublin?  I am concerned at the moment solely with the question of the delay.  I am not concerned with the decision as such or with the contents of the decision because the important feature regarding the delay is that if and when we receive a decision from the commissioners, if that decision is not acceptable to the men they have the opportunity of utilising the machinery provided by the Minister, the Appeal Board.  The Appeal Board is entitled to give consideration to their claim and to expend on that consideration a reasonable period of time; but if the Commissioners of Public Works require seven or eight months to deal with the claim of employees whose conditions of employment they have at their finger tips, how long must we allow this board of three gentlemen who are not familiar with their conditions to acquaint themselves with the whole position anew and to exercise consideration on that claims?  If we are to work on the time schedule of the commissioners, if they are entitled to seven or eight months the Appeal Board of gentlemen who are unfamiliar with the claims of the men should be entitled to 12 months, and it would not be unreasonable to expect that in 12 months we might have the decision of the Appeal Board.  I do not expect that to happen, however, because I have the belief that of all the slow things that operate in this country the slowest is the Commissioners of Public Works.  I believe that while they take seven months to consider the claim we will get a little more thoughtfulness for the men concerned when we come to the Appeal Board.</P>
    <P>Last week we had a lightning strike in the city and we heard members of this House, as is usual, addressing lectures to the workers.  It might be well if those who are not familiar with the problems of the workers would give some little thought to the problems arising from their conditions. They say that these unofficial stoppages have got no motive, but what would be the position of a group of workers in private employment with a strong organisation behind them if they were told that they must wait for seven <Col N="1631" /> months before they could get a reply to their claims?  We would have a record of unofficial strikes that would startle the people of this country.  But when we come to Government employees we expect a different attitude on the part of the men.  They cannot go on strike.  The flowers in St. Stephen's Green and in the Park are not going to worry the Government much and they can only make a protest through the organisations which are there or utilise whatever other means are available to them, such as the case I am making here to-night, but the fact that they have not the same remedies open to them as industrial workers have should entitle them to more consideration from those who are responsible for them than if they had.  Some consideration should be given to them. When men make a claim such as this they expect and are entitled to get a decision in less than seven months. When a conference is held at which a responsible Parliamentary Secretary presides and at which responsible officials are present, it should be possible to get a decision on the proceedings of that conference in less than seven months.</P>
    <P>If the attitude of the Commissioners of Public Works on this matter is allowed to go without protest, then we are not doing a service to those who made efforts on all sides of this House to try to find an efficient and acceptable means of dealing with the relations between employers and employees because a headline has been set by a Department of the Government which, if it were followed by private employers, would create such disturbances and chaos in the country that we would be unable to carry on.</P>
    <P>I would impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that the men are entitled to a decision.  It is not sufficient to say that a decision will be forthcoming at an early date when for six weeks, week after week and on two or three occasions each week, inquiries have been made by telephone to the Department and personally to the Parliamentary Secretary as to when a decision will be forthcoming.  It is not <Col N="1632" /> sufficient again to put us off with another promise that a decision will be forthcoming at an early date.  There should and there must be a decision within the next week or so.  Although the Commissioners of Public Works have been slow in this instance it seems they have been able to make other decisions, decisions not as important as this decision, so I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to urge on the commissioners that consideration be given to the men's claim and that they make a decision.  If their decision is not acceptable we have the machinery provided by the Minister and we will utilise that machinery to put forward the claims of these men.</P>

      <P>When I listened to the complaints of Deputy Larkin, my mind went back to 1948 and I remembered that he had to put down a question something similar to the question he raised to-night.</P>

      <P>I will.  On that occasion Deputy MacEntee broke in and said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;And the Labour Party are as quiet as mice.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That made me laugh.  When I look around the House to-night, at a time when there is a good, honest, sincere discussion here, brought up by Deputy Larkin&mdash;what I consider to be a fairly honest case&mdash;I can see that there is not one member of the Fianna Fáil Party remaining in the House.  Apart altogether from being quiet as mice, there is not one of them here.  That shows the very poor interest they take in the worker, although for many years they told us how interested they were in him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Larkin's case, I would be the last man in the world to defend the Commissioners of Public Works unless it was a case where I thought there was a necessity for doing so.  As the Deputy probably knows, our chairman, Mr. Connolly, resigned, having reached the age limit, and we were for a few months without an extra commissioner.  That put additional <Col N="1633" /> work on the existing commissioners. Whatever Deputy Larkin or any other Deputy may think, I do not believe there is as hard worked a Department in the State as that controlled by the Commissioners of Public Works.  That may surprise some people and it may cause laughter, but it should be understood that we carry out work there for all Departments&mdash;we look after things such as schools, drainage, barracks, and we have on our files communications from every Department in the State asking us to attend to various matters and, of course, invariably they put their own case first.  In the circumstances, I do not blame Deputy Larkin for thinking that the workers' case should come before everything else.</P>
    <P>I am inclined to think, and I regret it, that according to the way in which he spoke the Deputy imagined that I have no sympathy with the workers. I wonder will the Deputy admit this, that there was not a time since I came into control in the Board of Works that I did not meet the workers personally on any small item they had to put forward?  I am sure the Deputy will be good enough to admit that I was delighted to meet them and to hear their case and will give me a little credit for the decision in 1948. It will, I think, also be admitted that <Col N="1634" /> the present Administration did something for which a little credit could be given.  There was, for instance, a wages rise.  Some other points were raised, and I agree that it was very necessary to raise some of those points.  There was an increase in wages in 1948.  That increase in wages meant over £5,000 a year as regards those two sets of workers in the Park.  At the moment we are paying a bill of over £36,000 a year in workers' wages in the Park and there is another increase being sought.  If it is granted it will mean an extra £8,000 a year.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be correct, and he may not.  The Deputy has gone to a certain amount of trouble. I would like to congratulate him&mdash;the same as his father before him, he is a great representative of the workers. I am delighted at any time to hear him.  He works hard for the workers, and I will make them this promise: I assure the Deputy that within one week he will have a decision.</P>

      <P>I take it that the question refers to what are officially called minor employment schemes. The figures, county by county, for 1938-39 are set out in Schedule &ldquo;A&rdquo; subjoined. The county figures for 1949-50 are not yet available, but the number of schemes sanctioned for that year was 883, and the total expenditure £103,000 approximately.  The latter figure is subject to check and audit.  I should point out, however, that the figures for 1938-39 and 1949-50 are not strictly comparable, for the reason that in 1938-39 there was no expenditure on bog development schemes (for emergency production) or on the rural improvements scheme.  If these schemes are added to the 1949-50 expenditure, the total amount is approximately £251,000; in 1938-39, virtually the whole of the expenditure was on minor employment schemes.  The expenditure on minor employment schemes for 1932-33 to 1948-49 is as set out in Schedule &ldquo;B.&rdquo;</P>
