      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether, in connection with the deputation which he and the Minister for Lands received recently, he is in a position to make a statement in regard to (1) the purchase of land in <Col N="336" /> the Midlands by aliens, and (2) the failure of the Land Commission to divide certain big farms in Laoighis and Offaly, and if he will state whether he has investigated the points raised by the deputation and what hopes he has that action will be taken to acquire for division the lands which were discussed at the meeting.</P>

      <P>With regard to part (1) of the Deputy's question, so far as I have been able to ascertain, there have been four cases in the last five years of the purchase of land in the constituency of Laoighis-Offaly by persons who are not Irish citizens.</P>
      <P>The answer to part (2) of the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement, which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to have circulated with the Official Report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach further aware that in the parish of Ballybrittas we have six cases of the purchase of land by Englishmen, and that, in view of that position, local deserving applicants for land have been denied the land which was left by the Land Commission at the disposal of Englishmen?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the second part of Deputy Flanagan's supplementary is a <i>non sequitur</i>&mdash;at least, it does not necessarily follow.  If either Deputy Davin or Deputy Flanagan will furnish me with any particulars, I shall be glad to have them.  As I have already pointed out in this House, there is no machinery available by which the statistics asked for can readily be obtained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he is aware that there is considerable public resentment at the visits paid by British naval craft to ports in the 26 counties of our country over which we have effective control, and if he will indicate to the British Government the Irish Government's view that visits of units of the British forces or navy are provocative and unwise while Britain continues to occupy the Six Counties with units of those same armed forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The exchange of <Col N="342" /> visits by naval craft of countries which are in diplomatic relations with one another, as we are with Britain, takes place from time to time as a matter of ordinary international courtesy and has no implications whatever in regard to any questions, however important, that may be outstanding between the countries concerned.  The British Government are fully aware of the strong feeling which exists in this country concerning the Partition of Ireland, and the Deputy can rest assured that every step that can usefully be taken by the Irish Government will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>While keeping the matter in proper perspective and giving due weight to the considerations mentioned by the Taoiseach, will the Taoiseach not agree that these visits of units of British armed naval forces to our shores must be viewed against the background of the occupation of six of our counties?  Further, will the Taoiseach not agree that at least it would be well to discourage the activities of local shoneens in Irish ports who avail of these visits in order to parade their anti-national and anti-Irish sentiments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that there is any very solid ground for the suggestion contained in the latter part of the Deputy's statement.  In regard to the first part&mdash;that the matter must be viewed against the background of Partition&mdash;of course, every problem must be viewed against that background, and is so viewed.</P>
      <P>I might suggest to the Deputy that if certain action were taken it might very readily tend, so far from improving our prospects of the early ending of Partition, to postpone it. The matter has to be approached with very great caution.</P>

In calculating these estimates, balances unaccounted for of £8.9 million in 1947, £11.8 million in 1948, and £8.5 million in 1949 have been allocated to current sterling earnings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes) (for the Minister for Social Welfare)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of men of all ranks discharged from the Army during the five years&mdash;1945 to 1949&mdash; was approximately 34,000.  The number of these on the live registers throughout the country on the 28th October last, was 1,819 or about 5.3 per cent. The average number of insured persons unemployed during 1949 was 9 per cent.  (<i>Irish Trade Journal,</i> March, 1950, page 48).  The lower percentage of unemployment amongst ex-servicemen as compared with the general percentage must be attributed to the special efforts of the Government, in co-operation with a large number of employers, to resettle demobilised men in civil employment.</P>
      <P>The number of ex-servicemen on the live registers of the Dublin Unemployment Exchanges on the 4th instant was 707.  Of these 689 had employment for some period or periods since discharge from the army.  Five hundred and eighty-five of the registrants are seeking work in unskilled occupations, and employment in these occupations, as the Deputy is aware, is frequently of an irregular character.  Only 86 of the applicants are seeking skilled employment and 36 clerical work.</P>
      <P>Since 1946, a full-time Public Relations Officer of the Army Benevolent Fund has been specially appointed to engage in canvassing employers for employment for demobilised men.  The Employment Exchanges in Dublin actively co-operate with this officer and, in addition, maintain at their offices registers of employers who have intimated that they are prepared to give preference in their employment to ex-servicemen.  The Employment Exchange officials keep in constant touch with these employers and others. I am satisfied that everything is being done on behalf of these men who remain on the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All but 13 of the 707 ex-servicemen on the registers are in receipt of either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.  I have no details of <Col N="346" /> the full family incomes of these registrants.</P>

If I may put it this way to the Minister, is not he aware that service in the Defence Forces prior to the periods mentioned by him justifies and entitles the Government to take steps to provide employment for the persons mentioned in my question?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, this matter has been discussed a number of times already in the House during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, 1949, since enacted, and on other occasions.  It was pointed out then that Córas Iompair Éireann had indicated their intention not to proceed with the completion of the building at Store Street as a central bus terminus and administrative offices.  In these circumstances, the property became available for purchase by the Department of Social Welfare, and, as the building suited the urgent need of the Department for more suitable and centralised accommodation for its staff in Dublin, it was decided to buy it from Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;. As the holdings and turbary in question have been vested in the tenants, the drainage of the bog and the repair of roads are not matters for the Land Commission.  The tenants have been so informed and it has been suggested to them that they might apply to the Special Employment Schemes Office for consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revised system of rationing for bread and flour requires the baker or shopkeeper to attach coupons to each order form sent by him, directly or indirectly, to the flour mill, so as to ensure that subsidised flour will be supplied only where it is intended for human consumption by the individuals for whom the ration is provided.  This obligation to attach coupons to each order sent to the mill is designed to <Col N="366" /> put an end to three principal abuses which have developed:</P>
    <P>1.  The feeding of subsidised bread to greyhounds.</P>
    <P>2.  Large urban mechanised bakers travelling up to 60 miles to supply consumers who are not registered with them, in order to wipe out local bakers and secure a monopoly position all over the area.</P>
    <P>3.  Confectioners manufacturing cakes, pastries, etc., from subsidised flour, while charging the consumer prices based on the assumption that unsubsidised flour was used, thus securing an illegitimate excess profit at the expense of the taxpayer, without any advantage to the consumer.  There is no intention whatever of reducing or abolishing any supplementary ration at present available to any category of persons.</P>
    <P>It is confidently anticipated that every registered consumer will continue to receive a full sufficiency of the best quality bread and flour at the subsidised price and in the event of any case being established at any time in the future of hardship being occasioned to any section of the community by inability to procure ample supplies of bread and flour to meet their normal requirements, there will be no hesitation whatever in having the matter fully investigated and, where necessary, suitable measures taken to resolve any difficulty that may transpire.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in certain areas of the country the hay harvest has been very seriously damaged and in some cases substantially lost as a result of the adverse weather conditions.</P>
      <P>Having myself lost all my hay as a result of a fire which destroyed my haggard, I can assure the Deputies that I fully sympathise with the difficulties experienced by farmers who have sustained a similar loss, but I suggest that serious as is the problem, it is not one which should assume the character of a national emergency, and the first essential is to warn farmers not to be moved to panic by statements that cattle are a drug upon the market on account of a prospective shortage of fodder.</P>
      <P>This fairy-tale has been widely disseminated by interested persons who hope that as a result of such propaganda small farmers will be induced to sell their cattle without due reflection for much less than they are worth, thus enabling those who buy them at scrap prices to reap a rich harvest of profit. It is noteworthy that cattle prices have been advancing on the Dublin market for the last two weeks.</P>
      <P>I think it well to state shortly the steps best calculated to relieve the problem of farmers who have lost most of their hay and who fear lest they will be short of fodder in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many have already dug a pit and ensiled surplus grass and other green fodder.  Having done this, they can collect carefully all the barley and oaten straw under cover and use it with ensilage (where possible), roots, potatoes, cabbage or other green crops throughout the winter and spring months.  It would be advisable to boil and ensile as large a quantity of potatoes as are available and use these also when necessity arises.  The oats and barley should be dried and kept to meet any necessity that may arise, and, inasmuch as our entire domestic <Col N="375" /> output of bran and pollard is now available for retail sale to farmers at a very low price, they should use them, too, if necessary.  Ample supplies of maize and maizemeal will be available. And, lastly, farmers can shorten the duration of the hungry months by setting aside a few acres of grassland on which they should now put out whatever lime may be required, together with six cwts. of high-grade superphosphate of lime and one or more cwts. of muriate of potash, and at the end of January, one cwt. or more of sulphate of ammonia, nitrate of soda or nitro-chalk, per statute acre, with a view to having grass in March, on to which the cattle can be turned for an hour or so each day, until the ordinary growth of grass provides grazing in the spring.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, in certain areas, recourse will have to be had to methods of feeding not ordinarily employed, but I am satisfied that the farmers of this country can and will surmount this forage problem as they have overcome similar difficulties in the past.</P>
    <P>I shall continue to keep this matter under review and will gladly give every assistance which may appear to be practical and necessary.</P>

      <P>I consider that the Minister's reply, as far as it affects many of the farmers in my part of the country, is to the effect that when they are without hay to feed their cattle they will have to feed them on theory. They have no straw worth speaking of to fall back on.  They have no means whatever to feed their cattle during the winter and spring.  It is no use telling them that they can feed them on feeding stuffs.  The Minister says there are substitutes, but these substitutes are not available to these farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Minister for Health (Dr. Browne) Noel C. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of this Bill is to establish a single body for the control of the different branches of the nursing profession, including midwifery. This body, to be called An Bord Altranais, will replace the two existing boards which at present control nursing in the country.  In addition to carrying on the functions of the two existing controlling bodies&mdash;the General Nursing Council and the Central Midwives Board&mdash;the new body will have further powers.  I should like to say at this stage that the establishment of this body does not arise out of any feeling on the part of the Government that the functions discharged by the existing bodies are not being extremely competently and efficiently carried out at present.  It arises largely because of the changes which are taking place in relation to the nursing profession generally in the country, in relation to hospital services and the expansion of medical services. I think that most of us who have any experience of the nursing profession in Ireland are well aware that nothing but the very highest praise must go to these two bodies who have given us the opportunity of saying, in relation to the nurses turned out by our hospitals and institutions, that there are probably no better set of girls in such profession in the world.  I believe, however, that in spite of the competency and efficiency of these bodies, a new body with wider powers should be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the powers at present exercised by the General Nursing Council and the Central Midwives Board, which were largely confined to the laying down of courses and the working out of syllabuses for training, we should like to extend the powers of this joint board to allow them to direct recruitment, to direct the training of nurses and to advise on the organisation of the nursing services.  In addition, they will carry out the present function of the Nursing <Col N="380" /> Council which relates to the approval of training schools.  At present the council has no power to organise training. It is placed in the position that it can determine the quality of the nurses, which it has done extremely well, but it has no say in the numbers of girls who go for training.  Similarly, the Central Midwives Board has functions in relation to midwives practically identical with those exercised by the General Nursing Council in relation to nurses.  Naturally, the Central Midwives Board caters specifically for midwives but, in addition, due to the special type of duties carried out by midwives, the Central Midwives Board exercises certain disciplinary functions over its midwives. In these days, there has been a development whereby girls going for midwifery work usually have a background of general nursing training and we felt that if we could provide certain safeguards in relation to the midwives in a joint body&mdash;they would obviously be a minority in any joint body&mdash;it would be desirable to establish one body to control both types of nurses. That is what is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In view, however, of these responsibilities in relation to disciplinary matters, disciplinary control over the practice of midwifery, and in order to try to maintain as far as we could the independence of the old Central Midwives Board, we have set up within this body a midwives committee and this committee will have exclusive responsibility to deal with all matters relating to the discipline of midwives. The main board must accept, in relation to disciplinary matters, the committee's decisions on all such matters as discipline in relation to the removal of midwives who have proved unsatisfactory. Incidentally, it is expected that other matters affecting midwifery will be referred by the board to the midwives committee.</P>
    <P>Section 50 and 51 of the Bill empower the board to train nurses and to organise post-graduate courses.  This is put in for a special purpose arising largely out of my anxiety to meet a considerably increased demand which I think will come as a result of the expansion of the health services, particularly <Col N="381" /> in relation to the mother and child health service.  There will be a considerable amount of domiciliary nursing work and I am anxious to ensure that a sufficient number of girls will be available with the necessary qualifications.  The present position in relation to public health work <i>per se</i> in nursing is that most of the girls qualify in the ordinary way and take a number of post-graduate courses and then apply for public health posts. They are all of them, generally speaking, very highly qualified and naturally I have the greatest respect for their qualifications, but there is a certain lack of specific training in public health work as opposed to midwifery or general hospital work, and so on.  I am anxious to rectify that defect by empowering this board to establish special courses in public health, domiciliary nursing, and so on.  The training of nurses at present is designed primarily to make the girls first-class nurses for hospital work only.  I feel that if we give this proposed board all the responsibility for organising these courses it will be a great step forward in relation to public health nursing generally.</P>
    <P>Another very important point which we must bear in mind is that in the first place it is quite obvious from the very big hospital building programme which we have on hands and which must mature in anything from three to ten years that in relation to hospitals, health clinics, dispensaries and mother and child services, a very vast expansion in our requirements of specialised nursing personnel must be envisaged and consequently we feel that this whole question should be tackled now rather than wait until the shortage is upon us.  I am glad to say that at present we have no real shortage of a type that would cause any worry. Many of the girls are coming back and working here, but as I say I think that the demand will increase and consequently, I feel it is only right that we should deal with that anticipated shortage now rather than face the position which I think they are largely facing in Britain&mdash;that they have the beds, that they have a number of hospitals, but that they have not got the nurses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="382" /> The Bill also envisages the establishment by this board of scholarships by collaboration or co-operation with other authorities such as universities and hospitals for candidates for higher administrative posts or specialised nursing posts in the ordinary way such as midwifery or general nursing.  They should be empowered to organise post-graduate courses and provide for scholarships where there is a suitable girl who may not be able to afford the instruction which could be made available by this board in hospitals, universities, etc.</P>
    <P>While I say that we can make very desirable improvements by virtue of this Bill, I am quite satisfied that it does not answer all our problems because I think that the main one probably arises out of the conditions of work of our nurses in our hospitals throughout the country.  I think that one of the best ways in which we can anticipate effectively a shortage of nursing personnel is considerably to improve the standard of working conditions and living conditions of our nurses within our hospitals.  In relation to local authority services we are at present doing everything in our power to provide for these desirable minimum conditions under which these girls may live, reasonable disciplinary control, good living conditions, separate rooms and good food, small things but things which make a tremendous difference in the anxiety of a girl to take up nursing or practise nursing.</P>
    <P>I might add&mdash;a great number of Deputies may feel the point worth discussing&mdash;that I have no authority over the living conditions and working conditions of nurses working in the voluntary hospitals but in relation to local authority hospitals we are doing everything in our power to ally good working conditions, good living conditions and intelligent training conditions in order to anticipate the shortage which other countries already feel and which we fortunately are not yet experiencing.</P>
    <P>The board will also have power under Section 54 to provide accommodation for girls undergoing training courses, and they will be empowered <Col N="383" /> to charge for that accommodation, under Section 24.  The constitution of the board is set out in Sections 11 to 13 of the Bill.  It is provided that there will eventually be ten elected nurses on the board but, in order to get the new system working as soon as possible, the first appointment of the ten nurses will be made by the Minister.  In addition, there will be 13 other persons nominated by the Minister&mdash;nine of them after consultation with appropriate bodies.  Two will also be nurses which means, therefore, that, of the 23 members of this board to control, supervise and organise nursing training in the country, 12 will be nurses which, I think, is a very desirable point.</P>
    <P>Naturally, the working out of the constitution of the board was a considerable headache, because of the various interests which might be anxious to secure representation.  The Bill throughout has been drawn up in constant consultation with the different interests involved.  The midwives committee will consist partly of doctors specially concerned with maternity work and partly of midwives.  Some of these will not be members of the board, but liaison with the board will be ensured by having the chairman of the committee a maternity doctor who is also a member of the board.</P>
    <P>In relation to the financial provisions of the Bill, the proposal is that the ordinary running expenses of the board on staff salaries, holding of examinations and so on, will be met by fees paid by the trainee nurses, but, in view of the power which we hope to confer on the board to institute scholarships, post-graduate courses and so on, other provision is also necessary. This provision is included in Section 59 of the Bill under which a grant will be made from State funds to meet balances of expenditure not met by the ordinary receipts of the board. The Minister, in turn, hopes to recover half of the amount of this grant from local health authorities in proportion to their population.  It is proposed that any capital expenditure of the <Col N="384" /> board will be met from Hospitals Trust funds.</P>
    <P>This Bill has taken the unusual course of passing through the Seanad before coming to the Dáil.  Many amendments suggested in the Seanad have been incorporated and I now recommend it to the Dáil as a measure which will help to ensure that our health services will not in future suffer from want of well-trained nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side give our approval to this Bill and I should like to say that I understand that the Bill has been in preparation since somewhere about the middle of the Great War.  It was being prepared from about 1945 onwards, both under the Minister for Local Government and later under the Minister for Health who was in office before the present Minister.  It is, as the Minister has said, in the nature of a co-ordinating Bill, co-ordinating the direction of all nursing activities, and should be an improvement on the present system.  I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to some of the problems affecting the nursing world and the health of the country to-day.  Some of these he has mentioned, but there are others to which I should like to draw his attention.  I feel that the new board should do its utmost to improve the standard of the midwifery services of the country.  While, on the whole, they are good, I think the standard of training needs improving, and I have heard stories, which I think are reliable, that the number of midwives in certain areas who know anything about anæsthetics is very limited.  As the Minister is well aware, there is now a new type of anæsthetic which can be administered by midwives and I hope the new board will speed up still further training in regard to midwifery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, as the Minister said, we have to secure a sufficient number of nurses, particularly in regard to certain nursing services such as tuberculosis, in which I understand there have been vacancies unfilled from time to time owing to the character of the work.  Nursing is a very great tradition in this country, and, while we can be proud of the fact that the hospitals, <Col N="385" /> both in the neighbouring island and in other places, are staffed by Irish nurses who receive the highest praise and while we are glad that it is a vocation which appears to be particularly suited to Irish girls, at the same time, we need to make sure that we have an adequate number of nurses for the profession in this country and I hope the Minister will carry out his promise to insist that that should be one of the first objects of the newly-constituted board.</P>
    <P>The Minister perhaps could give us an idea of what the general position is in regard to staffing.  It varies so much throughout the country that it is very hard to get a general picture of the degree to which the staffing is inadequate, due to insufficient numbers of persons applying and the extent to which that is due to the character of the services involved and the extent to which it is due to lack of facilities, lack of recreation or proper quarters for the nurses.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask also how far the Minister has progressed with the plan which formed part of the new Health Act passed by the previous Government for the provision of dispensary nurses, highly trained, for every dispensary in the country, regardless of whether there was a public health nurse in the dispensary or whether there was a nurse from the Jubilee Nursing Organisation, paid for partly out of public, partly out of local and partly out of private funds.  It was our idea that eventually every dispensary should have a dispensary nurse of the most highly-trained type to follow up the work of the doctor and to do work which no doctor can do in connection with mothers and children and to make sure that the after-effects of illness have been dealt with.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister also how far he proposes to direct this new board to consider the appointment of nurses for preventive training.  During the course of the passage of the Health Bill under our Government, the Minister for Health adverted to that matter and pointed out that there was not half enough instruction and propaganda in relation to health and hygiene in the country and that the <Col N="386" /> problem would have to be tackled.  As the Minister knows, there are people who, through training in social science, acquire the gift of being able to impart information in a friendly sympathetic way and being able to give consideration to hygiene, cleanliness and other matters, all of which have been found necessary in other countries and which are equally needed here.  It is a particular gift as well as being a matter of training and so far we have made very little progress in this country.  We were hoping that the new Minister would carry on with the intentions of the previous Minister in regard to that matter.  So far as I know, there has been somewhat of a delay and I should like to ask the Minister how far he is going to direct the new board to consider the problem of teaching preventive medicine to nurses throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Then I come to the question of the improvement of conditions for nurses. The Minister adverted to the matter. Everyone knows that the conditions vary very much throughout the country and that they have improved considerably in the last ten years.  From talking with members of the nursing community I understand, however, that a lot needs to be done yet.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to ask the Minister whether, in connection with this board, he will consider the present grant made available to the type of nurses paid partly out of central funds, partly local authority funds and partly private funds.  I succeeded the other day in securing an increased grant for a particular nursing association and it occurred to me that perhaps the whole matter needed studying at the present time and that the board should direct their activities to that end as soon as formed.  I know that in some districts the local association has great difficulty in finding the balance of the amount required to maintain the nurse.  I know also that the nurses trained by the Jubilee Nursing Organisation are highly regarded and loved throughout the country and if something can be done to improve their conditions it will be a great advantage to the community. The pay of some of these Jubilee nurses seems to me extremely low in <Col N="387" /> relation to that of voted services.  In that connection, I should like to ask the Minister whether he will ensure that the Jubilee Nursing Organisation, and any other nursing organisation of that type, will play their due part in the developing and forwarding of the interests of this board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>As this is largely a necessary co-ordination of the various services referred to I think it is safe to say that the Bill will be welcomed by the House generally.  The Minister stated that the proposals were largely the results of consultations with the various interests affected.  That is a tendency in legislation for some time back in this House which is highly to be commended. He gave us to understand that the interests concerned were satisfied largely with the proposals and, if that be so, the Minister is to be congratulated.</P>
      <P>I just want to put two points to the Minister which are ones of omission. Since this is presented as a measure of co-ordination, I am sorry that it has not taken a wider scope.  I see no reason, for instance, why the nursing services in private nursing homes are not included.  The House will have learned from time to time of the conditions that operate in these private nursing homes, and the fees charged there.  That the private nursing homes should be excluded from consideration when there is what I might describe as a glorious opportunity to include them is a little disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second omission is one anticipated by the Minister when he referred to the fact that he has no authority over the nursing staffs in the voluntary hospitals.  That is a very sore question so far as public representatives are concerned.  No one can say that the conditions of the nursing staffs under the local authorities are ideal&mdash;in a good many cases they are not&mdash;but, such as they are, both from the point of view of remuneration and conditions of service in some cases they set a very desirable standard.  There is a very wide disparity between the conditions obtaining in the voluntary hospitals in the City of Dublin.  When the Minister <Col N="388" /> says that he has no power in the matter, I should like to ascertain from him when he proposes to take such power, because it is very badly needed. I regret that under these two headings the Minister did not see fit to avail of this opportunity to bring in these two sections.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Childers stated, this Bill is welcomed by the House for what it contains and has been produced after many years' study of the matter by his predecessor as well as himself.  I am not clear on certain aspects of it from the point of view of the actual technical details. The title of the body to be set up is &ldquo;board&rdquo;.  After reading the Bill and listening to the Minister, I have come to the conclusion that a better title would be &ldquo;council&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;board&rdquo;, because certain of the functions of this board will be to a great extent similar to the functions of the Medical Council. I am not quite sure whether the Minister has made it clear to the House, particularly after Deputy O'Sullivan's intervention, whether all nurses, apart from all branches of nursing, are to be included under this board as well as all nurses taken on in the future, because if all nurses are to be included then, obviously, the nurses operating in private nursing homes will also be included.  I should like if the Minister would make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is another misunderstanding. Deputy O'Sullivan holds the view, as does the Minister, that even with the setting up of this board and the power he has already he has no power with regard to the voluntary hospitals. I do not agree with that.  I think the Minister, not only has power with regard to the voluntary hospitals, but exercises it very frequently, not only so far as the voluntary hospitals themselves are concerned but so far as the local authorities are concerned. The Minister spoke of this board recruiting the personnel into the nursing profession.  Here again we have a problem.  The history of nursing in this country is quite peculiar.  We have the mental institutions which recruit their own probationers to be trained to become nurses.  Within the mental hospitals there are people set <Col N="389" /> up to examine probationers, male and female, to see whether they have made sufficient progress to be qualified ultimately as nurses under the rules and regulations.  The Minister has something to do with that.  In the voluntary hospitals, a great number of which are teaching hospitals, there are certain requirements laid down.  Certain types of persons are asked for in the first instance and from those are selected the individuals whom the particular hospital thinks will be most suitable to be qualified in the nursing profession and particularly in the institution that takes them in.  Am I to take it that the voluntary hospitals and local authorities and private nursing homes will have to take their staffs from those who are registered under this board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I explain to the Deputy?  The recruitment of nurses will be carried on as it is being carried on at present.  This new board will not recruit for a voluntary hospital or a nursing home or anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that this board would be responsible for recruitment of personnel to the nursing profession.  I think the Minister used the word &ldquo;recruitment&rdquo; in his opening statement just now.  At present, the position is that the individual hospitals and institutions organise the recruitment themselves, and they have reasons for it.  They want to pick certain types and, later on, they qualify the particular nurses.  Am I to take it that recruitment by these institutions will have to be subject to this particular board's accepting these particular nurses, ultimately, on the register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This board will lay down certain standards for syllabuses and courses for nurses in general hospitals and institutions generally.  They will not actually recruit nurses at all themselves except where they are providing scholarships or post-graduate courses.  They will lay down certain syllabuses&mdash;much as the general nursing councils do at the moment.  It is a common course to all general hospitals which a girl will have to carry <Col N="390" /> out before she can get her certificate from this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that we are not opposing this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for interrupting the Deputy.  I was merely trying to clear the point in the Deputy's mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not, even yet, quite clear on the matter.  The Minister says that all interests have been consulted but I do not think he has stated&mdash;unless we can so conclude from the way he spoke&mdash;that all interests have indicated perfect happiness and satisfaction over the Bill.  To what extent have the existing hospitals, voluntary hospitals as well as local authority institutions, expressed their satisfaction as a result of consultations with them?  Different questions arise in connection with each hospital and in connection with each section of nursing.  In a particular teaching hospital a very high standard obtains as far as nurses are concerned.  One of the problems with regard to having sufficient nurses is due, if you like, to this double-edged situation.  Qualified nurses from good-class hospitals in this country are very much sought after across the water.  That, I think, is generally known.  A very attractive proposition is made to nurses who qualify in first-class hospitals here, in the shape, in the first instance, of much better pay.  Is it not a fact that a great deal of the complaint about the maximum rates of pay that can be accorded to nurses here is due to the refusal of the Minister&mdash;I will not say personally, but in his capacity as Minister&mdash;to allow institutions to increase their payments to certain types and grades of nurses?  Apart from that, England recruits from this country a great number of our young people to be taught nursing on the other side because, again, even in the matter of teaching, much more attractive terms are offered to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear references to living conditions of nurses attached to very highly organised hospitals with excellent staffs of nurses.  The Minister is aware that if the board of a particular <Col N="391" /> hospital wants to spend a little money to improve the living conditions of their nurses by making better provision for their accommodation, the proposal is turned down.  There is a new development which, I suppose, will be made known to a greater extent and that is the idea which is now in the minds of those who are the representatives of certain nurses that the living-in conditions should be, to a certain extent, remodelled and that nurses be allowed to live away from the hospitals and to go to their work in the same way as the ordinary business person goes to his business, and that the terms of their appointment should not include this living-in condition.</P>
    <P>I take it that when the Minister refers to this board's laying down the conditions of training and qualifications, that that will also be done in consultation with the existing teaching bodies and in association with the Medical Council.  After all, the Medical Council and the universities know, from the medical side, what is required and this board, I take it, will have to have some regard to that, in itself. When the Minister says, in regard to a local authority, that a person will have to have a certain amount of knowledge of public health requirements, I would point out that when a local authority seeks to appoint somebody who will have to attend to public health requirements, they specify in certain cases that certain people have to have a certain diploma or degree. It is quite common for people to take out a diploma in public health in our universities.  Is this body going to be regarded afterwards as a body that will accord degrees or qualifications and will the local institutions have to take these degrees or qualifications at the same value as, say, those of a normally recognised teaching institution?</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that this Bill is very necessary now that we are embarking on a large-scale hospital building scheme and that we should feel the draught in the matter of a shortage if we were not to take steps now.  Between the years 1932 and 1939 we had a very big hospital building <Col N="392" /> scheme and a number of hospitals were built in those years.  I have already said that I do not think that rate of building will ever be equalled again in this country any time.  The Minister is aware that I have promised to take off my hat publicly to him if, after seven years, he can show such a return as we were able to show in the period 1932 to 1939.  Fianna Fáil, with the limited facilities and attractions available to our nurses at home even in those years, as compared with the facilities and attractions which obtained abroad, were able to fill the positions in most of our hospitals to satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I want to say again from my own personal experience and knowledge and from long association with mental hospitals and with a number of our voluntary hospitals here in Dublin, that one of our great problems has always been to try to be able to offer as attractive employment conditions to our nurses as they were offered elsewhere. At one time in this country&mdash;the system has been changed now&mdash;a type of girl had to have a fee before she could enter a hospital for training and it very often meant that that type of girl was debarred because she had not the fee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that that has been changed, to a great extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>But not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  It should be abolished altogether.  A great number of members of good families in this country who could not find the necessary fee to enable them to be trained &mdash;and trained under circumstances where they would still have to be supplied by their families with certain needs such as clothing, and so forth&mdash; have been debarred.  We can easily get all our requirements met if, at the beginning, we remove the impediments in the way of people who are admirably suited but who have not got the £. s. d. and if we offer them attractive conditions of employment, even in the training periods, we will be removing one of the things which have militated against us in our efforts to keep the required numbers and to maintain at <Col N="393" /> home the very best of our people who are snapped from us as soon as they are qualified.  The Minister must see that this board will pay attention to these matters, apart from laying down the qualifications of nurses and the syllabus of studies.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat confused.  I do not know what the position of voluntary hospitals will be when this Bill becomes an Act and is put into operation. I hope the Minister will make that clear.  There are certain voluntary hospitals who want to be in a position, not only to decide the qualifications that their nurses should have, but also to select their nurses from the point of view of character.  The hospital authorities have a responsibility for their patients and they are entitled to pick and choose the individual nurses for their hospitals.  I want the Minister to make it clear now, whether in time to come, the employment of nurses will be on what one might call a strictly trade union basis or not.  I want to express the opinion now that it would be a pity if such a situation should arise because the personal touch enters into the relationship between the hospital authorities, the medical people attached to the hospitals and the nurses who are responsible from day to day and hour to hour for the patients.  Therefore, some room must be left for individual decision as to the method of selection.  I have no quarrel to find with the laying down of terms and conditions with regard to knowledge.  I agree with Deputy Childers that in certain parts of the nursing profession there are people who make do, but who could have a great deal more knowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree also with what has been said by a previous Minister that prevention of disease is much better than an effort to cure disease.  In this connection, I want to relate an experience we had in the Dublin Corporation.  There was a very serious scourge of gastroenteritis, with a very high mortality. After a great deal of examination by our officers and the local government officers, certain conclusions were reached.  We decided to bring into our service additional nurses who were to do the very things that Deputy <Col N="394" /> Childers has suggested, that is, to visit the houses and to instruct people in matters of hygiene, because we felt that one of the causes of gastroenteritis was lack of hygiene.  We considered that 20 nurses were the minimum with which we could satisfactorily carry out this very extensive and important campaign in the City of Dublin.  We were cut down to half that number.  Prevention is a very important matter.  There is no use in waiting until some scourge overtakes us and then trying to cure it and to eradicate all that it leaves behind.  We have the position in regard to gastroenteritis well in hands now but, nevertheless, we feel that we should be given greater assistance both in permission to appoint and in relation to the financial assistance we get in our efforts to safeguard the health of our people.</P>
    <P>This particular illness to which I have referred affects our infants in the first six months of their lives.  We have had, for a great number of years, a considerable loss of infants as a result of that particular illness.</P>
    <P>I will be anxious to read the reply of the Minister to this debate.  I hope he will be able to clear up some of the points that have been put to him. I hope that when the Committee Stage arrives we will be better informed and advised in regard to general principles.</P>
    <P>I believe that every section of the House will welcome the steps that have been and are being taken, though they may not be all that some of us might desire and may bring about some complications.  Nevertheless, the idea underlying this whole arrangement is a good one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity of saying a few words in regard to nursing and the nursing service generally.  I look on this co-ordinating Bill as largely in the nature of an experiment and I believe that, as a result of the working of that experiment, improvements, statutory improvements, amendments and perhaps a new Bill will come before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Everything that has been said in regard to the treatment of nurses in the debate is, I am quite sure, well understood by the Minister.  Girls adopting such a very important profession have been treated very badly.  To a large extent, both during the period of their training and subsequently, they have been held almost as prisoners, subject to disciplinary regulations that were entirely out of date.  If this Bill will result in an improvement of those conditions and in nurses being treated as they ought to be treated, then it certainly will be a good step forward.</P>
    <P>There is no shortage of material in this country for the nursing profession. A very large percentage of our girls, particularly our country girls, are keen to become members of the nursing profession.  Through rules and regulations in the past, very many who would have been excellent nurses were prevented from becoming nurses.  Since the beginning of the last war, during the war and since, and particularly since the Government in Great Britain extended its health services, there has been a continuous flow of young girls to England to be trained.  The conditions under which they are trained and under which they work after training is completed are much better than the conditions here.  Better conditions will always attract and if we are to stop the flow of nursing material from this country and provide for the nursing staffs that we will require in a very short time, then it is vital that nursing conditions both in training and after training should be improved.</P>
    <P>Young girls who adopt nursing as a career ought to be able to spend a considerable time in theoretical training before they begin to do practical work.  Their hours of duty ought to be so arranged that individual nurses, and particularly young girls, will not be required to do, as they have had to do in Dublin hospitals, long stretches of night duty.  In England a nurse in training has a half-day every other day and a whole day a week; their fares are paid to and from their homes; their laundry is free and they are paid a wage that enables them just to get along.  They are required <Col N="396" /> to pay no fee.  When they qualify there is an offer of employment for these young girls at very reasonable wages and under very good conditions.</P>
    <P>We must see that young girls who enter the nursing profession here are not treated as prisoners or as slaves. We must see that they get reasonable time to study, that there must be reasonable periods for lectures and theoretical training and reasonable hours of work.  Further, we must see that their living conditions are improved, because the living conditions of many nurses in this country are very bad.  Whatever little accommodation happens to be left in the hospital in a number of cases is set aside for the nurses&mdash;places in which patients cannot be put.  Those are considerations that confront each and every one of us and I know that the Minister is aware of them and knows how essential it is that such conditions must be improved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe has made a suggestion in regard to nurses being compelled to live in.  There ought to be some reasonable freedom for nurses. Perhaps a number of them would prefer to live in rather than to live out, but it might be considered here in Dublin whether there should not be a central nurses' home, properly equipped, in which nurses might reside when they are not on duty in the hospitals. They would be free to a large extent from unreasonable restrictions; they would have the ordinary freedom and liberty of humans which, unfortunately, in the past was denied them.</P>
    <P>In so far as this Bill is a step in the right direction, an experiment which we all hope will be successful, I am glad to see the welcome it is getting from all sides of the House.  Perhaps if we were to keep up the drive through the Minister, we might succeed in improving the conditions of student nurses generally.</P>
    <P>Maternity training has been mentioned. I understand that the maternity qualifications for Dublin hospitals are considered, and have been considered for many years, to be probably the highest in the world.  Now, that is an excellent thing and I am sure the staffs of those hospitals are anxious to keep abreast of all modern developments. They have created a standard <Col N="397" /> which is accepted in all parts of the English-speaking world, anyway, and I think we can trust them to maintain that particular standard and to avail of all fresh developments and any scientific aids that come along.</P>
    <P>My only reason for speaking on this Bill is to give expression to the views I hold in regard to the mistreatment of nurses in the past and to express the hope that we are now at the crossroads and that we are moving forward in a way that will make those bad conditions to which I have referred only a memory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Briscoe, I am very anxious as to the manner in which probationer nurses will be recruited.  I would like that nothing will be done to take appointments out of the hands of the local people when it comes to the recruitment of such nurses.  I think everybody will agree that it would be a bad thing if we were to hold examinations something like those held for the appointment of civil servants in order to get girls to qualify to become nurses.  The manner of a girl, her attitude generally, has a great effect on the patient.  In the case of local authorities or voluntary hospitals, they have their selection committees, which usually consist of the matron, the resident medical officer, the chairman of the committee or somebody else like that.  These selection committees take into account, just as much as the educational qualifications, the manner and other qualities of the girl &mdash;qualities that they think will tend to make her a good nurse.  That is a very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the voluntary hospitals in Cork they have committees to examine the girls in the same way, and that system has worked very satisfactorily.  There is another matter that we are very interested in in Cork and I hope this measure will provide some facilities in this direction.  We are interested in registering male nurses.  We had some male nurses in the Cork District Hospital but they were obliged to retire because of age.  We heard very complimentary remarks from time to time from visiting surgeons with reference to the help given by those male nurses. <Col N="398" /> There were aged male patients there who were treated better by a male nurse than they would be by a female. At the present time, the South Cork Board of Assistance are contemplating a scheme to appoint six registered male nurses and I hope this Nursing Bill will not interfere with that in any way. We have about three of the present attendants, who are very intelligent men, who would be described as male ward attendants and who will be recommended by the resident medical officer for these posts.  They will have to do their lectures the same as the ordinary probationer female nurse and pass their examination.  We are anxious at the present time that those who have given satisfactory service and who have carried out a lot of the duties which would be carried out in the ordinary way by probationer nurses, will be given facilities to go through that course of training and be allowed their present grade of pay during that probationary period.  I hope this new board will not interfere with that in any way and that they will give facilities for a few young men, who will be entering the service, to undergo that course.  In big institutions like the Cork District Hospital and St. Kevin's here in Dublin, it is necessary to have some registered male nurses.</P>
    <P>It is also my own personal opinion that midwives should have a general nursing qualification.  Many complications arise after childbirth that make such qualifications necessary.  That matter should be considered seriously in regard to new people entering the service.</P>
    <P>I believe we are not doing enough for our nurses.  In the voluntary hospital in Cork they stay indoor, while in the district hospital they live outdoor, going to their own homes.  They are not paid as they should be, nor are they provided with the recreation rooms and living accommodation they should get.  I hope this board will look into these matters and will not interfere in any way with the recruitment of probationers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should look for power to include every nurse, in voluntary hospitals and private nursing homes, as the conditions, the hours of work and the wages paid to them have a tremendous effect in a country like this.  I know of nurses in voluntary hospitals in Cork City&mdash;and it occurs in other places&mdash;who work ten weeks at night duty without a night off.</P>
      <P>If those nurses are not included, they should be, and I hope the Minister will include them.  I was looking forward to this Bill for a long time to remedy injustices to the nurses and I am glad the effort is being made by bringing in a measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a system in the voluntary hospitals where nurses are asked to pay a fee of £50&mdash;I think it is more now&mdash;just to get in for training and their remuneration&mdash;I could scarcely <Col N="400" /> call it wages&mdash;for the first, second and third years in these voluntary hospitals is the greatest injustice that could be inflicted on girls.  That is the reason why I am appealing to the Minister to make this Bill a comprehensive one covering every nurse.  I have in mind nurses employed in private nursing homes which do a big business in the line of nursing.  If this Bill will not protect nurses there, it is not proper to title it a Nurses Bill.  I do not wish to elaborate the point any further.  Everyone will agree there has been injustice to nurses up to now and in bringing in this Bill I would expect the Minister to ask for authority from this House to deal justly with nurses in all our institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill deals purely with creating a board that will be responsible for the registration, certification, control and training of nurses and for other matters relating to nurses and the practice of nursing. Such legislation was in operation here for a great number of years.  Two boards dealt with nursing.  One dealt with the registration of midwives, I understand, and the other dealt with general nursing.  The Minister proposes in this Bill to have one board. He is dissolving the General Nursing Council and the Central Midwives Board and creating one board to deal with both.  There seems no possible objection to that and it is desirable that one nursing council should deal with all types of nursing.</P>
      <P>Deputy McGrath raised the question whether midwives had general nursing training or not.  I am not clear on that myself, but I have some recollection that they have.  If they have not, I suggest to the Minister that the days of training purely in midwifery should be brought to an end and the type of nurses known as midwives in the past should be replaced by nurses who have general nursing training in addition to that as midwives.  Local authorities have expressed the opinion for many years that midwifery alone is, to a certain extent, obsolete as a profession. But that cannot be dealt with in this Bill.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Bill goes in providing for the training of nurses I see nothing objectionable in it.  I suggest that the Minister might make representations to this council to sanction all county hospitals in the country as proper institutions for the training of nurses.  I understand that up to quite recently very few of them were registered as suitable training institutions. I think the Minister should put all county hospitals on the list of suitable institutions for such training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once more, I register my objection to the comments of Deputy Cowan as to the conditions under which nurses have to work here.  Conditions in other countries are held up as an example.  There is too deeply rooted a habit in this House of holding up other countries as an example with <Col N="402" /> regard to conditions of service in different professions.  Our ambition is to have the best possible standard we can achieve for all sections of our community.  Nurses are an important organisation.  They are very important to the health of our people.  I believe that they have at their disposal an organisation, such as other sections of the community have, capable of ensuring decent standards for themselves. The ways and means for doing that are available to every section of our community and they have legislative authority and approval.  Nurses are no exception to the general rule.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan and Deputy Hickey were quite entitled to raise the question of the payment of student nurses and to ask the Minister to make recommendations to this new board in connection with conditions of service, and so forth, in relation to student nurses.  I think they were only doing their duty as public representatives in emphasising the necessity for this step upon the Minister.  Deputy Allen let slip&mdash;I think that is the most apposite way to describe it&mdash;a little piece of his own mind in this matter in relation to the number of girls applying for positions as student nurses.  He <Col N="404" /> told us that the supply actually exceeds the demand, and that there is a long waiting list of applicants.  Wherever that situation occurs it leaves those in charge in the happy position of being able to dictate their own terms and conditions.  If any complaint arises they are in the happy position of being able to say: &ldquo;We do not want you; there are other girls waiting to get in who are quite prepared to accept the conditions that you refuse to accept.&rdquo; In that way all complaints are smothered.</P>
      <P>We can congratulate our neighbours across the water on one particular aspect: by giving good conditions and good rates of pay to their nurses they have more or less forced us to follow along the same lines.  I think it would have taken a considerable period to implement here a proper policy with regard to nursing conditions were it not for the fact that we have suddenly become afraid that we shall lose our best material, since those desirous of taking up this profession may be tempted by the better conditions across the water to go to England for their training.</P>
      <P>The Minister deserves great credit for the work he has done so far in providing hospital services and so forth. I think, however, he should get down to brass tacks now in regard to the people who work in these hospitals. I believe that nurses have got a raw deal for years past.  I have seen very little improvement in their conditions up to the present time.  There are various points I would like to raise but I do not think they would be relevant on this particular measure.  We are all agreed that we must move with the times.  I think Deputy Davin pointed out that one of the things which held back development in the nursing profession and in their conditions generally was lack of organisation amongst the girls themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of organisation here at home.  When I say that I mean that when girls take up the nursing profession and enter as probationers they are more like a flock of sheep than anything else.  In the case of some hospitals they have many genuine grievances about the conditions, but they <Col N="405" /> are afraid to tell a public representative about them or to lodge a complaint. They feel that if they were to do so they will be nailed at a later stage of their training.  Whether that actually follows or not I do not know, but that is the impression these girls are under.  The result is that we do not hear half the complaints from the members of the profession that we should be hearing.  I have personal experience of that myself with regard to a number of hospitals.  I think the Minister knows about these places too.</P>
    <P>If an inspector is sent into any of these hospitals the girls are afraid to tell to him the grievances which they may have told to me two or three weeks earlier.  The inspector comes back and makes a report to the Minister to the effect that the complaints in the hospital are exaggerated and, of course, the Minister has to go on the report of his inspectors with regard to these complaints.  We have to face the facts, as Deputy Cowan said, that there is no use in treating nurses as if they were in a jail or a convent.  They are grown-up people.  These probationers are 18 years of age or over, and so I think they deserve a little more freedom of action than they have at the moment.  I suppose there are many people here who will not agree with me in regard to that.</P>
    <P>We have throughout the country domestic economy instructresses, poultry instructresses, typists, shorthand typists and clerks of all descriptions. Most of them are about the same age as nurses and to a great extent have received the same education. Yet the conditions under which they live are far different from the conditions under which student nurses are expected to live.  I suppose there is a certain amount to be said for a little more discipline in the nursing service in view of the fact that the work nurses do is so responsible.  At the same time, there is no use in treating nurses as if they were ten or 12 years of age, and of practically locking them in at 10 o'clock at night.  Everything possible should be done to make them happy and contented, and not have them going across to England.  There is the alternative of giving them more scope for happiness here at home, thereby <Col N="406" /> encouraging them to remain at home and not go to England.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should ask the council to examine the question of the staffing of hospitals. Again, I hope I will not be misinterpreted or misrepresented in regard to what I have to say on this.  I think that, in the case of any hospital, it would be better to have an ordinary lay nursing service or a nursing order. I do not believe in a mixture of the two.  I think it would be far better if you had a complete staff of lay nurses so that, from the time a probationer entered, the ordinary avenues of promotion would be open to her.  Where you have a mixture of both, then in all cases the plum positions and the senior appointments are held by the members of the nursing order, with the result that there is dissatisfaction among the ordinary nurses.  There is no opening for them to reach the positions to which they feel they are really entitled. I would ask the Minister to examine that matter.  It is a rather delicate question and certain people would like to misrepresent or misinterpret what one has to say on it.  I hope the Minister will give great heed to what Deputy Hickey and Deputy Cowan have said with regard to the conditions and welfare of the student body of nurses in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it must be obvious that the manner in which this Bill has been handled by Deputies on both sides of the House has been particularly satisfying.  I think that should be accepted, not so much as a tribute or an acknowledgment by Deputies on both sides of the House of the particular merits of the Bill, but rather as a tacit tribute by this House to the tremendous qualities and respect in which we all hold these ladies in the nursing profession, whether lay or religious, who are engaged in our hospitals throughout Ireland or wherever else they may be working.  In the course of the debate a number of useful, interesting and helpful comments have been made.  It may be possible for me to dispel some misapprehensions which appear to exist in relation to some points.  Deputy Childers is interested in a number of <Col N="407" /> points.  He asked about the dispensary nurse which was proposed in the White Paper issued by the previous Government some years ago.  The position about the dispensary nurse was that she was a sort of hybrid individual with a mixture of dual responsibilities, public health responsibility and the other.  I am not certain that for the future the pattern envisaged by Deputy Childers is one that we should follow.  I think, however, that the future of the nursing profession will certainly follow on the very sound lines suggested by Deputy Childers&mdash;that is, that the preventive side, in relation to public health, should be emphasised.  That is to say that our nurses should receive a training which will equip them to fight conditions which bring about disease rather than wait for the actual disease to break out.  I would like to assure Deputy Childers that I am in complete agreement with that approach to public health matters generally.  If this board sets up the training courses which we have in mind, then the public health type of nurse, with a bias towards the prevention of disease, is a likely development in the future. At the same time, there will be the midwife, who will be related to midwifery, to antenatal and neonatal and the delivery period.  In regard to ordinary infectious diseases, we shall have public health nurses.  In relation to maternity work, there will be the midwife, who will have responsibility for the prevention of ill-health either in the mother or in the child by antenatal care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McGrath and a number of other Deputies were interested in the future of the midwife and thought that she should have general nursing training in addition to her midwifery qualifications. Incidentally, I agree with that particular conception myself but I feel that it is a problem which should be left to this board, who will probably be more competent than we are to judge in these matters, to draw up the qualifications under which nurses will be allowed to practise, in relation to midwifery specifically.  Deputy Briscoe dealt with a number of points but was particularly interested in the question <Col N="408" /> of recruitment of probationer nurses. Deputy McGrath also displayed some interest in that matter.  It is intended that this board will lay down certain minimum qualifications for trainees in the nursing service but the recruitment of the personnel will lie entirely with the heads of the boards of the different institutions, as is the practice at present.  We do not believe that any material change will take place in that matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers and a number of other Deputies were interested in the position of the existing voluntary nursing organisations throughout the country.  Our attitude in regard to these is that we are very grateful indeed for the contribution which these various voluntary organisations make towards our health services throughout the country.  That contribution they have made throughout many long years when their services were particularly badly needed.  I do not intend to interfere in any way with the services they are giving at present and am most anxious that we should be able to continue to avail of them in the future. Any further encouragement that it is in my power to give I shall certainly accord to these bodies for whom we have the greatest admiration.</P>
    <P>In relation to the problem of staffing difficulties, and our ability to get nurses for our hospitals and institutions at present, we find, as the House is probably aware, that there is a considerably increased demand for nurses due to the expansion of services arising from institutions recently becoming available.  Where the institutions are situated in large cities or towns, we have met with no real difficulty in obtaining staff.  There have been isolated instances in which we have experienced some difficulty but there has not been any material disturbance in our ability to render essential services due to lack of nurses.  One very gratifying development is the considerable number of nurses who tend to return to the country and who seem to be reasonably satisfied with the conditions here.</P>
    <P>In relation to that point, many Deputies referred to the existing <Col N="409" /> conditions under which many of our nurses live and in which they are trained.  I am afraid I do not agree with Deputy Allen that it is in any way reprehensible for Deputies to refer to the conditions under which many of these girls in many of our hospitals, both local authority and voluntary hospitals, continue to live.  I do not think the conditions are in any way as bad as they were 20 or 30 years ago.  They are by no means anything like the standards which we must provide for our nurses in all our hospitals, voluntary and local authority. In admitting this fact, I know I may be held responsible for existing conditions.  All I can say is that as far as I possibly can I am trying to ensure that good reasonable conditions are provided, from the disciplinary point of view, from the food point of view and from the simple point of view of comfort&mdash;single separate rooms, good kitchen facilities, etc.  I am doing everything in my power to encourage local authorities to provide these minimum standards which I think our girls most richly deserve. I shall be grateful for any help which can be given in this connection by Deputies who happen to be members of local authorities and who can use their powers to help me in this task.</P>
    <P>In relation to buildings which we are erecting at present throughout the country, I do not think the nurses' homes will be bettered anywhere in the world but that is not much good just at present.  In the temporary institutions such as at Castlerea, Mallow and St. Mary's, we have tried to get standards which we think will be reasonably satisfactory.  They are certainly an improvement on the conditions under which girls at present live in many of our voluntary hospitals and in some of our local authority institutions. Deputy Hickey and another Deputy were very anxious that I should take some steps in relation to the voluntary hospitals.  Well, this Bill is a very limited Bill which, as Deputy Allen pointed out, is restricted to the question of recruitment, training and such like.  I do not care to go into the whole problem of my policy in relation to the future of the voluntary hospitals <Col N="410" /> here, but I do believe that we must intelligently anticipate the shortage which will come in from five to ten years' time, and that if we do not take steps now to deal with it the voluntary hospitals will face a shortage of nurses because of various reasons. One is that they are improving conditions considerably across the water; the second is that I am taking every step I can to improve conditions in local authority hospitals for which all of us here are responsible, and in that way I believe that I shall eventually start to drain away the long queues of nurses attending or attempting to attend the voluntary hospitals.  Therefore I believe that the voluntary hospitals will be faced with a real problem to provide nurses for themselves and, consequently, I think that they should take steps to provide really good conditions where they do not exist at the moment for their nurses.</P>
    <P>There is in Section 51 a clause which authorises this board to prescribe the manner in which and the conditions under which probationer nurses will carry out their training.  I believe that this board, composed as it is largely of nurses, will take steps to see that the minimum requirements which, all of us here agree, our nurses should have will be achieved.  I do agree also with Deputy McQuillan's argument that just because there may be an endless pool, as it appears there is, of nurses to train in voluntary hospitals we should then decide &ldquo;why bother?&rdquo; I think that we should decide the conditions which these girls deserve, provide these conditions for them and then we have discharged our responsibility. Similarly I would prefer if the voluntary hospitals had that approach to the problem rather than the one &ldquo;we have plenty; why bother?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe was concerned with the question of consultation with the medical registration council and also with the problem of the qualifications of nurses which possibly may be laid down by the board.  Under Section 68 I am bound to consult with the council in respect of certain rules concerning midwifery.  In relation to others concerning the qualifications of girls going into voluntary hospitals this <Col N="411" /> board has representatives of the voluntary hospitals which are at present training nurses, and I feel sure that before drawing up any hard and fast rules under which these girls will be recruited and trained they will take the very obvious step of consulting the different bodies, hospitals, organisations and institutions, upon whom they are dependent later on for the proper functioning of their scheme.  I do not believe, therefore, that if the board is the intelligent one envisaged Dáil Deputies need have any worries in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy McQuillan mentioned a rather delicate subject to which I would like, in passing, to refer but to which I attach rather considerable importance, that is, the problem of why a lot of our girls tend to go away and reach the top without much apparent difficulty in other countries, for that is the experience of anybody who knows what happens to these girls when they do go abroad.  There is a matter which local authorities must decide in each area, a matter which I know can be misrepresented in various ways but which, nevertheless, I feel is an important point in the approach of a girl to a career in nursing here at home, that is, whether she can feel that she can enter any of our hospitals and, going through the stages of probationer nurse, trained nurse, staff nurse, sister, and so on, eventually become matron of that hospital.  That must be a very much more encouraging prospect to her and if she has any good in her at all I would imagine that any worthwhile girl would say to herself: &ldquo;If I can get to the top in that hospital then I am prepared to go through the years of drudgery and hard work entailed in making my way up.&rdquo;  On the other hand, if she finds that the avenues of promotion end at staff nurse or ward sister, you would find it hard to blame her if she moves to a place where there are better prospects of promotion and of administrative posts of interest.  Consequently, the problem has been put to local authorities that when they are providing hospitals in the future they should consider the desirability of staffing their hospitals either exclusively with religious or <Col N="412" /> exclusively with lay staff.  It is a matter which rests entirely with the local authorities.  Many of the Deputies of this House are members of such local authorities and if they feel that they can help in any way to improve the opportunities of our girls and encourage them to stay at home I have no doubt that they will willingly seize on such opportunities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen and Deputy McGrath, I think, were concerned with the question of county hospitals becoming training hospitals.  That, of course, would be a very desirable development, and I would like to see it taking place.  Unfortunately, I think it is a matter which must be considered by this board, because they will have the authority to vet the different hospitals and accept or reject them as training hospitals.  I believe myself&mdash;although this is not generally applicable&mdash;that if we had followed a policy in relation to our county hospitals which by a process of regionalisation&mdash;not of six or seven counties but of two or three&mdash;would have been able to provide larger hospitals, and if instead of the present type of county hospital with from 60 to 110 beds we could have 200 beds in these sub-regions, then these hospitals would have been able to provide a very much more varied staff of specialists, such as physicians, surgeons, gynaecologists, obstetricians, ear, nose and throat men, eye men, and so on.  I think that that type of hospital would be very much more acceptable to the governing board of the nursing profession for purposes of training.  There are some of our county hospitals which simply cannot give the comprehensive training to our nurses which it is only fair to ask that they should receive.  It is a matter, however, which I hope the board will take up so that some of our county hospitals can, either by themselves or in co-operation with nearby local hospitals, regional, local authority or voluntary hospitals, give us that service, so that we can provide a wider scope for girls entering the local authority nursing service. I would be completely opposed to girls being asked for fees when going for training.  That is a matter on <Col N="413" /> which the voluntary hospitals have their own policy, but mine is that they should not pay fees in the local authority hospitals at any time.  If a girl is qualified to go for nursing, she should be given every encouragement, and no impediment at all should be placed in her path.</P>
    <P>With regard to the small point of discipline to which Deputy Cowan and Deputy McQuillan referred, we have responsibilities which we cannot completely ignore in the local authority services and no doubt the situation is similar in the voluntary hospitals. These girls are young girls and the officers in these institutions act <i>in loco parentis,</i> and I do not think that one could give the latitude suggested by Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Cowan because of the obvious dangers in relation to girls of that age.  I think, however, that, once a girl becomes qualified, she has definitely come to the age when she can be trusted to look after her own best interests, and in that way I would encourage a very much more liberal attitude in the matter of recreation, discipline and the comings and goings generally of nurses. That is a matter for each local authority, and I think that on the whole they are tending to become a little more flexible in their views on this matter.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to private nursing homes and the conditions of service in these homes.  The conditions of employment and the control of these homes are matters which have given worry and concern from time to time. The girls there, if they are trained nurses, are naturally in the same category as nurses working in any other hospital or institution, and it is thereby ensured that a certain standard of nursing is available in these homes.  The question of supervision, administration and so on is one which this board can, I think, usefully investigate.  At present, we have no powers to deal with them, but if this board examined the conditions in these nursing homes and felt that some changes could usefully and desirably be made throughout the country, I would be prepared to introduce legislation to provide us with these powers <Col N="414" /> to bring about any improvement suggested.</P>
    <P>This is a limited Bill, covering a limited aspect of nursing generally. The whole policy with regard to the future of nursing is a matter which will require considerable thought on our part, in view of the very wide expansion which must follow the proposed mother and child health scheme, the new institutions and hospitals and the conditions of service of nurses. These are matters to which I certainly will give every consideration.  I, like every other Deputy&mdash;and possibly even more so&mdash;have every reason to have the greatest respect and regard for the work done by our nurses in our institutions and hospitals, and, in formulating the policy for the future, that will be the guiding factor.  So far as it is possible within the resources of the State, I shall ensure that my policy will make available for these girls the best nursing conditions we can make available, not simply lest they might become harder to get in the years to come, but simply and solely because they are deserving and more than deserving, of everything we can possibly give them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would allow me to ask a question.  In asking it, I admit frankly that perhaps I have not made a sufficiently detailed comparison of the new board with previous boards, but I should like to know if it is necessary for the Minister to nominate so many to the board&mdash; the general board and the midwives committee.  With regard to Section 12, sub-section (3), which is the section which refers to consultation by the Minister with organisations, it would be helpful to us for the Committee Stage if he would give some indication of what exactly he means by consultation. It is variously interpreted in different Acts.  In some cases, the Minister accepts almost automatically 80 per cent. of the people proposed to him by the various organisations, or a number from the total number proposed to him, and perhaps adds a few individuals who, he feels, will represent his particular point of view and the point of view of the Government of the day.  At the same time, he ensures <Col N="415" /> that the interests of the minority within the community will have every consideration and perhaps more consideration than their numbers necessarily entitle them to.  In the case of other boards, Ministers in the past have taken, if you like, a more political point of view and have rather encouraged voluntary associations to approve of their own nominations.  If the Minister would tell us what his attitude is with regard to the consultation element and to what extent he thinks it necessary to nominate so many people, I think it would help us on the Committee Stage.</P>

I am sure the Minister has spent the last 12 months examining the very strong arguments I put forward in favour of this amendment. I am not going to repeat those arguments this evening.  If I have not succeeded in convincing the Minister in the 12 months intervening, I am not going to do it this evening.  The section itself provides that on the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence the court may, if satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of the accused, exclude the public or prohibit publication.  The whole debate and arguments hinged round the words &ldquo;if satisfied that it is expedient.&rdquo;  This is not the trial, as I said; it is simply the preliminary investigation of an indictable offence by a district justice, and the district justice has to be satisfied that it is expedient in the interests of the accused before he may exclude the public or prohibit publication or disclosure of information in regard to the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I have endeavoured to make is a very simple one&mdash;that the best person to understand what is expedient in the interests of the accused is the accused person himself and not the district justice.  If the accused person is of opinion that his trial would be prejudiced or that it is not in his interest that there should be publication or that the court should be open to the public at the preliminary investigation, and if he indicates that himself or through his counsel, I think the district justice should be compelled to accept that as being in the interests of the accused person.  Otherwise there might be an argument lasting <Col N="417" /> perhaps a whole morning or a whole day as to whether or not it was expedient in the interests of the accused that there should be publication or that the public should be present when the case is being heard. The amendment suggests that if the accused person desires that the public should be present and that the newspapers should publish the proceedings then the district justice cannot close the court.  There is an historical reason for that.  I think it is necessary in the interests of citizens generally that there should be that particular protection because it is undoubtedly a protection.</P>
    <P>There have been cases in this country in the past where persons were brought before a court and the public and the Press excluded and the public generally did not know what the accused was charged with, what was against him, what evidence there was, although the accused person in his own interest might have been very anxious that the public should know.</P>
    <P>I think that the amendment is a reasonable way of resolving the difficulties. It gives the very best protection to the accused person.  The proceedings on investigation are not a trial.  They are an investigation where the evidence is reduced to writing and in which the accused, if he is a sensible person, will not cross-examine, give any evidence, or say anything about his defence.  When he comes to be tried, the court is open to the public and to the Press.  Everything that is said for and against the particular accused is open to the public and to the Press.  In these cases of preliminary investigation there should be no publicity unless the accused wants it.</P>
    <P>Strange as it may seem, there are cases where evil-minded persons avail of an opportunity for the purpose of doing injury to an accused person.  A person who is absolutely innocent may be charged with an offence and there is a preliminary investigation in regard to it.  An evil-minded person may, anonymously or otherwise, communicate with the newspapers and ask them to make sure to have a representative present for the purpose of publishing the proceedings.  As I said already, I <Col N="418" /> am absolutely in favour of the open court to try offences, but this is not a trial; it is just a preliminary investigation where one side of the story is put, the case for the prosecution, and if, in these circumstances, where one side of the case is being put, the accused desires that the court shall not be open to the public or that there should be no publication in the Press, then I think it is a reasonable request that should be granted.  If the amendment were adopted, then protection would be given to him.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion we were treated here to a discussion on high constitutional law.  I have endeavoured to see in what way, from a constitutional point of view, the amendment differs from the section as it stands.  The section provides that the things can be done if the justice so decides that it is in the interests of the accused. The amendment provides that the interests of the accused will be paramount.  I cannot see how the Constitution comes into this at all.  If the constitutional argument is right, then it is doubtful whether the section is constitutional.</P>
    <P>I put forward all the arguments on the last occasion.  I only hope that the Minister and his advisers, in the long period that has elapsed, have been able to see the desirability and the necessity for this particular amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with great attention to all that Deputy Cowan has had to say in support of his amendment but I have not altered my view that the amendment is unacceptable. It is true that we had a long time to consider the matter since December last.  I thought that the Deputy, on examination, might have changed his mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at all deny that an accused person may be and usually is the best judge of his own interests.  But where the administration of justice is concerned there is question, not merely of the accused's interests, but of the public interest.  I cannot accept the view that the provision of Article 34 of the Constitution to the effect that justice shall be administered in public save in such special and limited cases <Col N="419" /> as may be prescribed by law does not extend or apply to the preliminary investigation of indictable offences. But, however this may be, it is manifestly in the public interest that the public should know, amongst other things, how the preliminary investigation of indictable offences is being conducted in our courts and that there should be full publicity for the methods of the prosecution.</P>
    <P>It may save time if I say at this stage that I myself have had second thoughts on this section and that I have come to the conclusion that the only interest of the accused that can legitimately be safeguarded is that there should not be any publicity which, in the opinion of the court, would be likely to prejudice his trial. But subject to this, as will be apparent when we come to discuss the amendment to the sub-section that I myself have tabled, I think that we should move almost in the opposite direction to that in which the Deputy would have us go and aim at publicity of some sort in every case where such publicity would not be likely in the opinion of the court to prejudice the trial of the accused.  On the other hand, I am prepared to accept in principle the next amendment standing in the name of Deputy Boland, that is to say, the principle that subject to the exception specified there should be no publicity, if, but only if, there is a likelihood of the accused being prejudiced in his trial.  I am not, of course, referring to the indecent or obscene case, which stands on a different footing, and for which separate provision is being made.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment as it stands, but I am prepared to go as far as I have suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting the principle.  I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete lines 55 and 56 and substitute &ldquo;interests of the accused, do any one or more of the following&mdash;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment has a twofold object.  First, by inserting the words &ldquo;do any one or more of the following&rdquo;&mdash;that is, any of the things set out here in (a), (b) and (c)&mdash;it is hoped to make it clearer on the face of the section that the powers which the section proposes to confer on the court to exclude the public or any particular portion of the public or to prohibit publication of information in relation to the proceedings are powers that may be exercised jointly or in the alternative.</P>
      <P>Some importance is attached to this point because one of the criticisms directed against the present position, in which the District Court has only power to take the depositions <i>in camera,</i> is that if the accused is a person of some standing in the locality and after <i>in camera</i> proceedings on the depositions, the justice refuses informations, there is a possibility of harmful comment amongst local people who may be inclined to think that justice has not been done.  Under the new powers which the District Court will have under sub-section (1) of Section 18, the justice, if he thinks it possible or likely that there may be adverse comment if the deposition proceedings, conducted <i>in camera,</i> have a certain result, can guard against such an eventuality by refusing to take the depositions <i>in camera</i> and, instead, making an order prohibiting publication which should be sufficient to protect the accused against the risk of an unfair trial if he is returned for trial. For these reasons, it is considered desirable to make it quite clear that the court's powers under sub-section (1) are powers which it may exercise in the alternative as well as jointly and the amendment will do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, on further consideration, it is thought that it would be better that sub-section (1) should be restricted entirely to dealing with that aspect of <Col N="421" /> the proceedings on the preliminary investigation of indictable offences which is concerned with the protection of the accused's interests and that, in so far as it is necessary to provide for the case in which the offence the subject of the deposition proceedings is of an indecent or obscene nature, this should be done as part of the provision dealing generally with that class of offence.  Accordingly, the amendment deletes the reference in sub-section (1) to the &ldquo;indecent or obscene nature of the offence&rdquo; and, in amendment No. 38, it is proposed to recast sub-section (2) of the section so as to make it clear that that sub-section (2) will apply to the preliminary investigation of indictable offences as well as to the trial of such offences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the point about leaving the indecent or obscene nature of offence out, but there is one point which I should like cleared up. The Minister is accepting in principle amendment No. 33.  Amendment No. 33 affects lines 54 and 55: it also affects line 56.  On the other hand, this amendment No. 34 is to delete the two lines and to substitute &ldquo;interests of the accused, do any one or more of the following&mdash;&rdquo;.  The essential thing in the amendment which the Minister says he is going to accept in principle is the substitution of the idea that it is the likelihood of the accused being prejudiced that should be the ruling point rather than his interest.  It is a fine point, I grant you, but nevertheless it is a point.  He is amending the section in these particular lines and he retains &ldquo;in the interests of the accused&rdquo;.  Does this mean that amendment No. 33, now, is going to be abortive on Report?  Does it mean that it, itself, is going to be the subject of an amendment on Report?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 37:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Any restrictions or limitations on publication which have been imposed under sub-section (1) in the interest of the fair trial of the accused shall not remain in force after a jury has been sworn to try the offence with which the accused is being charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's acceptance of the priciple of Deputy Boland's amendment is all the more reason for accepting this amendment.  The restriction on publication, as we are now all agreed, is in the interests of the fair trial of the accused or lest there be any likelihood that he may not get a fair trial.  The reason for that, as Deputy Cowan pointed out, is that in the preliminary hearing the newspapers get a onesided story.  There are not many newspapers that report day-to-day proceedings in court in this country, with the <Col N="423" /> result that it is only reasonable to assume that almost every member of the jury who will come later to try the accused will have read one or other of such newspapers.  That is beside the point in so far as this amendment is concerned.</P>
    <P>It often happens that something of public importance is disclosed at a hearing in the district court and the Press might be precluded from reporting it.  When the accused comes forward for trial he may plead guilty. If the section is allowed to stand as at present, what happened in the district court, probably, will never come to light.  It may be in the interests of the public generally that what happened in the District Court should be made common knowledge.  Once the accused has been arraigned or has pleaded guilty, the interests of a fair trial are not prejudiced.  I would suggest to the Minister, therefore, that there are cases when this restriction should be relaxed.</P>
    <P>I can indicate another instance which happens quite frequently at the trial of accused persons.  The evidence of a particular witness in the District Court may not be required by the State at the hearing.  The State may then say to the representatives of the accused: &ldquo;We are not calling this witness but we will offer him to you if you want him.&rdquo;  It may happen that what this witness has to say would not help the accused, and therefore he would not be called by the defence. What he had said in the District Court might disclose some course of conduct or set of facts that it would be in the interests of the public to know.  An astute reporter might realise that fact and might have taken a note of what happened in the District Court but, by order of the justice, might have been precluded from publishing it.  If he or his editor thinks at a later stage that it would be in the interests of the public generally to have this matter published, the Press generally should get power to do so, and this limitation or restriction should last only up to the time of the commencement of the trial of the accused.  From that on there would be no danger that the publication <Col N="424" /> of that matter would affect his fair trial because the jury would have been sworn and the case might be over.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that a famous English judge, I think it was Lord Justice Goddard, in a reported case in the early part of this century, said that the court must have regard not only for the interests of the accused but for the interests of justice and I submit that the interests of justice are the interests of the people generally.  Therefore, if a set of facts is disclosed in the District Court which it would be in the interests of the public to know and if publication of that set of facts is precluded, I suggest that it would be only reasonable to the public and the Press that the Press should have a chance of presenting those facts to the public either after the commencement of the trial or after the conclusion of the trial or, at least, when the interests of the fair trial of the accused can on longer be prejudiced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of this amendment the following points should be weighed.  I should imagine that the genesis of the section and the reason why it has come to the fore are simply this, that it has been the experience of lawyers like Deputy Cowan, defending prisoners, that they started at a disadvantage because of the fact that depositions had been published.  The difficulty can arise very definitely in this way, that on the deposition stage the evidence against the accused was taken and normally up to this&mdash;there will be perhaps a slight change when this Bill becomes law&mdash;an accused person said very little and there was very little cross-examination. Therefore, the State's allegations went unchallenged.  Two things could happen.  If this was published in detail, as frequently happened if the case was an interesting case, the evidence for the State was put over to the public, so to speak, without any rebutting evidence.  That tended to prejudice jurymen because it was almost certain that you could not swear a panel without including a majority in that jury who had read the report.  Secondly, another difficulty arose.  Some of these depositions and, <Col N="425" /> in particular, statements, might be ruled out under the laws of evidence at the trial and could not go to the jury in court, but that would be of very little avail to the accused if, in fact, they had already got to the jurymen through the newspapers.  In most big cases, particularly capital charges, which get publicity, it has been an unfortunate fact in the past that the mind of the public has been largely conditioned by the impression given by the newspapers in reporting the deposition stage.  That is the case for the section.</P>
      <P>To take Deputy Lynch's amendment, however, there is another side to that story, another side to the argument. It is obviously very much in the interests of national justice that the matter should be published and, although these proceedings are not the trial, they are nevertheless proceedings in the case and, as Deputy Lynch has pointed out, matters which should be known to the public and which are important to the public, and would be important from the point of view of safeguarding the administration of justice, can be disclosed at that stage and should ultimately be published, and the suppression of them may open the way for abuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch has enumerated two points.  I would add to them.  There are, I think, four conceivable cases where the evidence is taken in the district court, and, when the case comes to the criminal court, whether the circuit criminal court or the central criminal court, that evidence may never again reach the light if the law stands as the Bill proposes.  One is where there is a plea of guilty, which Deputy Lynch mentioned.  There would be no evidence after that. There might be disclosures in the court which would be of public importance.  It is very easy to conceive how that would work out.  The legal advisers advising an accused person to plead guilty at that stage do it for the very purpose of suppressing damaging evidence.  That would be one of the considerations in advising an accused to plead guilty.  Damaging evidence may come out, and the accused may wish to suppress that <Col N="426" /> evidence and take his rap on a plea of guilty.  It can happen.  That would not be in the interests of the State in certain conceivable cases.</P>
    <P>The next case is the opposite to that, where the State could enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> at that stage of coming to trial.  I put this merely as a hypothetical case.  Fortunately or unfortunately, when you are dealing with principles you have to consider the hypothetical case and the safeguards. Supposing something came up in the course of a case that was damaging to the Executive, whether in any particular detail or generally.  That could be suppressed at the District Court stage.  Then, if the people responsible, whether Government or lower down the line, decided it would be better not to have this thing getting out, they would enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> against the accused, and then it would not get out.  I am not suggesting the Minister would countenance that, but it is a possibility.</P>
    <P>There you have two cases.  The plea of guilty achieves that where the accused is anxious to do it, and entering a <i>nolle</i> will achieve it where the State might want to do it.  Such a condition of things might arise.  A direction on a pleading straight away might have the same possibilities.  It is because of the possibility of abuse that I think it would be well to accept Deputy Lynch's amendment in principle.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to this.  From the normal news point of view, it cannot damage an accused at that stage.  We have to consider this aspect, the avidity of news editors and subordinating that appetite in the interests of the accused man.  It is that which has caused the mischief which this section is designed to remedy.  That mischief will not be there at that stage. When it gets to the trial stage the news at the deposition stage will be stale and will not be reported.  It may be reported only for the reason that I have outlined, in which case it is highly essential in the public interest that it should be reported.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I will add my voice to Deputy Lynch's and I will ask the <Col N="427" /> Minister to accept this amendment in principle.  It would be well to have a provision of that nature.  As the section stands, there might be a temptation either on the part of the State or individuals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment proposed by Deputy Lynch and supported by Deputy de Valera would achieve what they have in mind. I cannot see anything in the Bill that precluded the right they are looking for in this amendment.</P>
      <P>The position is this, that we have jealously guarded the stage of the proceedings that might prove prejudicial to the accused.  When the case comes before the trial court, whether it be the Circuit Court or the Central Criminal Court, a different stage of the proceedings is reached.  If then, either of the extraordinary hypothetical cases cited by Deputy de Valera is to occur, if, for instance, the State is to enter a <i>nolle prosequi,</i> what harm can be done? There has been no disclosure up to that point, no publicity.  If the State then decides to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> no harm has been done to the accused, nothing prejudicial has occurred.  Therefore, the entering of the <i>nolle</i> cannot do much harm.</P>
      <P>If, in the other case, a man decides to plead guilty, we are then at a different stage.  We are at the trial of the accused and the condition of a fair trial has been met.  I do not think there is anything in the Bill to prevent the Press from publishing, from the point of view of news value or national importance, anything that has occurred at the trial.  There is nothing in this measure which precludes the Press or the people in court from assessing what has happened on the deposition stage before the plea of guilty.  There is nothing to stop publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand Deputy Lynch's anxiety, but the Bill does not preclude from happening exactly what Deputy Lynch wants to happen.  I do not think the inclusion of the amendment would make it happen in any way more effectively.  I suggest we are getting a little mixed up by the raising of imaginary difficulties.  I think the Bill <Col N="428" /> as it stands affords as big a safeguard as what Deputy Lynch has in mind in his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see some virtue in what Deputy Collins has said.  Clearly, the restriction on publication relates only to the taking of depositions in the District Court.  Once that stage is passed, the trial, if there is to be a trial, can get all the publicity necessary. Fortunately, here in Dublin we are not burdened too much with the publication of trials because the newspapers have enough material to keep them going; but in the country you will get a very full report of all kinds of trials, including public inquiries. Deputy Lynch's amendment sets out that the case can be published after the jury has been sworn.  But if a person pleads guilty, no jury is sworn at all, so that the point Deputy Lynch wants to establish does not work out. The section which Deputy Lynch proposes authorises publication only after a jury has been sworn.  If the accused pleads guilty the position is altered.  If there is a <i>nolle</i> entered the same thing applies, so that if the section suggested by Deputy Lynch were inserted it might create the position that after a plea of guilty or after the entering of a <i>nolle</i> there could be no publication. I do not think that is what Deputy Lynch wants; in fact, what he wants is publication.  If the Minister could meet the principle that Deputy Lynch has put forward, by including a very short addition to paragraph (b) of Section 18 (1)&mdash;in other words, that he could prohibit the publication &ldquo;prior to the arraignment&rdquo;, I think an amendment on that basis would be accepted and if that is accepted I think we could leave it to the Minister to draft the final amendment.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Cowan's suggestion is an excellent one. I had some doubts about the wording of the amendment, but the proper word did not suggest itself to me.  Deputy Cowan has just given it, the word &ldquo;arraignment.&rdquo;  In answer to Deputy Collins, let us follow a case&mdash;I confess that it is completely hypothetical&mdash;and suppose you have the accused duly brought before the district justice for the taking of informations and that, <Col N="429" /> in the course of those informations, some disclosure is made which is a temptation to the Executive or which would be good reason for the Executive not wanting to go on, as it would be an embarrassment.  If at the trial there is an order made under sub-section (1) (b) prohibiting the publication &mdash;I am leaving out the word &ldquo;disclosure,&rdquo; as that is going to be dropped &mdash;of information relating to the proceedings or any part of them, that is an absolute prohibition as the Bill would stand and it would endure in perpetuity.</P>

      <P>There is nothing about the criminal code there.  &ldquo;Prohibit the publication&rdquo; is the plain straightforward wording of an unlimited act and it simply means &ldquo;prohibit the publication.&rdquo;  After all, the common way of construing a statute is to take the commonsense language of it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It might not.  The Deputy knows as well as I do how easy it is to get rumour and how hard it is to get truth on which you may move. A disclosure in a court before a district justice must be taken notice of.  Let me follow my hypothetical case.  As this section stands, it would be an absolute prohibition of publication, to endure for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see what happens next.  The people who are tempted&mdash;I do not want to be more explicit than that&mdash; decide they are going to avoid this embarrassment by entering a <i>nolle prosequi.</i>  It simply means that, when it comes to arraignment, they inform the court that there is a <i>nolle prosequi</i> entered and the accused goes out without any further reference.  The thing thereafter is completely hushed up.  A number of reporters actually in court may have heard it&mdash;and other people, too&mdash;but no use can be made of it.  It is then merely a rumour and nothing <Col N="430" /> can be done about it&mdash;except possibly in this House.  The point that Deputy Lynch is making is that it would be a safeguard to limit that ban until such time as the accused cannot be prejudiced in his trial&mdash;in his trial, mind you.  Do not press this so far&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Leave it so that the accused would not be prejudiced in his trial.  He cannot be prejudiced when it comes to the point of arraignment. That is why, with respect to my colleague, Deputy Lynch&mdash;I do not know whether he will accept this or not&mdash;I think Deputy Cowan's suggested alteration to the period &ldquo;of arraignment&rdquo; is a very happy one.  It would meet precisely the case we are trying to make and I suggest that the Minister accept it.</P>

      <P>I agree with what Deputy Cowan has said.  As a matter of fact, in proposing this amendment, I saw the limitations I imposed in it. What I really intended, and I think I made it clear in the gist of my remarks, was that I wanted this limitation lifted as soon as the fair trial of the accused was no longer prejudiced or capable of being prejudiced.  I am asking the Minister to accept the principle of that, in so far as he can.  Secondly, in reply to Deputy Collins, I think he has gone completely awry in regard to his reading of this section.  As I read it, I agree with Deputy de Valera that this prohibition is in perpetuity.  It is a positive Act of Parliament.  It provides nowhere in the Act for the lifting of the prohibition once it has been imposed.  Therefore, I suggest that the Minister should accept, at least in principle, the amendment I proposed, with the alteration suggested by Deputy Cowan.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 38:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (2) and substitute:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  In any criminal proceedings for an offence which is, in the opinion of the court, of an indecent or obscene nature, the court may, subject to sub-section (3), exclude from the court during the hearing all persons except officers of the court, persons directly concerned in the proceedings, <i>bona fide</i> representatives of the Press, and such other persons as the court may, in its discretion, permit to remain.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to offences of an indecent or obscene nature.  As I have explained in connection with amendment No. 34, one of the purposes of recasting sub-section (2) of Section 18, as proposed in this amendment, is to extend its provisions so as to cover the preliminary investigation of indictable offences as well as the trial of such offences.  This is done by adopting the wider formula &ldquo;In any criminal proceedings&rdquo; used in the amendment instead of the words &ldquo;where a person is being tried,&rdquo; which are in sub-section (2) as it stands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposes to change sub-section (2) in another way also, namely by adding at the end of the sub-section the words &ldquo;and such other persons as the court may, in its discretion, permit to remain&rdquo;.  That is, they would be allowed as well as the one female relative.  This was intended <Col N="432" /> to meet the point raised by Deputy Boland, amongst other Deputies, that some provision should be made to ensure that the relatives or close friends of an accused person might be allowed to remain in court. Deputy Boland has, I think, the same object in view in his amendment No. 39 and I want to say at this stage that I have an open mind as to whether his proposal to amend sub-section (3) is not perhaps a better proposal.  It has, at all events, I think, the merit of being more explicit but, on the other hand, it is more restricted in scope. However, when I have heard the views of Deputy Boland and other Deputies, I shall be prepared, if necessary, to reconsider the whole question before the Report Stage.  In the meantime, I would ask the House to agree to my amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is prepared to do something that meets what I have suggested here, I will not press this.  I think it would be wrong to permit only one female relative to be present.  A young boy might be accused of the wrong and would need some protection. If the Minister would add &ldquo;such other persons&rdquo; and leave it to the discretion of the court, I would be satisfied.  To leave it to one female relative would not be proper at all.</P>

      <P>I intervene with some little degree of temerity because there are so many lawyers in the House, but I at least have Deputy Boland to support me.  The purpose of this section is mainly to give power to the justice to exclude from the court at the preliminary hearing of an indictable offence such persons as he may decide ought to be excluded.  I take it that is the simple meaning of the section. May I put a hypothetical case?  Supposing a justice refuses informations during such a preliminary hearing, what will be the result?  The accused may be represented; witnesses may be cross-examined and the justice in his discretion may decide finally to refuse informations.  It may happen that as a result the public will be dissatisfied. There will be no publicity and no reason will be given.  The public will have no means of weighing the evidence that was given.  They will have no opportunity of studying the crossexamination. It might even be suggested, perhaps, that some witnesses were not put forward at this preliminary hearing.  Is there a danger in that?  I ask the Minister and the House to consider the position from that particular aspect.  It is an important aspect.  It is not unlikely to happen.  It has happened in the past. It has happened that very grave doubt existed in the public mind as to the course of a preliminary investigation. I think some safeguard is called for in this connection before this measure passes into law.  As the section stands at present, the position I outlined might arise.  I know that it has happened in the past that the public were disturbed as a result of a preliminary investigation at which they had no means of knowing the evidence that was put forward or the cross-examination that took place which brought about the particular result.</P>

      <P>The Press cannot be excluded from the court.  All that is provided for is that they may be prohibited from publishing.  Amendment No. 34 ensures that they can publish what they please.  The point the Deputy has made may be advanced in defence of my amendment since it could happen that by the suppression of evidence justice would appear not to be done.  Justice must be done. Not only must it be done, but it must also appear to be done and people should, therefore, have an opportunity of knowing the grounds upon which information was refused.  Once the trial is over, full publicity may be given to the matter and the people generally will thereby have an opportunity of examining the matter for themselves.  Of course, if it is in any way obscene it cannot be published. I think the ground is fully covered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>The Minister has asked what is the position at the moment.  The position is that up to the present such proceedings were published and the public was accurately informed as to what happened.  The public was able to fill the gaps in relation to what did not happen.  If everything is suppressed, all that will go round is indefinite rumour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Allen has drawn attention to something which will, I am sure, lead to some slight amendment of the section.  I agree with the Minister it is an indictment of the Attorney-General, of prosecuting <Col N="436" /> counsel, of State solicitors, superintendents and members of the Garda Síochána.  I have had a long experience of defending accused persons.  I have never been on the prosecuting side.  I must say that I never got any change out of the prosecution.  Prosecuting counsel, irrespective of who appointed them, went into court and did their duty in the way in which they conceived it ought to be done.  I have often had to complain that they were pushing their case a bit too far.  That is my own personal view.  I am glad Deputy Allen has given me this opportunity of expressing my complete confidence in counsel over a long number of years, in State solicitors, superintendents and members of the Garda Síochána who have prosecuted in the courts.  They have done it well and in the interest of the public.</P>
      <P>Human nature enters into all these things, and it is quite possible that there may have been an isolated instance here or there, about which there was a certain amount of talk. They have an old saying in the country that &ldquo;there is no smoke without fire.&rdquo; There is an extraordinary desire, often on the part of people, to see an unpopular fellow sent to jail, just as there is a strong desire to see a very popular fellow get off, no matter how guilty he may be.  If certain people who do not know anything about the facts make up their minds and say, &ldquo;Well, there has been a bit of a job done in this case,&rdquo; they may be entirely wrong in regard to that.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is right to give the impression, because people want to see a man convicted, that the prosecution has been lax or has been corrupt in putting the case against him, or that the district justice or Circuit Court judge acts corruptly in entering into the spirit of the thing. Now, I do not think this has very much to do with the Bill at all.  I think that all of us, representing as we do the general public, rightly have a very strong confidence in the whole administration of justice from the point of view of the fairness and efficiency of the prosecutors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising a specific case.  It is the principle of the matter that I am dealing with.  It may be that it is that type of procedure which Deputy Allen has in mind.  There is one protection for the public and it is that if the proceedings were known the attention of the Attorney-General, possibly, would be directed to a miscarriage of justice if, in fact, a miscarriage of justice had taken place. The Minister states that, once informations have been refused, there will be full publication of the proceedings &mdash; that the Press will be free to publish them.  If you had a case, say, where the Attorney-General decided, notwithstanding the refusal of informations in the court below, that the matter was going to be revived, it would mean that the accused would possibly be prejudiced by that publication.  I do not know whether the Minister has adverted to that but, if not, he might do so in the event of such a complication arising in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that I have been dealing with these possibilities on a purely hypothetical basis, the reason being, as the Minister <Col N="438" /> will appreciate, that it is the hypothetical cases which will show one the possibilities of danger.  Fundamentally, we come back to what the Minister himself has said, and that is, the appearance of justice being done.  It is a great safeguard indeed to have this publication because no matter what rumours or criticism are there, this much has to be said, namely, that the accused has a specific set of circumstances to meet, whereas if there is no publicity the State itself may be the victim of rumour.  I agree with Deputy Cowan that, in my experience, there has been very fair prosecution, and very efficient prosecution, by the Gardaí in most cases.  I have also seen cases where things have been said about the presentation of a trial because people have not appreciated the difficulties in regard to evidence or something of that nature, or the diffculties of the police in a particular case.  It is important in such a case that there should be full and accurate publication rather than that rumours should go riding around.  I make these suggestions on a purely hypothetical basis.  These hypothetical cases are enough reason to show the soundness of the approach heretofore.  After all, the only reason for the section is the fact that premature publication has too frequently in the past prejudiced an accused.  That one reason for having the section can be met in the way suggested by Deputy Lynch and Deputy Cowan.  If that is done there is nothing more to be said.</P>

      <P>It is in the form of a trial at that stage.  It may be that, as a result of that cross-examination, a justice may decide to refuse informations. If he has excluded from the court the persons set out here, there will be no record for the Press of that cross-examination or of the evidence that has been given.  I want to point that out to the Minister.  It is a very important matter, and were the facts not so well known to me in a particular instance, I would not be so clear on it.  It is something to which the Minister should give careful and long consideration.  If informations are refused, definitely a full report of the proceedings of that preliminary investigation should be given.

      <P>In sub-section (3), line 54, to delete the words &ldquo;a Minister of State,&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;the Minister for Justice.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Reading we had a rather long debate on this particular point. As I pointed out then, I suppose there is a necessity for this power but some doubt was expressed as to whether the power to remit should extend to all cases.  I agree that it is necessary; I am sorry that it is necessary that the Government should have this power, but I am not satisfied that any Minister should have the right to remit or that the Government should have the right to delegate that power to any Minister.  I made the case then that the Minister for Justice was the only person to whom that power should <Col N="440" /> be delegated, and I think that case was accepted because I was invited to put down an amendment to that effect. As I pointed out, I do not think the Minister for Justice is ever the accuser in these cases.  It is generally the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  In fact, I think there is scarcely a Minister of State, except the Minister for Justice, at whose instance a prosecution is not taken from time to time.  I may be wrong, but I cannot recall any occasion on which a prosecution was brought on behalf of the Minister for Justice. When this matter was debated on the 3rd November, 1949, I said that I did not think it desirable to set out in the sub-section that &ldquo;a Minister of State&rdquo; should have this power.  The report of the debate, as given in column 528 of the Official Reports of that date, goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;General MacEoin: Instead of the words &lsquo;Minister of State&rsquo;, will the Deputy put down an amendment to substitute the words &lsquo;Minister for Justice&rsquo;?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I said that I was prepared to do that and the Minister replied: &ldquo;And I am prepared to accept it&rdquo;.  I take it that the Minister is now prepared to accept the amendment.  I think it would be altogether wrong to leave this to the discretion of a Minister who may be actually bringing the case himself.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Boland on this matter.  After all, from the point of view of the administration of justice the Minister is concerned vitally with it.  Not only is he himself concerned with it, but his whole staff are concerned with it.  They are concerned with the matters that should properly be taken into consideration in a decision to exercise this power which is really the prerogative of mercy.  I would rather see that exercised by the Government as a whole, but if it is delegated, it should be delegated to the Minister whose prime function it is.  For that reason I support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not think that it has ever happened in our history before that when a Deputy, at the request of a Minister, put down an amendment in the precise terms suggested by the Minister, the Minister afterwards refused to accept that amendment.  It is an unprecedented thing.  After all the Minister is supposed to have a word and the House <Col N="442" /> accepted his word.  There was general agreement on that during the Second Reading debate.  I am simply amazed at the attitude which the Minister has now adopted.  I have read out what took place on the Second Reading.  I did not think that the Minister was going to go back on his promise.  I have put down the amendment in the precise terms which he suggested, and he is not going to go back on that now, surely.  It would be a very bad precedent to establish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is this difficulty about it.  The Minister says that he enjoys the confidence of the Government and that the powers will be given to him.  What I am afraid of is that these powers will be given to every Minister&mdash;perhaps to the Minister for Agriculture in prosecutions relating to agriculture, and to the Minister for Industry and Commerce in prosecutions relating to other matters.  It is for that reason that I should like to see the power limited to the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister can tell me authoritatively, but I was eight years in that Department and I do not think that a prosecution is taken at the instance of the Minister for Justice in any of these cases.  Prosecutions are generally taken by some other Minister.  Therefore, the Minister for Justice stands out as the person to whom these powers of remission should be delegated and the Minister was quite right in inviting me to put down this amendment.  He should not go back on that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is an unanswerable case to be made for the amendment.  In all cases, it is the Minister for Justice who should exercise this prerogative and there are many reasons why no other Minister should have this power.  There are, first, the reasons set out by Deputy Boland, that other Ministers are invariably the prosecutors or the nominal prosecutors.  The Attorney-General prosecutes on their behalf for different offences.  If any of these Ministers had to exercise the prerogative under this section in connection with an offence that was concerned with his own Department, <Col N="443" /> in the first place the particular Minister might be prejudiced very much in doing anything at all in the case.  On the other hand, the Minister may feel that if these powers are delegated to any Minister other than the Minister for Justice he may go on some basis other than the basis the Minister for Justice would go on.</P>
      <P>When petitions come in to have fines reduced or sentences remitted the Minister gets the remarks of the judge or district justice who tried the offence and nobody would be more alive to the dangers than the Minister for Justice or would exercise these powers with greater care.  Every Minister for Justice would realise that if a fine or a sentence were interfered with and were not interfered with correctly or if the prerogative of mercy were exercised in cases where perhaps the public might think that it should not be exercised it might undermine the whole structure of justice in the country.  It would have bad reactions not alone on the judge or justice who had tried the case but on the administration of the law in general, particularly the criminal law.  The Minister for Justice, by reason of his office, is bound to have more knowledge from every angle on these matters, and I cannot conceive why this power should be delegated by the Government to any other Minister. Would the Minister tell the House what are the objections of the Government to delegating these powers to the Minister for Justice and to making them the powers solely of the Minister for Justice?  Are there any angles which may not have occurred to the Deputies of this House as to why the Minister for Justice should not be the man to exercise these powers or why any other member of the Cabinet should be singled out by the Government for the exercise of these powers? I cannot conceive any good or valid reason why that should be so.  I cannot conceive any Minister in charge of any Department who, from his knowledge or from his sources of knowledge, would be a better or a more suitable man for the exercise of these powers than the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> The case for the amendment is unanswerable, and I would again press the Minister to live up to the undertaking which he gave Deputy Boland when the Bill was last before the House.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The Government may.&rdquo;  If you tie them down to the Minister for Justice they may retain the power themselves, and you would take away any power the Minister for Justice or other Minister of State would have.  They would not delegate it at all perhaps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister doing?  The Minister has read the section and I will not read it again. There is a reason for this section; what is it?  The reason is that certain exceptional cases will arise where it is desirable for the Executive to exercise their prerogative of mercy.  It is highly desirable that the exercise of that prerogative will be strictly confined and as solemnly confined as possible to exceptional cases and very exceptional cases.  There is a reason for that.  I know of one case&mdash;I had nothing to do with the case myself&mdash; where I regret very much that the Minister did not see fit to exercise the prerogative.  In this case there were two prisoners with the same offence and everything appeared to be the same but there was a grave and, in my opinion, unjustifiable discrepancy in the sentences.  That is a case where the Government should have exercised its discretion and the proper person to do it is the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand if the machinery of justice is to operate properly it is absolutely essential that the sentences of the court which are pronounced in public should run as they are pronounced except for very exceptional reasons.  Anything like a promiscuous <Col N="446" /> exercise of that power, a mitigation of fines or a modification of sentence <i>sub rosa</i> and without reference to justice as it is pronounced in the courts would be a very dangerous thing.</P>
    <P>What is the effect of this?  The Minister for Justice is obviously the person to exercise this prerogative.  He must first of all keep before him the principle I have mentioned.  He alone of all the Ministers will be in a position to weigh up an individual case against general policy which must rule in that matter and in relation to other matters.  If the power is delegated to one Minister in case A, to another in case B and in case C to another Minister, all of them without relation to the Minister for Justice, you can very easily conceive a situation of inequality or inequity arising which would be very bad for the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Another possibility arises.  As things are I can, by means of a question in this House, ask the Minister for Justice and the Government to account for the exercise of that prerogative, and it is a relatively simple thing to do because I know the Minister to whom the question in general terms is to be addressed and I know that there is that machine, but if this were passed in order that I should have the information I require I should have to address a question to virtually every Minister in the Government, knowing that I was going to draw 12 blanks and one positive but not knowing which would be blank and which would be positive.  That is a bad thing in principle, too.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Moran, I can see no reason why it should not be the Minister for Justice.  After all, the principle is important.  This interference&mdash; because it is interference, sometimes necessary interference, as in the case I have mentioned, but nevertheless interference&mdash;with the procedure of the courts, the sentences of the courts and the administration of justice is such a serious matter that I have no hesitation in saying that it should be a matter for governmental decision.  I can appreciate, however, the point of expediency in administration.  I can appreciate the argument that that would entail the Minister for Justice <Col N="447" /> marshalling all the facts of the case before the Government and that that would be cumbersone machinery, and therefore I say that the Minister for Justice would be the proper person to exercise the power on behalf of the Government, and I think that the Minister should stand over his word in that matter.</P>
    <P>Lastly, we are dealing with a Coalition Government.  This type of legislation is another indication of the weaknesses of coalitions.  That is all it is: another indication of the weaknesses and the tendency to diffuseness in coalitions.  I think it is not desirable in principle and I would ask the Minister to hold the bit in his teeth, as Deputy Boland says.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the Minister has completely and utterly failed to make any case against the amendment. If he looks at the whole problem he will see that where there are mitigations of fines or sentences the Minister for Justice generally has the power to mitigate&mdash;through the Government, of course.  Assume that the Government decides to give it to the Minister for Agriculture we could come to a stage where the Minister for Agriculture is himself a prosecutor.  Is he to be the one to decide whether a fine or a sentence of imprisonment is too heavy to lie, and is he, being a party to the case, to be the one to whom a petition should be addressed?  The alternative is for the Government at that stage to take the power from the Minister for Agriculture and delegate it to some other Minister with the result, as Deputy de Valera pointed out, that nobody will know to what Minister we will eventually have to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that it is the intention of the Government, when proposing to delegate, to have some permanency in that delegation.  The Minister knows that he has in the Department a trained petition staff who are experts in this kind of work.  Is the result of this delegation to whom the Government likes going to be that his petition staff will be a mobile unit, or if the delegation is taken from the Minister is his petition staff in the Department to stay static until such time as the <Col N="448" /> Government decide to hand back this power to the Minister himself?</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out by other speakers that the Minister for Justice is the proper Minister in every circumstance of this aspect of administration. He is the Minister in touch with the judiciary and in touch with the members of the Garda Síochána, and these are the people who are primarily and normally consulted in matters of petitions for the mitigation of fines or sentences of imprisonment.  I believe that, even if the Minister refuses, and succeeds in carrying his refusal in the House, to have the Minister for Justice specifically inserted in this section, the Government, in the long run, will appoint the Minister for Justice or will delegate the power to the Minister; but nevertheless, there is no case whatever against specifically appointing the Minister in the section, and, particularly in view of the Minister's undertaking and his complete failure to make a case for his point of view tonight, he should now accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we look at the section as a whole, we find that the first thing we do is to authorise the Government to commute.  We give them authority to commute, and apparently there must have been some doubt about that or the section would not have been introduced in its present state.  Section 12 starts off by saying that the Government may commute or remit, in whole or in part, any punishment imposed by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction, so that we, by legislation, are empowering the Government to commute.  That is a very important power.  Whether the Government had that power or not apparently was a matter which was not altogether free from doubt.  If it was free from doubt, clearly the section would not have been introduced by the Minister. We authorise the Government to do that and we then go further and say that we permit the Government to delegate the power to a Minister. This Dáil is perfectly entitled to insist, and I think ought to insist, that that delegation can only be to a particular Minister and that Minister the Minister for Justice.  Otherwise, the Minister for Finance might perhaps <Col N="449" /> feel that he would be the authority to remit or reduce in certain revenue matters.  Although statutory powers are given to the Revenue Commissioners, nevertheless, in the case of a revenue penalty which had already been mitigated by the Commissioners, the Minister for Finance could further remit or reduce, if the section were passed and similarly in regard to the Minister for Lands in respect of the different matters that come within his jurisdiction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>He could.  As I have already said, we give that power to the Government by this section and we give them a further power of delegation, but we should limit that delegation to the Minister whose prime function is justice, the Minister who knows how these matters ought to be approached from the general point of view, the Minister who has a staff which is experienced in this matter of considering the issues which ought to be taken into account and the procedure that ought to be gone through in regard to mitigations.</P>
      <P>Under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, the Minister for Justice has very specific functions, which functions include this whole question of justice. For that reason, if there is to be any delegation, it should be to the Minister for Justice, and to the Minister for Justice only.  If, at any future date, the Government are of opinion that that power of delegation limits them too much, then they can come to the Dáil and make a case as to why the power should be given to the Tánaiste, the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Finance or any other Minister.  But I think, until there is a case made for giving powers to a Minister other than the Minister for Justice, we should not consider permitting any delegation to anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not asked, because we are approaching this in a reasonable way, that any case should be made for delegation to the Minister for Justice, as we realise that that is a reasonable <Col N="450" /> and sensible thing to do.  But, if there is to be a case put forward for consideration in regard to permitting that delegation to another Minister, then it will have to be put forward by the Minister in the Dáil.  We cannot just simply accept what he says and let the Government delegate it to any Minister they wish.</P>

For almost 30 years this power has been exercised by the Minister for Justice but now, for some unknown and unexplained reason, this Coalition Government want every one of the 13 Ministers to be able to remit the sentences of a court.  That is what it amounts to.  It is an extraordinary section in a Bill with which it has no connection whatever.  If that power were sought properly, it should be in an amendment of the Ministers and <Col N="451" /> Secretaries Act, and not in a Criminal Justice Bill.  You are giving every Minister of the Government a power that only the Minister for Justice should have and, if right were right, only the Government of the country should have.  Speaking personally, I believe that the power of remitting should not rest in the hands of any Minister, but only in the Government. The suggestion in this section is that every one of the 13 Ministers should be a law unto himself.  Imagine the Minister for Agriculture having power to remit.  We know the way he would exercise it in respect, say, of the millers.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting that I am going to discuss the abilities or anything else of any Minister.  It may be any Minister at any time in the future.  I will describe him as a Minister for Agriculture having power to remit a sentence of the court in respect of offences under the Cereal Act where millers were milling too much wheat or where manure manufacturers did not please that particular Minister. Thousands of instances could occur where the Department of Social Welfare may have ordered prosecutions in respect of offences under some of the Insurance Acts.  Imagine a Minister for Social Welfare being called upon to adjudicate as to whether the court was fair in regard to a sentence on an individual who may have been charged. A Minister for Industry and Commerce may be asked to remit a sentence.  I am sure each one of the Ministers will <Col N="452" /> adjudicate on offences in which the prosecution was on the instruction of his particular Department.  We must assume that from this section.  To my mind, it is an outlandish and dangerous proposal which the House should not stand over.  These are powers which should not be given into the hands of any Minister of any Government irrespective of who or what they may be.</P>
      <P>If three years ago such a proposal were brought forward by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Boland, I can imagine the present Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and all the other big-wigs of the law courts making the welkin ring and condemning it bell, book and candle.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about the dangers to the fabric of this State by putting into the hands of every Minister the power to remit punishment or otherwise as he thought fit.  Does the Minister not realise the great danger there will be to any Government and the feeling there will be amongst the public that there was a danger of corruption?  If the public get it into their minds that we have a corrupt Administration, great harm will be done to the whole fabric of the State and to the people of the State.  The Minister knows that quite well and it should not be necessary to point it out.</P>
      <P>I understand that this power to remit punishment rested solely in the Minister for Justice.  What is wrong with that?  Has it been found that the Minister is incapable of or unable to deal with all the sentences that must be remitted as a result of the operation of the courts?  Does he need assistance? Have the other Ministers legal advisers to advise them on this matter? The Minister for Justice and his Department are solely concerned with the administration of justice.  No other Department in this State has advisers to advise on the administration of justice.  Therefore, the Minister, in fairness to the Government, to the House and to the country, should accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>What puzzles me is that the Minister should have allowed it to occur, because a Minister is usually very jealous of his own powers.  This is essentially a part of the administration of justice and I would have imagined that the Minister would have made very sure that he would keep under his own control the complete administration of justice.  It is a matter about which public opinion is very sensitive because, time after time, there have been cases where there have been remissions of sentences or part of sentences and where the comment made by the public has been very unfavourable.  Therefore. I think it is a matter upon which the House should insist upon keeping the responsibility where it belongs, namely, the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>If there is any question to be raised as to the rightness or wrongness of a remission in a particular case, or a refusal to remit, it should be placed in its own place, namely, where the administration of justice is carried out.</P>
      <P>There is something incoherent, almost Gilbertian, in the position.  If the functions of the Department of Justice can be carried out by any other Minister of State why should the functions of any other Department&mdash; say, of the Department of Industry and Commerce or of the Department of Finance&mdash;not be carried out by the Department of Justice? Surely the Department of Justice is the responsible body, having the full information before it.  If a case has to be placed before the Government it is they who have the responsibility of bringing it before the Government. That should be so, unless it is that there is a complete lack of confidence in the Minister for Justice either because he does not remit when he should, or because he remits too often, and that the Government considers that these powers should be put into the hands of someone else.</P>

      <P>I did not quite understand the Minister's reference to the Constitution.  We have no quarrels at all with sub-section (2) of this section which provides that the Government <Col N="454" /> may remit in whole or part.  Our quarrel is with regard to sub-section (3)&mdash;as to whom the Government is going to delegate these powers.  Can the Minister not foresee what could happen in practice, in case this amendment is not accepted?  The only protection for the citizens of this country and of the Deputies of this House, as far as remission of penalties is concerned, is the debate on the Minister's Estimate each year.  If, when the Estimate for the Department of Justice comes before the House, some members disagree with the decision to let some individual out of jail or, perhaps, with the remission of a fine, and the Minister gets up and says that it is not his function, that in this particular case the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Agriculture or some other Minister exercised these powers, then, where are we in this House and what is the position of the public?</P>
      <P>If this amendment is not accepted, it means that public criticism of any particular remission, under Section 21, by the Government, through a particular Minister, will be stifled and that Deputies will be completely stifled as far as criticism is concerned.  The public would not know and the Deputies would not know if, for instance&mdash;as can happen under this section as it stands at present&mdash;for one or two months the Minister for Agriculture, say, is the particular Minister delegated under sub-section (3); for another two months, maybe the Minister for Industry and Commerce and for another couple.  of months, maybe the Minister for Lands. Nobody will know, unless we put down a specific question in respect of each item about which we are complaining, who is the particular Minister on whom we can fix responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ordinary procedure, since this House was established, has been that the Minister for Justice was the Minister who was answerable to the House and to the country for matters of this kind.  It is vital in the public interest and in the interest of the Deputies of this House that the Minister for Justice will, for the future, shoulder the responsibility for the remission of any of the fines or for <Col N="455" /> the remission of disqualification orders or for the letting out of prisoners under the prerogative of mercy.  He, and only he, should be answerable to this House and to the country for that procedure.</P>
    <P>While it is true that the Government, theoretically, under this section &mdash;and I think it will work out in practice that it will be theoretical, too &mdash;reserve these powers, naturally, the members of the Cabinet will not have time from day to day to deal with the 101 or, possibly, the 1,001 petitions that I am sure reach the Minister for Justice about everything from the remission of fines in, say, a poteen case down the country to a petition to get a consequential disqualification order removed.  The Department of Justice normally gets all these petitions.  The Minister for Justice is the man in touch with this matter.  Furthermore, who, out of the whole Cabinet, would be the man most suitable to be answerable to the House if, for instance, the administration of justice suffered as a result of interference with sentences or fines imposed by the courts?  Is it not the administration of justice that would suffer and, if it suffers, surely the Minister for Justice must face that responsibility and shoulder it fairly and squarely?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not attempted to make a case for the non-acceptance of this amendment.  From the point of view of either good sense or good law, I do not think the Minister can make a case for the delegation of these powers to anybody else.  They should be retained by him.  I again ask him seriously to reconsider this matter.  It is a very important matter of principle and I think the Minister will very much regret it if he attempts to put through the section in its present form.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amendment and to what has been urged by Deputy Cowan and other speakers, I think that there is a great deal to be said in favour of the proposal to name the Minister for Justice in connection with the mitigation of sentences and fines.  I think he is the <Col N="456" /> proper Minister of the Government to deal with matters of this kind.  I appreciate that difficulties may arise with regard to certain offences, such as revenue offences and others of that kind that may, hitherto, have been dealt with through other chanels, but I find myself supporting those who have urged on the Minister the acceptance of this amendment or the acceptance of a proposal along the lines that would ensure, in respect of ordinary criminal matters and ordinary fines, that this power would be exercised solely by the Minister for Justice.  It would be undesirable to have the section as vague as it is at present.  I urge the Minister to endeavour to arrive at some compromise, if at all possible, which will ensure that in these matters generally, he, as Minister for Justice, will be the Minister who will deal with all these offences and consider them as the Minister of State designated in the section.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins has only emphasised what other Deputies have been saying.  I should like to put it this way.  Why should it be necessary to delegate power to certain Ministers?  Deputy Moran has talked about consecutive delegation, but just read the sub-section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The Government may delegate to a Minister of State any power conferred by this section and may revoke any such delegation.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sub-section (1) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Except in capital cases, the Government may commute or remit, in whole or in part, any punishment imposed by a court exercising criminal jurisdiction, subject to such conditions as they may think proper.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It seems to me that under that section it is competent for the Government to delegate classes of cases or to delegate cases simultaneously to all Ministers in the Cabinet, which is, obviously, a highly undesirable state of affairs and, again talking hypothetically, is the type of thing that would leave the road wide open for abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do you expect in regard to such a matter in a well ordered Government? If you have a well-ordered Government with collective responsibility, <Col N="457" /> with the Ministers mutually trusting one another, which is the type of Government any State should have, surely, what would happen would be this, that a petition would be furnished by the persons concerned for the remission of a particular sentence or punishment, that that petition would come to the appropriate Minister, namely, the Minister for Justice, that if it concerned the Department of another Minister, such as the Minister for Agriculture or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in any well-ordered Government what would be the first thing the Minister for Justice would do?  To communicate with the other Minister in the matter and, if they were pulling together, they would be able there and then to make their decision one of harmony between them?</P>

      <P>I am coming to that.  The Minister for Justice, however, in that position would still be able to make his view override, but the other Minister has his remedy.  The other Minister can bring it to the Government.  The Government is the principal in the matter.  After all, the Minister to whom these powers are delegated is the agent of the Government. It is a delegation from the Government and, in any well-ordered Government&mdash;and I am sure it happens almost as a daily affair in the business of Governments&mdash;if there is a clash between the opinions of two Ministers it is resolved in the Government conference. There are day to day conflicts of interest.  I am sure that the Department of Finance and probably every other Department of State finds itself in that situation on nearly any issue that arises, and very often these things are brought by the particular Minister to the Government.  That has worked well heretofore in a number of Governments in this State.  I see no reason why that should be changed unless it be that the weaknesses which we know have been inherent in Coalitions in other countries are beginning to creep into the present Coalition Government here and, if that is so, it is a very sad thing for this country.</P>

One of the big things we were afraid of in the section as drafted was the dispersal of that responsibility, the lack of co-ordination.

      <P>I move amendment No. 41:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5)  This section shall not apply to a disqualification order made pursuant to Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is accepting this amendment in principle or at all it might be well to consider a number of other disqualifications which I need not enumerate.  These will serve to bring out the principle of what we are dealing with.  There are, for instance, the disqualifications under Section 51 of the Road Traffic Act; there are the penalties which would follow, for instance, two or three endorsements of a publican's licence.  All these things would be serious and, although they are not covered in this section, the principle of them is.  I wonder does the Minister understand what I mean?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>So many endorsements of a publican's licence mean extinction.  If the Minister can remit these, he would be able to keep the licence alive.  This type of thing would be involved, as well as Section 51.  The point is that under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933. the disqualification is statutory and mandatory.  I do not know whether there have been actual cases of remission of that by the Minister heretofore. It seems to me on the reading of the statute that he has no power to remit, as it is a statutory penalty which is imposed.  However, I am not going to commit myself to that.  There is the general overriding prerogative of mercy in that matter and whether it is in the residue of that to be exercised by the President heretofore, I do not know.  It is very questionable indeed as to whether such disqualifications in such cases should be the subject of remedying by the Minister and that the provisions of this section should be applied.  It may be that under the general prerogative there is a power to pardon, as in the case of capital sentences, that there is a general power to remit in particular cases, <Col N="460" /> but I think that at the moment the power is not in the Government or a Minister, and I do not think it should be.  for this reason, that the number of cases where disqualifications of this nature arise is rather great, that they are a necessary incident to safeguarding the public in a very peculiar set of circumstances, that interference with one of them can bring about a great discrepancy in the administration of justice in individual cases.  Disqualification is very often the most serious part of the punishment involved in these cases because it affects in many cases a man's ability to earn his livelihood.  For these reasons I think this amendment should be considered.</P>
      <P>In principle, we should agree on this, that it is very desirable that sentences of the court are not in any way interfered with except for very exceptional reasons indeed.  That should apply particularly at the commencement of the punishment.  For instance, if it is a case of imprisonment, the granting of a pardon straight away so that the accused who is sentenced does not have to undergo any imprisonment should be a matter of great exception indeed. Remission of a sentence in the course of its running, remission towards the end or the granting of some time off a sentence towards the end is not quite so serious and there is very little objection to the practices which have grown up in regard to that but, in regard to complete remission at the beginning or remission of any punishment immediately after sentence, there are very grave objections indeed.  Even though there may be very hard cases, and even though judges may sometimes exercise their powers in a way which, in the light of the facts, might be regarded as harsh, still, taking general public policy into account, it is highly undesirable that these things which would come into effect at the early stage of the punishment should be interfered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These disqualifications are such that I would suggest that this matter should get very careful consideration from the Minister.  I would like to point out that we have never been furnished with statistics or any type of information as to the number of cases involved.  I <Col N="461" /> would have thought that the Minister's best approach to this matter, for the purpose of getting a controlled discussion, would have been to furnish us with statistics relating to the class of cases we are dealing with.  Unfortunately, the Minister has given no information as to the exercise of this prerogative during the past few years. He rather leads me to think that he has not exercised this prerogative. Therefore, it would appear that there is a case for this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that the Minister has not remitted a disqualification under Section 30. No remission has been made at any time in regard to the minimum requirement of 12 months.  at the same time, now and again a case has come to my notice and the suggestion has been made that something should be done, but there is no power to do it and there will be no such power unless it is taken in this particular section.  I do not think any Minister for Justice would attempt to exercise the power that is proposed here, but still I think it should be there.  The Deputy had great confidence in me a few minutes ago.</P>

      <P>You said that the Minister should have this power and should live up to his responsibilities. Now you are going into reverse, and that is what you should not do in this House.  A drunk in charge provision is one in respect of which I think no Minister could reasonably be expected to exercise a remission.  If something happened in a case, where would he be?  Would he not be ruined?  At the same time, the general remission should be there.</P>
      <P>On that point, I would like to mention that in other countries there is a reviewing power vested in the courts.  After a period of three or six months, the applicant can go to the court and put forward evidence why his driving licence should be renewed.</P>

I have asked the Minister for Local Government to consider that matter, so that I would not have to exercise that power.  This matter has been examined and I suggest that Deputies should leave it to the good judgment of the Minister for Justice not to exercise that power.  But when you have given him the power, do not cut the buttons. Let him go ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that while this power might be very seldom exercised, it should, nevertheless, be held in reserve.  A couple of years ago I came across a case which I referred to the Minister and which the Minister said he had no power to deal with.  It was the case of a young man who, about 20 years ago, had his driving licence suspended for life.  Now, 20 years ago he was a young fellow.  In the intervening period he has grown up to be a man of responsibility.  He has a family, he has done well and he is one of the most model men in the community.  Clearly that was a case in which, if justice was to be done at all, the sentence depriving that man of the right to drive a mechanically propelled vehicle ought to be reviewed.  It was clearly a case where a Minister for Justice, on being satisfied as to the facts, should have the right to remit the disqualification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little in the section as it stands.  In sub-section (1) there is the constitutional provision&mdash;in fact, what is laid down in the Constitution. The next sub-section clarifies the matter in regard to the disqualification and the third, as amended now, gives power to the Minister when that power is delegated to him.  No matter what individual may occupy the position of Minister for Justice in this State, there will be a responsibility on him to act in a judicial manner in matters of this kind, and I think to put in a proviso here that a disqualification cannot be considered by him, no matter what the facts may be, would be a very unwise thing.  For that reason I am entirely opposed to Deputy Boland's <Col N="463" /> amendment.  I would be quite happy to leave this matter entirely to the Minister for Justice, whoever that Minister may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the attitude that the Minister takes in regard to this amendment.  If he will recall the debate on the Second Reading, he will realise that every Deputy who spoke took the same line as I did.  I started the debate after the Minister's introductory speech.  My point was that in the case of a person found drunk in charge of a car the Minister should not have the right to remit a disqualification. As I said in the Second Reading debate, when I was Minister for Justice I was happy to be in the position that I could not do it.  For one thing, there would be pressure brought to bear on people.  That was not quite the reason I had in mind, but I realised that my life would have been made intolerable and there would have been certain discriminations.</P>
      <P>We must remember that when the Act was brought into force things were not quite as bad as they are now. There was a certain minimum penalty imposed.  There was, for instance, disqualification for a year for a first offence and for three years for a second offence.  When I was in the Department I was advised that I had no right to remit any disqualification. Since then it was suggested that perhaps after the minimum period laid down in the Act had expired there might be some remission.  Then there was the question of whether or not there should be discretion.  I am not quite sure what the position is to-day, but I suggest that the minimum period laid down in Section 30 of the 1933 Act should be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People cannot speak too strongly of this menace.  As we all know, traffic is becoming worse.  The cars are much faster and the roads are being made better for speeding.  My opinion is that the courts are too lenient altogether. It is all very well to have pity for the person who is in trouble, who may have killed someone or maimed some person for life.  But <Col N="464" /> what about the dependents and relatives of the person who has been killed?  I think every Deputy who spoke on the Second Reading agreed with my point that that power should not be given to the Minister, that the disqualification should be obligatory, that it should be automatic.  The point was that if there was a conviction for driving while drunk or being drunk in charge of a car, whatever about the sentence or the fine the disqualification period ought to be automatic and there ought to be no letting up on it at all.  I intend to press this home on the Minister, as far as my voice and my vote are concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to bring up a particular case, without mentioning names, and as I do not want to make two speeches it might be better to do it now instead of on the section.  The Minister was not here at the time.  I understand he said that no remissions of disqualifications were ever made that he knew of, disqualifications from driving, of a person convicted under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act.  That is probably right, as the Minister probably got the same advice as I got and did not think he had the power.  I know myself, and the Minister knows, one particular case&mdash;there may be others&mdash; where there was a disqualification for two years, which was affirmed on appeal.  The Minister knows as well as I do&mdash;it is the talk of my constituency and of all the County Longford and all the West of Ireland&mdash; where a person only some time about last April lost his licence and was disqualified for two years and he is driving round in defiance of everybody.</P>

      <P>It is quite true that when the Minister introduced this Bill on the Second Reading I was prepared to subscribe to what Deputy Boland said, that drivers convicted of being drunk in charge of a car were in a completely different category.  I think Deputy Boland is deliberately trying to misinterpret me.  I am absolutely and thoroughly in agreement with Deputy Boland that there should be no interference with the decision of a district justice with regard to a person being drunk in charge of a car; but at the same time we are showing a complete lack of faith, initially in ourselves and in whatever Minister may occupy the seat of justice and whatever Government may succeed us, if we shear the prerogative or the power.  I feel it should be there.  It is not necessary that that power ever should be exercised. It may not be desirable that the power should be exercised, but it is conceivable&mdash;in one of those many hypothetical cases which Deputy de Valera can weave&mdash;that a situation could arise where it would not only be necessary but would be virtually imperative in the interest of justice that the Minister should interfere.  I <Col N="466" /> say quite seriously to Deputy Boland that any Minister&mdash;not alone the present Minister&mdash;would be practically bordering on primary insanity if he were in any way to make generous use of the prerogative given to him.  His life would be a plague.  He would have Deputy Boland, Deputy Little, Deputy Collins and everyone else coming in with grand sympathetic tales to tell him about individual cases.</P>

Deputy Boland and the restopposite have insisted that there cannot be any other Minister&mdash;it must be the Minister for Justice&mdash;and the minute that is conceded in a deliberative Assembly, they want promptly to put some limitation on it.  They are like the old dog who wants to bite his own tail.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister should not accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Boland&mdash;not because Deputy Boland does not advance reasonable arguments as to why interference should not take place with a certain type of forfeiture, but on the basis that there is an implied lack of confidence in this deliberative Assembly, in whatever Governments may succeed in this country, by asking us to accept the principle of this prerogative and at the same time trying to limit it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera tried to wander on this amendment into a field that is not covered at all, but it would do ourselves maybe a little bit of good if we realised that there is a lot of craw-thumping and a lot of cheap publicity to be gained by utilising, in the way Deputy Boland did, the case about the drunk in charge of a car or the sympathetic tales of someone maimed for life, and so on.  It is possible to conceive that there can be a case in which the prerogative of mercy would be a very useful weapon for a Government <Col N="467" /> to have, to offset, maybe, an unintentional use, or maybe a misuse, or a possible misinterpretation by a justice.  It could happen, it is conceivable. As Deputy de Valera well knows as a lawyer, many innocent men have been convicted, and we had a very remarkable case in our own courts not so very long ago where a man was sent to jail and subsequently had to be released by the Minister for Justice and a gratuity paid to him by way of an ex gratia payment, as he was put there wrongly by an unfair and unreasonable process of law.</P>
    <P>One has to realise that a situation may arise&mdash;it has not arisen yet and may not, but we must concede in theory or in a hypothetical way that the possibility could arise&mdash;when the exercise of that prerogative might be both desirable and imperative; and because that possibility might arise at some future date, or because the possibility of that possibility is there, we should not accept this amendment.  We should let the prerogative stand in the spirit in which the prerogative section was passed.  The Minister himself then made it quite clear that there was no likelihood of this section being used for that purpose, particularly when he indicated that there was a distinct likelihood of the Minister for Local Government agreeing to some type of review of licence suspensions by the courts themselves, the authority that imposes the suspension.  I would not shear the prerogative of its full benefit because of any particular class.  The prerogative will have to be there unimpinged. The exercise of it is the responsibility of the Government of this country, no matter to what Minister it may delegate its task. They are answerable to the elected representatives of the people, and the sooner we get that much confidence in them the better for us all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister realises the extraordinary increase that has taken place in motor traffic within the last year or two and the appalling lack of careful driving.  I have heard people accustomed to driving in London traffic say they would be afraid to <Col N="468" /> drive in Dublin traffic.  Generally speaking, the public at the present time is very perturbed because of the increasing dangers involved in motoring. All that we are saying on this side is in the interest of the Ministry and it works out to the Minister's advantage also.  We could have adopted the attitude: &ldquo;Let him take these powers; he will walk himself into danger of all kinds and into all sorts of difficulties if he does not accept this amendment.&rdquo;  Public opinion will be against him on it.  Public opinion is very strong at the moment against any form of what I call &ldquo;wild&rdquo; driving. Above all, it is against driving by people who have taken too much intoxicating liquor, and have lost the sense and the capacity to drive with the exactitude required to avoid accidents.</P>
      <P>Again, the Minister will place himself in the position of having a number of petitions made to him, hard cases and so on.  It is for his own protection that we brought in this amendment.  Deputy Seán Collins referred to the fact that we possibly on this side of the House would be making application on behalf of &ldquo;hard cases&rdquo; because we would be soft-hearted. But we want to protect ourselves also against such petitions being made to us.  We want to be in the position of saying: &ldquo;The law is there and no remission can be made.&rdquo;  From the point of view of keeping ourselves right with public opinion we must do all we can to ensure that this amendment is carried.  I would urge the Minister very strongly to accept the amendment for his own protection and for the protection of the public in general.</P>

      <P>I am sure we all subscribe to the views of Deputy Boland, Deputy Little and the others who have sponsored this amendment as to the enormity of the crime of a man driving a dangerous weapon like a motor car when he is under the influence of drink.  In such circumstances, he is certainly handling a very lethal weapon and experience has shown that great damage to person and property can be caused.  But it seems to me <Col N="469" /> that the Opposition Deputies are, so to speak, missing the wood for the trees because if one pushes the argument to its logical conclusion, one is driven to this? there are crimes more serious than the crime committed by a man who drives a motor car when he is drunk and it would be logical then to take away the power or discretion which is already provided for in relation to these crimes that we are all agreed are more serious than the crime committed by a man driving a motor car when he is drunk.</P>

      <P>We are accepting the position that the sentence of the court can be altered in the case of murder. Deputy Boland wants us to say now, while conceding that the Government may change the sentence of the court in certain cases, under no circumstances must it interfere with the sentence of the court imposed for an offence under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act.  We all know, as Deputy S. Collins has said, that judgments of courts are fallible.  Until such time as they become infallible, I think it is unreasonable for us to ask the Minister to deprive himself of this power which he gets under the section as it stands, and I do not think he <Col N="470" /> should accept this amendment.  I cannot understand why it is being pressed so hard by the Opposition.  I think Deputy Little, Deputy Major de Valera, and the other lawyers on the Opposition benches really believe in their hearts this is an amendment that ought not to be accepted.  As the Minister set such a good example to the House by changing his mind on the amendment that has just been disposed of, I think it would be a gracious gesture if those sponsoring this amendment would now bow to reason and commonsense and say: &ldquo;We think we were wrong in pressing the amendment and we are now withdrawing it.&rdquo;  I could not for a moment consider supporting the amendment.</P>

      <P>After listening to the views of Deputy Allen on this important matter, I would like to say a word or two on it.  First of all, I think that the righteousness expressed by Deputy Boland and others on this particular matter is something to be deprecated.  I think that this attitude of endeavouring in this Assembly to prejudge for all time every single case that comes before the courts is something that should not be tolerated for a moment.  Those of us who from time to time have to appear in court, or listen to cases being tried in court, must appreciate that each case depends completely on the facts and evidence adduced in connection with the case at hearing.  Therefore, it is very wrong <Col N="473" /> for Deputy Boland, or for any other Deputy, to try in this House, merely for the sake of getting political kudos&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen has said enough.  I want to say to the Minister that, if there is to be a division on this particular matter it should be a free vote.  I say that in all seriousness.  Whether Deputy Allen or other Deputies agree with me or not, I want to say that a Bill of this kind should be discussed in this House from no political angle.  It should be discussed by those interested in the administration of the law, the criminal law, without any prefixed political notions.  A discussion on this particular section is an important discussion, with important consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see a lot in what has been said with regard to the particular offences charged under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act.  May I suggest for the benefit of Deputy Allen who, although he has, apparently, been considering this measure for the past 12 months, still finds that he has to ask the Minister for some information, that the position at present under Section 30 of the Road Traffic Act of 1933 is that on conviction on the charge set out in Section 30, apart from sentence, the district justice must impose a minimum disqualification of 12 months.  He may impose a greater disqualification, but the minimum disqualification is one for 12 months.  The amendment put down by the righteous Deputy from Roscommon seeks to deprive the Minister of any power to review any disqualifition, irrespective of the length of it. It is there that I part company with <Col N="474" /> Deputy Boland and others who have spoken on this measure because I can see straightway that, apart from the purely criminal offence, the offence that we are discussing under Section 30 is a most serious social offence.  It is an offence which has serious social consequences, which results from time to time in tragic consequences for a lot of people.  It is also an offence that can be far too easily committed by a person who is not conscious of the seriousness involved.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for a person driving a motor car in good company, to go to some hotel or public house and, without thinking, of bringing himself into a position in which he is unfit to drive a motor car.  It is right for that reason that this Oireachtas should point in all solemnity to the seriousness of that offence.  We can do that by giving the district justice who tries the person charged with that offence power to impose a very long sentence.  We have not done that.  In my opinion, sufficient powers to sentence are not given at present.  We could do that either by providing greater power to sentence or, as has been done under the Road Traffic Act, by providing for a minimum automatic disqualification of a person's right to drive.  I would suggest that while we might be justified to a certain extent, merely because of the social consequences which I have mentioned, in prejudging by our legislation all cases where there is conviction, that power should be exercised very carefully.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should accept an amendment or a proposal which would empower him to review every disqualification of a driving licence within a minimum set out in Section 30 but that that particular power of review should not interfere with, or give him power to reduce, the minimum qualification for 12 months.  I think by doing that we shall ensure that no injustice such as has been mentioned by Deputy Cowan will result in particular cases and, at the same time, we reserve our own rights as a Legislature to regard these offences as serious ones.</P>

      <P>This Bill seeks to give to a local authority, without any qualification, power to change the name of a street.  I do not think that that would be a wise step to take.  Speaking of Dublin, I am certainly very much in favour of changing the names of a great number of our principal streets, but I think it would be very unwise, in order to carry out that object, to do it in the way proposed here.  I think that we would probably pay hereafter much more than it would be worth to get these names changed in a hurry.  I hold that the people in the streets concerned are definitely entitled to be consulted even if the result should turn out for the moment to be adverse to us.  We should not attempt to use the big stick, as it were, to get the job done in a hurry.  That would be a very bad precedent.  The 1946 Act did make a big advance in this matter.  Before that, the local council or corporation could not initiate a proposal to change the name of a street.  Somebody else had to do it and had to present a memorial signed by a majority of the ratepayers in that street.  Outside of Dublin, it required a two-thirds majority to change the name of a street.  As I understand it, there was no provision whatever for changing the names of towns or villages.  The 1946 Act gave the initiative to the local council at any time to take a poll amongst the ratepayers in the street and if they got four-sevenths of a majority in favour of the proposal, they could change it.  So far as I know, since that Act was passed, the Dublin Corporation, at any rate, have not attempted to enforce it.  They have not attempted to try to change the name of any street by getting four-sevenths of a majority of the residents in favour.  The last effort that was <Col N="476" /> made, which was done under the previous Act, was in connection with Talbot Street.</P>

      <P>That is so.  There are several other streets in which an effort could have been made but nothing has been done.  A question was raised about the term &ldquo;ratepayers.&rdquo;  Personally, I think that we could do something to change that, as I do not think it properly describes the people who should be consulted.  I think that perhaps the word &ldquo;occupiers&rdquo; would be better.  If I am right as to the legal interpretation of that description, I think it would include anybody in occupation of a particular premises or part of a premises in the street concerned. They would be entitled to vote on the question.</P>

      <P>I might.  I have not considered that.  That would mean giving everybody over 21 a vote.  I was thinking only of the occupiers of particular premises or part of premises. As the present Act is worded, if the house were a tenement, the owner, who might not live in the area concerned, would be the ratepayer, while the people living in the house would not have a vote at all.  So the people mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary who come under the Small Dwellings Act, who were owners, would not be entitled to vote, and I think that those people are definitely entitled to consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not, however, agree with the Bill as it stands.  I think that it would lead to a feeling of opposition which would probably develop in other matters, and would create precedents that would be very hurtful to us in other matters later on.  I would suggest to Deputy Lehane that having got the undertaking he has got from the Parliamentary Secretary he should withdraw the Bill because there is the further point that it makes a big change of principle in dealing with a matter like this, and it ought to come from the Government if it is to come at <Col N="477" /> all.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave him a certain undertaking, and I think it would be as well for him if he withdrew the Bill and saw what the Government would do, and they would probably arrive at agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to follow the argument put forward by the last speaker.  He practically expressed our views on the matter and he very clearly stated that he himself feels that the names of a number of streets in Dublin should be changed and that is simply all we want.  Talbot Street has been mentioned.  Attempts have been made over a number of years to have its name changed to &ldquo;Seán Treacy Street.&rdquo;  Deputy Briscoe speaking this night fortnight said that there were very good reasons why that change should take place and why the name of Seán Treacy should be associated with Talbot Street.  I fail to understand the attitude of the speakers from the Opposition who feel that the ratepayers of any particular street, town or village should have priority of rights as they have at the present time.  They have gone out of their way to claim that that is a democratic approach to it and all of them from time to time dropped the word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; and used as the last speaker did the words &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; or &ldquo;resident&rdquo;.  If in the 1946 Act they had included the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; or &ldquo;resident&rdquo; it would not be necessary to bring in this amendment at all.  For a number of years a continual agitation has been going on to change the names of some of those streets and to blot out from the capital of the Irish Republic the names of kings and queens, earls and dukes of an alien state and replace them by the names of the people who fought and died on those streets in their attempt to establish the freedom of this country.</P>

    <P>Deputy MacEntee, who I understand was primarily responsible for the introduction of the 1946 Act, defended that Bill in his own very able and artful way this night fortnight on the grounds of democracy.  He claimed that the local authority had the right to alter the name of any street, town or village and that that right was in <Col N="478" /> the Act.  He said that certain qualifications, rules and regulations were laid down with which the local authorities must comply before they could make a change.  They had to get the consent of four-sevenths of the ratepayers in the street, town or locality before the name could be changed.  He claimed that that was a democratic approach and defended it as a democratic approach.  He occasionally dropped the word &ldquo;ratepayer&rdquo; and used the word &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; or &ldquo;resident.&rdquo;  We would be prepared to accept that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lehane, in introducing the Bill and during the discussion which took place on it, said that once its principle was accepted we were prepared to accept any reasonable amendment on the Committee Stage.  Deputy MacEntee challenged Deputy Lehane and asked if he would be prepared to go into any of the streets in Dublin and tell the ratepayers that he wanted to take from them the right to change the name of the street and give it to the local authority.  I do not think that Deputy Lehane would be afraid or ashamed to do that.  For myself, I would be perfectly prepared to get up on top of Nelson Pillar and tell the citizens of Dublin and all concerned that the time had arrived when the British admiral should be taken down. I would be prepared to stand in any street, particularly in my own constituency, in King Street or Queen Street, and say that the name should be changed irrespective of what the ratepayers think of me.  I would suggest especially to the soldiers and chiefs of the Irish brigade, of the Irish Republican Army, sitting in this House that we did not ask the ratepayers at any particular period whether we had the right to carry arms and fight in the streets for the establishment of an Irish Republic.  If we had asked the ratepayers for their permission we certainly would not have got it.  If we leave it to the ratepayers in the streets of the city to hoist a particular flag on the 11th of this month I know the flag they will hang out; it will be the same one that they hung out in 1924, 1925 and 1926 after the Treaty was established.</P>
    <P>There has been some suggestion that <Col N="479" /> the majority of the people cannot be coerced.  There is no question of coercing the majority of the people. As it stands, the majority of the people are coerced and the right of deciding what name should be on the streets is in the hands of the local authority or the majority, not of the people who live in the street or occupy the street but of the ratepayers, and I definitely object to that.</P>
    <P>Take Talbot Street.  If Seán Treacy, God rest his soul, had to go to the ratepayers and say: &ldquo;I intend to have an office in Talbot Street, will it be all right?&rdquo;  I know the answer he would get.  If when it was proposed to call that shop the &ldquo;Republican Outfitters&rdquo; they had to go to the ratepayers and say: &ldquo;We want to start a business and we want to put the name &lsquo;Republican Outfitters&rsquo; on it, we have a national outlook, and as well as being used for business purposes the premises will be used to advance national ideals&rdquo; they certainly would not get the sanction of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>This is not just a matter of one Party scoring off another.  We are prepared to admit that the late Government attempted to make some advances, but we feel that they did it very timidly.  I feel also that the proposal we have before the House is itself a little too timid, and I was hoping that someone would say that the time had arrived when the names associated with the alien aggressor should be taken down from the streets of the capital city of this Republic of ours.  If such a proposal were put forward as a result of our introduction of this Bill, I should be prepared to accept it, as, I think, would Deputy Lehane also.  We have heard Deputy MacEntee pleading for democracy, but he feels that a private Deputy has no right to bring in such a motion as this.  When that right is taken from the private Deputy, democracy leaves this House.  We have that right and will continue to claim and exercise that right while we are here. I am absolutely convinced that steps must be taken immediately to deal with this important national matter, so that visitors to this country will no longer have to stand in amazement on seeing the names of streets in our <Col N="480" /> capital city and ask &ldquo;Have you got kings?  Have you got queens?&rdquo; and then hear our explanation that Britain conquered us for a while and, at her own discretion, without asking the ratepayers, named these streets to commemorate her kings, queens and earls&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that now that we have complete freedom we would like to have these names changed, but do not want to offend the ratepayers.  I suggest that we must be getting old and timid.  That was not the attitude of the people here when the blow for freedom was struck in this city.  I was very glad to hear Deputy Colley say that he agrees with us that the names should be changed but I cannot understand why, when he agrees that they should be changed, he should object to this motion, and, following the lead given by Deputy MacEntee, suggest that the proposal should be put back and the Government given an opportunity of introducing it.  The experience of Deputies here is that, when such matters are deferred and the Government requested to bring in comprehensive proposals, we have to wait too long.  We are not prepared to wait any longer.</P>
      <P>We believe the time has arrived to change the names of the streets in the capital and wipe out the last signs of the alien aggressor.  I hope the Opposition will not set any hard and fast rule and tell Deputy Colley that, no matter what he believes, they passed this Act in 1946 and do not intend to have it upset by a couple of private Deputies.  The motion has been put forward, I should be inclined to say, very timidly and we are anxious that it should get a free and frank discussion. We hope also that the Opposition Deputies will be free to vote for it.</P>

      <P>Being a Bill, we have to consider it in its proper perspective. It is a private Bill introduced for the purpose of making it easier for local authorities to change the names of streets, but I for one do not understand what alternative procedure the framers of the Bill have in mind.  We have heard about majority rights and minority rights, but the law as it stands lays down a certain procedure&mdash; and, in my opinion, it goes as far as any sensible code of legislation could go&mdash;by which four-sevenths of the rated occupiers of any particular area can get a name changed through the local authority.  That is about as far as it should go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;unless the people standing behind the Bill want to trample entirely upon human rights. We have heard a lot about human rights in connection with these matters, and here we have the members of a Party advocating the complete steam-rolling of human rights.</P>
      <P>If it is to be made so easy for people, through the local authority, to change the name of a street, what is to prevent people from changing it back again? In my view, this would lead to a ridiculous position, because if it were made easier for people in one part of the country to change the name of a street, town or place, the same facilities would be available to other sections, and, in the long run, it may not work out so satisfactorily and those who think about changing street names to commemorate people who played an important part in the history of this country or about changing them to Irish names, as the same facilities would be available to people to change already existing Irish names, as the case might be, would find that they would be doing more harm than good by opening up the avenue in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the general feeling of the House is in regard to this measure, but my feeling is that the Deputies responsible for the introduction of the Bill would be well advised to accept the advice of the <Col N="482" /> Parliamentary Secretary and leave it over for further consideration.  What is the great urgency about it now? The Parliamentary Secretary has given an undertaking that it will be considered very shortly by the Government, and, in the light of that undertaking, Deputy Lehane should withdraw the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>The longer one lives, the more one learns.  I was under the impression, in my simple ingenuousness, that I had brought into the House one of the shortest, simplest and most unequivocal types of measures it would be possible for the ordinary human brain to conceive.  I brought it in in a spirit of complete frankness, and I was frank to the fullest possible extent with the House in asking the House to support me.  I made no secret of the fact that what urged me to bring this measure before Dáil Éireann was the fact that there had been in Dublin city and other places throughout the country a feeling of dissatisfaction, a feeling of frustration, because we were saddled in our local nomenclature with names reminding us only of the Conquest, names which commemorated only those who had been the ministers and instruments of aggression against our people in the past.  I was frank to this extent; I made no secret of the fact to the House that what moved me primarily was the difficulty that had been experienced by the majority of the people in Dublin who wanted to see the name of Seán Treacy commemorated in the street in which he gave his life.  Deputies opposite know as well as I do that there has been considerable feeling about that for some years back.  It was not a feeling confined to any one particular Party or group.  I know members and adherents of the Party opposite who were amongst the most vocal, the most energetic and the most anxious, and still are amongst the most anxious to have that change effected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sought for what appeared to me the simplest method of giving effect to that opinion, which I suggest to the House, and I do not think I will be contradicted in this, is the opinion of the overwhelming majority of the people of this city.  Apparently, in my ingenuous <Col N="483" /> simplicity, I perpetrated a terrible wrong against what Deputy Kissane described as the human rights of the Irish people.  I do not know to what extent Deputy Kissane was serious in asking the House to accept that.</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent I am to take seriously Deputy MacEntee's apprehensions about what might be behind this Bill.  The Bill speaks for itself.  It seeks to perpetrate the frightful crime of entrusting local authorities, some of whom we entrust with millions of the ratepayers' money, with the power to alter, when they think wise, the names of our streets and public places.  Deputies know as well as I do that there is not a monopoly of wisdom and sense in this House, and that the people who man our local bodies throughout the country, irrespective of Party, are, in the main, sane, reasonable, and, to a very large extent, conservative-minded people.  To suggest that there is something revolutionary in giving, say, in the case of Dublin to our city fathers the right to decide the names by which the streets of Dublin will be called is to my mind an absurdity that needs no demolition by way of criticism from me.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy MacEntee, this Bill contains no new principle.  Perhaps I might concede to him that that is so.  I do not think it does contain any fundamental new principle. According to Deputy Kissane, not alone did it contain a new principle but it contained an attack on human liberty and human rights.  But I want to suggest to Deputy MacEntee that it makes this important alteration so far as this particular portion of our local government law is concerned, that it makes it possible for a local authority to give effect to the wishes of the majority of the people who elect them, something which in my submission Section 78 of Deputy MacEntee's Act prevents them from doing.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee says that I am misleading the House when I talk about giving power to the local authority.  According to the Deputy, the local authorities already have that <Col N="484" /> power.  They have that power, but it is qualified in such a way and so costly to exercise that the likelihood of their ever using it is remote.  Deputy MacEntee was not quite frank with the House when he neglected to point out that Section 78 of the 1946 Act was undemocratic to this extent, that even after having ascertained the desire of 57 per cent. of the ratepayers to effect the change, Deputy MacEntee's Local Government Act of 1946 did not make it mandatory on the local authority to give effect to the express wishes of that 57 per cent.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the attempt some years ago to change the name of Talbot Street into Seán Treacy Street. What happened in that case was this. A canvass was carried out by a committee composed of representatives of various national organisations.  The G.A.A., the Gaelic League and the National Graves Association were represented on that committee.  They carried out a canvass of the residents in Talbot Street.  I think there was also an attempt made to suggest here that the canvass was tactlessly carried out.  I am not in a position to answer that criticism but, from inquiries I have made, I understand that that is not so.  However, I cannot speak from personal knowledge.  The 51 per cent. requisite under an old British statute was obtained, but I must admit only barely so.  When it was suggested to the corporation subsequent to the passage of the Act of 1946 that they should operate the Act in order to ascertain whether there was the requisite percentage, they pointed to the fact that Section 78 had raised the requisite percentage to such an extent that it would not be possible to obtain the consent of the percentage necessary. In actual fact, whatever the intention behind Section 78 was, and I understand that it purported at the time to make it possible to effect a change in the case of Talbot Street, the effect of Section 78, which the present Bill seeks to amend, was to make it more difficult and to render it impossible for the name of Talbot Street to be changed as desired.</P>
    <P>We have been told that this Bill is undemocratic.  We were told that by Deputy MacEntee and his sentiment <Col N="485" /> was re-echoed by Deputy O'Higgins.  I do not know whether that argument is seriously advanced or not but what, in God's name, could be more democratic than to allow a decision on a matter affecting the citizens in this city to the elected representatives of this city?  Surely no more democratic method could be evolved.  I think I am entitled to make the comment that while from both sides of the House we have had pious expressions of goodwill in so far as a desire to have the change effected was concerned, nevertheless, we have had at the same time a criticism of any effort or any method calculated to make that change possible.</P>
    <P>I do not think I need deal with the argument that there is an undemocratic principle enshrined in the Bill, at any great length.  The argument is so demonstrably ridiculous that it deals with itself.  It has been argued that if the Dáil gives a Second Reading to this Bill they are giving a Second Reading to a Bill which may leave the door open for the abuse of the unqualified power given to the local authority.  I think I have dealt with that point already in another way.  I do not believe the local authorities or county councils or borough councils or corporations or urban councils are composed of individuals who are going to abuse or unwisely use the additional power given to them under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Then, Deputy Briscoe, and to a certain extent Deputy MacEntee, lightly touched on another ground of objection.  They touched on it lightly: I am sorry they did not develop it because therein, I think, lay their real objection to this Bill&mdash;the possibility of inconvenience being caused to trade interests.  I cannot see that any such apprehension of inconvenience or disturbance of trade has any basis in fact.  Whatever little temporary inconvenience there might be would be of such a minor and transitory nature that I think we are entitled to ignore it.  Particularly are we entitled to ignore it in view, in my submission to the House, of the widespread public feeling there is in connection with this matter.  I do not know whether representations have been made by influential <Col N="486" /> interests in any given street or particularly in the street to which so much reference has been made.  I do not know whether any influential interests are behind the persistent opposition to change the name of Talbot Street to Seán Treacy Street, but there is persistent, virulent and determined opposition and I do not think Deputies, no matter on what side of the House they may be sitting, should give any countenance to that opposition because it is opposition from a very very small minority, numerically.</P>
    <P>The only real argument I have to meet, of all the arguments that were advanced against this measure, is the argument that the Government are bringing in a Bill which may, possibly, effect the desired change.</P>

I should like to be in a position to tell the House that the undertaking given by the Parliamentary Secretary went the whole way to meet me.  Unfortunately, I should be dishonest if I were to say so.  If we had in our hands a draft of the measure which the Parlimentary Secretary envisages when he gives that undertaking perhaps I might be able to accept that undertaking.  However, in default of having the actual draft and particularly in the light of some of the observations made in the course of this debate, I feel I am still entitled to ask the House to accept this measure and give it a Second Reading.</P>

At least that will be done.</P>

      <P>However, Deputy Fitzpatrick can answer for himself. This Bill would not be before the House if the representations that were made repeatedly by some of us on these benches for a period of over two years had been heeded.  It was only after a period of two years of Parliamentary Questions, of representations, of private and informal lobbying, which resulted in absolutely nothing, that the Dáil was troubled with this Bill. Consequently, in spite of what the Parliamentary Secretary says, I still ask the Dáil to give this Bill a Second Reading.</P>
      <P>I would say this to the Parliamentary Secretary and to the Dáil: that if the principle of giving the power to the local authority or to the persons on the electoral register were accepted, I am perfectly prepared to agree to any amendment which does not derogate from that principle, but, in default of that, I ask the Dáil to give this Bill a Second Reading.  If the Dáil gives a Second Reading to this Bill, any reasonable amendment will certainly be accepted by myself and the other Deputies supporting this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have attempted to make as completely objective an approach to this question as is possible under the circumstances.  I am certainly approaching it without any feeling of rancour over any of the things that may have been said in the course of the debate. I would ask Deputies to consider this point: Many of them waxed eloquent on the right of the ratepayers to decide, but I would ask them how many new thoroughfares have been <Col N="488" /> named since 1923 about the nomenclature of which the residents, the rated occupiers, the ratepayers have never been consulted?  I can put it further.  How many streets are there in Dublin in the naming of which one single individual ratepayer, resident or rated occupier has had the slightest say?  The answer, of course, is not one single street, except in so far as public opinion was responsible for forcing the change of name in the case of Cathal Brugha Street, Seán MacDermott Street, Pearse Street and O'Connell Street.  The ratepayer, the resident, the rated occupier was not consulted on any occasion in respect of the naming of any street.</P>
    <P>I do not want to detain the Dáil unduly.  I am afraid that at the back of the opposition to this Bill is the assumption that the Irish nation does not really exist, that this country is inhabited by a number of different groups, professing different political faiths, and that one of these political faiths is just as good as another and that nothing must be done, no legislation must be enacted, which may hurt the susceptibilities of that small section whose secret aim is to subvert the freedom of this country and to bring the country once more under the control of the British Crown.  I think that, unconsciously, Deputies opposite, perhaps in an effort to be unduly fair, are allowing some kind of loose thinking of that type to permeate their approach to this and to many other questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This measure is designed to provide for workers employed on the land of this country, on a weekly contract for wages, the right to a half-holiday.  The first thing that strikes me about it is that it is rather strange that at this period of advancement of civilisation and progress we should be talking now, in the year 1950, of the need for so simple an advantage for workers as a weekly half-holiday.</P>
      <P>The principle of rest from labour, the idea that the worker should not be kept eternally with his back bent, or with his nose to the grindstone, is a principle, an idea, which has been accepted in most parts of this country and, generally, all over the world.  Here we have a section of the Irish nation, the largest group of workers following one occupation and employed for wages, the farm labourers, and they have not yet been given, by law, the right to a weekly half-holiday.</P>
      <P>I and others associated with me in this measure are asking the Dáil to write into our Statute Book this very simple concession.  I have noticed that within recent weeks opposition to the idea of a weekly half-holiday for farm labourers has been voiced outside of this House by members of the House, and I have heard opposition expressed to the idea inside this House on different occasions.  I am always at a loss to understand how we can agree to have one law for one section of the people and another law for another section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure vitally affects the agricultural worker on the one hand, and on the other hand the farmer who employs labour.  There are many thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of farmers in this country who employ no labour.  But when this opposition is voiced, I often wonder at how short is the memory of those who are giving expression to this opposition. The tenant proprietors of this country have achieved a certain degree of security, of fixity of tenure. They would not have achieved that degree of security, they would not have achieved the present condition of what I would describe as relative prosperity &mdash;relative, that is, in relation to their condition 50, 60 or 70 years ago, when the landlords were rack-renting them and when they were held in economic subjection by a foreign power, not alone politically but economically, when there was a stranglehold on the peasant proprietors of this country&mdash; had they not fought to achieve it.  The fight was made, first of all, by the men who were concerned, the peasant proprietors, but their strongest arm and their strongest allies were these men I am talking about here now, the men <Col N="491" /> to whom Tone referred a couple of hundred years ago almost as the &ldquo;men of no property,&rdquo; the men with no stake in the country other than the products of their own toil and their own efforts and sweat.  These men are the lowliest section of our people to-day.</P>
    <P>I suppose in number it will be thought that they do not matter very much, and when electioneering takes place we are all aware of the fact that the large political Parties, when making their plea for political power, inevitably design their propaganda so as to attract support from those who are numerically greatest, from those who are in largest numbers, and they would be the tenant proprietors of the land.  I suppose there is approximately upwards of 100,000 men working for wages on the land, as opposed to over 500,000 of those who either own land directly or have an indirect interest in ownership of the land by virtue of their relationship to farmers or proprietors.</P>
    <P>I think this is a fact which has affected the fortunes of farm labourers right down to the present day.  I am making the appeal, in connection with this Bill, to the sense of justice which must reside in the minds and in the hearts of every member of this House, no matter to which Party he may belong.  Farm labourers in Ireland work 54 hours a week.  There are not many people in this country who can say they work 54 hours a week. Industrial workers at one time were required to work 70 hours a week.  In the not-too-distant past, within living memory, dock labourers had to work the round of the clock.  Factories and mill-workers have had to work, in bygone years which are long, long past, until they dropped.  In those years it was suggested that there should be a reduction of hours, that it was reasonable that human beings, who were given intellect and a sould to distinguish them from the brute animal in the fields, should get some sort of decent treatment and that there should be some regulation of hours, that it should not be just a question of &ldquo;from work to bed&rdquo;, as the saying goes in the country, that it should not be just a <Col N="492" /> question of toiling from dawn to dark, that a man was designed and created by the Almighty for something higher than that, and that, in order to afford him the opportunity to aspire to these higher things, he should be given shorter hours of work and fairer conditions.</P>
    <P>When those very moderate and what are now very respectable ideas were first propounded in this country by the late James Larkin 40 years ago and by James Connolly and other men like him, and when they were propounded in Britain earlier still, the very self-same arguments that are now being used, or have been used in recent weeks in connection with this very simple measure to give a small benefit to agricultural workers, were used then.  There is no difference whatever between them.  In those days, when the great men of that period were striving, when progressive social thinkers or trade union leaders were working tooth and nail to improve the position of workers, every device was employed to prevent the progress of what they were trying to achieve and every word that could be said was said about them and every act that could be carried out was employed against them to prevent what they were trying to bring about, a fairer deal for people who were not blessed with the world's goods who had not been born to property, who had not been lucky enough to accumulate property and who had nothing to sell, but their labour whether it was of hand or of brain.</P>
    <P>As I say, it was said then, in the days when efforts were being made to prevent children being employed in the mines in Britain&mdash;something which everybody, the most respectable, the biggest employer in Britain or in this country to-day would look upon with horror and be appalled to think of, children being employed in the mines &mdash;and when an effort was made to stop that and bring about some degree of civilised conduct in so far as employers and workers were concerned, the cry went up that it would bring about ruin for the industry of winning coal.  Every time we hear protests against this measure, based upon the <Col N="493" /> argument that it will harm the agricultural industry, we are reminded of what happened in years gone by in other cases.</P>
    <P>I think that an industry such as the agricultural industry of this country, which is our basic industry, is one which we must cherish and endeavour to bring to full prosperity by every means in our power, and upon which the whole future of this nation eventually depends, no matter what industrialisation may take place.  If that industry is in such a position that we cannot afford to give the men who work the land for wages, and for the lowest wages paid to any section of our people, 1/13th of a break of their weekly contract of service of 54 hours per week, then the time has come when we must bow our heads in shame and admit that our agricultural industry is nothing to boast about and that the fault lies within ourselves.</P>
    <P>I am asking for nothing more than that the simplest Christian principle of justice should be applied to these men. I have heard it said and bruited about by those who do not take the trouble to find out the true facts that this would be impracticable and that one cannot give a farm labourer a half-day every week because that system cannot be worked on the land.  I have heard the question asked: What will we do if the cows have to be milked; what will happen in the harvest-time if every other day is wet and Saturday is fine, how can we give a half-day then?  There is no more reasonable citizen in our State than the agricultural worker.  There is no better class, no sounder class, no more reasonable class than that of the agricultural workers.  There is no class which will rush to the farmer's aid so speedily in time of stress and danger.</P>
    <P>In the greater part of Co. Dublin agricultural labourers enjoy a half-holiday. They have been enjoying that half-holiday since 1944.  Farmer Deputies who know Co. Dublin particularly the area north of the river, will agree that that is one of the most intensively cultivated and developed agricultural areas in the country.  We have there some of the best farmers in Ireland.  When the idea of a half-day per week for the agricultural workers <Col N="494" /> in that area was first mooted six years ago it was not kindly received.  Eventually, by dint of negotiation and persuasion, which took various forms, the principle of a half-day was established. It has worked quite successfully and quite satisfactorily.  It has not done any damage to the industry.  Any Co. Dublin farmer will tell the farmer Deputies here that it has brought about a more satisfactory condition of affairs in agriculture in Co. Dublin. Formerly, because of its proximity to the city, there were times when it was difficult for farmers to get labour.  It is not easy for them now because if the men go across the road on to a building job they can get £2 per week more and work eight hours per week less than if they were working for a farmer.  But because of the successful operation of the half-day for the agricultural worker in Co. Dublin, the farmer has undoubtedly helped himself in bringing about a more satisfactory position there.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the half-day applies throughout the county.  I would ask those Deputies who are interested in this very important issue from the point of view of the 100,000 workers on the land to take the trouble before they cast their vote of inquiring from the farmers in Co. Dublin, without reference to their workers, whether this half-day has done any damage to the agricultural industry.  They will find that, on the contrary, its effect has been most beneficial.</P>
    <P>I know other speakers will follow me on this measure.  This is not the first time this matter has been discussed here and for that reason it is to some extent possible to anticipate some of the points that may be raised.  It may be said that it is not the job of the Dáil to legislate in this fashion; that the Dáil in putting through legislation of this kind would be usurping or assuming functions more appropriate to the trade union movement. It is very easy to say that but the fact remains that there is no country in the world where the trade union movement has been able to achieve effective organisation amongst farm labourers. By effective organisation I mean 100 per cent. organisation.  There is no country where there has been effective <Col N="495" /> organisation even amongst the farmers. That is a condition about which nobody can do very much.  The previous Government saw fit to introduce a measure to bring about certain minimum standards in relation to the wages of agricultural workers.  On occasion the present Minister has taken pride in the fact that he has lifted the wages to a £3 per week minimum. That is something which those of us who are in contact with these workers would not boast about because we know that that wage bears no relationship to the cost of living to-day.  It is a mystery to me and to others how the farm labourer can live on £3 per week and in many cases rear a very large family.</P>
    <P>I have discussed this question of a half-day for farm labourers in every county in the Republic.  I have not gone, as some would seem to think, with the idea of disturbing what are wishfully described, in my view, as the harmonious relations that exist between the farmer and his man, or, as was said on one occasion, between the master and his man.  I have gone there simply to obtain the views of the people interested in this proposed improvement or concession.  I can tell the House that most people need not be concerned about the justice of the case. They can be concerned about it politically because for the farm labourers there is no more important issue at stake.  When Deputies go into the lobby to vote I ask them to bear that in mind. I appeal to their sense of justice.  I appeal to them to contrast the position of the agricultural worker with that of the industrial worker.  In doing that, I ask them to make up their minds with a view to ensuring that justice is done to that most neglected section of our people.</P>

      <P>On the motion for the Adjournment, Deputy B. Maguire has given notice to raise the subject-matter of Questions Nos.  60 and 61 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="496" />
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been forced to raise this question on the Adjournment because of the Minister's reply to my question to-day.  Let me say at the beginning that I am not raising it through any political motive whatever. I am raising it as a matter of national importance.  The Minister knows that because this matter has been the subject of correspondence between the Minister and myself over the last few months.  About the latter part of September I foresaw that harvest conditions then were such as to indicate a very dangerous prospect for the future. I am speaking of the parts of the country with which I am familiar, and of the hearvest conditions there at that time.  As a result of the correspondence I had with the Minister, and of a previous question which I put down here some weeks ago, it became evident to me that the Minister was not fully aware of the conditions that obtained in the part of the country that I come from, or of the position of the farmers there whom I represent.  The Minister's reply to-day convinces me that he has not had direct information of the conditions that obtain in those particular areas.  My question referred particularly to the West and the North-West. The Minister's reply implied that he was dealing with the whole country and not with a particular part of it.  Hence I decided to raise this question tonight so that I might more definitely and accurately state what I had in view.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his reply, stated that he himself had lost all his hay, that it had been destroyed by fire and that he had to make alternative arrangements.  That has nothing to do with the questions which were put down by Deputy Flanagan and myself. These questions dealt with the actual emergency which exists as a result of bad weather conditions.  The Minister went on to state that there were alternatives which existed, and he mentioned that many farmers had already dug a pit and ensiled surplus grass and other green fodder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister's answer as regards the destruction of his own hay, which was unfortunate, had nothing to do with the general conditions prevailing amongst the farmers <Col N="497" /> whom I represent.  It is absurd for the Minister to suggest that they would be able to provide ensilage at this juncture to meet their requirements arising out of the bad harvest.  The farming community, as a whole, have not yet adapted themselves to the use of ensilage.  I think I can speak with much more authority on ensilage than the Minister.  I am an older man than he is, and as a practical farmer for many years&mdash;this also applies to those who went before me&mdash;we had adapted ourselves to the use of it.  It is very unfortunate, however, that farmers generally have not adopted that very useful means of providing themselves with even better fodder than the hay obtained under the best harvest conditions. However, that is so.  There is no use now in recommending farmers to use ensilage when it is too late for them to do so.  To suggest that, is no contribution towards a solution of the conditions that now confront them.</P>
    <P>It may be true, in a general way, that there is sufficient hay of sorts in some districts, but that is not the position in the districts in the West and North-West.  In order to illustrate the conditions that prevail there, may I mention that the farmers in the North of Ireland are, I understand, importing hay from Scotland and Holland.  Bad weather conditions can have a more adverse effect in the districts in the West and North-West than they probably would have in the Midlands or in the South.  The fact remains that, as a result of the best efforts that could be made, the position in the more extreme parts of the West and North-West is such that there is a serious shortage of hay. I suggested to the Minister some weeks ago that, as there was not sufficient hay available in the districts I speak of for the number of stock there, he might consider paying a subsidy on the killing off of a certain number of the younger stock.  As the fodder is not available, it will be impossible for farmers to prepare those cattle in the ordinary way for the market.  I might illustrate the situation that exists in this way.  At a fair in Manorhamilton a fortnight or three weeks ago a farmer sold four cows for <Col N="498" /> £26.  These cows were due to calve some time next spring.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At £6 10s. apiece?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If a farmer has no hay to feed to his cattle will he not be well pleased to accept any price that is offered to him?  The fact, however, is that these four cows, which were due to calve next spring, were sold for £26 at that fair last month or in September.  What is the position of that farmer going to be next spring when there is a scarcity of in-calf cattle if he attempts to restock his farm? How is he going to be able to replace those four cows that he had to sell for £26?  It is because of the seriousness of that position that I am raising this question this evening.  I want to bring it to the Minister's notice.  Manorhamilton is near the Border, and as I have said, the farmers in the Six Counties are importing hay from Scotland and Holland.  There is no use in blaming the farmers there because they do not make ensilage or because they do not retain their oats.  They do not grow a lot of oats.  It is a poor part of the country, almost entirely dairying with tillage in a very minor way. The situation that has arisen in that area will have this result, that one-third of the farmers there will be eliminated if the Minister does not take cognisance of the facts which I have stated and come to their rescue in some way.  It is now too late to make ensilage.  I admit that farmers have shown no ambition at all to engage in the making of ensilage or in adopting other methods for saving grass.  Instead, they stick to the old method of saving the hay in spite of the fact that a crisis like this has arisen before.  How many cattle will die of starvation in the coming spring as a result of an insufficient supply of feeding stuffs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cattle, any more than humans, cannot live without the necessary nutriment, and if the feeding-stuffs are not available, what will be the result? You will undermine the whole of the cattle industry of the country because the farmers in this part of the country produce stores mainly, which they self when they are six or twelve months <Col N="499" /> old.  At present when these farmers bring their calves which have reached the age of six or 12 months to the market they find that they are unsaleable. It is true, as the Minister said, that in the Dublin market there has been an appreciation in the price of certain types of stock, but these are well-conditioned animals of a more mature age.  The production of these animals is possible only because the people in the West of Ireland rear their stock until they have reached the age of 12 months or so and then sell them as stores to the midland farmers who, in turn, sell them off as finished animals when they have reached the age of 18 months or two years.  I have no desire to score any political points in this debate, but I assure the Minister that the people who rear these young stock are going to be driven out of the industry by the present conditions because young cattle will undoubtedly die of starvation unless something is done to assist these farmers.  What will happen when the spring comes around again, when there will be a marked diminution in the number of the store cattle available? Many of them will have died off because of lack of feeding stuffs.  Apart from the immediate loss to the farmer, will there not be a diminution in the number of stores required in the midlands and elsewhere?  Will that not result in increased prices all round, even an increase in the price of meat here in Dublin?</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to realise that we are dealing with a fundamental question here, namely, the raw material of our most important industry. That raw material is the young stores produced by the dairy farmers in that part of the country, who do practically no tillage and who have no reserves of ensilage, oats or barley. The people of this area have been particularly badly struck by the climatic conditions of the late summer.  As evidence of that fact, I again refer the Minister to the importation of hay from Scotland and Holland by their next-door neighbours, the northern farmers.  The condition of affairs in the country generally is bad but in certain districts it is more than bad; <Col N="500" /> it is disastrous.  Can anything be done about it?  I suggested to the Minister in a letter some weeks ago that he might consider the killing off of the less mature animals and so reduce the demand for feeding stuffs in the country.  If the number of stock were diminished by killing them off and exporting the meat under subsidy, nobody would suffer a financial loss.  The farmer to whom I refer is the cornerstone of the live-stock trade of this country.  Under normal conditions he feeds these young cattle through the winter and sells them off in February, March or April to the midland farmers who finish them off. I do not think it unreasonable at this juncture to ask the Government to ensure that these men should be kept in production.  If the Minister considers that it would be wrong to subsidise meat for export, then let him consider the other side of it.  Why not subsidise the killing off of a certain number of cattle whose meat could be offered for sale to our people in the City of Dublin or elsewhere at a cheaper rate?  Certainly something must be done and some assistance should be made available so as to make it possible to dispose of this meat on the home or foreign market rather than allow these cattle to die and be pitched into a bog hole.  In that way these farmers would be put in a position to resume their ordinary activities as producers of young cattle when grass becomes again available.</P>
    <P>I submit these suggestions to the Minister without any prejudice whatever with a view to ensuring that the Minister will cause an exhaustive and full examination to be made of the conditions to which I refer.  I do not think I have exaggerated them in any way and I had no intention of doing so.  In certain parts of the country, the Minister might ameliorate the present conditions by perhaps a subsidy on Indian meal or other feeding stuffs.  In that way, he might contribute also towards averting the terrible consequences of the present conditions which if they are allowed to take their full course, will militate against cattle production in this country for many a day.  If the people have to endure these heavy <Col N="501" /> losses, the young cattle trade in the poorer districts will be practically wiped out for many years to come.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  I rise for the purpose of expressing my agreement with the case put forward by Deputy Maguire.  Conditions in certain areas are very bad, particularly in the constituency which I represent.  I do say, however, that whatever action the Minister proposes to take, I hope he will give no consideration to any proposal to slaughter off young animals because we had that daft and crazy performance by the late Government. Young animals were slaughtered wholesale. The Lord's ways are always slow but sure and it appeared as if a curse fell on this country a short time afterwards when we had the terrible outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease as a result of which some of the finest beasts in the country had to be slaughtered. We do not want a recurrence of that.</P>
      <P>I desire to bring before the Minister the conditions obtaining in the Shannon area of South Laoighis, particularly in the Luggacurran and other districts and in the Nore valley area.  There is nothing surer than that live stock will die of starvation in these areas if some steps are not taken to provide sufficient feeding stuffs.  There is no hay in these areas; the hay crop has been completely destroyed.  We all sympathise with the Minister on the loss of his hay but that does not concern us so much because he is in a far better position to replace what he has lost than these small farmers who are dependent on the rearing of young live stock for a livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Attempts have been made by farmers in Laoighis and Offaly districts to dispose of their stock in view of the imminent shortage of foodstuffs but they found that there was practically no sale for them.  I went to the trouble of inquiring what the sales were like at Kilcormac fair to-day, and I am told that people were forced to bring home their live stock or sell them off for practically little or <Col N="502" /> nothing.  That is a state of affairs that should not be allowed to continue. I think the Minister should not tell us that he expects Deputies and other people to come forward with suggestions to meet the situation.  It is his job as Minister for Agriculture to find a remedy.  That is the job he is paid for. That is the reason resolutions were passed by the Laoighis Co. Committee of Agriculture and the Offaly Co. Committee of Agriculture concerning the deplorable conditions in that area. I agree with Deputy Maguire that the position is very serious.  In recent times I seldom raise my voice in this House, but I desire now to impress upon the Minister the seriousness of the situation, not with any object of criticising him but to assist him in any efforts he may take to put matters right.  If he does not put them right the best part of the Midland farmers and the farmers of other areas will be completely beggared and will not be in a position to pay rates, rents, taxes, or anything else.</P>

      <P>I have only ten minutes. No one can doubt that the loss of part of the hay crop is a most serious problem for the small farmer who has had the misfortune to suffer that loss. This is the eighth day of November. Six weeks ago the chief inspector of my Department was in touch with the secretary of every county committee of agriculture in Ireland.  Every officer of my Department whose duty takes him through the country has been under express instructions from me to keep me constantly posted of the conditions obtaining in every several area where his duties brought him.  Regularly for the last six weeks the chief inspector of my Department has made a report to me as to the impressions he forms from day to day from the information reaching him. To listen to Deputy Maguire talking, few Deputies would realise that we live within 20 miles of each other.  The last 25 years of my life have been spent living among farmers, the largest of <Col N="503" /> whom has a farm of 20 acres and many of them are rearing families on eight acres.  Does the Deputy imagine that I am not anxious about them?  Have I not lived out of them all my life? Anything I have I got out of them. The only danger in which I stand is that my reaction to every agricultural problem is unduly coloured by the intimacy of my acquaintance with the ten-acre man and that I find it hard to discharge my full duty in giving appropriate consideration to the interests of the larger farmer whose servant I am just as much as I am the servant of my own neighbour.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have told Deputies that I most fully appreciate and most heartily sympathise with the difficulties the farmers have to contend with, but I do not think that my sympathy will do anybody any good.  What I went on to say was that every resource I am possessed of will be mobilised to bring feed within reach of any farmer in Ireland whose live stock is short of the wherewithal to feed them and to see that no beast on any farm in Ireland will suffer the deterioration of a shilling for want of food.

I stake my voice against the panic-mongers and I say to the small farmers in Cavan, Leitrim, Monaghan and Mayo, in Galway, Clare and Kerry not to sell their cattle now unless they get their full value, and if any tangler comes to their gate to tell them that their cattle will die of starvation my advice to them is to take the loy and chase him down the road.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You took those two questions together instead of dealing with them separately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not be so eloquent.  The Deputy rebuked me about my failure to make provision for the flooded farmers of the Shannon valley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was every need to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I demonstrated to the Deputy on that occasion that the farmers to whom he then referred had severally been offered holdings of land outside the flooded area in which they were then living and that some of them had accepted them and that others had elected to remain where they were. This is a free country.  The duty of the Government was to make available to the farmers suffering from flooding in the Shannon area the opportunity of transfer, but it is no duty of this Government&mdash;and God grant that it never will be&mdash;to go to the small farmers of the Shannon valley or anywhere else and order them out of their own homes.  I showed the Deputy the facts and I obliged him to confess that it was the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not the area that I was concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the area of which the Deputy complained bitterly in this House, and I went to the trouble of finding out the facts lest the Deputy should feel that the people about whom he was concerned had been overlooked and every farmer had been offered an <Col N="506" /> alternative farm and only those who said that they were not prepared to go stayed.</P>

      <P>What about the hay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Give the Minister a chance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. Maguire has nothing to do with the farmers of the country.  I am not concerned with hay. I am concerned with securing where hay has been lost that the farmer who lost it will have at his disposal an alternative which will keep his cattle safe and sound until he has the opportunity of getting their full value.  I venture to swear that the farmers of Monaghan will have a great deal more confidence in my solicitude for their welfare than they are ever likely to have in the bleatings of Deputy Dr. Maguire.  Deputy Dr. Maguire knows as much about this problem as my foot and he should keep quiet about it.</P>
      <P>No small farmer of the type referred to by Deputy Maguire will suffer the loss of a single beast if he takes reasonable precautions to preserve them and to every small farmer in Ireland I give the assurance individually that he can bespeak the assistance of the Department of Agriculture and that each several case will get assistance to the limit of the Department's capacity to provide.</P>
