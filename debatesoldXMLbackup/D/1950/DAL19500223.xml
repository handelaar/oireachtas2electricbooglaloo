      <P>The returns furnished by local authorities do not give information in the form required by the Deputy.  The figures available show the number of persons in receipt of home assistance on a particular date in each month and not the total number of persons who received assistance during the year.  It may suit the Deputy's purpose if I give the number of persons in Balrothery who were in receipt of home assistance on 31st March in each of the years mentioned in the question.  The figures are as follows:&mdash;1938, 1393; 1939, 1625; 1947, 479; 1948, 338; 1949, 319.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers concerned in this matter were informed last November that, as their holdings were vested, the Land Commission could not undertake to repair the sluice gate. That position still holds.</P>
      <P>I wish to take this opportunity of impressing on Deputies that when holdings are vested, the Land Commission have no further commitment to the tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that if the sluice gate was repaired 20 years ago, as the Deputy said, the tenants were not vested then and it was definitely the responsibility of the Land Commission as they were landlords of unvested land.

      <P>A vacancy for an auxiliary postman at Milford, County Donegal, was recently filled&mdash;the most suitable candidate being appointed.  It would be contrary to policy to furnish particulars of the candidates or of the steps taken to ascertain which of them was the most suitable.</P>
      <P>It is my policy, in making appointments of this kind, to select the best qualified candidate, regard being had to the claims of ex-Army applicants, to Irish qualifications in the case of vacancies in the Gaeltacht, and to candidates' domestic responsibilities.</P>

      <P>No. I would refer the Deputy to my previous replies to similar questions asked by him and in particular to my reply of the 17th February, 1949.  I see no reason to change the views expressed therein.  The Deputy will remember that abundant supplies of fertilisers are now available and can be purchased by solvent farmers on credit from Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, their local manure merchant or in suitable cases by borrowing from the local branch of a joint stock bank or from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and all this is in addition to the usual credit facilities made available by cooperative societies to their members and the special facilities available in those counties where the county councils operate the Seeds and Fertilisers (Supply) Acts.</P>

Does the Minister think that we can get maximum production on ½ cwt. per acre?

      <P>The late Mr. Mortimer was subjected to a careful and searching examination by the Army Pensions Board from the 16th September to the 24th September, 1949, on which date he was discharged from hospital.  The board found that the applicant suffered from chronic bronchitis with fibrosis and reported that in their opinion he was not incapable of self-support by reason of permanent infirmity.  The medical examination did not reveal evidence of any disease in any condition to cause anticipation of a fatal outcome.</P>
      <P>Mr. Mortimer died on the 4th October, 1949, of broncho pneumonia and cardiac debility.  He had not broncho pneumonia on the date of his discharge from hospital when he was examined by the members of the board who found that his pulse, temperature and respirations were normal.  Whilst every care is exercised by the board they cannot possibly foresee the consequences of an acute illness supervening on a chronic condition.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the present level of rates is causing concern, and I can assure the Deputy that I will assist local authorities in every way I can where they are endeavouring to effect economy in local expenditure provided essential local services are maintained.  As the Deputy is aware the cost of maintaining local services at their existing level has increased in common with the general increase in costs of supplies and services and this increased cost must be met by rates and State grants.  State grants in aid of local expenditure are now at a very high level.  In this connection I would refer the Deputy to the figures given by me during the debate on the motion for the derating of agricultural land on the 16th November last, which show that between the years 1938-39 and 1948-49 total rates collected have increased by 41 per cent. while State grants to local authorities have increased by over 100 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion is impracticable.  There are approximately 38,900 miles of county roads in the country, of which 3,900 have some type of surfacing, leaving, approximately, 35,000 miles which are not dust free.  If funds were not limited, all these 35,000 miles could be surfaced, but taking into account the actual limitations on the funds which can be made available from both central and local sources, the effects of the implementation <Col N="640" /> of the Deputy's suggestion would be to make county roads, or the greater part of them, a county-at-large charge and to secure a percentage recoupment on expenses of maintenance, subject, however, to a reduced scale of grant and to proportionate curtailment of other grants.  It will thus be evident that the suggestion would not result in the more rapid improvement of the roads to which the Deputy refers.  This objective is being attained, so far as existing resources permit, by the adoption in 1949-50, and also for 1950-51, of revised bases of allocations whereby the total amount available for grants is apportioned in nearly equal amounts as between main and county roads and the improvement grant is divided between county and main roads in the proportion two to one.</P>

In any event, the Deputy will appreciate that in fixing the boundaries of dispensary districts, while the convenience of the public is the primary consideration, it is not always possible to ensure that at the extremities of a district the distance from a particular point to the dispensary premises for that district is not greater than the distance from that point to the dispensary premises in the adjoining dispensary district.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Committee adjourned last night, we were discussing Section 59, which provides for payments by way of compensation to the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann and of the Grand Canal Company.  The Minister when framing his Bill proposed that the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann should be granted compensation for loss of office on a fairly generous basis, a basis of payment of the equivalent of directors' fees for two years.  Until the discussion of the section began yesterday, Deputies were entitled to assume that the Minister had given careful consideration to this provision of the Bill, had arrived at a decision as to what was equitable and desirable and that this decision was embodied in the section. When the section was moved from the Chair, however, Deputy Larkin spoke, as he had intimated he would speak, in opposition to it and the opposition expressed by him was supported by a number of other Deputies on the Government side of the House.  Some six or seven Deputies on the Government side followed Deputy Larkin and expressed unanimous opposition to the section.</P>
      <P>After they had expressed that opposition on varying grounds, some logical and some illogical, the Minister intervened in the debate.  It was noticed that he made little effort to persuade the Deputies who were opposing the section that they should withdraw their opposition.  He spoke at the conclusion of his remarks of leaving the question to a free vote of the House, but he did not even intimate how he himself would vote, if a division were challenged on the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that we should recognise that there is no obligation on us to vote compensation to these directors.  I think that the Minister was overstating the case when he represented <Col N="643" /> himself as being coerced by precedent to provide for compensation for these directors.  There is no such precedent of which I am aware.  It is true that the 1944 Act provided for the payment of compensation to such of the directors of the old Great Southern Railway and the Dublin United Tramways Company as did not seek or secure election as stockholders' directors on the C.I.E. Board.  The position which arose then was that two companies were being amalgamated and the total number of their directors exceeded the number of directors which was to be appointed to the board.  It was obvious that they could not all be elected as directors of the new undertaking and there was, in any event, a consideration of policy which appeared to me to make it desirable to give some of them an inducement not to seek reelection. The circumstances were entirely different.  The concern of which these directors are in charge is being wound up.  It is being transferred to the custody of a new board, the members of which will be appointed exclusively by the Government.  I cannot feel, therefore, that there is in the provisions of the 1944 Act, any precedent which is so coercive that the Minister was compelled to put this section in the Bill against his will.  We must assume, until the Minister tells us otherwise, that he put this section in the Bill because he thought it should be there.</P>
    <P>The Bill took a long time in its preparation. It reached the Dáil some nine months after the Minister announced his intention of bringing it here.  Its drafting was not rushed in any sense of the term.  Every section of it was undoubtedly fully considered, including this section, and it is because he had fully considered it, giving due regard to every consideration of expediency and of equity, that the Minister came to the Dáil with a proposal that these retiring directors of Córas Iompair Éireann should be compensated generously.  Whatever considerations obliged the Minister to insert the section in the Bill, surely operate to place an obligation on him now to defend it.  He made no attempt <Col N="644" /> to defend it.  He did not even endeavour to explain to the Dáil the considerations which prompted him in the first instance to insert the section in the Bill.  The House is now in the position that it is considering a section of the Bill which nobody is prepared to recommend. In so far as it is a matter at all for Deputies on this side of the House, I want to make it clear that we will not accept an obligation which is clearly the Minister's</P>

If the Minister does not want it, we will not force it on him. If the Minister has changed his mind about it, he has only to say so and we will pass to the next section.</P>

      <P>He has to make a good case for it.  We will base our attitude on that.  We do not much mind what he does.  We are prepared to sit here and hear his case for the section if there is a case for the section.  I think the Minister owes it to himself and to the Deputies behind him, who spoke in favour of the Bill, at least to put on record the reasons he had in his mind when he put the section into the Bill.  If, however, the Minister is indifferent to the section, if he is not prepared to defend it to the Dáil or make a case to the Dáil, then I think he should withdraw it.</P>
      <P>My intervention in the debate last night was prompted by the nature of the arguments which were advanced by the Deputies who spoke against the section.  One Deputy said that we should refuse these Córas Iompair Éireann directors the compensation which the Minister thought it equitable to give them because they had had the audacity to criticise the Minister's proposals.  That is a rather dangerous precedent to establish.  I know that there are countries in Europe where criticism of a Government leads to penalties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The historical record is there.  The Minister is trying to sidetrack this, for him, awkward discussion by introducing irrelevancies and untruths. The case was made by a Fine Gael Deputy that to punish the directors for their criticism of the Minister's proposals the Minister should withdraw the compensation he previously intended to give them.  What was the criticism?  They criticised the proposed terms for the acquisition of the stockholders' interests in Córas Iompair Éireann.  Who are the people who criticised these proposals?  The representatives of the stockholders in Córas <Col N="646" /> Iompair Éireann.  I do not think their criticism of the Government's proposals was very sound.  I think that a far better case could be made to support an argument that the Minister was unduly generous to the stockholders of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the opposition to this section proposed by the Minister which was made by the Deputies behind him is an expression of their spite against free citizens&mdash;because they are presumably free citizens&mdash;or if because in the discharge of what they thought was their duty they expressed criticism of the Minister's proposals, then I think that most decent people, irrespective of their personal view as to the proposal in the section, would prefer to vote for it merely to dissociate themselves from that attitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More importantly, however, other Deputies urged that, whatever principle is involved in this, whatever case could be made upon general grounds for compensating persons whose office has been abolished by statute, an exception should be made in this case, because these particular directors of Córas Iompair Éireann were personally responsible for the condition of the undertaking, a condition which necessitated the voting of moneys to subsidise it some months ago.  That case against the section is, of course, in general line with the whole case which the Minister has been making to justify his previous attitude to Córas Iompair Éireann and his proposals in this Bill.  I argued yesterday, and I assert here again, that so far as it was possible for any body of men to manage that concern in the conditions laid down by the present Minister during the past two years, these directors did as good a job as could be done.  It <Col N="647" /> was humanly impossible to save the concern, to prevent it losing money, in the circumstances which the Minister created.</P>
    <P>The Minister perhaps may recognise that his effort to find a scapegoat to bear the consequences of his own actions is in conflict with his proposals in this section.  If he withdraws the section it will be because that fact became clear to him from the speeches which were made on the benches opposite last night.  I will not assert that these directors are entitled to compensation because of any special services they gave.  I do not want to be committed, and I do not think the House should be committed, to any precedent of this kind.  It may be that in the future other concerns, now in private ownership and managed by directors elected by their owners, may be transferred to the management of statutory boards or State-controlled companies.  If there is to be a development of that kind, I do not think that we should accept now that there is a necessary obligation established by precedent for compensating such directors.</P>
    <P>The only argument which the Minister advanced in favour of the section was that he was coerced by precedent. If he wants to assume that such a precedent exists, then we should make it clear, here and now, that it does not, by reversing the previous practice in this case.  It may be, and probably will be, desirable on grounds of expediency to provide for compensation in some cases to facilitate the transfer of an undertaking to public ownership where such transfer is considered desirable in the public interest.  I wonder if I am right in assuming that, when the Minister framed this section, considerations of expediency were upward in his mind.  Some Deputies have mentioned that the agitation which was being conducted on behalf of the stockholders of Córas Iompair Éireann by their representatives after the terms of acquisition were made known died down considerably when the terms of the Bill were made known.  The Minister may have purchased a few months of release from criticism by this section.</P>

In 1948, they wrecked Córas Iompair Éireann.  They imposed conditions upon it which made it inevitable that it was going to lose £1,000,000. The directors of the company went to the Minister and told him that, under the conditions which he laid down, they must lose £1,000,000.  They lost £1,000,000.  The Minister had to get a <Col N="649" /> scapegoat, and he got it in the former chairman.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He got nothing of the kind.  The facts of that matter will, I hope, be communicated to the Dáil before we finish the debate.  He then appointed another chairman, his own selection, and again he put on that chairman the obligations to manage this enterprise under impossible conditions. I do not know what private directions were given.  I refer only to one known fact, that in February, 1949, the Minister announced publicly his intention of acquiring the Córas Iompair Éireann undertaking and of transferring it to a board to be appointed by him.  It has not happened yet.  For months after that declaration was made by the Minister there was no sign of any action by him.  It was not until last November that the Bill came to the Dáil.  Does any Deputy think it was likely that a concern under sentence of death, the officers and directors of which had no knowledge of the policy the Government desired them to follow, with no financial resources to undertake any developments, could have been effectively managed over the whole of that year? It was not.  They lost more in 1949 than they lost even in the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, they lost a substantial amount of money.  For that a scapegoat has to be found and the directors have been nominated for that dubious honour.  That is why we had Deputies speaking here last night about withholding this compensation, promised to them by the Minister, as an expression of dissatisfaction with their management of the undertaking. I do not think I am capable of instructing Deputies opposite in the rules of decency.  It would require a man of much more forceful personality and persuasiveness of speech to get them even to understand them.  There are, however, considerations of decency here.  These considerations are possibly known to the Minister.  It is for <Col N="650" /> him to decide now what course of action they dictate for him.  So far as we are concerned, it is he who will have to decide.  We would not have put the section in if the Minister had not done it.  We will not object to his taking it out.  We will not vote to keep it in, unless the Minister makes a much more convincing case than he attempted to make last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, Deputy Lemass just before nine o'clock informed the House that I opposed this section because I had heard criticism of me that had been passed by Mr. Wylie, the so-called deputy-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann.  At that time, I told Deputy Lemass and the House that I had not heard of it.  I want just quietly to repeat that now. Even if I had heard of it, I hope I am able to view matters that come before this House in an objective way and without recourse to any personal feelings that any particular person may or may not have towards me.  As a matter of fact, as I have said, I am not aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course, however, of the Deputy's rather frenzied outburst last night he also referred to another matter that I think cannot be let just pass and be forgotten without comment going on the record.  Deputy Lemass suggested last night that the effect of the removal of this section would be to hinder or obstruct any possible chance of amalgamation of the Great Northern Railway Company of Ireland with the new national transport concern. Let me say as emphatically as I can that I do not accept the Deputy's view that the directors of that concern are not capable of judging what is in the interests of their shareholders without being offered a bribe as compensation. Let me state emphatically that the directors of any company, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, are there as the trustees for the shareholders, bound to consider first, foremost and at all times, not their own interests, but the interests of the people by whom they are appointed as directors.  It should not for a moment be suggested, as it was suggested last night in respect of the directors of the <Col N="651" /> Great Northern Railway, as it has been suggested again by Deputy Lemass this afternoon, that the only thing that would weigh with these directors in the future of the other concern and that weighed with these directors in this concern was whether they were going themselves to receive compensation or bonus.  I do not accept that view about the directors of the Great Northern Railway, nor do I accept that that was in any way a consideration that governed the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann whom we are discussing.</P>
    <P>Let us get down to this matter in an objective and careful way.  What is the position?  Directors, as everybody knows, are people elected from year to year or for a term of years as the articles of association of the company may provide.  They are not in the same position as permanent servants of the company.  It may happen, and it often does happen, that they are continually re-elected for one term of office after another.  But they are not in the same position as people who have a permanent contract of service or employment such as the ordinary officer may have in any company.</P>
    <P>We have here a company that is insolvent. I shall deal with Deputy Lemass's point about who made it insolvent in a moment.  But, for the purpose of consideration of this question, it is not who made it insolvent that matters, but the fact that it is insolvent. It is news to me that it is necessary to pay to the directors of an insolvent company compensation because their directorships are going to cease to exist, as undoubtedly they would have ceased if the company had become insolvent and had been wound up in the ordinary way under the courts or by voluntary liquidation.</P>
    <P>That is not the only consideration in this case.  We have here a board of directors who are in one of two capacities. They were either a purely advisory board with no powers, as I think the so-called deputy-chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann suggested, or they were a board with full and complete powers.  If they were mainly an advisory board, I do not think the question of compensation should arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> If they were, in the proper sense of the term, a board with full competence, then I think there is one essential question that must be answered if we are to consider why they should be given a bonus.  There is no right to this.  It is a bonus and must be considered as a bonus.  The question is this.  I am going to take Deputy Lemass at his own words last night.  I am not going to make any other case except on the speech that Deputy Lemass made, and that was that the loss of 1947 was due to three things, to the weather in 1947, to the strike, and to the wages increase which became operative, according to the Deputy, in August, 1947.  I want one simple question answered.  Why, if these directors were aware of the fact, if they were operating as a board should operate, they took no steps whatever to bring to the notice either of the shareholders or the Government the parlous condition in which the company was placed by these three things between August, 1947, and March, 1948?</P>

      <P>From August, 1947, when the facts could have been communicated to the shareholders, there was no step taken by these people until after the change of Government in February, 1948.  I think that the shareholders are entitled to know why the directors, if they were, as Deputy Lemass said, looking after the interests of the shareholders, dealt with the matter in that way.  I think we are entitled to an answer to another question. As is common property, this concern was in a parlous condition. Yet, in the first six months of 1948 capital schemes involving some £5,000,000 were commenced, according to the Milne Report.</P>

That those schemes were initiated, that proposals for them were initiated without any consideration being made as to where the funds were coming from&mdash;I think it is an extraordinary thing that a sensible body of men, if they had access to the whole affairs of the company, could possibly have done that.  May I now refer Deputy Lemass to page 6 of the Milne Report, paragraph 12?  It shows there that capital expenditure amounting to £5,325,000 had been authorised by the board up to 31st August, 1948.</P>

      <P>According to the people who produced the accounts it made a loss of £811,000.  That was the figure on which they wished to be judged in 1947.  If they now want to stand on the variation suggested by Sir James Milne, they are only giving further evidence of the fact that they did not understand what was happening in the company in that they returned to the world a loss of £811,000 whereas there was not any such loss. It was a conflict of opinion as between Sir James Milne's method of accountancy and theirs.  They cannot have it both ways.  They must make up their minds whether they were wrong when they put those figures before the public, before the shareholders, and, if they were wrong, that Sir James Milne's methods were right; or they were right and Sir James Milne was <Col N="654" /> wrong.  But they cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>It appears to me entirely new that the directors of an insolvent concern should be given compensation because their insolvent concern is being wound up&mdash;because all that this is is a new method of winding up.  Deputy Lemass suggested last night and again to-day that the method in which these affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann had been approached was one of vituperation.  I want to put this on record, that, far from accepting his view, I think it has been a matter for great compliment, the restraint that is being shown on this side of the House in dealing with the affairs of this company, because we all realise that they could have been dealt with in another way.  I want to put this to the House, that if the positions had been reversed, if Mr. Courtney, the present chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann, had made appointments such as were made in the past, would Deputy Lemass and his colleagues have been as restrained in discussing the matter and in not referring to that particular matter as we have been on this side of the House?</P>

      <P>I intervened briefly in the debate last night because I wanted to put on record something I felt then.  I feel a bit more strongly on the subject to-day and I want to enlarge my opinion.  Having heard the Minister's figures last night I had a feeling of amazement that a concern like Córas Iompair Éireann, electing these alleged directors&mdash;and I purport to show later why I consider them to be alleged directors&mdash;undertook to pay an exorbitant figure to these directors, exorbitant in view of the known financial state of the concern.  We are faced with the proposal here of paying a further £10,000 odd&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to get rid of some more of the dross that is knocking round that concern.  I am not going to mention names or deal with personalities, but I say that the reaction <Col N="655" /> of the country to this whole Córas Iompair Éireann problem is that an appalling mess was made of it by somebody and we should not have to pay large sums to get out of that mess. When I think, as a rational being, representing a small farming constituency, of the value that we could get in that constituency from £10,000, I am very loath to contemplate anything further than Deputy Cowan contemplated last night&mdash;leather medals for these retiring gentlemen.</P>
      <P>Here is the situation.  A company that is completely insolvent, not able to carry on and now subsidised out of public funds, is purporting to award a bonus to these gentlemen who, I submit, no matter what they are alleged to have been, seem to have been completely inept.  There is no doubt that the ex-chairman ruled the roost and that whether Mr. Wylie and his stockholder directors liked it or not, they never had any say in the matter.  It appears quite clear that Córas Iompair Éireann was run without these directors.  I do not know what the Minister would be giving them a bonus for if the House was to let that section stand.  There is no record of incompetence so blatant, so nauseating, as the record of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>I said on the Second Reading that it was a suitable epitaph to the incompetence of a former Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I still think that.  I think that in the light of the situation as we know it, we are lucky to have any type of transport system at all left.  I want emphatically to put it on record that I think we are creating a very bad precedent.  We may be encouraging some further large concerns in this country to allow themselves to drift into an impossible situation where the State will be forced to help them out.  If we are going to start a policy of bonuses for those worthy gentlemen who were elected by the stockholders of an insolvent company and who paid themselves nice fancy directors' fees&mdash;if we are going to create that kind of precedent, I do not know where we will stop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we here not far more sane to <Col N="656" /> approach this problem on the basis that if this was not something of such vital importance to the nation that we had to save and preserve it those directors might be answering hardy questions in the winding-up under another method and getting nothing for their trouble?  Those directors, if the concern was other than one of the paramount national importance that it is might have to be facing a rather prolonged investigation of their stewardship, finishing up, as I suggested last night, maybe being asked for something back rather than being given something for nothing.</P>
    <P>Is it not better for this House to get rid of this sordid mess?  These people as long as they served and in whatever capacity they served, advisory board or directors, gave themselves no small reward for it.  I think they have got more than enough.  It is the unfortunate taxpayers who will be asked to contribute this largesse.  As a representative of some of them I urge upon the Minister that we should leave these now <i>requiescant in pace</i>, and that we do not pass here any more bonuses to people passing out of what has been an inefficient concern.</P>

As I understand the machinery of the Road Transport Act, 1944, and the machinery under which Córas Iompair Éireann functioned, no charge against the shareholders' directors and no reasons adduced under this section on the matter of their duties or the way they carried them out are, in my opinion, sustainable because, under the transport system set up in 1944, it is quite clear that the directors had no functions to perform of an executive kind and had no share in the direction of policy.  Their functions were extremely limited.  They were merely representative of the shareholders of Córas Iompair Éireann, to give such advice as they could without any assurance whatsoever that any advice they might tender would be accepted. For that reason I think it is unfair of Deputies to shoulder the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann and the deputy-chairman <Col N="657" /> with any responsibility for the affairs of the company itself.</P>
      <P>I think it has been apparent for a number of years to the people generally that the transport undertaking set up by Deputy Lemass, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, under the direct control of the former chairman, was not run on successful lines.  Deputy Lemass is always most vehement in attack when he is weakest.  Perhaps there is nothing on which he is so weak as transport matters.</P>

      <P>There was also no policy and no proper direction.  On the figures put forward by the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann in the early part of 1948, before ever there was a change of Government, the company was losing money at the rate of £20,000 per week.  While we are all entitled to our own views with regard to Córas Iompair Éireann, and while we are all equally entitled to express them, we should not cloud the issues and we should not seek to apportion blame to those who had no share in its decline. The directors of the company had no function to fulfil; they had no executive authority and they had no right to force any views as to the policy of the company.  We cannot hold them up as having any share in the things that have happened to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has always been an unfortunate disadvantage in endeavouring to semi-nationalise <Col N="658" /> a public company that results ensure which do not fit in.  One of those results is, of course, the fact that there are shareholders' directors having no statutory function of any kind.  That is one of the disadvantages of attempting to compromise between a nationalised undertaking and a public company.  If that was a fault, then it was a fault in the Transport Act of 1944.  Let us recognise, however, that in 1944 a well-run, solvent transport undertaking was amalgamated with an undertaking which had been in difficulties for a great number of years.  With the amalgamation of the Dublin United Tramways Company and the Great Southern Railways, the Dáil put a half-cloak of nationalisation on two public companies, amalgamated into one, leaving the financing of that undertaking to be met by the shareholders of both companies, but leaving the direction of policy and all the executive functions to a Government-appointed chairman.  I do not think that was fair to the shareholders.  Certainly it was a type of compromise which had all the possibilities of failure attached to it.</P>
    <P>We are now discussing the affairs of that company some six years later. We know that the entire concern was a failure on all grounds and for a variety of reasons.  But I do suggest that we should be fair in apportioning blame and I do not think it is fair for any Deputy to attack the payment of compensation to these directors on the ground that they did not carry out their duties, because they had no duties to carry out.  Deputy Collins has asked: &ldquo;Why pay them&rdquo;?  Perhaps it is a border-line proposition either way as to whether or not these directors should be compensated.  I would ask the House to approach the matter from this point of view.  The section covers the directors of both undertakings now being amalgamated under the new Córas Iompair Éireann Company.  I do not think there could be any objection, certainly not any well-founded one, to the payment of adequate compensation to the directors of the Grand Canal Company.  That company is certainly a solvent undertaking, largely in the position of the <Col N="659" /> former Dublin Tramways Company, and it is a company in respect of which no criticism could be offered here.  Therefore, with regard to those directors, I am certain that no Deputy in the House would voice any objection to the provisions of this section.  As to the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, we must recognise that under the former Transport Act a precedent was, in fact, established with regard to compensation for directors.  I may be wrong, and if I am wrong, I am sure Deputy Lemass will correct me, but, as I understand the position, the directors of the dissolved boards six years ago were certainly given the opportunity and I think it was availed of in practically every case of going on the board of the new transport company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure. With regard to these particular directors, we must recognise that they are entitled to say that under the settled conditions in the country now by reason of the change of Government; under a more reasonable chairman&mdash;I am merely saying what case they are entitled to urge&mdash;certainly under a new policy in Córas Iompair Éireann, where expert advice is sought and taken, they are entitled to look forward to better times in the years that lie ahead.  They are entitled to make the case that, as directors of this concern, they have gone through their bad years and are entitled to expect better years ahead.  This Parliament is stepping in now, by means of this Bill, to dissolve that undertaking.  I do not think we can regard it as being in the same position as a public company <Col N="660" /> going into liquidation.  It is not the same as that.  Here we are, under this Bill if it becomes law, by force of law dissolving that company, wiping it out of existence.  We are providing, as we must provide, that all employees and officers of the company who find their positions abolished must get compensation.  It seems to me to be a well-established precedent not merely in these two Transport Acts that were discussed, but, generally speaking, with regard to all legislation in this Parliament, that if by our legislation we adversely affect the office, earnings or emoluments of any person, due and proper compensation is provided.  Realising the powerless position of these particular directors, realising that the only purpose for their existence was to act as trustees of the shareholders&mdash;they had no other function; they could exercise no other function&mdash;and realising also that whatever salaries or fees these men earned were the salaries and fees which were duly and legally voted to them by the shareholders of this company, I would urge that we must take the view that they were entitled to expect continuance of that situation&mdash; putting it at the very lowest&mdash;for another year or so.  We are interrupting that expectation by our legislation and I think we have a duty to provide compensation for them.</P>
      <P>I think the principle is exactly the same as if we were discussing three or four lowly-paid earners.  No matter how low their earnings or emoluments might be, no matter what the position might be, the principle is the same and it does not vary as to the personalities we are discussing.  Therefore, I should like to express my disagreement with what has been urged by a number of Deputies and my support of the provisions of this section as it stands.</P>

      <P>I have no intention of following Deputy Lemass's line.  He assured us that he had no personal interest whatever in this matter, that he was not concerned about the fate of this amendment in so far as it affects the directors.  For one who is entirely disinterested from every point of view, he certainly worked himself into a <Col N="661" /> rather sensational theatrical display last night.  He granted in his best form. He introduced the usual number of red herrings and irrelevancies.  There are one or two points which he made with which I must, however, deal.  He accused me last night of having made a scapegoat of the former chairman.  He accused me of having subjected the former chairman of the company to a campaign of abuse and vilification such as has seldom been seen in this country.  Deputy Lemass knows quite well that that statement was absolutely untrue.  I did not attack the former chairman.  I did not utter any term of abuse of the former chairman.  I did not in any way try to vilify the former chairman.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> He informed him of the very grave situation in which the company was in 1947.  The Deputy will not challenge that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>He informed the Deputy in 1947, very early in 1947, that very heavy losses were inevitable. Deputy Lemass made the case&mdash;it is all so childish that I am not going to deal with it at length&mdash;that it never lost any money until 1948-49.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  The Deputy was approached early in 1947, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, to sanction increased charges to an extent that would enable the company to earn an additional £1,000,000.  He sanctioned them and the charges were increased but notwithstanding that they were increased to a sum estimated to bring in an additional £1,000,000, they lost another £1,000,000 in 1947.</P>

      <P>The Chair is the judge of relevancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will establish the relevancy of this, if the Deputy will allow me.  The Deputy is himself responsible for this and nobody but himself. From the year 1929, Mr. Reynolds <Col N="669" /> was chairman of an omnibus company called the General Omnibus Company, Limited, which was the holder of a road transport licence under the Road Transport Act.  He held this until the 11th November, 1934, on which date the licence and business of the company were compulsorily acquired under the Road Transport Act by the Dublin United Transport Company.  The Deputy will see the link-up with all this in a few moments.  On the 13th January, 1936, Mr. Reynolds was appointed general manager of the transport company and at a later date became a director of the company.  That company was abolished by the Transport Act of 1944, on the 31st December of that year.  On and prior to that date Mr. Reynolds was employed by the transport company under an agreement of the 22nd April, 1941, which provided for a salary of £2,500 per annum free of tax, and provided that on his ceasing to hold office he would be entitled to a pension of an amount determined by the date of his ceasing to hold office.  The material pension provision is that on ceasing to hold office between the years 1943 and 1946 he should be entitled to a pension of £750 per annum.  Prior to the abolition of the company, the board made a decision, on 12th December, 1944, by which the company bound themselves by agreement to pay Mr. Reynolds a pension of £1,029 per annum, this figure being arrived at by grossing the pension of the £750 per annum to make it payable free of tax.</P>
      <P>That particular minute further recites an agreement to commute the life pension of £1,029 and states the capital figure, by reference to certain life tables, at the sum of £16,388. It further recites Mr. Reynolds's wish to be compensated by the company and not under the Transport Act of 1944, and the decision is recorded that he should be paid the capital sum of £16,388.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, 1944, and for approximately two years prior to that, Mr. Reynolds, in addition to his post in the Transport Company as managing director, was chairman of the Great Southern Railways Company at, I understand, a salary of £2,500 per annum.  Both of these posts ceased, <Col N="670" /> of course, on the establishment of Córas Iompair Éireann, January 1st, 1945.</P>
    <P>On 28th December, 1944, the Minister for Industry and Commerce appointed Mr. Reynolds chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann for five years.  Chapter VI of the Transport Act, 1944, provides for compensation for officers and servants of the dissolved companies and Section 43 provides that the managing director of the dissolved company shall be deemed to be an officer of the company. Mr. Reynolds was, therefore, entitled to compensation, which was to be determined on the provisions of the Fifth Schedule to the Act.  That Schedule provided that pensionable service should include service with any former transport company and service (being service which is recognised for the purposes of a superannuation scheme, within Section 44, or an existing superannuation fund) with any former road transport licensee.  The compensation to persons with not less than five years' pensionable service, under Article 3 of the Schedule, was to be an annual sum not exceeding two-thirds of the annual remuneration and emoluments on the date of abolition of office and, subject to that limitation, to be calculated at the rate of 1/60th of such remuneration and emoluments for every year of pensionable service, with an addition thereto of years based on a scale.  In particular, the officer with 20 or more years of pensionable service would get an addition of 10/60ths.</P>
    <P>It appears that Mr. Reynolds asked to have his compensation assessed under these provisions, notwithstanding his prior arrangement with the Dublin United Transport Company and I am informed that his service was calculated as follows: General Omnibus Company&mdash;that is what brings in the 1929 that Deputy Traynor could not understand&mdash;service, 1929 to November, 1934, six years; Dublin United Transport Company service, 13th January, 1936, to 31st December, 1944, nine years; total service, 15 years.  That is to say, his service combined between the General Omnibus Company and the Dublin United Transport Company was 15 years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="671" /> Under Article 1 (2) of the Fifth Schedule to the 1944 Act, pensionable service may be increased by the addition of such number of years as may seem just, where a person was taken into the employment of any former transport undertaker as a specially qualified person at an age exceeding that at which transport service usually began.  I am informed that, under this provision, seven years were added, giving a total service of 22 years. Under the provision above quoted&mdash; that is, where I mentioned earlier about the 20 years&mdash;this would entitle a further 10/60ths to be added, giving a grand total of 32 years' service, and justifying compensation at the rate of 32/60ths of the annual remuneration. It was estimated that the salary of £2,500 per annum free of tax was equivalent to £4,000 per annum and that, accordingly, the annual sum would be 32/60ths of £4,000, which is £2,133 6s. 8d.  It was agreed that this annual payment should be commuted for a capital payment on the same basis as the Dublin United Tramways Company pensions had been commuted. Under the same life tables, the multiple was 15,9265.  The capital sum was therefore 32/60ths of £4,000 by 15.9265, equalling £33,976.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question&mdash; a fair question.  Answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to answer it.  The Deputy ought not to be so impatient.  I understand that, credit against this being given for the sum paid by the Transport Company of £16,388, a balance due of £17,588 was arrived at.  All these calculations were, apparently, made by the manager of the company and submitted to the board meeting.  This is where the board comes in and this is where I establish the relevancy of all this.  On the 10th January, 1945, a few days after their being appointed, the board decided at that meeting to grant the chairman a personal allowance of £4,000 per annum from the 1st January, 1945, not carrying pension rights.  That was <Col N="672" /> in addition, of course, to the £2,500 which had been fixed by the Minister. And further, that the compensation payable as above&mdash;that is, the balance of the £17,000 odd&mdash;should be payable only in the event of the chairman dying or losing his office within ten years of the date of his appointment, that is, his appointment as chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann at £2,500 a year plus the special salary of £4,000 a year voted to him by the directors whom we are discussing here now.  That balance was to be payable only in the event of the chairman dying or losing his office within ten years of the date of his appointment and, in those events, to be payable on a diminishing scale by one-tenth for each year.</P>
      <P>At the general meeting of the company held on the 28th February, 1945, and adjourned to the 7th March, it was proposed that the fees to be payable to the board of directors should be £8,500 and that the directors would determine themselves how that £8,500 should be distributed amongst them. It was agreed at that meeting of the board of directors that £2,500, in addition to the £4,000, would be allocated to the chairman, £1,500 to the gentleman described as the vice-chairman and £900 to each of the other directors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; and, in accordance with the contracts entered into with the former chairman, on the assessments of years and the tables which I have outlined, we found last year, when Mr. Reynolds left the company, that under that arrangement in respect of the £17,976, or whatever it was&mdash;the £16,300 odd had been paid over before &mdash;the unexpired portion of the ten years in respect of that £17,000 to which Mr. Reynolds was entitled under the contract entered into between the company and himself was £10,500 and that £10,500 had to be paid and was legally due to Mr. Reynolds and was paid in addition to the £16,000 odd.</P>

The only argument for the section the Minister attempted was that he was coerced by a precedent in the 1944 Act to insert it here.  I framed the 1944 Act and I am not coerced into voting for it and I do not intend to vote for it, unless the Minister makes a better case for it.  As matters stand now, I will vote against it, if it goes to a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard the Minister about Mr. Reynolds and for the first time this House has got an opportunity of hearing the facts concerning Mr. Reynolds. I am very glad that that opportunity has arisen, because a number of very mean insinuations and half truths have been circulated by Deputies opposite on various occasions concerning him. Mr. Reynolds, as the Minister rightly said, was one of the pioneers in road transport services here.  He founded the General Omnibus Company in partnership with Mr. McCarron whom the Minister recently appointed as chairman of the air company.  The General Omnibus Company was perhaps the most successful of the non-statutory companies that operated at <Col N="676" /> a time when there was no control over the operation of road passenger service and everybody was free to engage in it.  Subsequently legislation was enacted by the Dáil which restricted the right of carrying on road passenger services to the statutory undertakings. Mr. Reynolds, at that stage in his career, first came up against the power of the Legislature.  He had built up, by his energy and the energy of his partner, a very considerable enterprise, a very profitable enterprise, but the Legislature, in what they considered to be the public interest, put him out of business.</P>

      <P>The General Omnibus Company, under the provisions of legislation, was compulsorily acquired by the Dublin United Tramways Company and Mr. Reynolds and his partner, like others, were deprived of that occupation which they had established for themselves.  However, because presumably, he was successful in the management of a road transport undertaking, he was invited by the directors of the Dublin United Tramways Company to become manager of that concern. Deputies, I think, must refresh their memories a little concerning the circumstances of that period.  The Dublin United Tramways Company was a private concern.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We will let the general public decide between myself and Deputy O'Leary on that issue.  The Dublin United Tramways Company was a privately-owned, independent concern, not subject to Government supervision or control and not assisted by the Government by subsidy or in any other way.  They were entitled to appoint whom they liked and to pay him what they liked.  They chose Mr. Reynolds and appointed him their general manager, and subsequently appointed him managing director at a substantial salary.  A salary of £2,500, free of tax, even at the lower rate of tax operating before the war, was a substantial salary.  We are not concerned with that.  That was their business and I think the directors of that concern were always of the opinion that it was a very good appointment for them.  Certainly, in the ten years during which Mr. Reynolds was managing director, that <Col N="678" /> concern was brought from a condition of semi-bankruptcy into a highly profitable state, and that extraordinary improvement in the company's position took place simultaneously with the notable improvement in the conditions of employment of the workers in the concern and a reduction to the public in the cost of transport in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that the Dublin United Tramways Company was a bankrupt institution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It was nearly so when Mr. Reynolds was appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular point we are concerned with here, to meet the clear implications of the Minister's observations, is that Mr. Reynolds's appointment as managing director of the Dublin United Tramways Company was under a contract which provided also for a pension, a pension to be paid to him on his retirement and proportionate to the length of his service.  I do not know if Deputies opposite regard it as an offence for Mr. Reynolds to accept an appointment of that kind involving the payment of a pension on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>You know very well we do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to think so.  When the Dublin United Tramways Company was being absorbed, again under the compulsion of legislation, by Córas Iompair Éireann, one of the matters that had to be settled by the company before it was absorbed was the liquidation of its responsibility to Mr. Reynolds in respect of his pension rights.  Mr. Reynolds's appointment as managing director of that concern had been terminated by legislation and he was entitled to get from the concern the pension which he had earned or the capital sum which would buy a similar pension under a life annuity arrangement. He was also entitled under the terms of the legislation which abolished his employment, which deprived him <Col N="679" /> of his means of livelihood, to compensation calculated in his case on exactly the same basis as that applying to every other employee of that concern who lost his employment in consequence of the enactment of the legislation.</P>
      <P>We have, with the obvious approval of every Deputy in the Dáil, enshrined in this Bill precisely similar terms to deal with the possibility of people being disemployed in consequence of the amalgamation which this Bill will effect.  That compensation for loss of employment to which Mr. Reynolds was entitled and to which every other officer of the company who lost his employment was also entitled, could, under the legislation, either take the form of a pension or of a capital sum sufficient to buy an equivalent pension under a life annuity arrangement.  The Minister has told you that the amount of that capital sum was estimated.  There was deducted from it the equivalent capital sum which Mr. Reynolds had received in discharge of the liability of the Transport Company in respect of pension and there was left a sum of £17,000.  That was the amount of the compensation to which he was entitled because of the abolition of his highly remunerative post as managing director of the Dublin United Tramways Company.  It would be equivalent to a pension of £500 or £600 a year. Mr. Reynolds did not draw it.  Was that fact made particularly clear by the Minister, the fact that Mr. Reynolds did not get that money, that he elected not to take it?  He was, prior to the legislation, asked by the Government to take over the chairmanship of the Great Southern Railways Company because the management of that concern proved unequal to meeting the transport problem occasioned by the war.  I am sure that there is no necessity to remind Deputies that of all the problems that arose for us during the war, the most acute and serious were associated with transport, whether internal transport or external transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of keeping essential internal transport services going during the war without adequate supplies of <Col N="680" /> fuel, without a possibility of replacing worn-out or damaged equipment, in all the well-remembered circumstances of these years was carried by Mr. Reynolds. I know that he does not want thanks for the work he did, but I think it would be ungracious for me, as ex-Minister for Supplies and ex-Minister for Industry and Commerce, with public responsibility during that period, not to say that it could not have been performed without Mr. Reynolds, and I am quite certain also that everybody concerned in the administration of the public transport services will concur in that statement.  However, if any Deputy has any doubts about the opinions that were held of Mr. Reynolds during that period, I will refer him to the Dáil records and the tribute paid to him by the present Minister, by Deputy Davin, by the present Minister for Finance and by many others who now sit on the far side of the House and who certainly were not under any political obligation then to pay any tribute to him.  We asked him to take over as chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann when that concern was established.  Subsequent to his appointment as chairman, as I understand it from the information given to me, the shareholders' directors approached him and asked him to act, not merely as chairman but as the equivalent of managing director.  The Minister said that subsequent to his appointment they voted him a personal allowance.  That is a rather simple way of describing a procedure by which an individual who already carried a very heavy burden of work and responsibility was asked to add to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1943" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>What was he paid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you exactly what he was paid.  He was asked to add to that burden and accept still more work and responsibility during the difficult years of building up what we hoped would be the transport organisation of the future.  They offered to pay him for that and I will tell you what they offered to pay him. They referred to the sum of £17,000, which was due to him because the employment which he had got on his individual merits as managing director of a transport company had been <Col N="681" /> abolished by legislation and which he had not drawn.  It was suggested to him that instead of drawing that sum of money he should take it in salary for this extra work and, in fact, the aggregate amount of money paid to Mr. Reynolds as additional salary for this as managing director during all the years he held that appointment was less than the amount he could have got in one lump sum in 1945 for doing no work at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, even if you leave income-tax out of account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>But if you take income-tax into account, the difference would be much greater because his salary was subject to income-tax and surtax and the lump sum would not have been subject to tax at all.  However, the agreement with Mr. Reynolds was that he should take this additional work and responsibility for a period of ten years and his agreement to forego the compensation to which he was entitled under the 1944 Act was conditional upon his appointment in his new post lasting for ten years.  Therefore, the agreement provided for the gradual disappearence of his claim to this money by so much every year reaching zero in the tenth year.  In fact, as we know, Mr. Reynolds ceased to have any connection with Córas Iompair Éireann after four years.  When the Minister for Finance came to this House and said that the Government had to pay Mr. Reynolds £10,000 to get rid of him, did any Deputy understand from that statement that what, in fact, he was receiving, the £10,000, was what was left of the compensation to which he was legally entitled under the 1944 Act for the abolition of his post as managing director of the Dublin United Tramways Company?  Was there in that phrase an attempt to suggest an avaricious individual holding office under contract and determined to stay in that office despite the wishes of the Government until he was bought out and that he settled for £10,000? Was that not the picture conveyed, the picture it was intended to convey?  I <Col N="682" /> challenge the Minister: is it not true that as soon as it became clear that there was a substantial difference in outlook between himself and Mr. Reynolds as Chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann that Mr. Reynolds said to him: &ldquo;You can have my resignation any time you ask for it,&rdquo; and that he got it when he did ask for it?</P>

It is quite true that you can get men of high ability for these executive positions in State concerns, but you cannot if you are going to permit them to be subjected in this House to the type of attack that was directed against Mr. Reynolds.  I warn those who profess to be interested in the extension of State activity, in public utilities or in any other field, that if they continue these tactics which they started&mdash;Deputy Davin knows his responsibility in that regard&mdash;inevitably a time will come when only the second-raters and the third-raters will be attracted into these executive posts.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what you overrate.  I am only concerned with getting certain facts across.  The Minister said it was not true that the chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann undertook extra duties in acting as a whole-time executive director.  He did, of course.  His original warrant of appointment, which I signed on behalf of the Government, did not oblige him to give his whole time to the affairs of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever time the work of the company required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The work which the position of chairman of the company required, but, over and above that work, he took on the day-to-day executive direction equivalent to the work of a managing director.  As I have said, when one speaks of the salary paid to him in that regard one has to take into account that, in consideration of that salary, he surrendered to the undertaking the pension to which he was entitled under the 1944 Act, or the £17,000 to which the Minister referred, which was the capital equivalent of that pension.</P>
      <P>Now, it is true that, in transport undertakings, salaries in the higher executive posts run considerably higher than it has been the normal practice to establish in the Civil Service.  I would say, as far as Mr. Reynolds was concerned, just this: that, after the establishment of Córas Iompair Éireann, the amount received by him as chairman in the position to which he was appointed by the Government&mdash; plus the amount paid to him by the company because he undertook the extra duties to which I have referred at the invitation of the stockholders' directors&mdash;was no greater than he had been receiving as a private individual before the enactment of legislation and is no higher than is at present being paid in the nearest corresponding position, that which is being paid to the chairman of the Northern Ireland Transport Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies can have any view they like <Col N="684" /> as to the value of an individual's services. I have a very high opinion of the personal capacity of Mr. Reynolds. I know, however, that the heavy burden he carried during all the war years seriously undermined his health, and that towards the end of the period when I was Minister he had on more than one occasion to relinquish his duties and recuperate in hospital. Some Deputies asked yesterday how the term of deputy-chairman arose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am correct in saying from recollection that it arose during these periods of absence of the chairman through illness when the other director of the concern took over the duty of presiding at board meetings. It may be that Mr. Reynolds's health has been so undermined that he could not now attempt to continue to carry the same burden of work and responsibility; but it is rather discreditable to this Parliament and to this country that a man who carried such a heavy burden so successfully should, at the end of his period, relinquish it in the manner in which Mr. Reynolds did.</P>
      <P>There is in this Bill adequate provision for his successor.  I am not objecting to that.  If his successor elects to retire after the Bill is enacted he is guaranteed by legislation a substantial pension.  But Mr. Reynolds is now out of transport in circumstances which closes to him any reentry into the business in which he was an expert without a pension and not a penny compensation paid to him in respect of the termination of his post in Córas Iompair Éireann.  He is not asking for it, and I am not suggesting that he should get it, but I do ask this: that, having given that service and having had that service terminated, he should be allowed to go back into private life without being followed by this vendetta which appears to have no other purpose behind it than a belated attempt to justify the policy of the Government by putting upon his shoulders a blame which is not his.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure every Deputy will have noted that, despite all the attacks that were made upon him and all the <Col N="685" /> statements which were circulated about him, he has not chosen to reply.  He, I know, will not be pleased with me for replying on his behalf here to-day. He is quite satisfied to have given the best service he could to the country in a time of difficulty, and, if a change of Government or some other circumstance denies him the opportunity of giving service in the future, he is quite prepared to stand down, if you let him stand down.

      <P>I did not even consider it relevant to the section.  However, we have had this account of his career in transport, this rather biassed account of his career, given by the Minister.  It was all intended to convery that he was a grasping individual and that he has retired now with the proceeds of several claims to compensation adequately discharged.  He was, it is true, paid a large salary by the United Transport Company.  He was paid no more for rendering the same service to Córas Iompair Éireann.  The pension which he earned in the Transport Company has been met by the grant of a capital sum.  The compensation which he was entitled to because legislation abolished his employment has only been met in part because the total claim was reduced in consequence of the agreement which he made with Córas Iompair Éireann to work for the money instead of drawing it for not working.  He is now out of transport without a pension.  He has now to find some other means of livelihood.  Is there any reason why this campaign against him should be followed to the extent that it is now <Col N="686" /> almost impossible for him to apply his talents in any other direction without those associated with him feeling that they are drawing upon themselves and their enterprises the vindictiveness and hostility of the Government?  The Minister has said his say and I have said my say.  Will we leave it at that? The facts are on the record and that is all I want.  I am prepared to leave it at that if there is general agreement that these attacks upon people who are not here to defend themselves will be discontinued and that we confine ourselves in future to matters which are relevant.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has not challenged the accuracy of the figures or the facts given by the Minister in his carefully prepared statement.  That being so, I would be interested to know whether Deputy Lemass still believes that Mr. Reynolds and his company, that is, the General Omnibus Company, having been bought out lock, stock and barrel under the 1932 Act brought in by Deputy Lemass when Minister should, in addition to getting compensation up to the six-figure mark for his company, also get credit for a five-years' service for pension purposes between 1929 and 1934.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of the 1944 Act relating to calculation of compensation on the loss of employment were not designed for Mr. Reynolds. They are of a general application to every employee of the old Great Southern Railway and of the Dublin <Col N="687" /> United Tramways Company.  It is not my recollection that when the Bill was going through Deputy Davin was trying to reduce the right to compensation and, so far as I know, the provisions were ultimately agreed by the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clearly no answer to my question.  The Minister has read out a carefully prepared statement which Deputy Lemass did not challenge at any period of his speech and, if it is correct, the meaning of it is that the General Omnibus Company was bought out in 1934, lock, stock and barrel, at a six-figure compensation.  I can give the figures.</P>

      <P>I am not going to be brushed aside by that kind of evasive answer.  According to the statement and I know it to be a fact, Mr. Reynolds <Col N="688" /> was in the service of transport in this country from 1929 to 1948, 19 years, and within the meaning of the speech delivered by the Minister from carefully prepared notes and not challenged by Deputy Lemass, he is getting credit for pension purposes for 32 years instead of 19.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to go further into it except to ask Deputy O'Higgins, who did not hear the statement of the Minister before he spoke, and any other Deputies who may agree with him, whether they, in the light of that kind of activity by these directors, would consciously ask the taxpayers to put their hands in their pockets and give sums amounting to £13,000, or £14,000 by way of compensation to the directors who are being provided for under this section. That has to be collected from the taxpayers as part of the £4,000,000 loss which we have asked the taxpayers to find in an Act passed a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>I do not think Deputy O'Higgins, if he had heard the Minister's statement, would have made the <i>ad misericordiam</i> appeal that he made for payment of compensation to these directors.  I agree that he made this case and that there is something in it, but the facts are not similar.  Deputy O'Higgins said that in Deputy Lemass's Act and perhaps in the 1924 Act, which the present Minister for Finance was in charge of, there is a precedent.  But there is no comparison between the conditions under which directors were declared redundant or lost their positions in 1924, under the original amalgamation Act, or under the 1944 Act with the conditions under which these directors are about to disappear.  The directors in those days handed over companies which were fairly well managed; they were not bankrupt.  These are different from the conditions under which these directors are disappearing from office by the will of the majority of Deputies who voted for the Second Reading.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins made the point that he was not sure&mdash;I shall help him to make up his mind finally on that&mdash;whether they were an advisory board or a board with complete power. I shall quote from the Section 83, page 25, of the Report in which Sir James Milne said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There can be no doubt that the wide powers vested in the chairman have largely nullified the authority of the board of directors.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Hon. W. E. Wylie, K.C., vice-chairman of the board, made it clear in his speech to the stockholders on the 28th June, 1948, that while the present chairman had always shown the greatest consideration and courtesy to the other members of the board and all matters of importance were fully discussed and debated, the board was only an advisory board and had to concur in measures in the interest of public policy without regard to the special interest of the stockholders.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Why did not these directors, who thought they were entitled to draw £900 a year, go before the shareholders at the meetings in 1946, 1947, and 1948 and tell that dreadful story which is recorded in that section of the Milne Report; tell the shareholders that they were only &ldquo;yes men&rdquo; without power?  As the Minister stated, they brought a report before their shareholders in one of these years in which they certified, under the signature of their chief executive officer and accountant, that there was a loss amounting to £811,000. Why did they not say then that they had no responsibility to the shareholders for the loss, that it was the chairman-dictator put there by Deputy Lemass who exercised full authority under the powers conferred on him by the 1944 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was one of the Deputies who had to go to the country and fight a general election on this question because Deputy Lemass and his leader, Deputy de Valera, lost their tempers in this House when they were defeated by two votes on the Second Reading of the Transport Bill.  They refused to accept <Col N="690" /> the democratic decision of the majority of Deputies and took the matter to the country.  The only issue between the majority of Deputies in 1944 and Deputy Lemass and his colleagues was the question whether full power should be given to one man.  It is on the records of the House that I stated that if the man concerned, Mr. Reynolds, or any other man, was recommended to the House by the College of Cardinals I would not give him the power which Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass put into his hands on that occasion.  But the people were not allowed to consider the real issues at stake.  Other issues were dragged into the discussions in the country at that election and the Government came back here and, under false pretences, gave to the chairman the dictatorial power which has brought the company to bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>Are Deputies on any side of the House satisfied to give the generous compensation proposed in this section to a body of people who approved of the contents of the document read out by the Minister this evening, knowing that compensation amounting approximately to £14,000 is to be given to professional directors, some of them with ten, 12 and up to 14 directorships? They are going to take that money out of the pockets of the poor taxpayers.</P>
    <P>I refuse to believe, in the light of the information given to the House&mdash; and that is only part of the story&mdash;by the Minister for Industry and Commerce here this evening, that those of you who realise your responsibilities to the taxpayers, after having voted £4,000,000 away because of the inefficiency and incompetence of these gentlemen, are going to add to the bill by giving these generous compensation terms.  I understand from the Minister that there will be a free vote on this matter.  I hope you will vote according to your consciences and cut this section out of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been absolutely bewildered here this evening by the statistics and the facts that were read by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That state of bewilderment was not in any way clarified by <Col N="691" /> Deputy Lemass's defence both of Mr. Reynolds personally and of the statutes that placed Mr. Reynolds in the position he was in.</P>
      <P>I think it will come as news to the people of this country that Mr. Reynolds was appointed as chairman of Córas Iompair Éireann with a salary of £2,500 a year and that he was not expected to do anything else for that £2,500 except to act as chairman.</P>

I think Deputy Lemass was very foolish, when he was carrying the burden of two Ministries during the emergency, that he did not throw them over and go up to Kingsbridge and take a decent job at a decent salary of £6,500.</P>

      <P>It strikes one as strange that a Minister can have all the responsibilities he has, including the burdens that had to be carried by the previous and the present Minister in regard to transport, and yet he is paid only one-third of the salary that the chairman gets, and apparently, even though carrying out the statutory duties of chairman and carrying out the other duties imposed upon him, he is still only part-time, because he an <Col N="692" /> have quite a lot of time to spend in other ways.</P>
      <P>Mr. Reynolds undoubtedly must have been one of the greatest men that this country has produced, one of the cleverest and one of the ablest men that this country has produced, because in 1929, when at that stage certain buses had entered into competition with the Dublin United Tramways Company and the Great Southern Railways, and when it was clear at that time that there must be statutory intervention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To add to the section the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the price of untenanted land acquired or purchased by the Land Commission was determined before the passing of this Act whether by agreement or by the fixing thereof under sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the Land Act, 1923, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) the Land Commission took possession of the land on or after <Col N="698" /> the 1st day of December, 1949, and before the passing of this Act or take possession of the land after the passing of this Act,</P>
    <P>the following provisions shall have effect&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) application may be made to the Land Commission within six months after the passing of this Act for redetermination of the price of the land,</P>
    <P>(ii)  on such application being duly made, the price of the land shall again be determined and shall be determined either by agreement or, in default of agreement, by the fixing of the price (as at the date of the previous determination of the price) under sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the Land Act, 1923, and sub-section (1) of this section,</P>
    <P>(iii) if the price so determined is greater than the price previously determined, it shall have effect in lieu of the latter price.</P>
    <P>(iv) the Land Commission shall, where appropriate, make an additional advance and issue additional land bonds (bearing the same rate of interest as the land bonds already issued or decided to be issued) for the purchase of the land, and thereupon there shall be payable by the Land Commission, to the person entitled to the receipt of the rents and profits of the land immediately before possession thereof was or is taken by the Land Commission, a sum equal to interest (less income-tax) on the additional land bonds so issued from the date on which the land vested in the Land Commission or the date on which the Land Commission obtain possession of the land (whichever is the later) to the date of the issue of the additional land bonds and that sum shall be in lieu of such (if any) interest as may be appropriate under sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Land Act, 1923,</P>
    <P>(v) the agreement or fixing of the price by virtue of this sub-section shall not be regarded for <Col N="699" /> the purposes of sub-section (1) of Section 7 of this Act as having occurred after the passing of this Act.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to make the market value provisions of the Bill applicable to pending cases as well as to future cases.  There are awaiting a certain number of cases in this pending category.  Prices have been settled in most of them.  It is, in short, the limit of retrospection which is possible for many reasons under the Bill.</P>

      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Sub-section (1) of this section shall not apply to any case where the person from whom the land is being acquired is a non-national.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main reason for moving this amendment is that I think it would be absolutely and entirely unfair to ask any Government which has to be so careful and cautious with the taxpayers' money, and to provide all the money essential to pay for the land being acquired, to pay market value to non-nationals, foreigners or any such individuals who have purchased land during the past number of years in this country.  We have, as I have said, plenty of places to put the money of the taxpayers of this country by giving a good reasonable price to the Irishmen and the nationals from whom the Land Commission will be taking over land.  However, I think that in fairness there should be nobody in this House who would for a moment say that it would be just or fair to give <Col N="701" /> to a foreigner or to a non-national of any description the market value for his or her land, as the case may be, and to place such persons on the same footing as our own citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I support Section 5 of this Bill I do so without any enthusiasm.  The reason why I support it is because the Minister has more or less given us the assurance that it will speed up this question of land settlement.  Personally I was quite satisfied with the machinery available up to this in the Land Commission for that particular type of work but I blame the people concerned in the Land Commission for not carrying out the work as quickly as they should have carried it out.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that this new power is necessary and that it is an incentive to give what he calls market value so that a pool of land will be available in a short time.  It is bad enough to have to give market value at all, in the sense in which it is in Section 5, but to give it to foreigners or spivs who came into this country in recent years is, I think, asking too much of this House.  I have no hesitation in supporting this amendment, which was moved by Deputy Commons, that these foreigners be debarred. There is no question about it but that in recent years there was an influx of people from Britain and elsewhere who did not like conditions as they were under the British Labour Government. They thought the best thing they could do was to come over here to this little island and invest their ill-gotten gains in Irish land.  Are we, as the representatives of the Irish people, to pay them market value for something they had no right to in the very beginning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily appreciate Deputy Commons's viewpoint in this connection but I want to assure the House that to adopt this principle would have very serious repercussions in many ways.  While it is pretty evident that none of us receives with open arms non-nationals who purchase land in this country&mdash;that is so, particularly, if it occurs in congested areas or even in the vicinity of congested areas&mdash;there are other factors to be <Col N="702" /> considered.  First, a number of our flesh and blood abroad have purchased property in other countries.  It is an international principle, which has been embodied in Section 3 of the Aliens Act of 1935, that the property of non-nationals will get the same protection in law in this country as that of nationals and citizens of the State.  The very same thing applies to our kith and kin in England, America and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>That is one aspect of it which would have very serious repercussions.  I do not know whether we might not look forward to retaliation if the amendment were adopted.  As the amendment is worded, it also throws into that category our own people who went abroad in former years and acquired American citizenship.  There are quite a few of them my own neighbours and I suppose such people are to be found in every county.  They acquired American citizenship while abroad and have since come home to take up their parents' holdings in this country.  They have never bothered, however, to set right the question of their citizenship.  We have quite a number of these people to contend with.  I would ask the Deputy not to press the amendment principally because of the repercussions it would have abroad.  While saying that, I think it right to say also that I have a certain amount of sympathy with the motives which the Deputy had in moving this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with Deputy Commons in relation to his proposal although I do think the acceptance of it as a principle would be bad.  Nevertheless, every national Government here would need to be very careful to guard against a recrudescence of the system of feudalism such as existed in this country formerly.  There is no comparison between the case of the people who have come here to Ireland in the flight from Moscow and that of our people who have to go to other countries to earn a livelihood.  The Minister for Agriculture proposes to bring in a Fisheries Bill one of these days to deal with fisheries.  There are many important Irish fishing rivers upon which, due to the purchase of farms by rich people <Col N="703" /> from outside, an Irishman cannot cast a fly.  That is relevant only because the land as well as the river is involved. While, as I say in my view the principle enunciated by Deputy Commons is dangerous, I think that any difficulties we can place in the way of certain types of people coming here from abroad, would be very welcome to the people of Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir.  I have listened to the Minister but I am not one of those who will swallow this talk about the repercussions the amendment would have on Irish people who have emigrated.  I would be very slow in moving any such amendment were it not for the terrible necessity that exists to have these lands made available for our own people.  We are faced on the one hand with a flight from this country, principally from the congested districts, and on the other hand with a flight into the country of wealthy people who can afford to buy land. There might be some excuse for asking me to withdraw the amendment if a limit were put on the number of acres or on the valuation of the land that these people are allowed to purchase. As it is, we know that for a number of years past and, up to the present moment, people from abroad can acquire land here without any restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within two miles of my own door, within the last six months, we have had an instance of a wealthy foreigner coming in and depriving the people of that locality of an opportunity of partaking of the wealth that is supposed to be provided by our land.  I think we should be very slow in paying compensation to these people for the land we acquire from them to allow them market value.  They have no right to come into this country and deprive the native population of opportunities which rightly are theirs.  Some time or other this thing will have to be stopped. We shall have to show Prince So-and-So or the Rt. Honourable So-and-So that when they come here to grab the land that rightly belongs to our own <Col N="704" /> people, they will not be allowed the same compensation, if that land is acquired from them at a later stage, as we would give to nationals from whom land is taken.  As I stated at the outset, I do not believe that this amendment is going to have any repercussions abroad but, whether it will or not, my immediate concern is the provision of land as cheaply as possible for people in the congested districts who have been waiting for it for a long time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not quite understand the principle of this limiting amendment as it appears to me to be an amendment very limited in scope&mdash; whether designedly or not I cannot say.  As I understand the amendment, it proposes to deal with the provisions of a previous amendment by the Minister. In other words, it deals with a very limited number of people, who will come in, in what I might call the interregnum period, people whose lands were in the course of acquisition at the end of last year or at the present time. This amendment does not appear to me to be framed to deal with the law as it will exist for all time in the future in reference to the compensation for land compulsorily acquired.  It seems to me that the amendment is designed to deal merely with any individual whose lands are being acquired at the present time, before the Bill becomes law.  I should like to know from the Minister whether there are in fact any such people or whether we are merely shadow-boxing. I do not know whether there are any people, non-nationals, whose lands are in course of acquisition at the present time.  If there are not, this amendment need not occupy the time of the House because it is designed only to deal with people whose lands are in course of acquisition at the passing of the Act.  If Deputy Commons intended this amendment to be written on the Statute Book as part of the law of this country for all time, dealing with the question of compensation for land in future, we could then debate the question of principle, as to whether we are entitled to expropriate people who are non-nationals and at the same time consider the repercussions of that on other <Col N="705" /> people who are also non-nationals but who came to this country to assist in the establishment of industries, etc.  If you are dealing with one section you will have to deal with another.  The way that this amendment is drafted, it is quite clear to me that the amendment solely deals with these people who may be non-nationals and whose land may be in the course of acquisition at the present time.</P>

If we are going to split hairs on this amendment in that way, I am not at all surprised that the Land Commission is stuck where it is and never looks like leaving it.  There is no doubt whatever about this amendment I have put down.  It is as clear as crystal and is intended to <Col N="706" /> be part of this legislation, that in the future as well as from the 1st December, 1949, any land which will be taken over, acquired or resumed, or whatever it is, from non-nationals, they shall not get the market value.

      <P>I did not hear the case for this amendment.  Personally, I would have a great deal of sympathy with any proposal that seeks to restrict the purchase of property here by aliens.  That would apply not only to land, but to residential and business property also.  I believe it is dangerous to allow too great a portion of the national assets to be passing into the hands of outsiders.  I do not think, however, that this is the correct way to deal with this problem.  A more effective way would be to prevent acquisition or to restrict acquisition by some special legislation.  Merely to restrict powers for compensation would be a roundabout way of dealing with the problem.  It might create a good deal of confusion for the Land Commission and perhaps it would cause delay in the acquisition of land.  However, I did not hear the view of those speaking for the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment by Deputy Commons aims to achieve a certain purpose.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with what is at the back of it, but this is not the way to achieve the end he desires.  Apart <Col N="707" /> from repercussions it would have abroad on our own kith and kin who have purchased land and property, notably in the United States and in England, this country&mdash;and any country with an ounce of wisdom&mdash;always seeks to develop the most cordial relations with all its neighbours, just the same as wise individuals do.  It is only a fool who tries to get his claws stuck in everybody, without cause.  One of the principal objections I have is that this seeks to establish a principle here whereby the State may deprive a person, a human being, who is not a national, of his land at a lesser value than another.  No country in the world has sought to do that, except one.  It is a wrong principle and I would not be prepared to support it.  Under it, the State would say: &ldquo;We are going to grab your property for half its value&rdquo; or some figure like that, while the rest of the people, because they are nationals, will be given the full market value.  That would place the State at once in a position where they would have a right to confiscate property. Half price or two-thirds price could be reckoned as being full price for a certain portion of the people and that would mean confiscation of the rest of the value.  I hope I will never see this Dáil establishing that principle.</P>
      <P>There is quite an amount of talk about the fact that non-nationals are coming in here and buying certain farms and holdings.  This amendment is not the way to deal with that question. I am sure the House will agree with me when I say that I am just as serious about this as Deputy Commons or anyone else, but this definitely is not the way to do it.  If I might describe it without going too far, I would say that this amendment, in seeking to stop the abuse or evil, is very much on the level with the Chinaman who burned his house to cook his dinner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I have more knowledge of what the reaction to this would be than the Deputy has.  For that reason.  I assure him that other steps are being taken along the lines that the Deputy desires; but I assure him that this would be a most disastrous way to <Col N="708" /> approach and attack this problem and that it would not achieve the desired end.  First, in order to acquire land of non-nationals, the whole structure of protection which the 1939 Act gives to owners of land who are living on it and working on it would have to be radically altered.  Again, Section 3 of the 1935 Aliens Act would have to be completely repealed.  I know what is in his mind about this question.  The repercussions would be serious, both inside and outside the country, and I would ask him not to press it.  He will get my full sympathy and support in his efforts to achieve his object in some other way.  May I say I am already fairly well advanced with certain inquiries and information along the lines in his mind?  We have not been asleep to it.</P>

      <P>Might I ask if the Minister has something in mind with regard to this point raised by the amendment&mdash;if he is prepared to take steps to see that the purchase of land in this country by foreigners is cut down to the lowest possible limit?  May I take it that the Minister has investigated this and intends to bring proposals before the House in regard to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the object Deputy McQuillan has in mind.  I have just as much sympathy with this problem as the Deputy or anyone else.  I am sure Deputy Moylan knows some of the difficulties attached to it.  It is not as easy as going in and saying that no one but an Irish national shall purchase land.  There is a very serious question here.  There is the question of repercussions abroad.  There is the big principle that we are asking a Department of State to establish the principle of taking land at a reduced price from one person besides another. There must be a method.  While I have nothing concrete to put forward at the moment, there must be some means found of curtailing that evil, because it is quite easy to foresee the danger in it.  It is not very serious yet by any means and I do not think the House should appear to get alarmed about it. The Deputy can be assured that a watchful eye is being kept on the situation.</P>

      <P>So far, we have had from both sides of the House an expression of sympathy with Deputy Commons' amendment.  Deputies on the opposite side said they have sympathy with it.  Deputies on this side have expressed the same feeling.  In other words, they intend, if possible, to another this amendment in sympathy. The attitude of Fianna Fáil to this amendment has been that of caution. I suppose that is due to the fact that they were 16 years hibernating.  The interest of Deputies, especially rural Deputies from the West of Ireland, in the relief of congestion has diminished according to the length of time they have spent in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some of them who have as much sympathy with the amendment as the Deputies opposite.  I do not dispute that.  The Minister has opened a very big problem when he says that we must have regard to the fact that our people have purchased land in America and Britain and that we must watch our position in connection with America and Britain.  That is quite true but Britain and America have not the problem of land settlement that we have to face. That statement of the Minister's would be quite in order in ten years' time when the land problem had been settled fairly satisfactorily, in other words, when congestion had been relieved and the greatest possible number of economic holdings had been established.  That is not the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have rural slums in which our young people find it impossible to make a living.  They have to emigrate and, possibly, at a later stage, buy land in America.  It is only right that we should safeguard their interests and see that they are provided with land at home in the first place.  The cautious atmosphere that the Minister has created will not frighten me into opposing this amendment.  I am concerned with congested areas in my own constituency and have seen the congestion <Col N="710" /> that exists in other areas in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>In getting away with the section in regard to market value, the Minister has achieved more than he ever hoped to achieve before he became a Minister. It is going a bit too far to suggest that that should apply to foreigners&mdash;&ldquo;opportunists&rdquo; is perhaps the word I should use to describe them &mdash;who have bought up land, especially in the last few years.  Are the Irish people to pay an exorbitant price to buy out foreigners or non-nationals who bought land here because they saw a chance of making money?  That is the principle I see in it.  Are we going to ask the Irish people, who are badly in need of land, to pay an inflated price to foreigners for land they secured under false pretences?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Not an inflated price. That is an exaggeration.  The Bill provides that market value will be paid. The Bill does not say &ldquo;market price&rdquo;. As I have said, &ldquo;non-nationals&rdquo; includes our own Irish-born kith and kin who have gone to the States or to England and who have lost their Irish citizenship and have become American or British citizens.  The amendment would preclude, for instance, Deputy McQuillan's brother, or my brother, if he were now an American citizen, from coming home and purchasing land here because, unless he takes out Irish citizenship, if the Land Commission decide to take up his land, he will not get the same fair play or the same price as his neighbour, who is an Irish citizen, will get.  We know the principle behind the amendment.  It has been hastily worded, without proper regard to many things. I could not possibly stand over acceptance of an amendment which asks the State to discriminate between people and to give market value to Irish nationals and to take a non-national's property from him even though he might be our own flesh and blood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission has ample power to acquire any farm because, while a non-national who buys a farm here has the protection of the State the same as a national, he must also conform to the laws laid down by this House.  If the Land Commission have the right to acquire land from a <Col N="711" /> national, they also have power to acquire the non-national's farm if it is useful for their purposes.  They have done so and will do so in future, if the land suits them, if it comes within the scope of the Land Acts.  This amendment is not the way in which to approach the problem that it is designed to solve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  If the proposed differentiation in price has suddenly become so abhorrent to the Minister, the Land Commission and some Deputies, how is it that the same thing has been carried out for 25 or 30 years in regard to the acquisition and resumption of land?  There has been a vast difference in price there for a long number of years.</P>

      <P>This may not be such a horrible and criminal amendment. The Minister should know better than I do that the stamp duty charged by the Revenue Commissioners in regard to the purchase of property is much greater in the case of aliens than in the case of nationals.  One Government Department seem to think that it is perfectly right to make the non-national pay more.  Another Government Department seem to think that it is a horrible proposition that they cannot stand over.</P>

      <P>There was a bad example set in this House some years ago when the Constitution, which is declared to be binding upon us, was violated twice in rapid succession by the steam roller majority of the then Government.  Fortunately, the courts intervened to check them.  I want the House to pause a moment and to show that respect for the fundamental law of the country to which it is entitled.  It would be a pity if Oireachtas Eireann acquired the habit of attempting to drive a coach and four through our own Constitution.  We need not fear that they will succeed, because the courts are there to check them, if they try, but that should not reduce our vigilance to avoid the undesirable appearance of indifference to the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I think, and I do not set up to be a constitutional lawyer, that the Constitution provides, in the section relating to property, that all persons under the protection of our institutions shall be treated equally before the law.  Our Constitution provides that all persons under the protection of our institutions shall have a guarantee that in regard to his fundamental rights there will not be one law for Billy and another law for Jack.  There is no more fundamental right, according to the way in which the majority of us in Ireland look at things, than the right to own private property.  The right to acquire property is quite another thing.</P>

You may lay down, I think, legitimately, that a national shall have facilities and freedom to create rights in himself in respect of property in his own country <Col N="713" /> which you are slow to give to a stranger.  You may lay down, I think, legitimately, that you want guarantees and even greater value from an alien if he wants to acquire property, because, when he has acquired property in Ireland, he has thereby vested himself in the privileges conferred on all persons by our Constitution, which says that, in respect of their fundamental rights, they shall be equal before the law.</P>
      <P>Any man who owns property in this country has, to the way of thinking of the vast majority of our people, a fundamental right and let not Oireachtas Eireann forget that over a wide part of the earth's surface there are people trying to establish the doctrine that there is no such right as the right to own private property.  I think the Minister for Lands has wisely said in a matter of this kind: &ldquo;Let every man in the House do as he pleases.&rdquo; That is the ideal arrangement in any deliberative assembly.

Whatever the arguments may have been before the decision is taken, one citizen should vie with another in his desire to show respect for the established institutions of the community to which he belongs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is designed to set up one basis of compensation for Billy and another for Jack. The fundamental law of this country says that, whether a man is rich or poor, great or humble, native or stranger, when he is under the protection of our law, whatever may be his fate in his own country, he will be treated under Irish law in accordance with the tenets of justice and equity. Where is the justice and equity of taking a stranger's property and denying him its value if you take identical property from his neighbour who is a citizen of this State and give him its full value?  Millions of our people have in their time been strangers in a strange land and they have had abundant cause to thank God that the land they went to had a Constitution and that however humble they were, however insignificant, if anyone in the United States of America dared to treat them differently before the law from the most venerable family in America there were judges there to see, whatever injustice prevailed under British dispensations in Ireland whence such a man came, now that he was in America he was entitled to precisely the same treatment under the law as the President of the United States.  I hope to God that a people who have thanked God for that haven of refuge and freedom in their day will not so far disgrace themselves in respect of this matter as to say: &ldquo;Having thanked God for that freedom, that justice and that equity when we were down-trodden and poor, we will deny it to strangers who come to live in our midst.&rdquo;  Whether they are rich or poor, great or humble, before the law of Ireland they are all the same.</P>

I do not know whether the Minister for Agriculture had anything to explain to the House or to Deputies Commons and McQuillan as to what the Government intends to do to stop land being bought up by foreigners.</P>

      <P>As I said at the beginning, it amuses me somewhat to see the Leaders of the Front Government Bench reaping the whirlwind they have sown.

If they had horns it would not be hard to hurt him, but they do <Col N="719" /> not mean to use any horns.  Deputy Commons is putting himself into the position in which he can go down to Mayo and say: &ldquo;Oh, I objected to this man getting the benefits of this Land Act, but I will take jolly good care to keep the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture in their positions.&rdquo;</P>

I would rather be out for the rest of my life than to be in a Government and be kept on the Government Front Bench by people who completely disagreed with my policy, or be like the Deputy who had to go down to O'Connell Street the other day and say that he voted against his conscience when he voted for the abolition of the bus depôt in Store Street.</P>
      <P>To come back to the amendment, the Minister for Agriculture concludes that every man in this House should do as he pleases on it.  He is not prepared either to make this an issue.  He says it is a breach of the fundamental law of the land.  He is quite prepared to let his supporters take a crack at the fundamental law of the land in this regard.  Indeed, there are a lot of other friends of certain members of the Government who are allowed to take a crack at the fundamental law and of the forces of law and order.</P>

If Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Commons had been really in earnest in this regard they could have secured that their amendment was put into the Land Bill before it appeared in this House.  They are only coming in here now to kick up a little bit of a row so that Deputy Commons can go down and quote that in Mayo.  But he does not really mean to go through with the amendment.  He will not make an issue of it.  Will the Minister for <Col N="720" /> Lands explain to the House what is his alternative to the amendment of Deputy Commons and Deputy McQuillan? What is he going to introduce, and what schemes have the Government in hand, which he promised would see the light of day before long, for dealing with the problem which was referred to by Deputy Commons?  Will the Minister answer that question?</P>

What I would not like to see happen in the House is that Deputies should abuse their privileges and so bring untold suffering on their constituents in the country by downright blackguardism.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  I am sorry, and I withdraw the expression. This Government has brought in several measures, including this Land Bill, to try and benefit the people who are our own flesh and blood.  The people up and down the country are suffering and labouring under many grievances.  I do not mind active opposition or active criticism of any measure provided the criticism is not designed solely and specifically to obstruct the passage of a Bill through sheer downright fear that the Government will reap kudos of the good things in the Bill.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what is being carried out here.  I cannot prevent any man abusing his privileges in the House by delaying a measure of this kind.  The only weapon that is left to me is to go outside this House and tell the people the work that is going on here.  The electors will deal with those people in due time when they have to go before them.</P>
      <P>The Opposition cannot understand why Deputy Commons or any member of a Party supporting the Government should put down an amendment to this Bill.  Deputy Commons and every Deputy supporting the Government has a perfect right to put down amendments and will not be influenced or tampered with to keep awkward amendments off the Order Paper.  I am proud of Deputy Commons for putting down such an amendment.  I never spoke to him about or interfered with him in regard to this amendment.  I never tried to have it withdrawn.  I hope that any Party who has that method of legislating will never sit down on this side of the House again.  Deputy Commons suffers from this disability from the Fianna Fáil point of view, that he is not a &ldquo;yes-man.&rdquo;  I think ten times more about him for that.  He has as much right to put his views on the amendment before the House as I have to tell him and the House exactly why that amendment would be injurious if passed into law.  That is one of the freedoms which we on this side of the House have got from the people and we mean to do our best to hold it for the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> Deputy Aiken has strayed into a different field altogether.  He misquoted me as saying that the purchase of land by foreigners was only a trifling thing. What I said was that a very close eye was being kept on that particular matter.  If it is as trifling as Deputy Aiken said I stated it was, he need not worry about it.  I know the game Deputy Aiken is trying to play.  I know exactly the repercussions this amendment will have if passed into law.  If Deputy Commons's amendment is put, Deputy Aiken will have to come out into the open and say whether he supports the amendment or not and we will see which Lobby he shall go into. I do not believe in a machined or dragooned majority in this House.</P>

      <P>Very good.  So far as I am concerned, I intend to allow any Deputy to vote as he wishes on this amendment and I know that we can always rely on the majority of the House deciding on this or any other amendment in the right way and in the best interests of the country.  Perhaps Deputy Aiken has something to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak until I heard Deputy Aiken's remarks.  I should like to find out what he means exactly when he says that Deputy Commons, if he were really sincere about the amendment, would have gone to the Minister and had it inserted in the Bill.  As a new Deputy, I understood that when legislation came before the House it was my right as a Deputy, as I think it is the right of Deputy Commons or any other Deputy, to put down an amendment in order to improve it according to my rights if I feel myself capable of improving it.  Deputy Aiken suggested by his remarks that no such right exists for a private Deputy and it is quite plain that there was no such right for any member of the Fianna Fáil Party for 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Aiken said that Deputy Commons and myself were concerned <Col N="723" /> with this amendment purely for the purpose of making political capital down the country.  That is untrue.  I think it is the right of every Deputy to introduce an amendment to any Bill if he feels that way inclined.  I merely remark that the habit was not practised by the Fianna Fáil Party for a number of years because, like well-trained lap dogs, at the crack of the Party whip they did what they were told.  So long as I am on this side of the House, if I feel like opposing any Bill I shall do so and I will not be deterred by Fianna Fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not pursue that line.  I will come to the remarks of the Minister for Agriculture.  As I said, I will not be prevented from saying what I like in this House by Fianna Fáil or anybody on this side of the House.  I bow to the ruling of the Chair, however.  The remark was made by the Minister for Agriculture in connection with the American Constitution that people over there had their rights in connection with property and land.  Nobody denies that.  But such a statement from the Minister for Agriculture would give the impression that we had vast prairies in Ireland like they have in America and that all that people had to do was to come to Ireland; that there were the plains of Kildare, Meath and Westmeath and, if a foreigner felt like purchasing land, all he had to do was to buy it and he would get the same privileges as the <Col N="725" /> people in Ireland who for generations have been looking for a decent holding. Evidently the Minister for Agriculture is making a comparison between this country and America as if we both had the same amount of land available for the relief of congestion.</P>
      <P>This particular section, if it is passed, will prevent or, if you like, save the Irish people from paying to foreigners an increased price for land that they have no right to get.  Again, at the risk of repetition, I want to say that so far as I am concerned I do not see any earthly reason why people who came over here from England and who made fortunes there during the war by various means should, under this Bill, get away with something they are not entitled to.  That is the reason I am going to support this amendment.</P>

The Minister said that while he agreed that the end sought by Deputy Commons in the amendment was a desirable one, this was not the method by which it should be pursued, and he indicated that he was pursuing that end by a more effective method.  He said he had given the matter a good deal of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to emphasise that we are, and <Col N="726" /> must be, opposed to the principle embodied in the amendment.  It cannot be otherwise.  But the fact that it is moved does show that there is a certain difficulty and a certain resentment that the Government must take cognisance of.  Not merely in Ireland but down through the history of England there have been revolutionary tactics directed against the influx of foreigners into England, and with very grave results&mdash;for the foreigners.  It is a natural and a human thing that there should be resentment by people like Deputy Commons towards foreigners who purchase land in his district, but we must agree that anybody coming to live in Ireland, purchasing or owning property in Ireland, is equal with all others before the law.  We cannot get past that principle.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a while ago, and I mention it again because the Minister for Agriculture is here, that the Minister for Agriculture knows what tremendous value there is in inland fisheries.  They can be developed to an amazing extent, I believe.  But, if they are to be developed successfully, the Irish people must get their due and adequate share of the profits.</P>

Apart from that, I would remind Deputy McQuillan and Deputy Commons of this fact, that, taking their own constituencies, there are, unfortunately&mdash;and I am certain of this&mdash; many kinsmen, constituents of theirs, living, working and carrying on business in a country not so far away from this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I think it is a matter of considerable importance and considerable significance and that it should not be lightly proposed here.  I think that the provision would be unconstitutional, contrary to the recognised guarantees given under our Constitution.  Even if it were not, even if this Parliament were in the position of the British Parliament, entitled to pass any law it wished, it would be an unwise thing to do by reason of the consequences it might entail for our people abroad.  I suggest to those Deputies that the matter mentioned by Deputy Moylan is one which must be the concern of the Government, not merely with regard to land but with regard to other matters, and it could be safely left at that.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned, I was dealing with the section in this Bill which proposes to make payments exceeding £10,000 to directors of Córas Iompair Eireann.  I was endeavouring to make the point that the compensation provided in this section for the stockholder directors is both unwise and unnecessary.  It is compensation to which serious objection will be taken by the people as a whole.  One of these directors, who described himself as a deputy-chairman, would be entitled under this Bill, if it passed into law, to a sum of £3,000.  As far as I am concerned, under no circumstances could I vote for the payment of £3,000 to that particular individual.  I was ruled out of order when I endeavoured to deal with the history of that particular individual and his activities against national progress.  I remember an incident that took place in the year 1921.</P>

      <P>I will not refer to it. I hope that this Dáil will say, by vote, on this particular section that no adequate reason has been advanced by the Minister for the payment of these sums in compensation.  I expect the majority of the Deputies, at any rate, to vote against the provisions of this section.  It is regrettable that the discussion on the section has led to a discussion on the past chairman.  The Minister has given his point of view. Deputy Lemass has made what might be described as a defence of the chairman. I have given what might be described as a critical analysis of the two points of view.  I think we might leave the matter there and concentrate entirely on the provisions of the section. We should make up our minds once and for all that if this section is passed into law, the general public will be outraged in being asked to provide compensation amounting to over £10,000 for people who might in the ordinary way lose office by the votes of the shareholders, people who had no security in office except for the number of shares they themselves held and who often obtained their appointments as directors by virtue of their control over shares which were in the hands of the banks and were made available to them by the banks.  I ask the House to reject this section and to show clearly that, as far as this House and the country is concerned, services properly rendered <Col N="730" /> will receive reward and consideration but that services of this type merit no reward, justify no consideration and certainly should not inflict any financial burden on the taxpayers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night on this particular section that I found myself in something of a dilemma.  I had not made up my mind then as to whether or not the section was one which should be supported. Generally speaking, I felt the section should be supported.  The principle of compensating people from whom an office of profit is taken by legislation should be accepted.  I still feel exactly the same way about it.  I am sorry to say that I do not think the discussion in the House on this section has assisted me very materially to make up my mind on the question.  I think that as a matter of principle this section or some similar section should be included in the Bill and should be enacted by the House.  I am somewhat troubled as to whether or not the amount of compensation or the basis of assessment of the compensation is fair, having regard to all points of view and particularly as to whether or not it is fair to the people.  After all, it is the ordinary taxpayers who will be called upon to pay this compensation ultimately and I am not at all sure that the two years, 1948 and 1949, are not too much and that the Minister should not limit it to possibly one year's fees.  However, on the general principle, my mind is still the same.  I think the section should be passed.  I think the principle of compensating people who could and, I think, would reasonably have expected to continue in those offices if there were no interference from the Legislature, should be maintained.  There is precedent for that and no matter how Deputies of the House may feel with regard to the particular individuals or with regard to the work which they did or which it is alleged they left undone, nevertheless I think there was a precedent and a principle and that both the precedent and the principle should be upheld in passing this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know if it would be possible or if the Minister has considered whether or not some limitation <Col N="731" /> of the section might not meet with general approval in the House.  Would it be possible at this stage or at a later stage to consider the amount of compensation and to amend the section if the House feels that the principle should be upheld but that the compensation is too much?  I know that Deputy Cowan put forward last night the point of view that the principle should be upheld but that the amount of compensation should be purely nominal.  I do not agree with that point of view, but at the same time I am not entirely satisfied that the amount which the directors would get and which has been mentioned by the Minister is not somewhat too high.  Consequently, we are up against the situation that all the complaints and all the attacks here to-day and yesterday evening were directed against the directors of Córas Iompair Eireann.  No one has suggested that the directors of the Grand Canal Company should be made to suffer by the deletion of this section from the Bill.  Nevertheless, that result would ensue from a defeat of this section by the House.  Whether or not the Minister might rectify that, if those events should come to pass, I do not know.  The cold fact of the matter&mdash; and it is on this that the Deputies must adjudicate now&mdash;is that the Grand Canal Company is included and coupled with Córas Iompair Eireann in this particular section.  If the section goes out then both the directors of Córas Iompair Eireann and the directors of the Grand Canal Company are equally affected by it.  In the case of the Grand Canal Company it is true to say that the amount of fees drawn by the directors in the years in question, 1948 and 1949, were very considerably less than those drawn by the Córas Iompair Eireann directors.  Consequently, the maximum amount of compensation which they could get is again very considerably less than the maximum which could be secured by the directors of Córas Iompair Eireann.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowan said that this section was unwise, unnecessary, and that it would be objected to by the vast majority of the people.  I think he is probably right in the last portion of that sentence.  I think it is true to say <Col N="732" /> that if this section is passed it will to that extent&mdash;to the extent that this section is included in the Bill&mdash;be an unpopular measure.  I think it is true to say that the ordinary man in the street would feel, without going into the matter very considerably, that this section should be deleted and that there should be no compensation paid to the directors of Córas Iompair Eireann.  It is a moot point as to whether or not we are discharging our responsibilities in this House by accepting a particular line of action, whether it is right or wrong, just because that line of action would be the popular line and because the contrary would be unpopular.  It may be argued, and possibly argued quite reasonably, that our function as Deputies in this House is to represent the prevailing opinion amongst those who put us into this House, even if that opinion is arrived at without considering the facts and the various factors involved very closely, or, on the other hand, that it is our duty, as their representatives, to examine these matters on their behalf&mdash;to weigh up for ourselves all the arguments, all the pros and cons, and then, on their behalf, to come to a decision.  I think it would be stretching the theory of representation a little bit too far, so far, indeed, that the elastic might snap a little occasionally, if we were to adopt the viewpoint that whenever either a wave of sentiment or indignation should surge over the people whom we represent we should be carried away by that without giving a thorough examination to the matters involved.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Cowan is right in saying that this section will be objected to by people outside.  I have given the matter very considerable thought, even since he made that remark.  Even though that is so and even though I believe that the vast majority of the people in my constituency will object to this provision, nevertheless I cannot help feeling that I would not be discharging my duties as a Deputy of the House or my duties to those whom I represent if I did not give the matter rather more examination and rather more careful examination because of that particular situation and because I know that they have not got the same <Col N="733" /> opportunities of examining all the factors involved and the question of principle involved as we have.  I know that they have not the same opportunity of doing it as we have of doing it on their behalf.  Consequently, having given the matter, as I say, considerable thought, I do not propose to oppose this section. I have not quite decided whether or not I will support it but I rather think I will.</P>

      <P>When, last night, I indicated opposition to the section and asked for information from the Minister on the grounds on which he felt the section was justified, I did not expect that the discussion would have been quite so broad.  Maybe it has served its purpose.  So far as I am concerned, I have no doubt as to my own personal feeling in the matter and I am prepared to express it as definitely as possible.  At the same time, I was interested to learn how and in what way the House as a whole could justify the inclusion of the section and the way in which many who had spoken in the most critical manner of Córas Iompair Eireann during the past two years, could equally find it possible to justify this particular proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two matters we can deal with.  One is the question of principle in regard to compensation for directors; the other is the question of compensation for the particular group of directors referred to in the section. It is interesting to note that out of the whole House only two Deputies have got up to defend the section, both in respect of the principle and its application to these particular cases.  Frankly, I do not see any principle involved at all.  However, the case that is made in respect to principle answers itself.  If directors are in fact representatives of the shareholders, then it seems to me the responsibility for expressing appreciation of their services and compensating these directors for any loss of office involving profit is the responsibility of the shareholders as such, especially when we consider what the actual work of a director is.  A director is not a person who is engaged in the day-to-day management of a company. He attends a meeting possibly once a <Col N="734" /> week, once a fortnight or once a month.  His one concern is specifically to protect and further the interests of the shareholders and to the extent to which he discharges that duty efficiently, he is fulfilling the duties imposed on him by the shareholders and it is to the shareholders he should look for appreciation of his services in whatever form it may be thought suitable to express such appreciation.</P>
    <P>There is the other factor, bringing the thing somewhat nearer home&mdash;that is, the treatment accorded to directors as against other persons affected by legislation or the winding up of companies. The case is made that because we make provision for compensation in the form of superannuation for officers and servants of such companies, we are under the same obligation in regard to the directors.  It always surprises me how many of us are so free to apply principles to those who are in no need of protection and to forget those who should have the first claim on our sympathy and interest.  Here we have, in the case of Córas Iompair Eireann, a group of directors&mdash;and I am not now discussing the question of whether they discharged their functions efficiently or not&mdash;and to those directors we propose to guarantee&mdash;mark you, guarantee&mdash; the payment of a lump sum equal to the amount of the directors' fees for two years.  Yet in this country during the last 20 or 25 years we have had a continuous spate of legislation dealing with transport problems.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are connected with the working-class side of the problem are aware that within the period from 1924 to 1933, thousands of railway men whose sole means of livelihood consisted of their employment with the railway company, and whose sole guarantee of being able to provide for themselves and their family consisted of that employment, were given no such guarantee as is given here.  Instead they were told to go before an arbitrator to argue their case and it depended on the decision of the arbitrator whether they were to obtain compensation or not.  We apparently deal much more tenderly with the directors.</P>
    <P>In the case of the workmen, they have nothing to fall back upon.  It has <Col N="735" /> been already pointed out that with this group of directors, this question of directorship is purely a pastime.  I do not think they take it seriously themselves. It has been pointed out that, in one or two cases, we are dealing with gentlemen who to the public knowledge hold 14 to 16 directorships and whose position of affluence and security is second to none in this country.  Yet, we are so concerned for their possible loss of an office involving profits, that not merely must we give to them the kind of terms we provided in earlier legislation for the unfortunate wage-earners, but we have got to give them a cast-iron guarantee of statutory powers to protect them.  Deputy Davin reminds me that, in the goodness of our heart, we so drafted the provisions under which an arbitrator has to consider applications by workmen for compensation that, nevertheless, many thousands of the workers lost their claims under these provisions.</P>
    <P>After all, when we are dealing with precedents there should be some consistency, and consistency should be applied to the most humble and the low-liest-paid worker as well as to the highly-salaried director.  Any obligation imposed on the directors was an obligation to preserve and safeguard the interests of the shareholders rather than those of any other section of the community or any section engaged in the carrying on of the undertaking.  It seems to me from the point of view of principle that any token of appreciation of the services of the directors, should come from amongst those whose interests had been protected by the directors, namely, the shareholders.  In the case of Córas Iompair Eireann it seems to me that there is general agreement that the shareholders had been treated in the most generous fashion, and, out of that generous treatment provided for them, they can quite well afford, if they feel disposed to do so, to express their appreciation of the services of their directors.</P>
    <P>So far as the Grand Canal Company is concerned, it is not correct to say that nobody has suggested that this payment to the directors of that concern should not be given and that <Col N="736" /> therefore it would be unfair to suggest that this section should be deleted.  I am equally opposed to any provision being made for the directors of the Grand Canal Company.  I am on even more solid ground there because the Grand Canal Company has got a certain history.  Many of these directors of that board have been associated over a long number of years with a policy under which the payment of directors' fees was a prior charge before the payment of a living wage to the workers of the company.  When we have statements publicly made at the Labour Court by a representative of the Grand Canal Company, that he is not prepared to give any answer to an application for a modest adjustment in the wages of the workers and when in the same year, the directors' fees are paid, then I think the directors of both these companies are gentlemen who do not require any protection from us either on the ground of principle or precedent and we should oppose the section from that point of view.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the question that has arisen relates to the history of Córas Iompair Eireann.  The Minister when asked as to his position in this matter was very frank.  He said that he had felt under certain pressure from the point of view of procedure, in embodying a section like this in the Bill but equally he had felt under no obligation to defend the section or to press Deputies to support it.  He had embodied the section in the Bill, he would take responsibility for it and he would vote for it in an effort to have it accepted but the responsibility for it must be accepted by each individual member who voted for it.  I can see nothing wrong in that.  In the whole course of the discussion, the Minister has taken the attitude that we are trying here to deal with a transport problem, that even though it may have a political background, it nevertheless is a common problem for all sides of the House and he was willing as far as possible, to accept the general guidance of the House and not to seek to impose rigid Party decisions.  I think he has followed that attitude very consistently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to some of the major sections of the Bill, we have had, first of all, the original proposals in the Bill, then we had amendments submitted by the Minister, as he thought in response to the expressions of opinion from various sides of the House, which drastically altered the framework of the Bill; and when these amendments were considered later by the House, he again accepted the viewpoint of the House and made further alterations.  I think that is an admirable approach to a matter like this.  I know it was done on other occasions&mdash;very rare, I may say&mdash;by Deputy Lemass when he was Minister; and when he did so we gave credit for it.  I see nothing wrong in that principle.</P>
      <P>So far as the question of Córas Iompair Éireann directors is concerned, I feel that we are trying to see our way through a smoke cloud.  The interesting thing I find is that we have had here, starting last night, a very excitable defence presented by Deputy Lemass and at the same time an attack.  Whom is he defending?  Not Mr. Reynolds, not the directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, but Deputy Lemass&mdash;because as Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1932 the national responsibility, so far as the Department is responsible, rested upon his shoulders.  It is not a question that we have had a transport problem grow up overnight, or even grow up since 1940 or 1941.  The transport problem has been with us as far back as 1917.  I am not going to blame him for those mistakes, for not being any more foresighted than anyone else.  The problem was there.  From 1932 on, he proceeded to deal with that problem step by step until we reached the culmination in the 1944 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as the former chairman, Mr. Reynolds, is concerned, I do not want to make any comment at all. He has retired from the scene.  He has received his lump sum by way of commutation of his pension rights.  I have no objection to his retiring to peaceful retirement and enjoying it. <Col N="738" /> However, it would be much more honest of us, when we are discussing the activities or the failures of Mr. Reynolds, to say we are in effect discussing a transport problem which has been evolved gradually by Deputy Lemass over the years, and in respect of which Mr. Reynolds was merely the front or the covering.  I have not got the same degree of admiration or respect for Mr. Reynolds that Deputy Lemass has.  We had a situation in which, starting from 1932 and associated with the political régime in this country, we had gradually built up a framework and atmosphere in regard to transport that finally had its logical outcome in the 1944 Act.  I suggest, that, with the framework that was laid there, the groundwork that was provided, any ordinary average individual with any knowledge of transport could have reached to the same position as Mr. Reynolds.  When the Dublin United Transport Company was given the monopoly, there was no reason in the world why that company should not be successful.  When that company, with its ability to milk the large mass of the population of Dublin, was then merged with Córas Iompair Éireann, there was no reason why that should not improve the fortunes of Córas Iompair Éireann.  Everyone was aware of what was happening.  In 1943-44, when the Transport Act was going through the Dáil, members will recall that the Dublin Deputies, almost from every Party, resisted violently&mdash;in some cases to the point of vote and in some cases to the point of vocal expression&mdash;the merging of that Dublin concern with Córas Iompair Éireann.  The explanation was that it was necessary in order to place some sound financial basis under the transport system.  Everything that happened was of such a nature that, when the decision was taken and started to operate, whoever was in the leading position in regard to transport in the country automatically must get the credit for it.</P>
    <P>The weakness I see in the matter&mdash; and I still think the weakness exists even to-day and will exist after this Bill is passed&mdash;is that we were trying to deal with our transport on a patchwork basis, and for political considerations <Col N="739" /> we have been deliberately avoiding a certain problem.  We are still avoiding the problem even now, but sooner or later the problem will have to be faced up to, that is, the problem of whether or not we are going to treat transport as a service and take the decisions that flow from that.  We are continuing to defer that decision, but no matter what machinery we may evolve, that problem will still face us.  That is why, from that point of view and without commenting on the former chairman&mdash;I am not very much concerned with him as an individual but merely as a representative of policy&mdash;I say it is a question of exercising powers that were evolved by Deputy Lemass during the time of his Ministerial position, handing over those powers to the new machine created and the machine automatically ticking over.  Even in the period of the emergency, I wish to say quite frankly that whatever success was achieved in keeping transport on the move at that critical time, the greater credit should be given to Deputy Lemass than to anyone in Córas Iompair Éireann.  It is for that reason I am surprised that Deputy Lemass is running away from the position he himself has taken up. He is accusing the Minister of refusing to stand his ground and he is running away on this section.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that it is Deputy Lemass who is running away?  For over two years, both in the House here and outside, we have listened to Deputy Lemass making very skilful and very carefully established, and at times very excitable, explanations of and defence of Córas Iompair Éireann and the leading personalities in it.  I do not object to him doing that.  After all, it is his conviction and he is entitled to it.  But if he takes the view &mdash;as he has indicated on a number of occasions within the last two or three days&mdash;that up to a certain point Córas Iompair Éireann was a successfully run concern and that when they ceased to be a successful concern and started to run into heavy deficits and finally reached losses of £1,000,000 and more in a year, that particular point is marked by the coming into office of the present Minister, then he should <Col N="740" /> have the courage to stand by the people he is defending and stand by them in this Vote.  If those directors did their job to the best of their ability, with the powers given to them under the 1944 Act, if they carried on Córas Iompair Éireann under great difficulties during the emergency, with difficult weather conditions, lack of coal and so on, and if they did succeed, as he maintains, up to a certain point in doing their job, then I say that, apart altogether from whether he is convinced there is a question of principle or precedent involved he has the moral obligation to record his belief in their freedom from responsibility for the present failure, by supporting the retention of this section in the Bill.  If he does not do so, not only personally but with the support of his Party, then it is he who is running away and not the Minister.</P>
    <P>I listened last night to Deputy Lemass and was quite satisfied at that time that we were going to see a position in which he would definitely take the view that the attacks made upon these directors were unjustified, were not only based on false premises but were formulated from a prejudiced point of view, and that the attitude of this House towards those directors should be to grant to them the form or type of compensation they were entitled to as gentlemen who had discharged their duties in a proper and efficient manner, within the limits allowed them by the Act of 1944.  To-day, we suddenly find a complete change.  He does not mind what happens to the directors.  The Minister can have the section in or take it out, he can have a vote or no vote.  Deputy Lemass does not mind.  All he is concerned to find out is, whether or not, as he says, the Minister is going to stand his ground or run away.  The final outcome to Deputy Lemass's speech, to my way of looking at it, is that the person running away is Deputy Lemass himself.</P>
    <P>I do not mind in the least if this House passes this section.  It is quite entitled to do that.  I personally am going to oppose it and vote against it. But I personally believe that, if I had adopted the stand taken by Deputy Lemass and his Party, not merely <Col N="741" /> since 1948 but since 1944, if I had behind me the record of having introduced the Act of 1944 to the Dáil and forced it through at the expense of a general election, coming back to this House and carrying the Act on to the Statute Book after that election, if I had the responsibility of the Minister adminstering that Act, making the appointments, and then, over a period of two years, seeking to explain the result of the working of that Act, seeking to defend the man whom I had appointed as chairman and his fellow-directors who had been appointed by the shareholders, and who had carried out not merely the machinery portion of the 1944 Act but the policy that I had given to them as Minister through their Government-appointed chairman, if I had felt under that obligation for two years, then certainly I would feel under the same obligation to-night to crown that work of four years by defending them by my vote in the House to-night.  If that is not done by Deputy Lemass and his Party, then I think there is no other conclusion to come to than that he is not prepared to stand his ground and that the charge levied against the present Minister is more applicable to him.</P>
    <P>I am not concerned whether the section is passed or not.  The amount involved is very small.  The question of the principle can be taken up again later in other legislation.  I, personally, have an objection to what is proposed here but, certainly, so far as moral courage and political honesty are concerned, there is an obligation on Deputy Lemass to carry to its logical conclusion the course he has been pursuing for two years, which he feels is proper, which he felt called upon to pursue and which he thinks is justified, of defending the administration of Córas Iompair Éireann, its chairman and its board of directors. There is an obligation on him to carry that to the point where, by the votes of himself and his Party for this section, he records his appreciation of these men and of the manner in which they discharged the duties imposed upon them by the Act carried through the House by him as Minister, with the support of his Party, in 1944.  Otherwise, <Col N="742" /> it is quite clear that there has been a complete revolution in the attitude of Deputy Lemass since last night and a lack of courage is manifest on his side.  I do not know what the explanation is except the simple one that he feels that defending the position in a long debate, in long speeches, is somewhat different from recording a vote which will be reflected in public payment of moneys to these directors.  Whether that is the explanation or not, I do not know.  Whatever difference I have with the Minister in regard to this section, if I were in Deputy Lemass's position to-night I would feel most peculiar in taking up the attitude of not supporting the section after what he has been saying for the last three years.</P>

      <P>May I reply to Deputy Larkin's observation, in one sentence? He made a speech at some length which refers to a section of a Bill introduced by a Minister of the Government. He is a Government Deputy here.  The first half of the speech was directed to giving reasons why the Government Deputies should vote against it and the second half to giving reasons why the Opposition Deputies should vote for it.  The explanation is, of course, that he realises, as other Deputies opposite, that this is likely to prove an unpopular section and that the whole purpose of the Government manoeuvre is to get the section passed and to blame the Opposition for it.  Deputy Larkin's speech was very convincing but he did not put enough bait on his hook.</P>

      <P>I rise to support this section.  There has been a lot of talk <Col N="743" /> about it and a lot of personalities in connection with it.  I think it is a matter of principle.  The directors of Córas Iompair Éireann, even if they have not been there individually for years and years, are the successors in title to directors going back for many years.  It is an act of justice to compensate those men.  In many cases they have done very good work.  We know the company has had very difficult times in the last few years.  There is just one thing on which I flatly disagree with Deputy Larkin, that is, when he said that the directors are there solely as the representatives of the shareholders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

      <P>I understood that Deputy Larkin was saying that he believed that to be the case.  But, whoever may have originally said that, I think it is nonsense and certainly there is no way in which shareholders could compensate directors for loss of office.  This Dáil would be establishing a bad precedent and would be doing something unjust and inequitable if it did not compensate these men for the office they are now relinquishing.  That would be done and should be done in the case of any employee of any company in which, as a result of State action, changes were made.  The same principle should be applied to directors.</P>

I would like to know why there is such commotion, both on the Government side and the Opposition side, about these gentlemen, who can retire without any compensation.

      <P>They got 37/6 if they were 65 years of age but they would not get that if they were 70.  Here we have Deputies talking about people who have been well paid for doing, as Deputy Larkin said, a couple of hours' work a fortnight.  We ought to be sensible. There was a general election in 1944, following the dissolution of the Dáil in the middle of the night, as a result of a decision on a Transport Bill. The public were promised faster trains, new stations, grander buses and cheaper fares.  After four years, we are in a worse position than ever.  We had the Minister telling us some months ago that he had to go to the Minister for Finance to get the money to pay the wages of the workers of Córas Iompair Éireann and why should we worry about these people who got thousands of pounds while in office?  In my view, the chairman was very well paid in what he got, without getting any compensation, considering the way other sections were treated.  I am not going to vote for this section to provide compensation for fellows who, if they were in another country, would be brought before a tribunal, and, if not executed, put in prison for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what we have heard about the woeful mismanagement on the part of this board of directors and the terrific loss which the nation has had to carry and will have to face up to, it is difficult to expect the House to adopt an attitude of generosity in this matter.  If the business were being taken over as a going concern, as a concern which was paying its way, it would be quite understandable that the men who had assisted in the successful management of that concern over a number of years and who were being removed from office through no fault of their own should be compensated, but we know that it is the necessity for intervention <Col N="745" /> by the State that has brought about the termination of these men's offices. If left on their own, there is no doubt about the inevitability of a complete stoppage and that position was very forcibly demonstrated in the Minister's statement that the concern was unable to pay its workers their weekly wages.  In view of that, I cannot see the justification for offering compensation to men who must hold themselves responsible in some degree for the woeful state of bankruptcy into which, day by day and year by year, they brought this wonderful institution of ours known as Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely, we must have regard for the morals of our people and surely if men in responsible positions knowingly and deliberately so manage or mismanage public concerns, involving the interests of the whole community, not only financially but economically, as to bring these concerns into a state of chaos, it is not a good example to set to reward such services generously at the expense of the taxpayer.  The Minister, I suggest, in view of his statements here, statements which, I am sure, he felt were justified and which he can substantiate, should reconsider the consequences of such a proposal as is now submitted to the <Col N="746" /> House.  These men failed to make good in their positions and they should accept their dismissal, as their dismissals would automatically have taken place.  If we are to have this sort of thing, if we are to accept whatever losses may occur through inefficiency in management or neglect and if the State is to be asked to take over such a liability, and not only that but to compensate inefficiency and mismanagement, we are tending towards a state of affairs where our whole public service will be besmirched.  Where, then, will be the encouragement for efficiency and what will be the necessity for it?  &ldquo;We are dealing with public money.  Let us spend as we like and mismanage as we like.  It does not matter if, when the terminus is reached, we have left debts behind us, because these will be borne by the State and we will be compensated, as if we had been highly efficient men&rdquo;. The proposal is morally wrong and unjust. It is an indication that, in future, men in such positions may do as they like, may make whatever mess they wish, through neglect or otherwise, and that their pensions will be safe.  It is an outrageous proposal and should be rejected.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Second Schedule be the Second Schedule to the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, I have no objection to the Schedule.  I think, however, the fact that I have no objection is a matter worthy of mention in view of the discussion we have just had, because this Schedule is designed to ensure that every member of the new board who serves the minimum period on it will be entitled to a pension on leaving it and that the chairman of the board will also have the right to a pension on retirement which his predecessor had not got.  I think that, on the whole, it is desirable that these provisions should be in the Bill.  I think it was an omission from the 1944 Act that no provision was made for the chairman appointed under it.  We have got to face the possibility that persons appointed to these boards will prove less useful on them than anticipated or may lose their utility in the course of time.  It is always easier to effect changes involving the retirement of such persons when some compensation arrangement exists than when it does not.  That is more likely to be the case in relation to this particular board because, as was pointed out, the stockholders' directors of the old company were generally people of means, certainly people with other <Col N="752" /> sources of income, whereas that may not always be the case with all the members of the new board.</P>
      <P>If I rightly interpreted some observations made in the course of the debate, there would be a view in the House that the rate of remuneration of directors of the old company was high, and one might, therefore, assume the expectation that the remuneration of the members of the new board would be less.  I, however, would not support that.  I have already expressed the view here that the management of this transport undertaking should be entrusted to a board of people so remunerated that they can, if necessary, give the whole of their time to its supervision.  If we are to get competent persons capable of doing that work properly, it is likely they will have to be taken out of other employment, that they will be people who have already established reputations for themselves in some other sphere and who would be reluctant to leave a sphere in which they have established their reputations to take over the rather dubious task of managing this undertaking, with all the risks to their own reputations which will be involved in it, unless the remuneration is attractive and unless the prospect of pensions at the end of a reasonable period of service is before them.</P>
      <P>While, therefore, in the heat of the discussion on the previous amendment, views may have been expressed in relation to the past, we should not allow them to prejudice our views in relation to the future, and I hope that, whatever opinion Deputies may have concerning the remuneration of directors as a class, they will appreciate the importance in this Bill of having, not merely adequate provision for remuneration, but the additional security provided for in the Schedule.</P>

      <P>I must say that I thoroughly agree with what Deputy Lemass has said, that persons in a responsible position such as this should receive adequate remuneration and should be so placed by the terms of their employment that they would have to give full time to their duties on the board.  While saying that, I do think that, in the conditions obtaining in this <Col N="753" /> country, a salary of £6,500 per year is too high.  I think that that will be accepted because, if we relate it even to the salary paid to a Minister, who has very heavy responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was following Deputy Lemass, because the pension has relation to the amount of salary. Clearly, the amount of salary would have a bearing on the pension that is paid to the particular occupant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Schedule says that it is superannuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>His superannuation is based on his salary.  However, I am only making the point to the Minister with which I think there will be no disagreement&mdash;that the salary paid ought to be adequate.  To go, however, into the realms of six or more thousand pounds is going beyond anything ordinarily understood in this country.  I know of no official employment in this country where the salary exceeds £4,000 per year.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind in regard to this board he is now going to appoint, but I, for one, would certainly support the Minister in ensuring that these directors, and particularly the chairman, will be able to give full time to the business of the board and that their remuneration will be reasonable and fair.</P>
      <P>It is reasonable that there should be decent superannuation or pension.  I do not think, however, that it should be permitted to capitalise that particular pension.  I do not think it can be done under this Bill.  If the pension is, say, £500 per year, I do not think it is right that it might be capitalised into a sum of £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that that ought not to be done. It is a bad principle to do it.  It is contrary to all the principles of superannuation and pension.  Anyway, I do not think there is provision in this Schedule for it.  Therefore, in treating the members of the board well and in <Col N="754" /> expecting a good return from them, the Minister and the Government will be doing the right thing and I think the community will be doing the right thing in seeing that the chairman and directors are treated properly.  But then we do expect from them full service and the exercise of all their abilities on behalf of the new Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the expressions of view that I gave in the course of the debate on Section 59, it would be as well if I indicated that I agree with the view expressed by Deputy Lemass and Deputy Cowan in respect of the provisions of the Second Schedule.  But, having in mind the provision of reasonable and suitable superannuation treatment for the members of the board, I think we should also have in mind that we are formulating these provisions in respect of what may be regarded as a reasonable and adequate salary not only in relation to industrial and commercial employment, but also, as Deputy Cowan said, in the light of the commitments borne by other persons in the public life of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More than that I do not want to say on the question of salary, except to refer to another reference in the Schedule connected with superannuation and to express the view that, if we are going to provide salary and, particularly, superannuation for members of the board, from that point of view alone I think there is a strong and unanswerable case to require the members of the board not merely to accept appointment as full-time members of the board, but, in fact, to give full-time service.  I recognise that you cannot keep a board in continuous session but, at the same time, if they are required in the terms of their appointment to make themselves available on a whole-time basis, even though they naturally cannot be at meetings continuously they can be directly associated with various executive branches of the undertaking so as to familiarise themselves with the day-to-day work. I think the most regrettable thing would be if we had a board of persons who might be competent to discharge the duties of membership of the board <Col N="755" /> but who, because of their contact merely consisting of attendance at board meetings and, possibly, some subcommittee meetings, would, in fact, be people whose day-to-day practical knowledge of the undertaking would be dependent on the reports and information made available to them by experts.</P>
    <P>Nobody expects, for instance, a person coming out of commercial life and going on to the board to become an expert on transport, but in so far as he has a background in his knowledge of the commercial life of the country it will be helpful to him if, as a member of the board, he acquires an ordinary close knowledge of the actual working of the transport undertaking, some relationship with and some knowledge of staffs in the particular branch in which he may be interested, and some knowledge of the problems that are dealt with. He should acquire knowledge from the leading experts handling a particular side of the undertaking so that when matters come before the board he will not be in the position of being completely dependent on the reports available and unfamiliar with the actual day-to-day working of the undertaking.  I suggest to the Minister that the warrants of appointment should require whole-time service on the board; it should involve whole-time attendance and an intimate association with the actual working conditions of the undertaking.</P>

      <P>There was a good deal of discussion as to the type of board that should be appointed. Might I remind Deputies who took part in that earlier discussion that the discussion arose largely out of whether the general manager should be a member of the board at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>To this extent, that we are dealing with superannuation on the basis of whole-time service; superannuation can only apply if the appointment is on a whole-time basis. We were discussing earlier whether the <Col N="756" /> appointment should be whole-time or part-time.  My own recollection of the discussion was that there was rather a loose and perhaps not a well-considered viewpoint expressed that these positions should be whole-time.</P>
      <P>The viewpoint expressed by Deputy Larkin will arouse a good deal of sympathy here.  There is that old feeling against directors who move from place to place and there is the feeling, since this is a national concern, that their appointment should be on a whole-time basis.  Under sub-section (2) it appears they can qualify for superannuation only if their services are whole-time.</P>

      <P>I believe I am still quite in order.  The House had different viewpoints on this subject as to whether they should be whole-time or part-time and I suggest to the Minister that, when it comes to the point of issuing warrants for these appointments, he will see so far as the chairman is concerned that he will be a full-time chairman and in addition&mdash; and this is a condition which was not provided for&mdash;that he shall be deemed to be the chief executive officer of the concern between board meetings; in other words, that he should have responsibility.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if the wording of sub-section (2) means that a director in order to qualify for this superannuation must have whole-time service as those words are commonly understood?</P>

      <P>The only thing I want to say on this schedule is this. The Irish Transport Stockholders' Association have sent a circular to all Deputies and the effect of their circular was contained in the amendment which Deputy Cogan put down, and which was not moved.  Their point is this. They say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The transport stock with which it is proposed to compensate the common stockholders of Córas Iompair Éireann is a 3 per cent. stock dated 1975-1985.  The earlier the date of redemption the higher the present cash value of a given stock.  The annual cost to the State of compensating the stockholders with 3 per cent. 1955-60 will be no more than that of a 1975-85 stock, and no one can foresee whether the terms on which the State can convert or borrow will be better or worse in 1955 than in 1975.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The association circular proceeds:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="758" />&ldquo;In short, this association reiterates its demand for compensation at par value and, further, urges that the stock with which compensation is made should be dated 1955-60 instead of 1975-85.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My only reason for referring to that is because Deputy Cogan is not here to move his amendment, when he would have explained this particular thing, and I feel that the case made by the stockholders should be considered by the Minister.  I am not putting it forward as a recommendation of my own; I am just giving expression to the fact that those stockholders request that and I leave it entirely to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

      <P>There will be a considerable number of amendments, but they are nearly all amendments arising out of undertakings given here on the Committee Stage.  If Deputies will agree, it is proposed to take the Report Stage on next Tuesday week.  If Deputies find that they have not sufficient time in which to consider the amendments when they are circulated I will be prepared to make it Wednesday or Thursday.  Deputies will understand that I am anxious to get the next stages completed as soon as possible in order to have the Bill passed into law as early as possible.  If the amendments are circulated in sufficient time, I take it the House will have no objection to having the Report Stage on Tuesday week.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned, I was explaining that this amendment in reality makes no difference whatsover as between the price paid to non-nationals and the price formerly paid under the existing law. The method of determining the price under the machinery we have is that the Land Commission court, commonly described as the appeal tribunal, hears evidence from auctioneers on behalf of the applicant.  They then send other valuers to inspect the lands and, having heard both sides, they give a decision which is supposed to be equivalent to paying the market value of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment does not purport to deprive non-nationals of the value of their land under existing law.  It is not suggested that they should be cut by 50 per cent, or 20 per cent.  It is not suggested that they should be deprived <Col N="764" /> of the value of their lands at all.  So far as the amendment goes, it only goes to deprive the non-national of whatever doubtful benefits he might get under the provisions of this Bill.  I heard the Minister state to-day that there will be a difference and that there is a difference between market value and market price.  Unless some of the amendments tabled are passed, the question of market value will still be up in the air.  If Deputy Commons is sincere in this amendment and if he wants to deprive non-nationals of the ordinary rights of compensation, there is no reason why he should not say so specifically in this amendment.  He does not purport in this amendment to deny the right of non-nationals to the same compensation for their land, if that land is acquired by the State, as every Irish citizen got up to the passage of this Bill.  I think there is some kind of shadow-boxing in connection with this matter.  I would be interested in hearing the Minister elaborate on the methods he proposes to employ to deal with this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair has given an opinion on this matter before.  My experience of the practice of this House is that if an amendment was unconstitutional and obviously so it would not find its way on to the table of amendments before us.  However, we are dealing with a Government of lawyers and surely they would have no difficulty in finding somebody to define the rights or wrongs, as far as the Constitution is concerned, without having to call on Deputy Dillon, who is the Minister for Agriculture.  I think there are many Front Bench men in the Coalition Government who could give us an opinion, to which some weight could be attached, as to whether this matter is unconstitutional or otherwise. I believe myself, in connection with the question of non-nationals, as Deputy Commons purports to deal with them under this amendment, that the House would be in order in dealing with this problem as far as land is concerned.  If I may, I would advise Deputy Commons not to be at all awed by the oration which the Minister for Agriculture delivered in this House to-night in regard to the constitutional issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point of view with which Deputy Commons wants to deal and, indeed, with which this House should deal, is quite apparent to everybody.  I think that, in regard to the way in which Deputy Commons has put this matter, he is not in reality penalising anybody. I want to retiterate that if this becomes law and is written into the Statute Book of Dáil Éireann any non-national who comes to claim compensation <Col N="766" /> before the courts after the passage of this Bill will be in the same position as every Irish tenant farmer was before the passage of it.  There are grave doubts, both inside and outside this House, as to whether the terms of compensation, depending on their interpretation, will be a very big advance or very much of an advance on the terms of compensation that existed before this Bill ever saw Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>This amendment, I think, does not purport to deal effectively or otherwise with the problem which Deputy Commons has in mind.  Speaking for myself, I for one am prepared to accept the Minister's solution, if he has a solution.  He hinted at it to-night and, if it is more effective than the amendment moved by Deputy Commons, I would be prepared to accept it.  If the Minister has a genuine method of dealing with this problem I am sure he will be heard sympathetically by every side of the House.  I think that, having hinted that he had a solution, he should tell us what steps he proposes to take in connection with this problem.</P>

The Minister stated definitely to-night that he had a better way of dealing with that matter than that suggested by Deputy Commons.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on that statement and to give us the information we are looking for.  If the Minister's suggestion should prove to be better than that of Deputy Commons then Deputy Commons might withdraw this amendment.</P>

I am not in any way assured that the Minister is going to take any action.  I decided to table the amendment and to allow it to be determined by a free vote of the House.  We shall then see who is in favour of the amendment and who is not in favour of it.  The new sub-section which I propose can be easily understood by anybody who reads it.

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The market value of land to be acquired by the Land Commission shall be determined by the average price paid for land of quality similar to that being acquired in the particular district where it is being acquired over the period of the preceding three years.</P>
      <P>I put this amendment down principally for the purpose of getting a definition of market value.  The Minister has, in the views which he has expressed so far, been rather nebulous as to what exactly he means by &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  When we were discussing the question of market value on a previous occasion it was pointed out to me that I had on several occasions opposed the idea of paying market value for land and that is true.  It is only by way of consideration that I did come round to the view that it would be an injustice to property owners to pay anything other than the actual market value.  Reforms do not come quickly and before any man introduces a reform, he must have convinced himself.  Not merely that, but he must convince others who are acting with him.  While the Minister and I are, I think, in agreement that market value should be paid to property holders, yet there is something to be said on the other side and it has been said by Deputies, not merely on this side, but on the Government Benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="770" /> Old tradition is not bad and old custom is not easily got over.  The general idea in regard to the non-payment of market value arises out of the belief that property has its duties as well as its rights, and that when property did not carry out its duties there should be a penalty inherent in any transaction between property owners and the State.  That is why people have opposed market value and many are still opposed to it and are not convinced that it should be paid.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Agriculture pointed out to-night, there are conditions about the world now, however, very much opposed to the system of property holding in any form, and we should be very careful in our views in regard to property.  I take the view that once an allottee has entered into a contract with the State the State cannot override that contract and, if it does resume or acquire the land originally got for him by Land Commission action, it is right that he should be paid market value.  I doubt&mdash;and I think the Minister doubts, in view of what he has already said&mdash;that the acceptance of the view that market value should be paid will make a tremendous difference in the price paid for land.  While the Minister and many other people were at one time rather indignant at the attitude of the Land Commission towards property holders, he has admitted, and I know it is so, that only in very few cases has there been any injustice.  The Land Commission have been reasonably fair with all property owners and have been most sympathetic towards them and I doubt if acceptance of this principle would mean any appreciable addition to the cost.  I think the only difference that could possibly be made would be in regard to the redemption of land annuities.  Since that is taken care of in Section 7, I see no reason why the Minister should not, in accepting this amendment, give us a very clear difinition&mdash;his own definition, anyhow&mdash;of what is meant by market value.  That is the point on which I would like some elucidation given.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary to move the amendment, as technically there should be only one amendment at a time before the House.  The Deputy may discuss his amendment in full, without actually moving it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, taking the amendment as if it were moved, I again seek to get some concrete idea from the Minister or from the Government on this nebulous question of market value. As I have pointed out to the House on the last amendment, it was stated by some people that we already had the basis of market value.  It was contended that when the Land Commission courts were directed that, in fixing a sum, regard should be had to the fair value of land to the Land Commission, the best interpretation of those words was that they should get something approaching market value.</P>
      <P>An earlier intervention of the Minister in this debate to-night makes me gravely doubt as to what is the official intention in regard to this matter.  I have heard him trying to draw fine hairs between market value and market price.  If someone in the House will clearly explain to me the difference between market price and market value, I would be very much obliged to him.  I consider that the market value of any land is the market price it would fetch in its own locality.</P>
      <P>You cannot have a market value to apply to the whole of this country, as a lot would depend on the local circumstances. Land per acre may fetch a certain price in County Meath, while in areas where there is land hunger, as in the area I represent, land may fetch a very different price.  That is why I have tabled this amendment, that</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the market value of land to be purchased or acquired by the Land <Col N="772" /> Commission shall be determined by the average current price paid for land of similar quality to that being acquired in the immediate vicinity of the district where it is being acquired.</P>
    <P>The value of land varies not alone from county to county but from district to district and from parish to parish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>And from townland to townland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to tie the Minister and his Department down as nearly as I could by the definition I have put here.  I have tried to get it as close as possible to indicate the area in which the land is being acquired. Taking a farm in one particular district, even in a county where there is no congestion or land hunger, the price paid for that land is no criterion in respect to a price which should prevail over the whole district.  As every rural Deputy knows, there are areas in different districts, in different counties throughout the country, that differ in price very widely.  It is in an attempt to get the Government or the Minister to say what will be the rule in connection with this matter that this amendment is tabled.</P>
      <P>There is another point, which we will be discussing further later on, but which is relevant here.  It arises out of the manner in which the price is determined.  The procedure, as we know it at the moment, is that the owner produces evidence from his auctioneers as to the amount they say his land would fetch; the Land Commission then send valuers, who report back.  Whatever they report nobody knows, but ultimately the Commissioners, the Land Commission Court or the Appeal Tribunal fix the price, presumably having had the benefit of hearing both sides of the question.  It is a matter we can fruitfully discuss later on in the Bill.  I think both sides should be heard together and that the question should be decided in open court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In arriving at market value, we should not leave it as some rule of thumb, the sending down of some city auctioneer or valuer to an area in the West where he never saw or sold land <Col N="773" /> before, as he would have as much idea of the value of land down there as a pig has about aviation.  Such people, ex-officials of the Land Commission in Dublin and valuers from Dublin, accustomed to dealing with city properties, have been sent down to congested areas.  It is a completely stupid idea to ask these people to determine the market value of land in congested areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>When does that happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know quite well, and it is not my business to tell him, that the Land Commission courts, day in, day out, are sending inspectors down the country to value land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not know that, he should know it because it is one of the matters about which I am complaining.  I am suggesting to the Minister that in arriving at the market value in a particular area regard should be had by the body that is to determine the question to the evidence of men who are familiar with the particular area and who are familiar with prices in that area and that the decision will not be taken, as I think it is taken at present, on the evidence of somebody from outside the area who is unacquainted with conditions and prices in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am narrowing the definition of market value even more than my colleague Deputy Moylan has done.  I am suggesting in the amendment that it shall be determined by the average current price paid for land of similar quality to that being acquired in the &ldquo;immediate vicinity of the district&rdquo; where it is being acquired because &ldquo;district&rdquo; is a word that can be extended to a very large degree.  If the House decided to give the market value, that market value should be based on the market price of land in the area in which the holding is situate.  That is the principle I am trying to secure and I would like to know from the Minister whether he is accepting the principle of both these <Col N="774" /> amendments, which aim at the same object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if he can state at once what he means by the market value?  Let us be clear about the situation.  Let it be clear once and for all because this will raise questions that will be disputed in the law courts for many years ahead.  Will the Minister state now what is the market value?  Let him give a clear definition now, as the law stands and as he knows and understands it.  That is the only thing I am concerned about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to reply to a point that was made by Deputy Moylan. Deputy Moylan said that in his opinion the provisions of this section will not add very much to the price that may be paid for land acquired. That raises one point.  The Chair ruled an amendment of mine out of order on the ground that it would add to the cost of this Bill.  Deputy Moylan claims that there is no additional cost involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy himself mentioned the cost in the amendment.  It was unfortunate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed that there would be additional cost.  Deputy Moylan appears to have a different point of view.  I do not think that he really believes that when he says it because everybody knows that land has been acquired during the last ten years, and perhaps before that, at considerably below the market value and, therefore, if this section is made operative, it will add to the cost.  Another point made by Deputy Moylan was that he doubts very much the equity of this particular section.  He suggests that property has its duties as well as its rights and that, since land is acquired as a sort of penalty on the owners, it ought to be acquired at less than its value.  I do not agree with that point of view.  I do not agree that it should be a recognised function of the Land Commission to impose sanctions or penalties on the owners of land in regard to the use of that land. In the case of land that is still the <Col N="775" /> property of the Land Commission, and in which the tenants are not yet the vested owners, there should be supervision in regard to the use that is made of it but in the case of land that is the property of the farmer the Land Commission ought not to have the power which Deputy Moylan suggests they should have.  I think everybody will agree that the Land Commission is not qualified to exercise that function. If somebody must perform the function of supervising the use of land, it should be the Department of Agriculture, which is more closely associated with agricultural practices.</P>
      <P>Certainly, the Land Commission should not have that power.  I maintain that ownership should be absolute and that the owner of land should be free from unnecessary supervision.  We have had it stated by the Minister for Agriculture that inspectors are to be kept outside the farmer's fences.  If that is Government policy, we ought to stand by it.</P>
      <P>There is certainly a very distinct difference between market value and market price.  My idea of market value is the estimated value of land in the particular area where the land is situate.</P>

      <P>It must be estimated by somebody.  Otherwise how can you ascertain the price?  Somebody must value the land and come to a decision as to its value.  You cannot value land by putting it up for auction and seeing how much it will fetch.  That is hardly a reasonable way of solving the problem.  This problem ought not to present any difficulty to the Land Commission, because as I understand it, the Land Commission have been acquiring land or resuming land for a long period under another Act at the market value and they must have, therefore, <Col N="776" /> the machinery for ascertaining, if that is a better word than estimating, what market value is.  If the machinery is there in regard to land resumed, land which is not vested in the tenant, that machinery can be put into operation under the section and I do not see that any difficulty can arise.</P>

      <P>I am giving the market value.  I do not mind Deputy Moran putting down such an amendment as this, but I am candidly surprised that Deputy Moylan should have slipped so badly as to do this.  Deputy Moylan must know that two methods of determining the price were laid down by statute in respect of land held under two different types of ownership, vested and unvested land.  Unvested land was resumed and the price fixed was fixed satisfactorily in nearly all cases under the very same system as that which I am proposing here which was laid down in the 1939 Act.  Incidentally, I should like to have time to go through the Dáil debates to see whether Deputy Moran tabled such an amendment as this, when Section 39 of that Act was going through.  In the determination of market value, do Deputy Moran and Deputy Moylan, both of whom know a little about rural Ireland, seriously propose that either of these amendments should go in as part of a statute and part of the direction or guidance for the Land Commission in determining the price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Moran mentioned that the price of land varies from one parish and from one townland to another. Two holdings of exactly the same acreage, the same poor law valuation and very nearly the same quality, so far as the eye can see, side by side in the same townland, will go two different prices.  He knows well that there is no such thing as pinning down.  These amendments would have the effect of reverting to the position which this <Col N="777" /> Bill seeks to get away from, and in some cases I have no doubt this system would give an enhanced price to some farmers and a reduced price, or a price much below what would be fair, to others.</P>
    <P>One of the principal things affecting the sale of land is its location with regard to a public road or a good road. Does every Deputy not know that a 50-acre farm at the end of a mile-long boreen, particularly if the boreen is in pretty bad condition, would not go any more than half the price it would go if it adjoined a main road and particularly a good steam-rolled road?</P>
    <P>The condition of out-offices is not taken into account or whether some of the land would be subject to periodic flooding in the winter or water-logging in wet weather all the year round.  All I am doing is giving the very same freedom to the Land Commission.  I am asking the House to enable them to determine the price of acquired land by the very same method as that by which they have determined the price of resumed land up to this.  It has worked satisfactorily and, as the black said about the watch: &ldquo;I do not know anything about it, but it works&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>And why no anxiety was expressed about it during all that time, although half the Land Commission's takings during that time consisted of resumed land.  The method provided by that section, credit for which goes, I think, to Deputy Aiken, who was Minister at that time, produced satisfactory results, while the other method of determining the price of acquired land was nothing more or less than a pickpocket's method.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said on the Second Reading, as regards fixation of the price of land, the relief of congestion is a responsibility which the State should shoulder and the method employed up to this was definitely not one that aimed at speeding up a solution of that problem, and any section or sub-section of a <Col N="779" /> statute which delayed the work of the Land Commission in that regard could not be said to aim at finality in the matter, could not be said to aim at bringing the problem of congestion to an end, a problem which Deputies on all sides are anxious to see finished. I said that it was exactly like asking a man to run a race after tying his feet.  That is exactly what was happening. The Land Commission were told to go out and get land and every person in the country from whom land was being acquired threw every possible obstacle in their path, because word had gone round that the Land Commission were practically stealing the land. The Party opposite operated that for 16 years and they acquired a reasonable amount of land during their first four or five years.  I am asking the House to agree with me in doing away with it.  The method of fixing the price of resumed land has proved satisfactory and I am quite satisfied that it will prove satisfactory in relation to acquired land.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any necessity for any heat on this matter.  We are entitled to know what will be the price paid to farmers for their land, for ordinary land, not ranches or anything else but the land of ordinary farmers.  You are taking something from a farmer for which he is entitled to get at least the price he would get elsewhere for it.  How is that to be determined?  That is what we want to know.  Is it to be in the same way as for resumed land?  I have <Col N="781" /> seen some amazing results in our own land courts.  One holding in my own district was valued by the Land Commission valuers at £900.  It went up before the Appeal Tribunal, who sent down another set of valuers and they valued it at £1,450.  I can quote another case and give it to the Minister&mdash; I would not like to give the details here in the House, but I would give them elsewhere&mdash;where the value fixed by the Land Commission was £1,200 and the value fixed by the Appeal Tribunal was £2,380.</P>
      <P>Those are facts in regard to resumed land.  We are entitled to know who is going to fix market value and on what basis that market value is going to be fixed.  Is it going to be fixed by either of those two bodies, by the official valuers of the Land Commission or by the official valuers of the Appeal Tribunal or is it going to be fixed by a valuer of the Department of Social Welfare like the one who down in my country valued a half-acre of beet at £45?  Is any new authority going to come in and have a go at it?  We are entitled to know who is going to fix the market value and what the market value is going to be.  I for one would prefer Deputy Moran's amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The market value of land to be purchased or acquired by the Land Commission shall be determined by the average current price paid for land of similar quality to that being acquired in the immediate vicinity of the district where it is being acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That would mean that if a farm was sold within a couple of years in that district and so much per acre was fixed, the man whose land is being taken would have that as a basis of the price he would get.  The value of the house and out-offices would of course be taken into consideration if one had a dilapidated house and out-offices and the other a good house and out-offices that would be taken into account in determining the value Deputy Moran's amendment, however, gives some basis which has not yet appeared in the section by which we could judge.  I for one, with 23 years' experience in this House and experience of the actual working of those Land Acts in the <Col N="782" /> country, would not accept the manner in which it has been done in the case of resumed land up to the moment as the right manner to determine market value to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of market value is one which is pretty difficult to answer because there is no doubt that the market value can go up and down in small districts as well as throughout the country.  That we must all admit and to find a method of determining the market value of any holding is difficult.  There are Deputies in this House, farmers by profession and occupation, who claim they know land and market value as well as any Land Commission valuer.  I know I would not play second to any Land Commission valuer who ever went out to value a holding of land.  Like Deputy Corry or anyone else who has lived on a holding I would be a very poor master of my occupation if I could not tell the difference between good land and bad as well as, or better than, any official of the Department.  In this section paragraph (a) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The said sub-section shall have effect with the substitution of the words &lsquo;the amount to be so fixed shall be an amount equal to the market value of the land&rsquo; for the words &lsquo;in fixing such sum regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively.&rsquo;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between market value and a value which is fair to the owner and the Land Commission, respectively, is very little.  If the Land Commission decide to give the value which is fair to the owner and to themselves they are first going to get as close as they can to the market value.  In some cases they have been doing that and in other cases they have not.  The Land Commission valuer can  certain price on a holding of land.  The person from whom the land is to be taken over then appeals to the Appeal Tribunal and in most cases there is a revaluation and the price is increased. Anybody who takes an interest in land knows that that has happened from time to time, but who is to determine market value and how is it to be fixed? The determination of the price to be <Col N="783" /> paid for any land for a number of years past has rested with the commissioners of the Land Commission and it still rests with them.  They act presumably on the reports they get from the valuers of the Land Commission. The valuer submits a report of what he thinks is the value of the land and leave is given to the owner to appeal. The whole thing is heard by the Appeal Tribunal and a bargain is struck between the two.  I would be very cautious about giving the market value of land, especially if I thought it was going to fleece the Government, the Land Commission and the taxpayers in general in order to satisfy a whim or fancy of some individual from whom land will be taken over.</P>
    <P>I have always said that I am not a great lover of the principle of market value.  I am simply supporting it now as an experiment to see if it will bring more land into the pool to enable the Land Commission to help to relieve congestion.  There is an effort being made now to arrive at market value, but if we carry on the system which has been carried on with regard to resumed land, I do not think that we will be far out.  That will not be a perfect system and let nobody think that it will.  The best valuer that you can get may be out £50 or £60 in valuation. What the Bill proposes may help to speed up the procedure with regard to the acquisition of land.  There may be an easing up, and that will be all to the good.  That is the only way in which I can imagine market value being arrived at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan, in his amendment, is urging that market value should be arrived at by taking the price paid for land in a locality in the preceding three years I do not know why he introduced such an amendment, because we all know that land values can vary very much in a year or two years.  They may fall or they may rise.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be correct to say that over the past few years land values have risen considerably, but they may fall during the next three years.  Therefore, would it not be wrong if the Land Commission had to <Col N="784" /> carry on its work based on the inflated prices that have prevailed during the last three years?  I think that we should give a discretion to the Land Commission and try, so to speak, to grade out prices.  Let us be as hard as we can on the owner of land without being unjust to him.  Let us try and strike a figure that will be reasonable. I want to repeat that market value is a very hard thing to define.  I do not think it is a thing that can be arrived accurately at by anybody.</P>

On behalf of the people I represent I want to say I am glad that we are getting away from that.  I do not think there is anyone who can define what the value of land is.  I think that the Leader of the Opposition is wrong in pressing the Minister about that.  If the Minister could do something to save landowners from having to go before the tribunal it would, I think, be a good thing.  We all know from experience that if, say, ten people go to an auction of land each one will have a different idea about the value of that land.  I do not think you will ever change that.  I think that these two amendments should be withdrawn.  Their acceptance, in my own opinion, would only lead to endless trouble.  I move to report progress.</P>
