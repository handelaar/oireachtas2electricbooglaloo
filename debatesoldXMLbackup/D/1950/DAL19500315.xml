      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state whether it is proposed to acquire the Store Street premises from Córas Iompair Éireann before or after its conversion for use by his Department.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy a week ago, the necessary changes in those parts of the premises which will require some alteration are the subject of discussions between my Department and the company and their technical consultants.  It is probable that the property will have changed hands before effect is given to the alterations which appear to be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand that the position is that the plans for the conversion of the premises will be made by the architects of Córas Iompair Éireann and will then be executed by the Board of Works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not to understand any such thing from what I have said.  I have indicated to him on more than one occasion that the question as to alterations in the plans has been the subject of discussions between my Department and the company and its consultants.  The company has been made aware of certain alterations which are required, and the company is taking steps, I take it, to give effect to what we require in this respect.  The question of the purchase of the property cannot be dealt with until such time as the necessary legal assurances have been <Col N="1882" /> received, and when they have been received the matter will be taken in hands expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am anxious to find out is whether it is intended that these premises will be converted for the use of the Minister's Department before they are acquired from Córas Iompair Éireann or after it.  Is the work of conversion to be done by Córas Iompair Éireann or the Board of Works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Board of Works do not come into the matter of conversion at this stage.  Córas Iompair Éireann have been told what it will be necessary for them to do if we are to purchase the premises from them, and Córas Iompair Éireann, being anxious to dispose of the premises, will, I take it, take the necessary steps to satisfy the requirements of their customer. Before these alterations have been completed the property may be purchased from Córas Iompair Éireann, the liability remaining on Córas Iompair Éireann to do whatever it is legally directed to do for its customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the conversion work will be done by Córas Iompair Éireann?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann will be required to do whatever alterations we require carried out in this matter.  When Córas Iompair Éireann has done that and is able to pass over premises which satisfy us the premises will be purchased from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any means by which the Dáil can find out what the conversion alterations are going to cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be most happy to let the Deputy know what the conversion costs will be as soon as we can ascertain them.  That can only be done when we know the extent of the conversion required and what it will cost on tenders to make these conversions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume, therefore, that no estimate has been made yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>You cannot make an estimate until you make inquiries and <Col N="1883" /> get tenders.  To proceed on any other line would be quite unwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will it be done in our lifetime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be done before the Deputy is many months older.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Primary Teachers' Scale.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that, no matter how many years efficient service single men or women teachers may have, it will take them four further years to reach the maximum of the new salary scales, and that such teachers of over 61 years of age will not have reached the maximum of the scales when they have to retire on pension at 65 and will thereby be in receipt of reduced pensions; and, if so, whether he will consider amending the new scales to remedy this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the decision to abolish the highly efficient rating was arrived at, it was decided that teachers who had reached the maximum of the former scale for efficient teachers would proceed by annual increments to the maximum of the former scale for teachers who had been rated &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo;, with effect from the 1st April, 1949.  The placing arrangements announced in connection with the new scales which came into operation from the 1st January, 1950, provide that each teacher will be placed in the appropriate new scale at the point corresponding to the point he has already reached in the scale existing previous to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women and single men teachers who were, at the date of the abolition of the highly efficient rating, at the maximum of the former &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; scale will, therefore, as the Deputy states, not reach the maximum of the new scales for four further years, such teachers if retiring in the meantime will not therefore receive the maximum pension which a teacher retiring on the maximum of the new scale i.e. a teacher rated &ldquo;highly efficient&rdquo; under the previous arrangement, will receive, but they will receive the <Col N="1884" /> benefits of the new superannuation terms.  This means, that for women, the pension will be based on 1/60th of average annual salary for each year of pensionable service, instead of 1/80th for each year as heretofore.</P>
    <P>Single men teachers, in addition to pension on the existing basis of 1/80th for each year of service, will receive a lump sum calculated at 1/30th of average annual salary for each year of pensionable service.  In the calculation of average annual salary, whether for pension or for lump sum, teachers will have the benefit of the new salary rates for such part of the three year period as is subsequent to the 1st January, 1950.</P>
    <P>In addition I would refer the Deputy to my reply given to Deputy Alfred P. Byrne on 14th December last in which there is contained the information that following full consideration by the Government of related matters at an interview which took place on the 7th December last between representatives of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the Taoiseach with other members of the Government, the Government decided that it was unable further to modify its proposals regarding the salaries, pensions and allowances of national teachers other than as indicated in my letter of the 23rd November to which reference is made in my reply to Deputy Byrne.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state whether any proposals reached his Department in connection with the building of a national school at Killahan, Abbeydorney, County Kerry; and, if so, when it is proposed to start building work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has been in correspondence with the manager with a view to the erection of a new school to replace the present defective Killahan National School, Abbeydorney, County Kerry, but certain preliminary arrangements have still to be completed before a grant can be sanctioned towards the cost of the new building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1885" /> I am not at present in a position to say when these arrangements will be completed or when it will be possible to commence work on the erection of the new school.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the Glasheen Boys' National School, Cork, is in a very dilapidated condition with completely inadequate amenities for the school boys, and if he will state when it is proposed to have a new building erected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that Glasheen Boys' National School is in a very dilapidated condition.  The building is overcrowded and I am advised that the premises fall short of modern standards.  Until an examination of the case now proceeding has been completed, I am not in a position to say in what way the problem can best be solved, but I hope that it will be possible to arrive at a decision in the matter without undue delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he is yet in a position to state when building will commence on the proposed new national schools at (1) Ballincollig; (2) Kilmurry, and (3) Knocknamanna, Minane Bridge, County Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Commissioners of Public Works that the working drawings and specification for the proposed new Ballincollig national schools are almost completed, but that bills of quantities will have to be prepared before the commissioners will be in a position to invite tenders.  It is expected that the official lease vesting the site in trustees will be executed at an early date.</P>
      <P>Agreement has been reached with the managers in regard to the local contributions to be provided towards the cost of the proposed new national schools at Kilmurry and Knocknamanna. Certain arrangements have, however, still to be made as regards the production of evidence of title to the sites, so as to enable the plots to be vested in trustees, before grants towards the cost of the new buildings can be sanctioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1886" /> I am unable to say, at present, when it may be possible to commence work on the erection of the new schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there has been confusion either in the Minister's or the Deputy's mind as to two Jackson estates in close proximity in this area and it is possible that my former reply may have left the Deputy under the impression that the proceedings were in connection with another estate.</P>

The policy as laid down is that uneconomic holders are to get first preference and after that, if there is land left over, it must be left entirely to the discretion of the Commissioners as to how they will utilise it.</P>

    <P>(b) Six hundred and fifty lbs of abies pectinata, 200 lbs. of pinus contorta and 150 lbs. of scots pine have been received.  Further deliveries are expected at an early date, but owing to failure of the crop of several species it is anticipated that neither abies grandis nor Japanese larch will be received and shortages are likely in the seed of pinus contorta, pinus insignus and tsuga hetcrophylla.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1894" /> The home collection of seed is under way at present and appreciable quantities of scots pine, pinus contorta, Japanese larch and European larch cones have been procured.  In addition, the forestry division's requirements of hardwoods (oak, ash, beech, alder, etc.) are likely to be secured in full.  It is not possible to give exact quantities until the seeds have been extracted and cleaned.</P>

He will have an opportunity of putting his question and getting the answer within a fortnight on the Army Estimate.  I would only take up undue time to try and explain to the Deputy now the new system of indenting and receiving supplies. It is not economy of a financial nature that is holding it up.

      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 50 and 51 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An allocation of 1,040 dollars was made available to Córas Iompair Éireann for the purchase of plastic rock from the United States of America.  An expenditure of 860 dollars has been incurred and this has provided material for use on 90 buses.  The financial saving in using this material is estimated by Córas Iompair Éireann at £4 13s. 6d. per vehicle.  It is not because of this small economy that the change was made, but because the plastic rock has been found from experience to have <Col N="1908" /> exceptional qualities and, being skid-proof, hard-wearing and waterproof, it is particularly suitable for use on buses.</P>
    <P>It would, in my opinion, be a retrograde step to prohibit the development of new methods which make for the greater convenience and safety of the travelling public and, in any event, I would have no power to do so.</P>

The annual cost of the network includes also the working costs but, as most of the networks have only recently gone into commission, it is too soon to give any figure for annual working costs; (4) the number of dwellings connected to date in completed areas is 57 per cent. of the total dwellings in these areas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Chinn Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>The present position is that an airfield has been provided and is being operated at Farmer's Cross, Cork, by private interests.  A licence has been issued authorising the use of that airfield by aircraft plying for hire and reward subject to certain conditions. The airfield is being used for private and charter flights.  Aer Lingus have considered the question of operating regular services from the airfield. Apart from any question as to the extent of the traffic that would be available they do not consider the existing facilities adequate for regular services.  One of the main difficulties is that meteorological forecasts are required for regular services and these could be provided only by stationing forecasting staff at the airfield.  There has been great difficulty in securing such staff for Shannon and Dublin airports and officers have been obtained temporarily from other countries.  Such personnel could not be made available at Farmer's Cross.</P>
      <P>It is proposed to provide a new meteorological station at Roche's Point, County Cork, but this will be concerned only in making observations of the actual weather and will not have any staff competent to make forecasts. It could not, therefore, provide the type of weather service needed at an airfield.</P>
      <P>Preliminary estimates of the cost of the new station at Roche's Point show that the capital cost will be of the order of £3,500 and the annual cost will be about £2,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The production of slates is carried on by private enterprise, and I am not in a position to state the cause of the reduction in the output of slates between the years 1938 and 1948.  I assume that the rate of production is governed by economic factors affecting this particular industry, including the competitiveness of other roofing materials and the trading results experienced by the owners of slate quarries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>How could that be? How could the rate of production be governed by competition from other roofing materials?  I already informed the Parliamentary Secretary that they have orders in hand and if they got no other orders it would take them ten years to comply with the demand. Surely competition is not a factor at all in this matter?  Even the Belfast or Glasgow suppliers would keep them going, not to mind any more.  How is it we could produce 9,676 tons in 1938 and only 3,098 tons in 1948, at a time when the demand was much higher? Will the Parliamentary Secretary agree to draw the attention of the Industrial Development Authority to this matter?</P>

In 1934 a grant of £250 from the Relief Schemes Vote was made available for the opening of this quarry, but it was not taken up at the time and was not renewed.  From the information available to me I would not feel justified in recommending that a grant should now be made; but if a company, with the necessary financial and technical resources, were formed to work the quarry, I should be prepared to consider them for a State mining lease and would also provide them with all the technical information about the quarry available in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would make a last appeal to the Minister to change his attitude on this amendment and to accept it.  I have listened to the arguments put forward, for and against, and while they were very interesting and, of course, important, I feel that <Col N="1927" /> I have to take the question of practical operation into consideration.  I think the Minister should see that the powers that he now proposes to take are very unwise and unsound in principle. This, in my opinion, is a very retrograde step that he proposes.  We have to ask ourselves the question, why were certain matters excepted under the 1933 Land Act, and why did the Government that came into this House with a clear over-all majority in 1933, after a very hard fought election, consider that it was right and proper to except such matters?  Was it not because of the fact that numerous complaints were being made that there had been ministerial and political intervention in the division of land? In fact, the principal matters which were referred to in Section 6 as excepted matters were acquisition, resumption, price and allocation.</P>
      <P>The Minister may say, as he has said on various occasions, that he is doing this for speed.  I cannot see where speed comes into it.  In fact, I believe there will be much greater delay. These matters were excepted because of all the complaining there had been. Now there was a great temptation, in the case of a Government that came in at that time, with an over-all majority, and having such a background of history, to leave matters as they were or, in fact, to further strengthen the hand of its Minister in dealing with acquisition, resumption, price and allocation.  We Deputies from the West felt pretty keenly on that line of action at the time. Naturally enough, we felt that we had got our innings, that we should avail of it and have a levelling up, but better counsels prevailed and, after a good deal of consideration and discussion at our Party meetings, we did give way to common sense and reason, and so the excepted matters were put into the Bill and were enacted by the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Minister is taking back a considerable share of the powers that the then Government divested itself of.  Why is he doing it?  He says, of course, it is for speed, and he also <Col N="1928" /> states that he will delegate his powers to a senior inspector of his Department to carry out.  Nobody can read into this Bill anything other than what is written into it.  If the Minister believes that his statement, that he proposes to delegate his responsibilities to a senior inspector, is going to make for harmony amongst the people concerned, and that it will dispel suspicion and doubt, he is making a very great mistake.  Any Bill that goes through this House in which any section of the community or any individual is interested is just as capable of being interpreted by others as it is by any Deputy, whether he be a legal man or a layman.  Knowing what is in the Bill, they will not be satisfied that the interfering hand of the Minister is not there and nothing will convince them that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>In paragraphs (d) and (e) the Minister is taking back very wide powers.  Everybody knows that, so far as any rearrangement scheme is concerned, if it is to be completed on a fairly satisfactory basis, it will be necessary to take land either in the immediate neighbourhood or elsewhere to make it a workable scheme.  Otherwise, I think there would be no point in trying to bring about any rearrangement. It would hardly be possible to have any rearrangement if there was not additional land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is not so dense as he pretends to be in this matter.  It is all right to plead innocence in order to try to get out of an awkward situation, but I will not accept that from a man of the experience and intelligence of the Minister.  The inspector goes to the locality and, naturally enough, he goes to the people and states that he has come there for the purpose of rearranging their holdings.  In order to try and get agreement he has to give them very full information as to the type of scheme he proposes to prepare.  What will be the answer to him?  The answer will be: &ldquo;We have got to consult with the other members of the household&rdquo;.  They are not going to sign the agreement there and then. They will go back to the household.  We know what human nature is; we know what political feelings are, what political hopes are and what political disappointment is.  One man will be told by his wife: &ldquo;Of course the Minister is the responsible instrument in this case.  There is a nice plot a few hundred yards away from John Murphy.  Did he promise to give you that?&rdquo;  The husband will answer, &ldquo;No, he did not; that is going to another man.&rdquo;  The woman of the house will then say: &ldquo;We expected that we would at least get that and we are going to insist on getting it or you will not sign any agreement.  You will engage a hackney car now and go and see the Minister about it.  He has full authority.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is going to be the position. There are two very historic places in County Mayo already to which pilgrims go from spiritual motives.  We shall now have a third one added to them where they will go henceforward from corporal and material motives.  I have no doubt that the Minister will receive his guest very courteously and civilly. <Col N="1930" /> He will take him into his parlour or drawingroom and they will proceed to discuss the matter.  The Minister will say: &ldquo;I have nothing to do with the preparation of that rearrangement scheme.  I have handed that over to the senior inspector and he has full discretionary powers in the matter&rdquo;. Then the man will say: &ldquo;Not at all. You took the powers.  It was you delegated him to come here, and certainly you can do it if you like&rdquo;.  The parting at the door or the gate will not be nearly as friendly as the meeting was when this man arrived.  Even the hackney car driver will sense the changed atmosphere.  It will be a very silent journey home.  The woman of the house will be very disappointed and will say: &ldquo;That is how Joe has treated us after all we did for him since he started out to be a T.D.  You will not sign a rearrangement scheme until we get that two acres&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not the old way. I challenge anyone to give specific instances of it.  But that is going to be the way now, and that was the way before Section 6 was put into the Land Act of 1933.  Were it not for the fact that I do not want to uproot the past I would give specific instances and bring forward documents to prove that I am right.  That, as I have said, will be the position.  That will be the speed we shall achieve, and that rearrangement scheme will not be finished for the next ten years.  If the Minister is sincerely anxious to speed up rearrangement, and I am sure he is, he should leave the authority with the Land Commission.  He should give that body an outline of Government policy.  The proper thing then for the Land Commission to do would be to delegate their powers to one of their senior inspectors.  They should give him special powers to deal with the problem under their authority and not under the authority of the Minister. We would have satisfaction then and there would be no necessity for a pilgrimage to the Minister's abode, either the present Minister or any <Col N="1931" /> Minister who may follow him.  I believe much greater speed would be achieved in that way, rather than in what the Minister proposes to do under this section with the powers he now proposes to take back.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that board the inspectors had discretionary powers. They were not controlled by the Minister. The Minister cannot tell me anything about land division or Land Acts. I grew up amongst them.  I know all about them.  The powers the Minister proposes to take back under this section may create for the time being a vain hope; but, very shortly, there will be both keen disappointment and suspicion.  That will be the outcome of it.  I do not think we have yet reached the stage where all hope is built upon reason, where disappointment is taken as a cross and suspicion regarded as a temptation that must be resisted.  I do not think we shall ever reach that stage in this world.  I suggest to the Minister that he should accept this amendment in the names of Deputy Cogan and Deputy Moylan.  Surely it cannot be argued by the Minister or anybody else that there is any conspiracy between Deputy Cogan and Deputy Moylan in tabling a motion of this kind.</P>

      <P>I am sure we appear very small in the Minister's eyes, but we must put up with that.  There is no justification for the powers the Minister proposes to take back.  The Taoiseach might just as well come in with a Bill to curtail the power of the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission.  The Minister says, of course, that there are several other excepted matters given now to the Land Commission.  But, as I say, the Taoiseach could just as easily come in and give additional minor <Col N="1932" /> powers to the particular commissions I have mentioned while taking back to himself the right to have appointments made through some deputy of his, that deputy being a senior official in any department of State.  I am sure there would be a swift reaction to that on both sides of the House.  There would be a volume of criticism and resentment.  But the Taoiseach would be quite as well justified in doing that as is the Minister in doing what he proposes to do under this section.  Even at this late hour I appeal to him to take power from himself and give it back to the Land Commission.  I cannot understand the Minister allowing himself to be used as a chopping-block.  That is what he will be.  No matter how strongwilled he may be in resisting the influence and pressure brought to bear on him, there will be endless dissatisfaction. There will be suspicion, whether well-founded or unfounded. Instead of achieving speed in rearrangement and relieving congestion, the powers the Minister proposes to take back will have the opposite effect.</P>

      <P>A good deal of time has been spent on this amendment. There has been a good deal of what can only be described as misrepresentation of the powers sought under this particular section that the amendment proposes to delete.  The solicitude of Deputy Beegan, because of all the trouble I shall bring down upon my head, and of Deputy de Valera, who occupied the time of the House with purely delaying tactics, almost makes my heart bleed.  I never knew I had such good friends on the Opposition. It struck me while Deputy Beegan was speaking that he missed his vocation in life.  He should have been on the stage.  He painted a dramatic picture of these petitioners at the new shrine. I did not expect Deputy Beegan to descend to that level.  In view of the deliberate refusal of the Opposition to accept exactly what is in the Bill, backed up by what I have said in the House, I think I must repeat it again. Both Deputy Moran and Deputy Beegan tried, though not very successfully, to give a faint impression that powers of resumption and acquisition were being taken here.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to muscle in he can do so, but I shall not follow him along that path.  My main concern is to relieve congestion.  I stated that on the first occasion on which I moved an Estimate here.  It is an evil that has confronted successive native Governments, including the present one.  I do not impute blame to anyone.  I do not think Governments should stand idly by and see that evil without making some attempt to remedy it.  So far no such attempt has been made.  Perhaps Fianna Fáil did its best in the light of its knowledge. It is a significant fact, however, that there were seven Ministers for Lands during that régime and not one of them came from a congested area.  I <Col N="1934" /> do not think it is fair to ask those who do not know the area to tackle such a complex problem.  It requires an intimate knowledge from childhood up. There must have been some in the Fianna Fáil Party who understood the problem.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that, while a certain amount of land was divided, the 1946 Act had to be introduced to dispossess those who got land under the Fianna Fáil régime, but who were not working it or using it.  It was clear proof that the land which was bought and purchased with the taxpayers' money and which should have been devoted to the relief of congestion was given to the wrong class. I must say in favour of the previous Government that when they realised they made a blunder they did their best to set the matter right.</P>
      <P>No power of acquisition or resumption is being sought in this Bill. The power of allotment of additions to old holdings on the one hand or the allotment of new holdings on the other hand is specifically safeguarded because I have adopted some of the excepted matters of the 1933 Act and re-embodied them here.  I do not know where Deputy Major de Valera received his tuition&mdash;although I have a shrewd suspicion&mdash;but he left me powerless to attack him because he qualified every second sentence by saying: &ldquo;I must admit that I know nothing about the problem.&rdquo;  Nevertheless he did his best to convey that the Minister, under this rearrangement business, has power to allot a new holding.  That is not true.  I should like to see Deputy Moylan going back as Minister for Lands and telling the Commissioners that he had power to allot a new holding.  He knows well what they would tell him while paragraph (f) is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relieving of congestion means rearrangement in a vast number of cases.  I cannot see how any Deputy&mdash;particularly a Deputy from the congested areas&mdash;who has the interests of these people at heart, can conscientiously delay a measure which he knows is going to do good for these people.  If an inspector is given a task he is either fit for it or he is not. <Col N="1935" /> If the Minister tries to do it himself he will find that many other weightier things in the Department will go undone. Unfortunately a Minister cannot even attend to the bigger matters as fully as he would like to most of the time.  He has not time to give even slight attention to small matters like this in some cases.</P>
    <P>While there are people in Ireland and while there are Deputies coming to this Dáil, and while time is time people will approach Deputies and Ministers and ask them to do something for them.  That is perfectly natural.  However, I hold, as Deputy Beegan holds, that wiser counsels will always prevail.  I am often asked by some of my supporters to do things for them which are impossible, and sometimes they are not too pleased.  However, I am not going to tell them that I can do something for them which I cannot do.  I am not going to take from one man what the Department would normally give him in order to rob him and give it to another man. Some day I shall have to meet the Supreme Judge, and I shall have enough to answer for besides that sort of behaviour.  It does not matter whether it is the Minister, the inspector or the Commissioners who sanction it.  The important thing is that the tenants themselves sanction it.  I can guarantee that you cannot have severer critics than these people who are watching one another.  The old scheme did not work.  Rearrangement schemes were agreed to by the tenants after the inspectors had, on many occasions, spent weeks and sometimes months reducing a bad rundale or a badly mixed townland into some kind of order on the map and getting the tenant to agree to it.  The delay occurred after the matter left the hands of the inspector.  That was the trouble.  The main thing is to get the tenant to agree, and after that to get sanction instantly for the scheme before there is time for a change.</P>
    <P>I asked the Opposition to put down an amendment on the Report Stage, if they could, in order to make this more watertight.  They have absolutely refused to take up the challenge.  There is no intention&mdash;nor is there room in <Col N="1936" /> this Bill, as far as I can see&mdash;of the Minister taking unto himself the power of the allotment of holdings or of additions to holdings.  The only additional power is the readoption of the old Congested Districts Board system&mdash;that a senior inspector would have the sanctioning of a rearrangement scheme on the spot.  In view of the fact that the Opposition cannot make the matter more watertight than it is, I shall ask the Department to put the matter under the microscope and to see if there is any loophole although I do not think there is and I cannot see one.  If, by any chance, there should be a loophole, I shall bring in an amendment on the Report Stage seeing that the Opposition are not doing so.</P>

      <P>The only flaw, according to the Opposition, is that the Minister is going to bring a lot of trouble down on his shoulders.  The present amendment is going back to the system which obtained since the 1933 Act which has left something like 16,000 tenants in the country in the plight they are in and which has been largely responsible for the flight from the land.  Deputy Beegan has such villages in his constituency.  He knows that it would be absolutely inhuman and uncivilised to ask young men to remain on there and to live the life which their fathers have lived before them.  If it is a crime to bring in a Bill to this House to come to the rescue of these people, I gladly shoulder responsibility for that crime. I have been in Roscommon and I have seen villages there.  A few nights ago Deputy Fagan revealed what I did not think existed, that is, a bad case in Westmeath&mdash;a county which we regarded as being fairly completely settled.  Has the Deputy been in Kerry?  Has he been in the Rosses in Donegal?  Has he ever been in County Leitrim?  We must not forget County Cavan&mdash;a county about which we hear little but which, nevertheless, has its own congestion problems.  Very few <Col N="1937" /> counties have not.  I am asking for that power and let me say without any ambiguity that there is no authority for the Minister to allot a new holding or to allot an addition out of a farm to an existing holding as was done in the past.  The power I am asking for under the section is that when the tenants themselves agree on the rearrangement the senior inspector will be able to sanction it before, for instance, any mischief-maker can stir up trouble or before, perhaps, some person dies in the village and makes a complete change, or something like that.  I am sure that the majority of the Deputies who are anxious to come to the rescue of the people will agree that that is reasonable.  I have very little time for the Judases who had the cheek to ask these people for their votes at the time of the election and who are now trying to impede this Bill because it is good just as they impeded the Local Authorities (Works) Act last year.</P>

      <P>Let the Deputy keep quiet until I have finished.  Our objection to the section, and particularly to paragraphs (d) and (e), is that we <Col N="1938" /> want to take away from the Minister the powers which he proposes to assume under this section.  It is a very simple matter.  These are powers that were never exercised by the political head of the Department before.  I do not see what great objection the Minister could have to the amendments put down to this section.  If the Minister is anxious to do what he purports to do, if he is anxious to get on with the job, why should he take upon himself the allotment of lands under paragraphs (d) and (e) of Section 10? Speaking here a few nights ago, Deputy T. F. O'Higgins said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You must get the agreement; you must be in a position to enforce it there and then.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>And the Minister added:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the spot; that is the principle.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Will the Minister or anybody behind him tell us how he is going to deal with the matter on the spot by the powers he proposes to take under Section 10?  The Minister knows quite well that if he sends a junior inspector into a congested area, and if that inspector can get the people to sign a provisional agreement, it commits the tenants but it does not commit the Land Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to know how, under this section, the Minister is going to deal with the rearrangement of land on the spot, by transferring the power of rearranging land from the Land Commission to the Minister, the political head of the Land Commission. The Minister may have done it at other times but he cannot do it now.  He will not now have time to walk the Peyton estate or to walk the lands at Kiltarsaghan.  He will have to send one of his minions down to deal with this matter, and under this section he will have the names submitted to him. He will have deputations from John Browne and John Jones to see who is going to get land in that particular area.  Anybody who would suggest that where there is a rundale system in existence it can be solved without getting people out of the area or without making land available to enlarge the holdings simply does not know what he is talking about.  The first essential is to get one or two men out of the area and to acquire land in order to satisfy the demands of those who are ready to swap their fields for those of their neighbours.  A man may swap a field which has been in possession of his family for years in consideration of the fact that another field may be given to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The crime I am talking about is that the Minister is the man who is going to decide the claims of his own Clann na Talmhan supporters in the area.  That is the objection which we are making.  The Minister knows quite well that before any rearrangement takes place some people will be migrated.  How the lands of these people are going to be acquired is another matter.  The Minister had his tongue in his cheek when he quoted paragraph (f) of this Bill.  I direct the attention of the House to what is contained in that paragraph&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the determination of the new holding which is to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose holding has been acquired or resumed by the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1941" /> The Minister suggested that under paragraph (f) there was room for all and sundry by the Land Commission. If you examine paragraph (f) it purports to deal only with new holdings to be provided for a tenant or proprietor whose holding has been acquired or resumed by the Land Commission. The Minister wanted to hold up paragraph (f) as a protection for the whole country against the powers he proposes to take under paragraphs (d) and (e) He knew well that that paragraph applied only to holdings acquired or resumed.  How is that going to limit the powers reserved by the Minister under paragraphs (d) and (e), and particularly if you look at sub-section (2), which says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Any power or duty for the time being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the lay commissioners may, save in relation to excepted matters, be exercised or performed by&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the Minister...</P>
    <P>The Minister takes the power under this sub-section of allotment and he knows&mdash;nobody knows better&mdash;that he is taking power to dish out the parcels of land necessary to be dished out in a congested area in order to get the tenants to agree to a scheme.  He knows that different threats have been, and I suppose still will be used by the Land Commission inspectors in order to get tenants to agree to a scheme.</P>

      <P>When I put down this amendment it was mainly with the intention of clarifying the position, safeguarding the position.  I felt there was a danger embodied in this new departure, a danger not only to the people in the particular districts affected, but to every farmer in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point, but we have a terrible lot of control over the Minister.  The people who live in the county which the Minister represents can exercise a considerable amount of control over him.  Because <Col N="1945" /> of that there is no analogy whatever between the old Congested Districts Board and the Minister.  The Minister, we must remember, is a Deputy elected on a democratic franchise in a county where this scheme is to operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>But this is one county where it is to be operated.  There is no use in comparing the position of the old Congested Districts Board with what the position will be under this Bill.  The old Congested Districts Board was, to a great extent, as independent of popular pressure as the Land Commission is to-day or perhaps even more so.  The Minister made what I thought was a rather good point to-day when he said that we were urging the Land Commission to speed up while their two feet were tied together, and he more or less implied that the purpose of this section was to untie the feet of the Land Commission.  But that is not the position.  The purpose of this section is to take administration in this respect out of the hands of the Land Commission altogether.  In other words, instead of untying the feet of the Land Commission we are putting them out of the race altogether and putting in another athlete, the Minister himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only difference between a senior inspector and the Land Commission is that the former is subject to direct instructions from the Minister and is under his authority. The Land Commission is an independent body.  That is the fundamental difference.  As long as you have the allocation of land administered by a senior inspector acting under the authority of the Minister, it is exactly the same as if the Minister himself were allocating the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that sub-section (2) of the section makes that very clear.  It says that &ldquo;any power or duty...being vested by law (including this Act) in the Land Commission or the lay commissioners may, save in relation to <Col N="1946" /> excepted matters, be exercised or performed by the Minister or any officer of the Minister or the Land Commission.&rdquo; Therefore, the Minister is the officer who administers this particular section which is excluded from the power of the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think we are all agreed, or ought to be agreed, that nothing is more essential than that each individual farmer should feel a sense of security in the occupation and ownership of his farm, and that nothing should be done to weaken that sense of security.  It is strengthened by reason of the fact that two powers are vested in the Land Commission and not in the Minister, first, the power to decide what particular land is to be acquired, and, secondly, the power to decide to whom the land is to be given. These are the two great pillars on which a farmer's security rests, because if any political party had the power to decide whose farm was to be taken or to whom it was to be given, then every farmer would become a tenant at will. But, because the Land Commission is there and has security of tenure itself, and because its officials cannot be removed, by reason of their determination as to what land is to be acquired and to whom it is to be given, farmers have a certain sense of security.  Now, for the first time in a number of years, that power is being weakened to a considerable extent.</P>

      <P>Well, we are taking from the Land Commission the power to deal with certain problems of land allocation which they formerly dealt with, and we are putting it into the hands of the Minister.  Nothing could be clearer than that in the Bill.  A question may arise as to the extent of the power that we are taking from the Land Commission and transferring to the Minister. We are taking the power to deal with all those congested districts in which rearrangement is required. Everybody who knows anything about the congested districts and who has taken part in the debate, has pointed out that in almost all those congested districts the holdings are intermixed and require rearrangement.  Therefore, the amount of rearrangement that will require to be done will be very considerable. The Minister has pointed out that there are seven or eight counties in which this problem arises in an acute form.  Therefore, it is clear that a considerable amount of the work of the Land Commission is being transferred to the Minister.  We have to realise what that means.  It means that a Deputy can come into this House and ask the Minister why he gave a patch of the land on John Murphy's holding to Deputy Moran's friend, John Brown.</P>

      <P>Deputies may question the Minister in regard to the manner in which land is distributed and even in regard to the grievances of people who think that they did not get the good piece of land which they expected. There is, of course, the other aspect of it also.  As to the position of persons who are taken out of these congested areas and given holdings in order to carry out a rearrangement scheme, the Minister says he has not power to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  A question arises in practically every rearrangement scheme of migrating a tenant or a number of tenants out of a congested village to a new holding.  It is not the Minister who moves them.  That is still part of the Land Commission's work, because the question of supplying them with a new holding is, under paragraph (f), one for the commissioners, and the problem of resuming or acquiring the holding which they have left behind by virtue of a deed of surrender is also part of the Land Commission's work. It is a bit involved, but that is quite clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section as it stands would give the Minister power to allocate a holding to a person who was transferred by reason of a rearrangement scheme in order to facilitate that scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that this should be settled by agreement, if possible. I think the Minister indicated on several occasions that he contemplated bringing in further amendments on the Report Stage.  I appeal to him to accept the two amendments, with the reservation that he will put down a further amendment on the Report Stage.  Certainly I am anxious to help the Minister to deal with this problem. I am satisfied that he is taking an unwise step in withdrawing from the <Col N="1949" /> Land Commission this particular power. He ought to leave the Land Commission with the powers they have.  If, for some reason, the Land Commission are not acting efficiently, then we can provide machinery at a later stage to speed up their operations.  On occasions, it is stated that the courts are not able to deal with all the cases which come before them speedily enough.  I am sure, however, that there would be an uproar on all sides of the House if the Minister for Justice were to come in here and demand that certain of the cases which come before the courts should be handed over to the local superintendent or to the Minister to be dealt with by officers of his Department. The Minister is taking a somewhat similar step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the administration of justice, the matter could be rectified by appointing an additional district justice or two.  If the Minister thinks the Land Commission are not sufficiently strong to deal with this matter, it should be possible to appoint junior commissioners to deal with it.  They would deal with it as effectively as any senior inspector. They would have the advantage of not being subject to political control and that is the thing we want to avoid. We do not want to have a position in which any Minister can be accused of allocating a piece of land to his friends and excluding his political opponents. We do not want to have a position in which rearrangement schemes and the allocation of land will perhaps become the subject of heated discussions at meetings of local political clubs.  At present there is some protection provided as between the Minister and those who are claiming land that they are not perhaps entitled to.  We have a judicial body with security of tenure to deal with this problem and I think the Minister would be right to leave this whole matter in their hands and, on the Report Stage, to make provision for the speeding up of their operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the officers of my Department and myself could <Col N="1950" /> get words to safeguard what the Deputy has in mind, we have done so. What I said was that between this and the Report Stage I shall ask the officers of my Department to scrutinise this again.  I threw down a challenge to Deputy Moylan, but he did not seem to take it up.  As he has not taken it up, I will have this re-examined to see if there is any means of tightening it up or making it more certain.  I think I should state for the information of Deputies who are not familiar with the working of the Land Commission that there are two schemes, one which is mentioned in the Bill and one which is not.  There is the rearrangement scheme, which is mentioned, and there is the migration scheme, which is also in operation.  The two go side by side and are complementary to each other. The Minister is not having anything to do with the migration scheme and, as I said, I shall take good care that I will not.  The rearrangement scheme is not a matter for the Minister either.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy might be able to help me out with an amendment between this and the Report Stage?  The rearrangement scheme is not mine; it is not Deputy Moran's or Deputy Cogan's scheme. It is not the Land Commission inspector's scheme.  It is the scheme that the tenants themselves will agree upon.  As to what happened in the past, there was one case where a rearrangement scheme was attempted 21 years ago and it has failed all down the years since.  Agreement had been reached amongst the tenants 11 times. Deputies can imagine the amount of time that was spent and the amount of paper that was used in connection with that case.  If there was somebody with authority to say: &ldquo;Go ahead, as the tenants are all in agreement&rdquo;, the thing would have been done long ago. Eleven different inspectors were sent down there during a period of 21 years and it is only a few weeks ago that the case was finally settled.</P>

      <P>Suppose you had tried to hold them to the agreement and one man has a piece of land the size of the carpet here and another has a piece elsewhere.  How are you going to compel one of these men to surrender a piece of land?  It cannot be done. You cannot compel a man to move out of his own dwelling-house and build a new one, although the Land Commission might be providing almost the full cost of building the new house on another plot, unless you get the full co-operation and goodwill of all the tenants concerned and unless they know what they are getting.  They study these schemes under a microscope and by the time one has the agreement of all the tenants in a rundale village, one can sanction that scheme straightaway with complete confidence that it is a good scheme because not one of those tenants would allow a neighbour to get as much extra land over and above himself as he could cover with his two feet.</P>

      <P>Even with all the hampering restrictions on rearrangement imposed by the 1933 Act, I am glad of the speed with which rearrangement schemes are going through.  The only difficulty is that a number of them cannot yet be sanctioned, and I walk daily in terror that some of these schemes on which agreement has been reached may fall through by the time the tortuous channel of legal formalities is completed.  It is a waste of taxpayers' money to ask inspectors to go out day after day, time and time again to these places, as they have been requested to do in the past by Deputies and others.  Scheme after scheme falls through simply because there is no one on the spot to say: &ldquo;Go ahead with the scheme; it must be a good one if all the tenants are agreed&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am all at one with the Minister when he says that his objective is speed.  A few moments ago he disclaimed any desire to take any powers to frame the scheme.  As a matter of fact he has an amendment down to delete the word &ldquo;framed&rdquo; from sub-section (1).  Therefore, all the Minister on his own showing is claiming is power to approve a scheme either on his own initiative or through a senior inspector. Heretofore inspectors of the Land Commission who went around rearranging rundale estates have had to seek the permission of the tenants before they drew up any sort of a scheme.  I take it that the bones of the scheme had to be indicated to the tenants before he was able to make even tentative proposals, and that when he got consent to the scheme it was sent on to Dublin.  The Minister's complaint is that in the interval the consents were very often withdrawn by the tenants.  What guarantee has he or what assurance can he give us, that if his senior inspector now approves of a scheme&mdash;which, the Minister says, will not be framed by the inspector but by the tenants themselves&mdash;which has been drawn up by the tenants themselves they will not even now under this Bill withdraw the consent again before it has been carried out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience is this. An inspector went to a place and, whether it was rundale or rigdale or whatever other mixture the tenants were afflicted with, he indicated to the people who owned those plots what he proposed to do.  He could not draw up the most tentative scheme without an indication of what he proposed to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1956" /> He got some sort of provisional consent from them.  The Minister knows that very often these provisional consents were withdrawn before the plans were implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be interested only when full agreement amongst all the tenants had been reached.  I think it is very bad when a year or more elapses before sanction is given during which time conditions in villages change, which might cause the whole thing to go up in smoke.</P>

What is gained by (d) (1)&mdash;&ldquo;the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land&rdquo;?  Is there not a clear suggestion there that, in the giving of the rearranged portions of a townland to persons, the persons who receive them are, under this section, being called allottees?</P>

      <P>The Minister, in one of the additional amendments of which he has given notice, proposes to cut out the word &ldquo;frame&rdquo;, which would seem to indicate he was taking some powers to start a scheme.  All I can say is that I object in the strongest possible manner to his naming the allottees.  I believe it is a new principle and it is an entirely wrong one. It is being accepted by his own supporters because they think he is taking powers to speed up rearrangement, which he is not.  If he took these powers it would sugar-coat the pill to <Col N="1959" /> some extent but he is not taking the powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been referring to two things.  He is talking about amending the section so as to meet the point of view that he was not taking these powers.  He has referred to paragraph (f) of the sub-section. I ask the Minister has he appreciated that paragraph (f) does not qualify of necessity the operation of paragraph (d), having relation to the remaining words at the end of the section?  In addition to that, there is material upon which paragraph (f) can operate&mdash;namely, it operates on land acquired or resumed <i>simpliciter</i> quite apart from a rearrangement scheme. The point is that where you have two paragraphs in a Bill, when it comes to interpretation, the court will try to give them a separate and distinct meaning and not regard them as redundant or repetitive.  Therefore if as a matter of fact paragraph (f) can operate without any arrangement, paragraph (f) does not come into the picture at all.  If paragraph (d) then, taken with the rest of the section stands and the section is passed in its present form, the Minister will, willy nilly have in his hand power by himself to deal, so to speak, privately as Minister both with the allocation and the price of land in the congested districts.  What is more he can do that apparently in the name of the Land Commission if he wants to.  The point I want to put to the Minister now to appreciate is that this paragraph (f) does not amend it at all.  If he wants to take these powers I suggest that he take them openly but if he does not want to take them then the obvious thing is to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I have been wondering, after listening to the various arguments, why the Minister cannot accept the amendment.  He has challenged the House to frame an amendment to meet the problem in a better way than he proposes to meet it.  Has the Land Commission failed in its job seeing that the Minister now wants to take it over?  The Minister <Col N="1960" /> is slighting the Land Commission as a responsible body of officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can appoint an inspector.  Why cannot the Land Commission have the same powers or are we to have this dictatorial attitude of the Minister in bringing in this section to nominate his own inspector?  I object to the principle because I regard this as a definitely partisan attitude on the part of the Minister.  He may not intend to abuse this power but some other Minister may come along and abuse it.  If this principle is adopted by other Ministers then we are going to have partisan legislation.  I put it to the Minister that, if the Minister for Local Government wants to appoint an inspector to allocate houses, it amounts to the same thing.  If the Minister for Defence wants to do a job, he can do the same. The Minister for Health can appoint doctors and do away with the Local Appointments Commission.  The Minister for Agriculture can instruct his inspectors whose land is to be taken.</P>
      <P>I am objecting on principle to taking power from the Land Commission because the division of land is a national problem and should be left in the hands of the Land Commission or some independent body.  No Minister of State should have the allotting of land left in his hands.  Here the Minister is definitely taking over from the Land Commission a job that was theirs before he took office.  As Deputy Beegan said, when the Fianna Fáil Government came into office and passed the 1933 Land Act they did not take such power.</P>

      <P>He realised it should not be given to partisan people. So far as I can see, the trend is towards dictatorial legislation.  If the lay commissioners are not able to rearrange holdings they should not be there at all. This rearrangement should be left to the Land Commission.  If, as other Deputies have said here, the Minister tries to get in that backdoor legislation and tells us that he is not taking power from the Land Commission, then he must think we are very dull people. Surely Deputies on this side of the House should have some say?  We are anxious to see that the Minister will not have power to rearrange allotments in favour of his own friends.  We want to see the land divided by an independent body in the national interest, irrespective of what people's political views are.  We did not take such power during our period of office.</P>

I ask the Minister to accept this very judicious amendment, which was put down not alone for the good of the Bill, but in the interests of posterity, because any other unscrupulous Minister can dish out land to his supporters.</P>

I say one objective we might turn our minds to in the discussion of this Bill is to try to get into the minds of the people in the congested districts that no matter how hard we work, no matter how good our intentions, no matter how much land we acquire, resume or divide, we cannot deal with one-tenth of the problem in the congested districts.</P>

      <P>The Minister spoke about the 1946 Act, about Fianna Fáil having had to bring in that Act because of certain things that happened in the way of land division. These things cannot be avoided, no matter how honestly any Minister works.  It would be better nationally for all of us if we could take merely one subject into consideration&mdash;that is, the relief of congestion.  If we could deal merely with the relief of congestion we would be doing far better national work than if we were dealing with any other problem, but unfortunately, human nature being as it is, we cannot bring people from Mayo, <Col N="1963" /> Donegal, Galway, Cork and Kerry into County Meath, County Tipperary or any other county without taking into consideration the outlook and the desires and the opposition of the people who live in these particular districts.  Deputy McQuillan will find that even in County Roscommon there will be definite opposition to the bringing in of men from an outside county while landless men are making demands in Roscommon.</P>
      <P>The argument against the 1946 Act is based on a completely wrong conception. It was because so much was done that the 1946 Act had to be brought in.  Human nature being what it is, we have to provide a sanitary cordon in County Meath and elsewhere around the people from the West.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate provides for meeting increased expenditure in <Col N="1964" /> respect of certain services included in the Vote for Public Works. and Buildings and a deficiency in the estimated amount of Appropriations-in-Aid, offset to some extent by savings on other services.  The gross additional expenditure is estimated at £195,690, the deficiency in receipts at £6,000 and the savings on other sub-heads at £34,990, leaving a net shortage of £166,700 for which the Supplementary Estimate will require to be voted.</P>
      <P>Of the gross shortage the greater part, £115,000, is in respect of sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions.  This sub-head was the subject of a previous Supplementary Estimate passed by the Dáil on the 15th December, 1949.  As I explained on that occasion this is a sub-head which in most years has shown a saving as a result of sundry unforeseen circumstances which tend to retard or suspend some of the numerous individual works covered by the sub-head, and each year allowance is made for this factor by way of a deduction from the gross total of the provision for the individual works.  In the original Estimate for this year a deduction of £210,385 was made from the gross Estimate of £810,385 for sub-head B, reducing the provision to a net sum of £600,000, this being the amount suggested by experience as likely to be spent.</P>
      <P>As already indicated to the Dáil this calculation was upset by the more rapid progress made with the programme due to such matters as exceptionally fine weather and the easier supply of materials.  Provision was made by Supplementary Estimate to meet an additional expenditure of £125,000 on the sub-head, but owing to the largely unpredictable effect of the factors mentioned it has been found that this sum will not suffice to meet the expenditure now anticipated in the current year.  It is necessary to ask for a further provision of £115,000 of which the greater part, £105,000 is in respect of grants for the building or improvement of national schools.  The balance of £10,000 is apportionable over the numerous works comprising the sub-head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under sub-head A, which is largely <Col N="1965" /> a contingency provision, a shortage of £5,000 is anticipated consequent on an unforeseen expenditure of about £18,000 on the purchase of new premises for the Legation at Washington.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head C&mdash;Maintenance and Supplies and sub-head D (1)&mdash;Furniture, Fittings and Utensils, additional sums of £20,000 and £15,000, respectively, are required owing to increased demands generally and, in the case of premises abroad, to devaluation.  The latter factor, together with changes in rental terms and increased rates, accounts also for the additional sum of £17,000 required under sub-head E&mdash; Rents, Rates, etc.</P>
    <P>The provision of £2,500 under sub-head D (2)&mdash;Central Furniture Stores &mdash;is in respect of unforeseen bulk purchases.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £1,190 required under sub-head J (4)&mdash;River Fergus Drainage&mdash;is to cover the outstanding balance of payments on foot of the State contribution of £2,500 towards the cost of the acquisition of lands by the Clare County Council.  We had been given to understand that this amount would have been payable before the 31st March, 1949, but it is now necessary to provide for payment maturing in the present financial year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head K (3)&mdash;Central Engineering Workshop and Stores&mdash;it is necessary to ask for an additional sum of £20,000.  As Deputies are aware the gross provision in this sub-head each year is offset by amounts chargeable to other sub-heads, for example, to sub-head J (2)&mdash;Arterial Drainage Construction Works and sub-head K (2) &mdash;Maintenance of Engineering Plant and Machinery.  The amounts thus chargeable are expected to be less than was anticipated when the original Estimate was made.  There will be corresponding savings on the sub-heads mentioned.</P>
    <P>There will be a deficiency of £6,000 in the amount of receipts from rents and fines as the outcome of a property transaction which was expected to realise a substantial fine, is now doubtful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to get a little additional information from the Parliamentary Secretary on one or two <Col N="1966" /> of the sub-heads.  On sub-head E&mdash; Rents, Rates, etc.&mdash;there is an increase of £17,000.  I should like to know the reason for that.  Is it due to increases in this country or to Legations abroad or to a combination of both?  I observe that there is an additional sum of £1,190 required in connection with the Fergus Drainage Act.  I should like to know why it was that the original sum was only £110, and why there should be this jump of £1,190?  Surely, it should have been possible to foresee, when the original Estimate was being prepared, that this larger sum would be required in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  Under sub-head B, there is provision for an expenditure of £105,000 on schools.  I think no one in the House will quarrel with that.  The more expenditure there is on that sub-head the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but the £105,000 is expressly earmarked for schools.  I think every Deputy will agree with that, because we all know that a lot of our schools are in a very bad condition, and that they need to be put into a proper state of repair so as to make them suitable for the children.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary a question with regard to the building of schools where, say, a question arises as to title to the site.  I have in mind a case which has arisen in my constituency. The materials&mdash;a good part of them&mdash; required have been actually placed on the site.  Work on the building was <Col N="1967" /> about to commence when a question of title to the site was raised by an adjoining landowner.  I am not suggesting that the Board of Works is to blame in any way for what has happened, but I do want to bring to the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary that the job has been suspended for a very long time, and, apparently, nobody is in a position to take the initiative in getting whatever difficulty has arisen resolved.</P>
      <P>Where a matter of that sort arises, where it has come to the point of building and the Board of Works is definitely brought into it, I want to suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Board of Works might use their good offices to see that whoever is responsible for a difficulty of that kind would be got down to the job of trying to bring about a settlement.</P>

      <P>I can understand the Parliamentary Secretary might not be able to give the information asked for, but I must say that I regard the information I have got as entirely unsatisfactory. This is a large sum for what seems to be a rather small item. The original Estimate was around £34,000 and now we are asked for an additional £15,000 and we are told that £4,000 of it is in respect of changes which took place abroad as a result of devaluation.  I should like to be told whether it is in respect of our office in America or in some other country that this £4,000 is being spent.  I think the House is entitled to an explanation as to where this additional £11,000 is being spent at home for furniture, fittings and utensils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is accounted for by movements of staff in the Land Commission and in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  That is why we are responsible for it.  Of course, it all comes before the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  If the Deputy has any doubt about it, we can fully account for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the <Col N="1970" /> Government expect us to do in regard to this.  We have a duty to discharge when the approval of the House is being sought for the spending of money.  That approval will be granted provided we get what I regard as proper information.  We have from time to time reports as to alterations and changes which are being made in Government buildings and offices designed for the accommodation of Ministers.  If any of this sum is being spent in the Department of External Affairs, the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Local Government or the Department of Health for the additional accommodation of Ministers, for the improvement of their offices and for their better equipment so far as furniture is concerned, we are entitled to be told where the additional furniture, fittings and utensils are going.</P>
      <P>I must say that on a Supplementary Estimate of this kind, though I had not adverted to this fact when coming into the House, it is scarcely fair to ask me to allow it to pass without a division because of the lack of information on the matter.  On the basis of the information obtained from the Parliamentary Secretary, I could not in conscience allow the Estimate to pass without challenging a division.</P>

    <P>SECTION 1</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In lines 17 and 18 to delete all words after &ldquo;until&rdquo; to the end of the section and substitute &ldquo;the last day of December, 1950&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is a simple amendment to this short measure and I do not think the Minister should have any serious objection to accepting it.  The Bill itself is designed to secure the suspension of the Flax Act of 1936.  My amendment will secure that purpose with the limitation that the purpose of the suspension will only be secured until the 31st of December of this year when the Minister can, if he thinks fit, come to the House again and ask the House, if the circumstances so warrant, for a further period of suspension.  The fact of his coming here will enable him to give the House and the country some information on the position in regard to the whole flax business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say, too, that I am rather suspicious of this short Bill.  It seems to me to convey the Minister's desire to secure here a condition whereby he will not again have to come before this Assembly in order that a discussion such as the one we have already had would take place and, as a result of that, he provided in this section which I am proposing to amend that the Flax Act of 1936. will be suspended until <Col N="1973" /> such time as the Government think otherwise.  I believe, from my experience over the past two years, that such freedom and such liberty are undesirable. I believe that the suspension should be granted but for a limited period and that if it is found to be necessary the Minister can then come forward with the same Bill and the same phraseology and we can have the advantage of a discussion on this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Smith would appear to overlook the fact that it is open to him at any time he wishes to discuss any matter to put down a motion and, inasmuch as he is a member of the Front Bench of the Opposition, it would be the duty of the Government to provide Government time to discuss any serious topic which a speaker from the Opposition Front Bench has submitted to the House for discussion.  I cannot recollect any occasion on which a responsible opposition member has asked for that concession when it has not been very readily forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith seems to forget what he himself said.  He brought a Bill, virtually identical with this Bill, before Dáil Éireann to suspended the Flax Act.  At column 236 of the Official Reports of the Parliamentary Debates of the 23rd January, 1947, Deputy Smith said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This suspensory Bill merely gives scope and freedom to do something in the flax growers' interest which would not be so easy to do if the 1936 Act were to continue to operate.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Can it be that Deputy Smith wishes his successor in office to be restricted with the shackles of the 1936 Act when he himself three years ago declared that in order to free himself to serve the best interests of the flax growers he was coming to the House to relieve himself of the statutory obligations put upon him by that Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with the difficulty of finding adequate parliamentary time to provide the Opposition with the fullest scope for their legitimate duty of criticism and inquiry.  The sole object I had in mind in suspending the <Col N="1974" /> Flax Act of 1936 until such time as it was thought expedient to revive it was to avoid the necessity of having a First Stage, a Second Stage, a Committee Stage, a Report Stage and a Fifth Stage of a Flax Act in Dáil Éireann every year and the same procedure in Seanad Éireann.  If I, as Minister for Agriculture, want the powers of the Flax Act, I will revive the Act.  If I do not want them, and if Deputy Smith thinks I ought to have them, there is no conceivable restriction on his right to put down a motion to the effect that Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the Government ought to revive the Flax Act.  But surely I must suspect that Deputy Smith is not wholly disinterested in this amendment when there can be no conceivable grounds advanced which could appeal to the reason of any rational man for imposing on Oireachtas Éireann the necessity of passing a Bill through five stages in the Dáil and in the Seanad each year when exactly the same purpose could be served by submitting a resolution?</P>
    <P>It has been suggested&mdash;and possibly some Deputies, like Deputy Maguire, were under some misapprehension about this matter&mdash;that the flax legislation was designed to protect a thriving agricultural occupation of a number of hardworking farmers in certain restricted areas in the country.  I think I have explained to Deputy Maguire that that was quite a mistake, that there was no such situation obtaining. I think it was Deputy Smith who went on to say that the Flax Board had been functioning for years in the Department, and he asked what had become of it.  The Flax Board was set up in 1943, I think, to distribute money which was provided by the British Government to enable scutch mills to be equipped so that the British Government could get the flax which they wanted for aeroplanes.  It had never existed before.  Its sole purpose was to distribute money which the British Government paid to the Irish Government for the purpose, with a view to maximising the production of flax and linen required for the aeroplane industry.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Smith desired that this matter should be further <Col N="1975" /> postponed to this stage so that he might elicit further information about certain matters.  He could get this information as readily by putting down a parliamentary question if it is too much trouble to put down a motion. There is no means available to me if I wanted&mdash;which I do not&mdash;to withhold information from any Deputy of the House and there is no means available to me, if ordinary parliamentary procedure is to be observed, which I sincerely hope it will, whereby I could resist a debate on flax whenever the Front Bench of the Opposition expressed their desire to have it.</P>

      <P>It may seem somewhat strange that I could have disposed of the arguments to which we have just listened in advance.  In fact, I have here before me a number of notes I prepared which would show that I was perfectly conscious of the case the Minister would make in resisting the amendment which I have tabled.  I knew that I would be told that Question Time was designed for the purpose of facilitating private Deputies and members of the Opposition to elicit information on matters affecting the public.  I knew I would be told that, in the event of a Minister refusing to give this information, or in the event of our failing to get the fullest possible information by way of supplementary question, we could avail of half an hour on the Adjournment to raise at more <Col N="1976" /> length the particular matter in which we are interested.  I knew in advance that the Minister would say that as a member of the Front Bench Opposition, I could have tabled a motion dealing with this matter at any time and that if the Whips of our Party approached the Government Whips, time would be made available for discussion not only on this but on any other question which we wished to raise.  I was fully aware of the fact that the Minister would advance these arguments.  I refrained from dealing with them in advance but I shall deal with them now.</P>
      <P>When in 1949 questions were tabled here by Deputies Maguire and Mrs. Rice dealing with the flax situation, I can recall very well as I am sure can other members of the House, the attitude adopted by the Minister.  He warned them that they were tying his hands, that he was engaged in a discussion with Northern spinners, and that their questions were inopportune and unhelpful.  That was all designed, of course, to frighten them away from a discussion on this particular matter but, at a later stage through the Information Bureau, a history of the negotiations on the flax question was released to the public and an announcement was made to the effect that the Minister had thrown up his hands in despair of solving the problem of arriving at an agreement with the Six-County spinners in regard to a price for last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is designed to show, when the House is invited to take advantage of the opportunities that have been cited by the Minister for a discussion of this or any other subject, that we did on previous occasions take advantage of their facilities and we were told that we were crippling his efforts, tying his hands and sabotaging the Minister in his endeavours to secure a suitable agreement for our growers.  I am trying to demonstrate that even at a later stage after a statement was conveyed through the Information Bureau to the public, setting out the history of these discussions, I asked further parliamentary questions here, and not being satisfied with the reply, I raised <Col N="1977" /> the matter on the Adjournment.  I find I was accused in the very same fashion with taking the side of the outsider against our own producers, our own farmers.  We have had experience of the way in which these matters have been dealt with by members of the Government, and especially by the present Minister who, in spite of his protestations and instead of being the docile, quiet lamb which he has represented himself here to-night to be, uses Question Time in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure you I am not going very far in this matter.  He uses Question Time for the purpose of depriving members of the Opposition of the information to which they are legitimately entitled.  We have noticed for a long time a tendency on the part of certain Ministers not to give to members of the Opposition, the Fianna Fáil Party, the information they seek. A slick effort is being made to sidestep and short-circuit us, to deprive us of that information.  It is in that setting that I am resisting and disposing completely of the arguments advanced by the Minister in support of his contention that he should be given these powers to suspend this Act until such time as the Government think it fit and proper.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made here to the fact that a Bill was introduced by me seeking similar powers.  I cannot say from memory if that is correct, but, if the Minister says that is so, I accept that statement.  There is an important difference between my action an the Minister coming to the House for similar powers.  There is this difference, that in his case he has washed his hands completely, as Minister, of any responsibility for making an effort to secure agreement in the matter of price with the Northern spinners.  For my part I would regard the business of flax growing as so important that I would continue to strive, while prices were in any way remunerative, to seek agreement on behalf of our growers here with the Northern spinners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may have asked for similar powers, but I contend that those who have an understanding of the different method <Col N="1978" /> of approach, the different attitude adopted by both of us in this matter will appreciate that it is one thing to give powers to one who is vitally interested and another thing to give them to one who, as the Minister admitted to me yesterday in reply to a Parliamentary Question, did not make a single approach to the Six-County spinners with a view to effecting an agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a very specific objection to the inclusion of the words proposed by the Minister.  Deputy Vivion de Valera afterwards gave a very clear legal exposition of the meaning of those words.  I pointed out that it is not the opinion or views expressed by the Minister that will count exactly, but the words included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister has been most unreasonable in his attitude towards the proposal made by myself and Deputy Cogan.  The Minister for Agriculture, who is here, said a few days ago, on the Holidays Bill, that it was difficult to frame in specific words proposals which are mentally well defined. I think that I can see that the Minister is aiming at a certain power which he thinks he needs and is not really retaining the exceptions which should be retained.  At the same time, he is making provision to give himself power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to accept the point of view that we are really anxious to find a solution for the congested districts.  I am not optimistic about the tremendous amount that can be done, but I am most anxious to be helpful to the Minister in trying to retain, for the solution of congestion, every acre that can be acquired or resumed. The Minister and other Deputies made play with the 1946 Act by which they said Fianna Fáil had tried to retrieve itself.  The measure of error was the measure of the amount of work done by Fianna Fáil in bringing migrants from the West.  In trying to be helpful towards reaching a solution of congestion, we had, unfortunately, in Meath and elsewhere to give way to a local demand.  It was undesirable  <Col N="1981" /> that we should so give way, but the opposition was so great that we had to meet people half way so as to be allowed by them to bring in people who heretofore had no touch with the counties into which they were brought.</P>
    <P>Now, we really do want to find a solution for congestion.  I do not think the Minister's proposal is going to lead to speed in the matter of rearrangement. Instead, I think it will slow down the process.  Since the Minister has asked us to put to him a form of words he might accept, I have already put it, and Deputy Cogan takes the view that my suggestion is workable.</P>
    <P>What I want to say to the Minister is that it is desirable that this authority, which the Minister seeks, should be in the hands of the judicial authority and should not be under the control of any politician or any political Party.  No matter what suspicion is cast upon the Minister, or on the commission that works under him, that does not matter so long as the Minister's conscience can be completely clear that he is not interfering with the judicial authority.</P>
    <P>Now, if it is impossible and undesirable, and I think it would be, that the present commissioners should be asked to pull up stakes in Merrion Street or open their offices in Donegal, Kerry and Mayo, the Minister might devise, with his advisers, the idea of creating the posts of two further commissioners who would be directly associated with the work in the congested areas, and who could give, under judicial authority, swift sanction to the proposals that he now hopes to get by way of directing a senior inspector to make a decision.  The Minister is unwise in seeking to secure for himself this authority.  Even if he does deny that he is so seeking it, we on this side of the House are convinced by the words included in the Bill and their obvious meaning that the Minister cannot escape accepting the responsibility which will thrust itself upon him.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the relief of congestion and at the speed at which it can be carried out.  I desire very much that we should ultilise all the land possible for the relief of congestion and nothing else, but I do think the Minister is wrong, and that he cannot persuade <Col N="1982" /> me or anybody else on this side of the House that the words in the Bill mean anything other than what they say.  I again suggest to him that he should retain the judicial authority by the appointment of commissioners who would function in the congested areas and give the decisions that he now wishes to put on civil servants.</P>

      <P>The Minister tried to leave the House under the impression that in fact he was taking no powers to himself.  He said he had no intention of taking powers over the allotment <Col N="1983" /> of holdings or additions to holdings. The Minister must have forgotten what he said previously.  The impression he left on Deputies on his own benches was that he was in fact taking powers which the Land Commission exercised heretofore.  The Minister must have forgotten the White Paper issued in connection with this Bill.  In paragraph 13 of the White Paper, referring to this section and, particularly, to the two paragraphs which Deputy Moylan has proposed to delete says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As regards paragraphs (d) and (e) it is considered essential, for the expedition and success of rearrangement schemes, to delegate decisions to local senior inspectors of the Land Commission....  Apart from such delegation, commissioners' independent jurisdiction under paragraphs (d) and (e) remains as fixed in Land Act, 1933.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>But their independent jurisdiction has been taken from them by paragraphs (d) and (e).  That is indicated clearly in the White Paper, even if we were not able to read the paragraphs with our own eyes and, particularly, in conjunction with the end of sub-section (1) which says that the Minister will have this power over the land to be rearranged in a particular area &ldquo;whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.&rdquo;  The Minister himself admitted at one stage in this discussion that it was necessary to have additional lands in order to facilitate rearrangement.  These two paragraphs will certainly give the Minister power not only over the lands in rundale, but the additional lands whether situated in the district or in any other parts of the country.  My belief is that the Minister has pulled the wool over some of his colleagues' eyes in regard to the powers which the Minister for Lands will have under this section.</P>

      <P>The Minister at the <Col N="1984" /> same time wants to go around the country and proclaim that he in his own person is in a position to exercise the powers of the Land Commission in regard to allotments and the price of the allotments.  I must say that I am amazed that a number of Ministers and Deputies on the Coalition Benches would go to this extent even to keep the Coalition Government in office.  I suppose the Minister said to them: &ldquo;You have got your price in other regards and I will have to get my price in regard to this power.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister also laid great stress upon the fact that it was necessary that he should take this power into his own hands in order to expedite matters.  He admitted that, if a Minister was doing his job and tried to do this in detail, he would neglect bigger matters to which he should pay attention. The Minister also pleaded that it was necessary, in order to facilitate the relief of congestion, that power to the senior inspector to O.K. a scheme on the spot should be provided for. Why not provide, if that is the Minister's plea, while leaving the judicial functions which the commissioners have to the commissioners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Supreme Court is jealous and has shown itself to be jealous of the exercise of judicial functions by lay personnel.  In order to meet the attitude rightly taken up by the Supreme Court that people should not be kicked around simply by ministerial decree or at ministerial will, that if their property is to be taken and given to somebody else in the public interest it should be done by due process of law and not in some back room by a Minister or by anybody else.  One of the most essential things dealt with in the Constitution is that people should have security of ownership of property unless it is taken from them in the public interest and according to due process of law.  Here the Minister is putting himself in a position not only to take a portion of land and to say to whom each particular section of it shall be given, but he is also taking the right to say in relation to these sections the price at which they should be given to the various allottees.  That is a power which the Minister should not have and which this House should not give him. If the Minister makes such a fuss about getting sanction from the Land Commissioners, he could quite easily have put a section into this Bill to the effect that the Land Commissioners would have to give a decision within a certain number of days subsequent to their having empowered an inspector to make a rearrangement.  Instead of <Col N="1986" /> giving the Land Commission any additional powers, the Minister is taking these powers unto himself.  The Minister, being a politician, is naturally subject to much greater pressure than a person who is in a judicial or semi-judicial capacity and whose tenure of office is fixed.</P>
      <P>We have fought too long for the rights of the people to see these rights now swept away in this arbitrary fashion without pointing out to the Minister and his colleagues in government that they are doing something disastrous to the public interest.  The Minister has challenged us about amendments.  Two amendments were circulated to this particular section. They were circulated months ago. Yet, a fortnight ago the Minister challenged Deputy Moylan to produce an amendment and said that, if he produced it, he would get his officials to examine it.  Surely the Minister knew a fortnight ago when the Debate started on this section that Fianna Fáil objected to it in principle.  He should then have asked his officials to produce an amendment which would safeguard the public interest in this matter.  It is no use asking us now to produce new amendments.  We have already produced them.  I am sure the Minister submitted those we did produce to his officials for examination and got their advice.  Can he give us now any assurance or any indication that he will amend this particular section in order to safeguard the public interest?  If he cannot do that it is no use trying to palm us off with a promise to consider further amendments. We believe the two amendments tabled are necessary in order to ensure that judicial functions will be left in the hands of those people who have the tenure of judges and not in the hands of a Minister who is subjected to all manner of pulling and pushing from day to day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), paragraph (e), lines 52 and 53, to delete &ldquo;(other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme).&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paragraph as it stands in the 1933 Act was designed for the protection of the Minister, to ensure that the functions in this case would be divorced from politics and to protect the Minister from undue representation and <Col N="1989" /> influence.  The Minister's proposal is directed towards giving him power to determine the price of land to allottees in the rearrangement scheme.  That would be pretty undesirable but, unfortunately, in the manner in which the section is worded, the final paragraph of the sub-section not merely gives him power to deal with land in rundale but practically gives him power in regard to all land.  Paragraph (e) as it stands is included in the Bill.  What effect would paragraph (h) have?  Paragraph (e) says &ldquo;the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister wants.  On the other hand, there is a sub-section included in the section to the effect that the determination of any standard purchase annuity is a function of the commissioners. It seems to me that the two are quite conflicting.  I hope that some of our legal lights on both sides of the House will address their minds to it.  I should like to know, if the Minister insists on having the words he wants inserted, what effect that insertion is going to have on (h) which keeps for the commissioners and in their power the determination of a standard purchase annuity?  I think it is most undesirable that the Minister should have the power of selecting allottees as he has in the section that has just passed.  On top of that it is still more undesirable that the Minister should have power to decide not merely who the allottees are but the price at which land is to be sold to them.  I think it is a most impudent demand to make on the Dáil and I must resent it and oppose it with all the power at my command.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>All the objections that were voiced against the previous amendment which has now been rejected by the Government Parties hold good for this amendment too.  This matter is, in the first place, objectionable because it is the taking of power into the Minister's hands by an indirect method&mdash;what I have called already on the previous amendment the taking of power by way of an exception to an exception.  I have no intention of repeating <Col N="1990" /> all the arguments that went before but, in all seriousness, I invite Deputies to read the submissions that have been made on the debate on the previous amendment and to ask themselves if it is a good or a proper thing for a Minister to take power which not only is power that of necessity interferes with private property but power which relates to the doing of justice as between individual citizens.</P>
      <P>Is it a good thing for the Minister to take such power by such a method? I think not.  I think in principle it is highly objectionable and whereas I have carefully safeguarded myself throughout this debate&mdash;because I lack personal factual knowledge I have refrained from commenting on what the Minister should do or should not do&mdash; I nevertheless have suggested and still do suggest, that whatever the Minister wants to do under this section should be done directly in a straightforward, honest manner.  In other words, if he does not want this power but if this power on the legal construction of the section as it stands is to flow into his hands, let him divest himself of it.  On the other hand, if he wants it, why not take the power in a more straightforward and direct manner which would make it apparent to the country and to everybody in the House where precisely we stand?  As I say, I put that as my main contribution to this part of the debate and I leave it to Deputies who have a more intimate knowledge of the situation to deal with the merits of what should or should not be done. The section as it stands is objectionable from that point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, since the opportunity arises&mdash; I stress this&mdash;and I particularly commend it to the consideration of certain Deputies of the Fine Gael Party who opposed this principle in the past as being very solicitous in regard to the rights of others and as people who were very conservative and apprehensive of any interference with the rights of others by such a method&mdash;that here we have a Minister in a Coalition which is dominated by Fine Gael obtaining power in this particular form.  For that reason I commend it to Deputy O'Higgins and his confréres in that Party in all seriousness.  That is the <Col N="1991" /> first objection, an objection on principle, but there is something more objectionable still.  It is a section as I have shown&mdash;and nobody has attempted to get up to contradict me or to show how the argument failed&mdash; which puts power into the Minister's hands.  What is the practical result? The practical result is that in regard to the determination of allottees and, as we now propose, in regard to price, the Minister will be in a position, <i>qua</i> Minister, to decide both allottees and price, once the thing has been embraced within a rearrangement scheme and a rearrangement scheme, of the widest nature, is made possible by virtue of the concluding words of the first sub-section.  Having said that a scheme is a rearrangement scheme, under the very wide description of a rearrangement scheme set out in the section, the Minister can do what he likes in regard to allocation or price.</P>
    <P>Then to add, so to speak, insult to injury where he does such a thing, by virtue of sub-section 5 he may do it in his own name, in the name of the Land Commission or of the lay commissioners. In other words, if the Minister&mdash;and I say this objectively without any reference to the Minister personally&mdash;were to see a way by which he could exercise personal influence under such an arrangement for any political purpose whatever, and then cover it up by laying it at the door of the Land Commission, if that were his motive, he could hardly achieve it by any better method than the method which is in effect provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that is his intention. Some Deputies are only too keen to attempt to put personal interpretation on all these things.  Will they please realise that what I am trying to establish is that by virtue of the draft of the particular form of words in this section, it has this legal effect whether the Minister wants it or not? Is it desirable in principle that we in this House should legislate in that manner?  Is it desirable, in cases where such rights are concerned, that the Minister should be in a position to ask somebody, some officer who will be in effect dependent on him, to frame a scheme and then that scheme having <Col N="1992" /> been framed&mdash;which in effect anyway will be framed if the Minister wants it &mdash;that the Minister can then proceed to deal with the determination of allottees and price as he personally may think fit and, having done that, be in a position by virtue of a later sub-section to say: &ldquo;This was done by another body&rdquo; because he will do it in the name of the other body?  Is it desirable that he should be enabled to put up that facade?  Is it a wise thing to do as a matter of principle?  Let us look to the future.  Some time, somehow, somewhere, acquiescence in such a situation can lead to trouble, if not in the immediate future.  That is what we are up against in this Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Deputies were not present.  House counted and 20 Deputies being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Chair will permit me to retrace my steps very shortly, as the Minister has come in?  The arguments we have already advanced on the last section are relevant to this, but I am not going to pursue them in detail.  They stand. Will the Minister appreciate this, that, first of all, there is a direct and an indirect way of doing the thing, but that it is better to do it in the direct way? If the Minister wants these powers, I would say, let him take them directly. If he does not want them, then I will ask him to shed these powers incidentally given to him by virtue of the wording of the section.  I am leaving the merits to be discussed by Deputies who know more about the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is point one.  Point two is, does the Minister think it desirable to take unto himself powers which are overriding powers?  There is a radical departure from Section 6 of the 1933 Act, which is repealed, and which this Bill replaces.  By virtue of the whole section as it stands, the Minister is in the position of being able to direct his officer.  Being in that position, he can direct the type of rearrangement scheme he wants.  Being in that position, once the rearrangement scheme is formed by that officer, who already is acting on the Minister's direction&mdash;and the definition of the scheme is so wide as to embrace practically everything&mdash;the Minister has <Col N="1993" /> complete power in regard to allocation and price and he can exercise that power in his office without any reference to the machinery of the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Is it wise to take that power and, on top of that, to take the power of covering all that up?  I am using that phrase without any imputation on the present Minister.  He will be in a position to cover the whole thing up by a provision later on which enables him to do it in the name of the Land Commission. I am saying all this objectively, without any reference to the present Minister.  Let us take a hypothetical Minister of the future who may be inclined to act improperly.  He is in a position to do exactly as he wants to his own political advantage and cover it up.  It is bad enough to be accused of allocating, but it would be worse to be accused of rigging the price.  Even if the Minister behaves in the most exemplary manner possible to any human being in the discharge of these functions there will, nevertheless, be mud slung by somebody and accusations will be made.  It always happens, because you cannot satisfy everybody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it wise for the Minister to put himself in that relatively open position?  The arguments are already on the records and it is unnecessary to go into them again.  If the Minister will not divest himself of the powers that have been referred to, we must assume that he is anxious to take these powers.  If that is so, I suggest he should take them directly and openly rather than in this indirect manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to direct the attention of the House to the common or garden interpretation of paragraph (d) of Section 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the persons to be selected as allottees of any land.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What other interpretation is there on this section unless it is that the Minister is reserving to himself the right <Col N="1994" /> of determination arising out of rearrangement schemes of the persons to be selected as allottees?</P>
    <P>The next paragraph sets out:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the determination... of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am suggesting that the only interpretation of paragraph (e) is that the Minister is reserving to himself in any matter of rearrangement the determination of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee.  It is the only interpretation that can be given to that paragraph outside this House.  The Minister must remember that the sub-sections he wants to put into the Statute Book will be interpreted outside the House and the least the House might do is to make clear what it intends.</P>
    <P>In the White Paper which the Minister has circulated he suggests in paragraph 13&mdash;whoever is responsible for the White Paper suggests it, and I am sure the Minister is&mdash;that all these sub-sections have certain interpretations. The White Paper says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards paragraphs (d) and (e) it is considered essential for the expedition and success of rearrangement schemes, to delegate decisions to local senior inspectors of the Land Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister want to delegate powers to senior inspectors of the Land Commission locally?  If he does, there is a simple way.  What is wrong with saying that the Judicial Commissioner shall delegate to the local senior inspector any particular power?  Why should the Minister come in under this section, under the various sub-sections of it, and set himself up as the individual who will delegate this, that or the other?  Why not the lay commissioners or the Judicial Commissioner?  Why should the Minister come out, for the first time in the history of the Land Commission, and take this power unto himself?</P>
    <P>This is a simple matter, a matter the Minister can put right if he wants to. If the Minister feels that all these accusations may be made against him, that he is taking political power for the purpose of paying a particular price for land or allotting land, what is wrong with the Minister saying now, without <Col N="1995" /> further discussion: &ldquo;I am prepared to say in this Bill that the Judicial Commissioner shall have power to delegate to a senior inspector whatever authority he wants to give him.&rdquo;  Does the Minister suggest that by the mere fact of being empowered to pick and choose under this scheme he will be able to speed up land division and the alleviation of the conditions in rundale areas?  Does he suggest that, by using his name, it would speed up anything throughout the country?</P>
    <P>It is the main objection of the Opposition that the Minister, as political head of the Department, is taking this specific power to pick and choose not alone the allottees, but the prices that will be paid in certain instances. Can he not see what suggestions these powers are open to and, if he is sincere in meeting the wishes of the House, why not delegate those powers to the Judicial Commissioner or one of the lay commissioners of the Land Commission? Whether it is the Minister or a lay commissioner has this particular power, how is that going to speed up the solution of the rundale system or of a rearrangement scheme? If the Minister thinks there is anything in the talk or suggestions that have been made about political pressure being brought to bear, why should he take this power to himself, because both in law and in fact he will be the man who will be responsible?  I cannot see the reason why the Minister should take this power to himself unless it be the reason the Opposition has suggested. If the Minister were to say that he was prepared to give this power to a Judicial Commissioner or to one of the lay commissioners who could delegate it to the man appointed to work out a rearrangement scheme, that would meet with the wishes of the House.  By refusing to do that the Minister leaves himself open to all the charges that have been made from this side of the House, as well as to all the types of abuse that can arise under this legislation.  I invite the Minister to reconsider the matter even now.  If he is prepared to say that he will delegate these powers to one of the lay commissioners or to the Judicial Commissioner, <Col N="1996" /> we will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of speed, it should be possible, as Deputy Moran has said, to let an inspector go down and deal with the matter in the manner the Minister contemplates and then come back and report.  That system would work just as expeditiously as the proposal which the Minister has in the Bill.  I take it for granted that the Minister himself is not going to go down and arrange these things.  If he is not, the speed will be achieved by some others doing it.  When the officer comes back and makes his report, why cannot a decision be taken by the Land Commission as well as by the Minister? The argument as regards speed does not stand a very close analysis.</P>
      <P>This form of attacking this problem is very objectionable in principle.  I would invite the Minister to consult with, say, the Minister for External Affairs, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, who in the past have expressed very definite views as regards the dangers of this type of legislation. They have shown themselves as being very much aware of it.  If the Minister has not already consulted with them on this matter, I think he should because this is a new departure and the Government, as a collective body, will have to take responsibility for it.  As I say it is most objectionable in principle.</P>

That means in effect that the Minister is going to have the power to declare that a loss on resale must be borne by the taxpayers in some form or another.  What justification is there for that?

      <P>The Minister is not attempting to deny, I hope, that hereafter the Minister for Lands, if this Bill is passed, will have the right to determine the price of a particular allotment in connection with a rearrangement scheme.  He cannot deny that he will do it in his own individual capacity.  Will the Minister tell us whether the price is going to come out of his own pocket or not.  We know perfectly well that it is not, but that it is going to come out of the public purse.  I think this is a most scandalous and outrageous innovation.  I do not believe that the members on the Coalition Benches would have listened to it for one moment except under the threat from the Minister that he would break up the Coalition if he did not get this particular provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no other explanation for it. They had been talking for years about the right of this Dáil and of the Comptroller and Auditor-General to have full and absolute accountancy for every penny that is passed by the Dáil, and quite rightly so; but how is any Dáil going to determine whether or not the Minister is carrying out his function to fix prices, to take money out of the taxpayer's pocket in regard to a rearrangement, unless there is to <Col N="1998" /> be a full-blown judicial inquiry into the Minister's acts on every occasion where it is stated that he has given an excessive price or suffered an excessive loss, with the taxpayers' money.</P>

It is obvious that what he wants to do is to string this out because he believes that the people of the country are &ldquo;mugs&rdquo;, as he described them.  What right has the Minister to say in Roscommon and in this House that we want to delay this Bill?  That is the <i>alibi</i> of members of <Col N="1999" /> the Coalition with regard to a number of Bills.  The Minister has been in office now for over two years.  He has been talking about this Bill for well over a year.  The Bill was brought in before Christmas.  During this Session it got a Second Reading.  For a couple of weeks past, the Dáil only got an opportunity of discussing it for 15 minutes at a time.  If the Government think this is an important Bill, why did they not give it an important place on the agenda, rather than taking it in between other Bills which are not so important?</P>

      <P>I want to know what excuse the Minister has for taking to himself this function of determining the price at which people are to get land.  Is it for speeding up purposes or so that he can outbid Deputy Commons in Mayo for votes?  The White Paper quite clearly sets out that sub-section is taking from the independent jurisdiction of the Land Commissioners functions which they had heretofore.  These functions are being taken from the independent jurisdiction of the Land Commissioners and being given into the jurisdiction of the Minister, who is not independent, who is subject to all sorts of pressure from the people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a count of the House was called for, I was saying that, naturally, every person interested in a rearrangement scheme wants to do the best he can for himself and his family. A person who has got a new portion of land does not want to pay an exorbitant price for it, or what he will regard as an exorbitant price.  He wants to get it at the lowest price possible.  We all know that when anybody in the country goes looking for any commodity he will try his best to beat down the price, to get it at the cheapest possible price.  We know how difficult it is to get these people in these rundale areas to agree to a redivision of the land included in the rundale.  They want all sorts of perquisites and additions to the price. <Col N="2000" /> Heretofore, the price was finally fixed and the allotment arranged by men who were independent of the support of Deputy Commons or of the favour of the persons to whom the land was being allotted.  They could exercise an independent judgment.  They could act independently, knowing that their careers and their salaries were not dependent upon the people on whom they were imposing a fair rent and they could exercise their jurisdiction, as the White Paper says, in an independent fashion.</P>
    <P>It would be impossible, if this Bill were in operation to-morrow, for the Minister to exercise an independent judgment in relation to the rearrangement of a rundale or to the price at which the land was to be given while he was being trailed all over the rundale holding by people like Deputy Commons.  Deputy Commons would, naturally, be saying to the people: &ldquo;The Minister has power to give the land to you for nothing.&rdquo;  He has the power in his own right to give it for nothing and make the taxpayers pay for it.</P>

      <P>That is a power which can be abused in the hands of a Minister for Lands.  If that power resides in the Minister it leaves him open to pressure.  It leaves him open to outrageous pressure from colleagues in his own constituency.  We know there are a number of rundale holdings in County Meath.  When the Minister invokes this particular section he not only takes power over the rundale holdings in Mayo but he also takes power over holdings in any other part of the country which may be associated with a particular scheme of rearrangement.</P>
      <P>It is stated that a rearrangement scheme means a scheme approved by an officer by virtue of this sub-section, whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.  If the Minister wants to elbow the Land Commissioners out of practically all these excepted matters he has only to declare that he wants land in County Meath, or County Tipperary, or anywhere else&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Not being a judicial person or a person whose tenure of office is in any way guaranteed, as is the tenure of office of the Land Commissioners, he can not only elect the allottees and fix the price at the public expense but he can in public pretend that it was the Land Commissioners who did it.</P>

      <Col N="2003" /> I think the people are entitled to an explanation as to why this is necessary. The Minister made the excuse that it was necessary to relieve congestion. In the two years in which he has been in office he has relieved less congestion than did Fianna Fáil even during the war years.  He broke the record for the lowest possible figure for the relief of congestion at any time since 1923, not excluding the war years when the bulk of the Land Commission's staff was engaged on other duties.</P>

If the Minister is being so anxious to speed up the division of land, surely he could have done a little better than Fianna Fáil did in the worst year of all the war years.

      <P>I cannot understand what the objection is on the part of Fianna Fáil to (d) and (e) of Section 10. To my mind, the purpose behind the Bill is the solving of the land problem. We want to finish, as far as we can, the problem of congestion that exists in a good number of counties.  I am afraid, however, there is congestion in more places than in the West of Ireland.  I suggest it exists to a great extent in the Fianna Fáil Party and that some of the members ought to hold a rearrangement scheme amongst themselves and decide on some kind of constructive criticism towards this Bill.  If they would do so it would be better for themselves and for this House and for the country.</P>
      <P>Last night we were treated to the spectacle of Fianna Fáil Deputies deploring the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was waiving his responsibility under the Industrial Development Authority Bill.  It is an about face to-day&mdash;it is quite the opposite.  Here they are deploring the idea that the Minister for Lands is about to take more power into his own hands from the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> Can they make up their minds on what they really want?  Is it not beginning to be quite evident that their contribution to the debate is more for the sake of obstruction than for anything else?</P>
    <P>I welcome Section 10 and the sub-sections (d) and (e) which these Deputies were annoyed about.  I think the Minister deserves great credit for taking this power in connection with the determination for rearrangement schemes and also with regard to the price in this particular sub-section.</P>

      <P>When one is passed I think that it is absolutely ridiculous to obstruct the other because both go hand in hand.  If, as has already been decided, we give authority to a senior inspector under the Minister to reach a decision with regard to rearrangement surely the power to reach a price must also be given or one sub-section will nullify the other?  Seeing that the first has been passed I think these Deputies should not criticise the Minister any further.  We have listened for a very long time to Deputy de Valera on the legal end of it.  I am not a legal expert&mdash;I have never claimed to be such&mdash;but I think he has saved himself to a great extent by saying that he has not any practical experience of the problem of congestion. Because he has said that I would be inclined to forgive Deputy de Valera for his contribution to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A certain Deputy on the other side of the House took occasion to say that the Minister would now go around the country and arrange for his friends to get holdings and arrange the prices.  I think that that is a very shabby type of criticism and it carries no weight under these particular sub-sections.  My <Col N="2006" /> name was actually mentioned by this particular Deputy.  He said that the Minister visited my constituency recently and that he deplored conditions as he saw them in the county.  I see nothing wrong with the Minister for Lands visiting Roscommon, Galway or any other county in Ireland.  He is to be congratulated on that.  It is not so very long ago since the late Minister for Local Government, Mr. Murphy, did a tour of the county councils which was followed up by his successor.  The late Mr. Murphy wanted to see the housing situation first hand.  The gentlemen opposite, including Deputy MacEntee and his pals, criticised the late Minister for going down the country and taking an active interest in what was his work. I should like to see the Minister for Lands going through all the counties. I should like to see the Minister for Agriculture doing the same thing.  They were put in to do a job and that is the way to do it.  They were not put into office to hide in a big house in Dublin and to live like a Maharajah and to send their inspectors down the country to do the work.  There is nothing like the personal touch.</P>

His personal touch will be tremendous under this sub-section if he has a Land Commission cheque in his pocket to pay the price to individuals from whom land is being acquired throughout Ireland.  He has the finest personal touch of any Minister this House has ever seen&mdash; the finest personal touch any possible Minister could ever have&mdash;because he will have the public purse to write the cheque for a political supporter.</P>
      <P>It is a price that was never before given by this House because the determination under this amendment we are discussing is &ldquo;the determination (other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme) of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee.&rdquo;&ldquo;Any such allottee&rdquo; I presume must refer to paragraph (a)&mdash;&ldquo;the determination of the persons from whom land is to be acquired or resumed.&rdquo;  Land cannot be resumed <i>willy nilly.</i>  There are certain statues under which land can be resumed and one of the main reasons why land is resumed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that under paragraph (e) the Minister purports to seek power for the determination of <Col N="2009" /> the price at which land is to be sold to any allottee.  I am proposing to show to the House that virtually 90 per cent. of the land acquired by the Land Commission is acquired for the purpose of rearrangement and therefore the Minister will have the personal touch with the Land Commission cheque.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer you, Sir, in case there is any question about it, to the wording of paragraph (e) which must definitely be referred to paragraph (a)&mdash;the determination of persons from whom land is to be acquired or resumed.  Do we not all know that practically all the land acquired or resumed is being acquired or resumed for the relief of congestion?  There are only certain specific cases in which the Land Commission can acquire land. The first purpose, the principal one, is the relief of congestion.  There are other purposes such as the provision of town parks &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I suggest it is quite clear from the sub-section in question that paragraph (e) refers to a rearrangement scheme, which is defined in the main section and not in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  It is defined in sub-section (I), at the end of the sub-section.  There is nothing there about the resumption of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer to the sub-section which says: &ldquo;In this sub-section, the expression &lsquo;rearrangement scheme&rsquo; means a scheme which is framed or approved by an officer by virtue of sub-section (2) of this sub-section for the rearrangement of land held in rundale or intermixed plots whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement.&rdquo;  I am submitting to the House again that 90 per cent. of the land acquired under the Land Acts is acquired for the purpose of the relief of congestion and the relief of congestion is dealt with in the main in accordance with the definition here for rearrangement schemes.  Lands <Col N="2010" /> are being acquired by the State for the purposes of rearrangement and when notice is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> in regard to the acquisition of certain lands, one of the things the Land Commission must set out is that the lands are being acquired by them for the purposes of the relief of congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;rearrangement scheme&rdquo; is limited under the definition to the rearrangement of lands held in rundale or intermixed plots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I would again invite the Deputy to read the definition.  It deals with the rearrangement of land held in rundale or intermixed plots &ldquo;whether with or without the distribution of other lands to facilitate the said rearrangement&rdquo;.  We have there the expression &ldquo;with or without the distribution of other lands&rdquo; and I am dealing with the situation as if it were concerned with the distribution of other lands because you can never, as has been stated here, deal with a rearrangement problem unless you have some other lands to distribute.  Otherwise there is no point in trying a rearrangement scheme.  There is no way of getting the tenant to agree unless you have other lands to give him.  The Minister on this sub-section is taking power for the determination of the price at which land is to be sold to any allottee under a rearrangement scheme.  I invite the Minister, if this does not contain the sinister meaning we think it will, to divest himself of this power and to give it to the Judicial Commissioner or a lay commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Minister to give his reasons as to why he thinks that would involve the slowing up of any such scheme.  The Minister remains quite silent but the Minister knows quite well that the price for land acquired, <Col N="2011" /> in 90 per cent. of the cases, is going to be determined by the Minister for Lands and not by the people who formerly determined the price.  Ninety per cent. of the land that is acquired is taken for the purposes of the relief of congestion and for rearrangement schemes.  The Minister knows that quite well and to try to suggest that this has nothing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, surely this sub-section refers to the price at which land should be sold to allottees and not to the price at which it is to be acquired?  It is to the latter point that Deputy Moran is addressing his remarks.</P>

      <P>The paragraph says: &ldquo;the determination... of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee.&rdquo;  That is one matter.  What the Minister is reserving and what I am objecting to is the wording in brackets:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is contained in paragraph (e) and that is what I am objecting to.  That is an excepted matter and it will be left to the Land Commission&mdash;that is, the determination of the price at which land is to be sold to any such allottee.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2012" />&ldquo;(other than any determination arising in or being part of a rearrangement scheme)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My submission is that the implication of that is that it is giving the Minister power to determine the price at which land is to be sold.  That is what I am objecting to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

      <P>The word &ldquo;price&rdquo; is after the brackets; it cannot refer to what is in brackets.  I am sorry to dispute in law with the Deputy, but it strikes me that &ldquo;price&rdquo; is after the brackets and refers to the allottee only.</P>

      <P>If the Chair and the House take the view, and if the Minister accepts it, that the words in brackets are so innocent, then I invite the Minister to withdraw them altogether. My construction of the wording in brackets is that the Minister is given power to determine the price of land in any question of rearrangement or resettlement.  If the Minister says that is not so, and that he is taking no such power, I do not see what is the objection to withdrawing these words from the sub-section.  There will then be no objection from this side of the House to letting the section through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I want to make a simple statement of fact in introducing this measure.  I claim that, in introducing this, I am giving expression to the feeling of the majority of the landholders in the country and of the people generally that the landholders should be entitled to let or use the fisheries attached to their own lands.  Heretofore these fisheries have been vested in and reserved to the Land Commission or to the landlord.  The position to-day is that a man whose lands adjoin a valuable fishery has no say whatever in the vesting of that fishery and no right to fish in the waters adjoining his land.  The same applies to sporting rights.</P>
      <P>The case is sometimes made against a measure of this kind that if one gives back these rights to the farmers the fisheries will deteriorate.  I describe that as a rather insidious type of propaganda.  It is said that there will be no proper protection.  My answer to that is that there is no proper protection at the moment.  Irrespective of whether there are conservators or fishery boards protecting the fisheries, the riparian owners poach the waters. I claim that they are quite right in doing so because the vested interests who hold these fisheries reside for the most part outside this State.  Why should a farmer whose lands adjoin these fisheries regard those fisheries as alien property?  Why should he be a party to their protection when they represent a right that was taken away from him throughout the years.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission have let and sublet these fisheries to vested interests. In this Bill I propose that these interests be bought out at a fair price and the fishery rights and sporting rights revested in the riparian owner by way of additional annuity consolidated with the annuity already attaching to his holding.  In that way we shall not do anything detrimental to any interest. We shall simply restore to the farmers a particular right to which they are entitled with the least possible loss to those who now enjoy such rights and who utilise these fisheries for their own benefit.  I suggest that to safeguard against exorbitant claims being made for compensation a tribunal, such as that suggested in Section 2, could decide as between the interested parties. In order to make it possible for the Government to meet our demands I would suggest that what has been done in previous legislation should be done here.  Particular areas could be taken over at different periods.  That is the answer to the Department of Finance, or any other Department, which might claim that this was too costly an undertaking and that the compensation to be paid would be incommensurate with any benefits which might accrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strongest argument put forward by the trout angling associations and other interests is that the farmer might be selfish and might develop his own particular stretch or river or lake to the detriment of other interests above or below him.  I can cite a case in point to prove the inaccuracy of that suggestion. The river Laune in County Kerry drains into the lake of Killarney.  A landowner there took legal action and was given the particular fishery.  He sublet that to hotel proprietors in Killarney.  This hotel uses the fishery for the purpose of attracting tourists. When the fishery was awarded to him it was in a sadly deteriorated condition because it had been consistently poached.  It is now a valuable asset, because of development, both to himself and to the nation.  I could quote a number of such cases.  That is a <Col N="2021" /> complete answer to those who say that if these fisheries are handed back they will immediately deteriorate.</P>
    <P>Another point put forward against handing them back to the farmers is that they would charge exorbitant rates to those who wished to use them.  Why depict the farmers as selfish and dishonest people?  They are the backbone of the nation.  The inhabitants of our towns and cities all came from farming stock.  The best of our race has come from the land.  That is an answer to that type of propaganda.  I do not approach this measure from any political angle.  This is a Bill that should have been introduced years ago.  I appeal to the Minister to let this go to a free vote of the House.</P>
    <P>In regard to sporting rights there is ample machinery in the Land Commission for the purpose of vesting such rights.  I wanted to draw the Minister's attention to one particular aspect.  On the Ventry estate in County Kerry the sporting rights are still in the hands of outsiders.</P>
    <P>They were never handed over to the farmers or even to the Land Commission. I have been informed that in previous legislation the Land Commission have ample powers to deal with that matter.  That is why I am including it&mdash;in order to clarify the position and to see that such powers can be utilised to deal with estates.  Perhaps there are others throughout the country.</P>
    <P>On the question of vested interests, let me say that I realise that the said vested interests could mean the Land Commission as well as people from outside the country.  We have State property. Take, for instance, the State property in the Bourne Vincent Estate. In connection with the lower reaches of that estate, the riparian owners agitated some years ago to lease these fisheries from the Board of Works.  At that period they were advertised.  Once again the vested interests were in a position to pay a pretty enhanced price for them and the local farmers could not compete with them.  That is another type of fishery to which I am referring as well as to the stretches of river and lake shore fisheries.  I want to make it quite clear to Deputies who may have points against this measure <Col N="2022" /> that where trout angling associations and other interests have developed their own stretches on rivers and proved from their own industry that these are an asset to the nation, this Bill will not interfere with that interest at all.  There is no mention of it. There are certain areas where these trout angling associations have made purchases, in some cases from the riparian owners and in other cases from the Land Commission.  We are not out to hinder the development of fishing. We are paying the way for real development. No matter what may be said about riparian owners and farmers, whilst farmers stand on the bank of a river and look at a man from South Africa or from some other country fishing on his lands and order him off his own lands you will have no development. You cannot have it.</P>
    <P>Take the trout angling associations. I am informed that a man with a £2 licence dare not go into that stretch of river which is leased by the vested interests.  As a contrast, would he not have a better chance in dealing with the local farmer and the local riparian owner to lease a stretch of river and get permission to fish on it for a week or a month or whatever the period may be?  These are the fundamental points which I am putting forward.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will be favourably received and that it will be accepted in the spirit in which it is offered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary attitude for the Minister to adopt on a Bill of this kind which has been introduced as a Private Member's Bill.  If the Minister would indicate the attitude of the Government in relation to this matter we would know where we stand and perhaps the Minister would <Col N="2023" /> save quite an amount of parliamentary time if he were to do so.  I do not see why he should keep silent if the Government have taken a decision on this matter.  If on the other hand the Minister has a personal opinion on this matter and cannot get the agreement of his colleagues on it then it is quite a different question.</P>
      <P>As the Minister well knows, this Bill raises very difficult and serious questions throughout the country.  The first principle of the Bill recommends itself to me and, I am sure, to most Deputies of this House, that is, of the State or the Land Commission in the name of the State stepping in and taking over the fishing rights.  Having said so much, let me add that I disagree with practically everything else that is in the Bill.  I accept the principle that the State or some Department of State would come in and take over these fishing rights and particularly these private protected fisheries which we have throughout the country and more particularly in the Minister's own constituency.  We have many valuable fisheries there such as the Moy, the Newport river, the Carrownisky river and numbers of other rivers in County Mayo that are, in the main, owned and leased by outsiders.  I think a very good case can be made by the movers of this Bill to ask the State to come in and take over these rights, compensate these people, if necessary, and put these fisheries in the position that every member of a fishing club or certainly every citizen of this country, on paying the necessary licence fee, would be entitled to fish there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the principle I take from the first part of this Bill&mdash;that the Land Commission would take over these fishing rights.  However, some of the other matters dealt with in this Bill &mdash;what it is proposed to do with the fisheries, namely, the handing of them back to the riparian owners or to individual landholders&mdash;are quite different propositions.  They are matters upon which I would have to make up my mind on the Committee Stage, if this Bill gets as far as the Committee Stage.  With regard to fishing in the inland waters of this country I may <Col N="2024" /> say that I agree with the principle of the State taking over.  I would be behind the mover in asking the Government to accept that principle.  If the Minister has a Bill or some form of procedure in mind to deal with this very urgent problem throughout the country, and particularly in the West of Ireland, and if he would tell the House about it, we could accept what the Minister has in view.  There are many things here which we cannot accept.  For instance, I do not accept that you can deal in a Bill of this kind with both sporting and fishing rights because they give rise to different problems.  The question of sporting, preserving game, commonages and so forth gives rise to far different problems. There are already enough problems in connection with the fishery code as it exists to-day&mdash;as I am sure the Minister will realise if he comes to draft legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to know now the intention of the Government on this matter.  It would save the time of the House instead of having to wait to hear what the Minister has to say at the end of the debate.  The principle in the first part of the Bill will be accepted, I think, by most Deputies in this House.  I would be very interested if the Minister would, even now, make a statement on the Government's intention in connection with the problem of inland fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCollins" hpid="Mr. S. Collins Mr. S. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Moran, I quite agree with the principle enunciated by the mover in the first section of the Bill, but unlike Deputy Moran, having subscribed to the principle of the Bill, I suggest to Deputy Flynn that he is going absolutely the wrong way about tackling this problem.  I do not know what attitude the Minister will adopt towards the Bill but I expect, as custodian of the Department, he could not possibly accept it in its present form.  There are many difficulties involved to which the mover of the Bill has not adverted, whether consciously or unconsciously I do not know.  Deputy Moran pointed out that there are distinct and separate problems connected with sporting rights, as distinct from fishing rights.  The fishing <Col N="2025" /> code is already fairly complicated and, in my opinion, this seemingly simple Bill would only add to the confusion. Undoubtedly the time is past that some wandering duke or earl, who has parted with his ancestral lands, should still be the proprietor of fishing rights in this country.  I am perfectly in sympathy with Deputy Flynn there.</P>
      <P>I think the time has come when the State must face up to the problem of bringing these rights within its own purview and control but I do not think that Deputy Flynn has found a solution of the problem in suggesting that the Land Commission should take them over and compulsorily vest them in the tenants.  You are up against the problem that perhaps some tenants, if these rights were vested in them, would not look after them properly. Some certainly would but others might not.  Certainly in regard to sporting rights, it is easy to visualise some farmers doing all in their power to preserve the lands while their neighbours would do nothing.  In that way the preserves of whole areas might be destroyed.  I would suggest to Deputy Flynn that if he could get the House to accept the principle that the time has come that something should be done to restore to Irish control, fishing and shooting rights in the country, he should withdraw this Bill because I think his intentions as expressed in the Bill have gone somewhat astray, and the Bill would not ultimately achieve what he wants it to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly it would not achieve it in a harmonious way.  It is a big and very complicated problem, one in which you have a tremendous divergence of interests. The Deputy himself has referred to the fact that there are leases and numerous sub-leases of certain fishing rights.  I can see at once that big problems would arise if these fisheries were taken over in the way he suggests. It is a problem that needs thorough technical investigation, a problem which requires all the astuteness and expertness of trained draftsmen to frame a law in understandable language and capable of effective operation. While I contend that the time has come <Col N="2026" /> when the wandering duke or earl or alien of any description who has bought certain fishing or gaming rights should promptly be divested of these I would not recommend to the House that that should be done by the method suggested in the Bill.  I would urge upon the Minister to direct his mind to the fact however that there is almost unanimous sympathy with the idea that these shooting and fishing rights should be brought back under Irish control.  I would suggest that some measure should be introduced by the Government which would give effective control or at least remove foreign ownership of Irish rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that, in the experience of this House, there has ever been a case in which the Government has so shirked its clear responsibilities and the Minister has so shirked his clear responsibility to give a lead to the House as on this occasion. This is a very important matter, the question of fresh-water fisheries&mdash;in-land fisheries.  Surely if a lead is to be given in an important matter of this kind to the House it should be given by the Minister?  He is responsible. He has technical advice and experience at his disposal and should be in a position to explain the principles involved in this matter.  Why is is that we have to wait for private members to explain these principles?  He has been challenged to give his opinion by the mover of the Bill.  Whenever a private Bill is introduced involving a matter of public importance the Government should face up to its responsibilities, give its decision and not wait for other people to do their duty for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been explained this is a difficult question.  There are four or five principles involved in the Bill.  There is the question of securing public control and ownership of the fisheries and the question of what it would cost to secure that.  Has any estimate been made by the Department concerned of what it will cost to take over the fisheries?  Next, there is the fact that there is a very big difference between the problems of the fishery rights and sporting rights.  There is then the question of tourism, the sporting attitude towards fisheries and the commercial <Col N="2027" /> attitude.  All these are matters which the Department and the Minister responsible ought to know and in regard to which they ought to give the House a lead and not wait for private members to stand up to express their views.  As to the question of the desirability of securing public ownership of these rights, there can be little doubt; but there is the question of cost to be considered.  Somebody would have to give an estimate of what the cost is likely to be so that we would know exactly what we were doing in taking over these rights.  There is a further question.  Having secured State control, are we to give back these fisheries and divide them up so that the people through whose lands rivers flow or whose lands lakes adjoin, will have the ownership of these fisheries?  I am not in favour generally of nationalisation; I believe in private enterprise to the utmost but here is a case, if ever there was one, in which public ownership could be advocated.  Does the Minister stand for it?  If he stands for it, is the State prepared to find the money necessary to buy out the owners?  Let us hear from the Government what is their attitude in the matter.  Let us hear what would be the difficulties of carrying out such a programme and what would be the attitude of the Government in regard to giving back these rights to private individuals.</P>
    <P>Is it the proper way to develop these fisheries?  What are the difficulties that would arise?  Most of us can see some of these, but we want to know what is the considered attitude of the Government.  I think it is most unfair for the Minister in charge of the Department immediately concerned to sit here and wait for private members to express their opinions in regard to the measure.  He should be leading in this matter.  That is his duty.</P>

So far as giving them out again is concerned, I, for one, will require a great deal of argument to satisfy me that once the State got possession of these it would be good public policy for the State to hand them back to private individuals.  Why cannot the Minister, if he believes these things, say it?  Why should he wait for the Opposition to say it for him?</P>

      <P>I must say I am disappointed at the Minister's attitude on this measure.  Deputy de Valera said I did not give certain information, certain details in connection with this Bill. I submit that to do that I should have had access to statistics and returns in the Department relating to the number of vested fisheries and other interests and their values throughout the years.  I did make an effort to get certain information, but I had not sufficient time at my disposal to get all that would be necessary.  I admit that in a matter like this considerable preparation is necessary.  I simply put forward the Bill so that Deputies could criticise it or suggest amendments and in that way we might get at the root of the problem and endeavour to solve it.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that Deputy Commons or myself or any other Deputy who supports this measure is not out to do anything that will impede developments or be detrimental to tourists' interests and the interests of the nation.  We are endeavouring to make it possible to pave a way for development.  It is a well-known fact that the State provides machinery such as conservators and fishery boards, but I contend that even if you had a 1,000 bailiffs and others trying to protect fisheries, if you have not the goodwill of the farmers whose land adjoins rivers, the riparian owners, it would be merely a waste of time.  That is my contention.  I claim that if the State will regard this matter as important&mdash;and they must&mdash; then they should first buy out the fisheries, the various vested interests, at a fair price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission own a large number of these fisheries, and if they vested them in the tenants at a price to be arranged by the tribunal, I claim <Col N="2031" /> it would go a long way to encourage the development of our fresh-water fisheries.  In parts of the County Kerry, farmers and their predecessors have been agitating for that for a long number of years.  Under the 1923 Land Act there was provision for the purchase of the fisheries, but that did not avail much to the people who had been carrying on an agitation for years to become the owners of them.  In one case the fisheries reverted to the Land Commission, and in other cases they reverted to the original landlord or to his descendants.  In parts of Kerry the fisheries are still in the hands of the original landlord and are vested in people outside this country.</P>
    <P>That situation has led to a good deal of conflict and agitation.  Farmers have been brought to court for trying to maintain their rights and for preventing those people from, as they call it, trespassing on their lands.  The object of this Bill is to make it possible for the Government to deal with this matter in an expeditious way.</P>
    <P>Under the land rehabilitation scheme, counties are grouped and work is carried out on that basis.  I suggest to the Minister for Agriculture and to the Minister for Lands that the same method should be adopted for the taking over of these fisheries.  They might deal with two or three counties at a time.  If that were done it would, I think, meet the point that was raised by Deputy de Valera in regard to cost. That is the suggestion that I make to the Government for dealing with this matter in a systematic way.  Otherwise, I assume that the cost of dealing with it might be very great.  I think one Minister said recently that the cost would run into millions.  If this problem were dealt with on the lines of the land rehabilitation scheme it would be an easy matter for the Government to put up sufficient money each year to defray the cost of vesting and the purchase of these fisheries over a small group of counties.</P>
    <P>The point was made that this measure would interfere with certain rights in regard to leases, and so on, which certain people hold at the <Col N="2032" /> moment.  It has been said that some of these fisheries have been leased to outside concerns for a long period.  As I said at the outset, the suggestion that we are making is that machinery be set up to deal with that.  I can imagine that, if the Government were to agree to the principle of the Bill, ways and means can be found for dealing with any problems that might arise in regard to leases, etc.</P>
    <P>A question was put to me in regard to a central fishing authority.  That, in itself, would be very important, but it would entail considerable work over a long period of years.  I imagine it would also entail the taking over of a several fishery and, I presume, syndicates and other interests.  That, however, is not exactly what we are driving at in this Bill.  Riparian owners are quite distinct from syndicates or from a several fishery.  We are simply making the claim that the rights of riparian owners should be dealt with in the first instance.  If it is the intention of the Government to introduce a more extensive measure in the near future, it will be up to them to deal with any points or proposals that are not covered in this Bill.  In conclusion, I would again ask the Minister if he is prepared to accept this Bill in principle, and if not to leave the question to a free vote of the House.</P>

      <P>On a point of clarification, am I right in interpreting Section 3 as set out in the Bill as imposing a duty on the Land Commission forthwith to vest in the tenant that part of the fishery which is an appurtenant to his land, and to impose on the tenant an annuity adequate to redeem the purchase price of the fishery over a term of years, because I feel sure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot take Section 3 without bearing in mind the reference in Section 2 to the tribunal to be set up to fix a fair price. The Minister for Agriculture should not, or could not, assume that this would involve an additional annuity of £50 on a tenant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In certain cases, as the <Col N="2034" /> Bill is drafted, it must impose an annuity.</P>

      <P>That is a matter that I would like to deal with at a later stage.  I admit that the words &ldquo;shall vest&rdquo; are mandatory, but if the Bill goes to Committee an amendment could be moved to leave it optional with riparian owners as to whether they would vest or otherwise.</P>
