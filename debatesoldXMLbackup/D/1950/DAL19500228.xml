      <P>Since the Unemployment Assistance Acts came into operation, questions referred to a Court of Referees in respect of applications for unemployment assistance made by residents of Connemara have been considered by Galway Court of Referees.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he proposes to arrange for the broadcasting of lessons to schools especially for the purpose of fostering a high uniform standard of Irish throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="Minister for Education (General Mulcahy) Richard (General) Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of arranging for the broadcasting of lessons to schools has been more than once under consideration in the Department.  As a result of an exhaustive survey of the position I have come to the conclusion that the educational benefits which might accrue from radio-broadcasting for schools would not be commensurate with the cost involved nor with the amount of time and energy which would have to be expended in organising and selecting suitable and acceptable programmes.</P>
      <P>I believe that the best way to foster a high uniform standard of Irish throughout the country is to ensure that the teachers engaged in the various types of schools shall have reached a high level of qualification in the language, both from the point of view of knowledge and of capacity to impart it.  Everything possible is being done to realise that ideal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the system and the effect have been carefully examined into and I am not convinced that the effect would be worth the amount of money which would be involved.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend upon what you propose.  I think the Deputy is aware that when it was investigated some time ago it was considered that for a short programme it would cost about £60,000 to equip the primary schools and about £13,000 a year for the Radio Eireann end of it for organising, cost of fees and personnel of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister think that it would be worth spending that much money in using it as effectively as it is used in other countries for other educational purposes?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>In moving the Second Reading of the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1949, I think a word of explanation is due to the House.  When this matter was before the House last session I gave Deputies to understand that the permanent Bill would be in their hands within a very short period. The permanent Bill has been in the hands of the parliamentary draftsman since some time early last month. Owing to the fact that it is a rather lengthy Bill, containing a couple of hundred sections, I have been informed that it will be the middle of next month before it will be released from that department.  As Deputies are aware, the present measure before the House must be passed before 31st March each year in order to continue the Army.  I would ask Deputies to take into consideration the fact that there is nothing new in this Bill this year.  It is a small Bill containing only two sections for the purpose of continuing the Army until the permanent measure comes before the House.  The first Estimate which we shall take will be the Army Estimate.  Later on, the permanent Army Bill will come before the Dáil.  I mention these facts in the hope that the Deputies might consider letting this continuing Bill through without discussion, under the circumstances.</P>

      <P>In view of the extraordinary lack of information which the Minister has given us in respect of the Army and in respect of the question of Government policy in regard to defence, I feel it necessary to ask him if he can give us an assurance that the Second Stage of the Defence Bill, 1949, will be taken, say, before Easter.  In the absence of any assurance that that can be done, I think it is desirable and very necessary, in view of the world situation at the present time, to discuss at the earliest possible moment the question of the Army and the question of national defence as well as Government policy in regard to that particular phase of affairs.  Can the Minister, then, give us an assurance that the permanent Bill will be before the House, say, before Easter?  Am I to assume that the Minister cannot give an assurance in that regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The question of this debate will, I feel, result from whatever answer the Minister can give in that respect.  I do not want, for instance, to debate the whole question of the Army or Government policy or anything else if we can be given an assurance that in the near future&mdash;say round about Easter&mdash;the Bill will be made available and that the discussion which might take place now could be deferred, say, to that particular period.</P>

      <P>I think I put it to the House last December that my only object in introducing this temporary Bill now is so that the permanent Bill can be discussed in a comprehensive and leisurely way without tying the Dáil down to any date such as the 31st March.  I am as anxious as the Deputy to get the permanent Bill introduced and disposed of.  However, I cannot govern the parliamentary draftsman's office and I cannot give or be expected to give any assurance governing another Department over which I have no control.  When I get that Bill back from the parliamentary draftsman's office I shall come, at the very earliest opportunity available to me, to this House for its Second Reading. If the Deputy, on the other hand, <Col N="804" /> wants to discuss the Army three times &mdash;this evening, in two or three weeks' time on the Estimate and in five or six weeks' time on the permanent Bill &mdash;he is within his rights and I cannot object to his doing so.  I am only asking for reason in a matter of this kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel that in the absence of any assurance that we can have this Bill, on which I certainly would prefer to discuss the general line of policy, it is desirable that we should now discuss the question of defence generally.  The attitude of the Minister makes the discussion of this question very difficult.  He comes in here and does not give the slightest information, good, bad or indifferent, in respect of the Army or its strength or its weaknesses or of what its future policy is likely to be.  That makes it very difficult for Deputies on this side of the House to regard the Minister in a serious way or to believe that he regards the present situation in a serious way.  While the rest of the world is at present considering the serious menace which concerns it, we in this country appear to be taking up the attitude that all is well and that there is no necessity, good, bad or indifferent, to worry very much over the international situation.  I should like to know the cause of the Minister's complacency in this respect.  Has he, for instance, any policy in respect of other nations of the world which are also confronted with these dangers?  Is there an assurance from some of the people whom he regarded as our protectors? Is there any alliance or what is the reason why we are to-day so complacent in this country in respect of our defence situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General Mulcahy, when he was speaking on the question of our defence in 1947, stated that if we are going to be involved in a major war, our circumstances are going to be what they were, in relation to Great Britain at any rate in the last war, that is, that it is Great Britain's power of defence both by air and by its navy that will protect us.  I should like to know if the Government has been impressed by that reasoning; and, if so, if we can now sit back in the full knowledge that in any difficulties  <Col N="805" /> which are likely to arise in the near future we are going to have, not only the protection of the second greatest fleet in the world, &mdash;to which the Minister himself so often referred &mdash;but assistance from the air as well. If that is so and if we can get an assurance that that is so, then we can well understand the easy manner in which the Government appears to be viewing the present world situation.</P>
    <P>On the same occasion, speaking on the Defence Forces Bill, Second Stage, General Mulcahy also said that the reason for putting down an amendment to the Minister's motion was so that the Government would tell the House for what purpose the Army was being kept and in the light of that purpose what its strength and its equipment ought to be.  We have received no information whatever from the Minister in regard either to the equipment or to the strength of the Army.</P>

      <P>I am entitled to ask the Minister these questions.  They have been asked by his own colleagues and, when he was in opposition, they were asked by himself.  But when his colleagues asked these questions, they were not met with the same insults which the Minister likes to hurl at his opponents when they ask similar questions. I am going to continue to ask these questions even though they appear to cause a certain amount of pain to the Minister.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that when the Minister assumed office the first thing he did, apparently, in regard to Army policy was to stop recruiting.  Not only did he stop recruiting but he stopped the advertisements inviting recruits.  Of course, it was fair to presume that if recruitment was stopped the Army would gradually be depleted.  I referred to that situation in the course of a speech and I suggested that if recruitment had <Col N="806" /> been brought to an end&mdash;the recruiting campaign was certainly brought to an end&mdash;whatever casual recruitment may have occurred&mdash;we know what it would be, one or two or half a dozen recruits at the most per week&mdash;would not in any sense make up for the natural wastage which took place in the normal way in the Army.  Therefore, it was reasonable for me in the course of my statement to suggest that the Army of 8,500, which was there when I left office, had been depleted in the course of 12 months or so to a very low figure and I suggested that that figure was perhaps the lowest on record.  But how did the Minister deal with that statement?  This is what the Minister said on 30th March, 1949, referring to that statement:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An ex-Minister for Defence&mdash;he had been Minister for Defence for some six or seven years&mdash;comes into Dáil Éireann and, from the Opposition Benches, says that 8,500 all ranks is the lowest strength ever recorded in the history of our Army.  I would not mind a back bench Deputy who had been only a few months in Dáil Éireann making a statement such as that, but for a man who had been for many years Minister for Defence to make a statement such as that, when talking about the strength of a peace time Army in this country, means either one of two things: either that he never looked up the Army strength in order to get some information as to what would be a reasonable strength in peace times or else he misled the Dáil.  The choice of descriptions is his.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On Wednesday, 14th April, 1948&mdash;that was more than a year before that statement was made&mdash;in the course of a speech I said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Army Vote for 1931-32 was £1,437,000 odd.  For that sum you had an Army of 500 officers and 6,000 men odd.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, I made a clear reference to the fact that in that year the strength of the Army was 6,500.  Yet the Minister deliberately misleads the House as to the statement which I made when I said that the Army was perhaps the lowest on record.  He puts into my mouth a statement that an <Col N="807" /> Army of a strength of 8,500 was the lowest strength on record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>What is much more important at the present time is: what is the strength and what is the morale of the Army to-day?  That is, perhaps, the most important question we have to consider when we are discussing the question of the Army being given, as it will be given by this Bill, the right to exist for the next 12 months.  Surely we are entitled to all this information asked for in the past but which, for some extraordinary reason, is now being withheld.  We want to know the Army strength.  We want to know what Army policy is and we are anxious to know what the Government defence policy is.  Surely, if the Minister failed to give us that information in his opening statement, which was, perhaps, the briefest on record, he should at least give us that information when he is concluding?  As I said in the beginning, I would very much prefer that this question would be debated on the permanent Bill.  We can get no assurance as to when the permanent Bill is likely to be introduced or whether it is to be introduced at all.  If the question of its introduction is one which depends entirely on the draftsman, I can see no reason why the Bill could not have been introduced last December.  When the Minister was introducing the Bill on that occasion, he must at least have known whether it was likely to be ready at some particular period.  He must surely have known, if it had received Government approval, that it was only a matter of putting it into proper legal phraseology in order to have it produced here in the House. Therefore, I feel that the occasion which the introduction of this Bill provides is a fair opportunity for the House to discuss in general terms the question of defence.</P>

      <P>This problem has worried me for quite a while and I think Deputy Traynor was quite right in the attitude he has taken to this particular measure.  I was very hopeful, when the Minister got leave to introduce the permanent Defence Bill, that we would have seen that Bill before to-day.  I am aware, of my own knowledge, that the preparation of that Bill has been going on in the Department of Defence for years, and I should have imagined that, when the Minister came in here and asked for liberty to introduce the Bill, the draft would have been completed as far as the Department of Defence was concerned, that it would have received the general approval of the Government and that it would be printed in the ordinary way and circulated as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>As far as I am concerned&mdash;and I think this applies to every Deputy&mdash;I am anxious that defence should be kept completely outside the scope of ordinary Party politics and that there should be no serious issue there between the Government and the Opposition.  Last year, when the temporary Bill was introduced, the Minister did make me a promise in this House that that was the last Temporary Provisions Bill that would be introduced, that the permanent Bill would be introduced and that the Dáil would be given an opportunity of passing it into law before the following 31st March.  I am quite sure that that was within the Minister's intention. If he came before us now and said: &ldquo;That was really my intention, but the draftsmen and the Department have run into difficulties&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I interrupt the Deputy?  What happened was this.  I assumed, in sending a Bill to the parliamentary draftsmen, who are professional colleagues of the Deputy's, that ample time would be two or three weeks for them to prepare the Bill. To my amazement, I learned when I returned to this country last week, that they would not give me the Bill for three months, even though they had given priority to it.  That was completely <Col N="809" /> unexpected as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I can understand that; but almost a year ago that Bill was under discussion.  I feel that the parliamentary draftsmen should have had it long ago.  Certainly, they should have had it when it was introduced here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

      <P>From 1923 to 1950 is 27 years.  For 27 long years there has been an effort to get this permanent Bill before the House.  In that long period of time, many Deputies have endeavoured to have that done&mdash;and it is not before the House yet.  If the Minister had said: &ldquo;When I undertook last year that no more Temporary Provisions Bills would be introduced, I believed they would have been able to get this permanent Bill ready for circulation; I have been unable to do that and, therefore, I am asking the Dáil to give me a further Temporary Provisions Bill to bring me up to June or September, or even to December.&rdquo; But the Minister asks us, in this temporary Bill, to give him until the 31st March, 1951; in other words, he is asking for the same period of time he would have asked if the Defence Forces Bill had never been promised or if it had not reached the stage that it has reached now.  If the Minister had adopted that attitude, the House would probably have said to him: &ldquo;Without discussion or debate, we can appreciate these difficulties and we will unanimously give the extra time asked for.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should not have asked for a whole year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the permanent Bill rescinds this Bill at whatever date it is passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear.  It will rescind this Bill, but there will be no obligation on the Government to ask this House to pass the permanent Bill into law prior to the 31st December, 1951.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation on the Government to curb <Col N="810" /> Deputies when a Bill is under discussion and I do not want to curb them and put them up against a date.  I want to let them discuss the permanent Bill as long as they like.  It is certainly not Government Ministers who take up the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we are grateful to the Government for that.  I am afraid the Minister is misunderstanding what I am trying to put before the House in as calm a manner as I possibly can.  The Defence Forces Bill will undoubtedly require time for examination and discussion, since the whole law in regard to our defence forces has never had an opportunity of a full discussion in Parliament.  Now, this Bill, whenever the parliamentary draftsman gives it to the Minister, may be circulated or may not be circulated. As I understand the position in regard to Public Business before the House or that will be before the House, it will be next autumn before there is an opportunity of taking the Second Stage of the Defence Forces Bill.  Eventually we will find ourselves with very little time to discuss it and pass it into law before the 31st March, 1951.</P>
      <P>There will be serious disappointment in the Army that the permanent Bill has not been brought before the House. There will be very serious disappointment that the Dáil has had no opportunity of discussing the machinery that controls the Defence Forces.  Deputy Traynor has referred to the strength of the Army and the morale of the Army.  None of us ever would say that the morale was not high, but there have been many grievances amongst all ranks.  I believe that those grievances could be removed if the machinery under which the Army is administered and controlled were changed.  That can be done only when we get an opportunity of discussing the new Defence Forces Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This opportunity might have been taken to make a very short statement in regard to policy.  What is the defence policy of this country at the moment?  Are the Regular Army, the permanent and non-permanent forces, strong enough to carry out that policy?  Are <Col N="811" /> they equipped as they ought to be? We would all have welcomed a statement on those lines from the Minister. What is the defence policy at the moment?  Is it a policy of taking sides in the event of a world war being sprung upon us or is it still a policy of neutrality?  If it is a policy of neutrality, are the defence forces at the moment strong enough, properly organised and adequately equipped for the purpose of maintaining neutrality in the face of any threats from any nation?  A statement on those lines from the Minister would be helpful to the Dáil, to the Defence Forces and to the country.</P>
    <P>There is a matter that arises in connection with that.  Has any country, other than Britain, military bases within the six occupied counties?  Have the American forces bases in the six occupied counties?  Have they received a lease of those bases?  Are those bases available for them in the event of war? If they have bases, and if they occupy those military bases, in the event of war, will they do what they planned to do and what they prepared to do in the last war, namely, move out from those bases and occupy our territory, in spite of our Army, in spite of our Government and in spite of our policy of neutrality?  If they were to attempt to do that, is it the policy of the Government and of the Army to stop that invasion or, at least, to do everything in their power to stop it?  These are serious matters, on which the House and the country should have some information and a declaration from the Minister.</P>
    <P>It ought to be made perfectly clear to every country that, no matter what the cost may be, this country will maintain its neutrality in the event of war in the near future and that it will defend its territory against any enemy that may endanger it or may attempt to occupy it.  A clear, specific statement on those lines is necessary and must do good.  A clear, specific statement on those lines must increase national morale and help all of us to defend our position.</P>
    <P>In another realm, statements have been made in regard to the line of <Col N="812" /> action that we might take in certain eventualities&mdash;in other words, if America were able to bring sufficient pressure upon Britain to induce or to compel Britain to vacate the Six Northern Counties, that we would take our place with one of the belligerents in a war that may come in the near future.  When those statements were made, were they made with the authority of the Minister for Defence? Do they express our defence policy in that particular eventuality?  In other words, would we as a nation sell our rights for the purpose of getting possession of the Six Northern Counties that are held from us and kept from us by force?</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he must bear that responsibility.  That is part of our defence policy, in my respectful submission to the Chair.  These are serious matters.  They are matters that ought to be dealt with as early as possible. I would invite the Minister to make a clear and specific statement on these matters when he is concluding.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Bill that the Minister has introduced, it is essential that our defence forces be maintained.  It is essential that they should exist under statutory authority.  Therefore, it is necessary that the Bill should be passed.  No Deputy could take it on himself to oppose the Bill or even to limit the duration for which the Bill will operate.  It did happen on one occasion in the Seanad that a Senator endeavoured to limit the period of operation of a Defence Forces Bill.  I think the action of that particular Senator at the time was unnational and unwise and he has disappeared from public life since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will get from the parliamentary draftsman, within <Col N="813" /> three months, the Defence Forces Bill and that when he gets it he will circulate it, so that the many Deputies who are anxious to contribute from their experience and knowledge to the improvement of that Bill will have sufficient time and opportunity to do so.  We have waited for 27 years for such a Bill. I hope the Minister's statement here to-day, that he will have it within three months, is correct.  I ask him to give us ample time to examine it and study its provisions.  If this debate will give the Minister an opportunity of making a statement along the lines that have been suggested already to him, I believe a very useful purpose will be served.</P>
    <P>I hope, in conclusion, that when this Bill is passed we will have seen the last of these temporary measures and that, for the first time in 27 years, Parliament will soon get an opportunity of creating machinery that will give us a satisfied, a contented, and an efficient defence force.  Under tremendous difficulties a defence force has been maintained that has been a credit to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is, of course, sure of this Bill, but I think in all fairness to the House he should have given some statement, when introducing it, on what the policy of the Government is in connection with the Army.  When the Minister was in opposition, he was constantly looking for that information himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He was looking for that information on this type of Bill and at every other opportunity he could get. We have, I think, more reason for looking for this information, because the Minister, when he was in opposition, never made it very clear whether he thought we should have an Army for defence purposes or not.  At one time he said that it ought to be only an auxiliary police force.  It is very necessary for us, in present circumstances, to know the Minister's intentions with regard to the Army.  I hope he will give us some definite information in his concluding statement, but even that will not be very satisfactory, <Col N="814" /> because we will have no opportunity of discussing it.</P>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister the present strength of the Army. So far as I can follow matters from outside, it has fallen very low.  I would also like to know if anything is being done about the defence of the civil population&mdash;civil defence&mdash;in the event of war.  So far as I can see, nothing seems to have been done in that regard. I may be wrong in that and, if so, I welcome correction.</P>
      <P>I understand that recruiting was renewed some time ago.  Will the Minister tell us what has been the result? Will he give us information as to the number and type of men who have been brought into the Army and what are the prospects for the future, judging from the present recruiting figures? At the present moment the world situation presents serious problems for every country.  When one sees what the big powers are doing in the way of defence, the money they are spending on defence&mdash;although some of them can very ill afford it&mdash;it makes one believe that the danger of war is not far distant.  So far as I can judge, we are taking no steps at all to defend ourselves properly.  Is it the Minister's view that, in the event of war, this country is to be defended, or are we to carry on in the way we seem to be carrying on&mdash;in such a way that if war came it would be an invitation to some of the belligerent powers to come in here?</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to deal with these few points.  As Deputy Cowan said, nobody with any national spirit will oppose the carrying on of the Army, but at least we are entitled to some information.</P>

      <P>We on these benches would very readily have agreed to give this measure to the Minister without much discussion if the permanent Bill were immediately in the offing, but the Minister cannot promise.  I understand quite well the difficulties that arise in the draftsman's department occassionally, because of the number of Bills Even though it gets priority, this particular Bill will necessarily have a large number of sections, as the Minister has <Col N="815" /> indicated, and it will take a considerable time to prepare.  That means that there will be no suitable opportunity given to Deputies to discuss what is at the moment a matter that is causing great concern to very many of our citizens; it certainly is causing grave concern to Deputies on these benches.</P>
      <P>We have had the experience of a major conflict breaking out when we had very inadequate forces for our defence.  We were fortunate in that a considerable period elapsed from the outbreak of the war until it became an immediate threat to us here.  During that time, it was possible to reorganise our forces; it was possible to build up a fairly substantial voluntary force and it was possible to give a certain amount of training to these forces. That was a favourable accident which we have no right to hope for again. Were it not for that favourable accident, we would indeed have found ourselves in a very bad way in this country.  The permanent portion of our Defence Forces on which our whole defence was to be based was allowed to become so small that it was not sufficient to train the body of volunteers that were recruited for emergency purposes.  Another thing which favoured us too was that several years before the emergency we had tried to introduce the volunteer spirit again and build up a volunteer force. Although that force was not built up to the extent we had hoped when it was initiated, nevertheless, it was of tremendous value to us when the emergency broke out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although we did get that year or so in which to make amends for what might be regarded as our neglect in the previous years, nevertheless, the position in which we found ourselves was anything but an enviable one. Before the war broke out certain equipment had been ordered in various places and when the war started we were not able to secure it.  If there is to be any question of neutrality for the future, we must make provision to get now the necessary supplies.  We must make provision to get the ammunition and so on which is necessary.  The amount of ammunition that even a <Col N="816" /> small army requires under modern conditions is tremendous and it is extremely difficult to have stocks in hand that would be sufficient to tide you over a considerable period of war. The situation, as has already been pointed out, is a really dangerous and serious one and if we feel a proper sense of responsibility at all, we ought not go on as we have been going, acting on the principle which the Taoiseach mentioned, legislating and acting simply for peace.  There is not a nation in the world that would not wish to be in a position of that sort; no country wants to spend, if it could avoid doing it, a considerable proportion of its revenues on maintaining defence forces, but they all do that because they realise that if they did not do it, their very independence would be at stake.</P>
    <P>We have been talking of the independence that has been achieved in this part of Ireland.  If we value that independence we should do everything in our power to see that it is maintained. We, on this side of the House, have grown more and more anxious recently about this whole question. What are we doing to act up to our responsibility to maintain this independence of which we are so proud?</P>
    <P>In the case of small nations like ourselves, the problem of defence is always a difficult one and one of the chief difficulties in it is the view that must be fairly general among the population of such a country that even their utmost efforts would not be sufficient if a major power attacked.  We had to meet that argument many times in the past.  It was the argument that was used in the first instance to beat down any effort that was being made to secure our independence, the argument that it was quite impossible to do so. It was also used as a reason why expenditure on the Army should be cut down. It was argued that that expenditure was not productive; it would not yield immediate dividends and therefore it should not be incurred; particularly it should not be incurred inasmuch as it would not produce even ultimate dividends in security.  That argument, in my opinion, is a completely wrong and fallacious argument for us to follow or <Col N="817" /> accept.  It is our duty to do our utmost whatever that utmost is.  We may differ as to what is the extent of our utmost, but at any rate I think that each one of us should agree that our utmost should be done in order to defend ourselves and maintain our independence.</P>
    <P>When the war was coming to an end certain questions were put up to the Government by the Army, and it was suggested that answers should be given. In the main they were: what is to be the defence policy of this State?  Were we to envisage a position in which we would be acting alone or a position in which we would be acting with others?  If we were going to act alone, what kind of defence should we have? Should we as, for instance, in Switzerland, have a very big volunteer force in which practically every citizen of the State would be a trained soldier?  If we were not to have compulsory training, what provision were we to make to have a substitute on a voluntary basis?</P>
    <P>I think the final reply was to the effect that we were to have an Army based on a certain permanent force with reserves to be brought up to the greatest extent that our manhood could, by voluntary recruitment, give to us.  The purpose of the permanent force was, during peace time, to be there to repel any sudden attack and to ensure that the Parliament elected by the people would be supreme and that its power would not be contested by any other army or group that might try to constitute themselves an army. Its purpose also was to be there for expansion in case of emergency.  The conclusion we came to, I think, was&mdash; at least the figure remains in my mind &mdash;that at least 12,500 officers and men would be required as a nucleus around which you could have this expansion. It was reduced somewhat afterwards following the emergency when a very large number of people were going out. The idea we had in mind was that the Army, certainly in times of threatened emergency, should amount to 12,500.  I am talking about the figure that should be aimed at certainly if there were danger of war, the figure that would give you the nucleus which could take control and thoroughly train and command <Col N="818" /> the volunteer force which might be recruited and might be available.</P>
    <P>I think that we cannot act to-day as we might have acted in the '20s.  The position to-day is very different from what it was in the '20s.  The world position is very different.  Everybody must realise that the danger of another great war is there.  We all hope and pray that it may not come actually, but the danger is there, and every country in the world that regards its independence of value is envisaging such a possibility, and is doing its best to provide for its safety in such a possibility.  We here do not seem to be facing this question at all.  We are just drifting along.</P>
    <P>The reason why we on these benches are speaking on this, and why we are using this occasion to do so, is because we think that the time has come when we cannot shelve this question any longer.  We here on these benches had the anxieties of war in which there was the possibility&mdash;I will put it no farther than that there was the possibility any-how&mdash;that we might possibly be attacked from either of two sides.  It is one of the great difficulties for us in the case of neutrality.  If our problem during that period was simply the problem of facing one side, well our resources could be used very much more effectively than it was possible to use them when we had to consider the possibility of attack from either side&mdash; particularly if there was a possibility of attack by the side based actually upon our own territory, that is in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>We, therefore, having passed through all that period, will do everything in our power to assist the Government to provide adequately for the defence of this country.  We ask them to be frank with the House and to tell us what their policy is.  Having experienced ourselves the difficulties of a Government that was responsible for national defence in such circumstances, the Government need not be afraid that we will face this question in any narrow spirit.</P>
    <P>One matter has been suggested here which is of the greatest importance to us.  Our position could be more readily determined were it not for the fact that <Col N="819" /> six of our counties are occupied.  That is a fact, and it is a thing that we must all the time, in connection with our defence problem, take into account. The Government have indicated that it is one of the principal difficulties they have at the moment in settling a defence policy.  Well, we cannot get rid of these facts.  If war were to break out to-morrow, that would be a fact and we would have to take cognisance of that fact, but there is no use in our trying to say, because that fact exists, that we will do nothing.  We cannot do that.</P>
    <P>We have a very serious responsibility. I do not think there has been any question which has come before the House since the change of Government, important though some of these questions were, which merits on the part of every Deputy such close examination and such diligent attention. On account of the way in which the Minister had previously referred to this matter, I did not expect that he was going at this stage to give a full explanation and indicate what the Government policy was.  I concluded what appears to be a fact, that he expected to get this Bill lightly and intended to postpone discussion on defence policy to a later time.  We would all co-operate with him in that were it not for the fact that we believe the situation is urgent, and that we cannot go on as we have been going, drifting in this particular matter.  Remember, if there is any truth in the rumours which are fairly common that the Army strength is deteriorating, and that some important officers have gone or are going out of the Army, some young men with whom one might hope to build the officer force of the future: if there is any truth in these rumours, it is a very serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  It has been suggested that there were certain young officers who, ordinarily, might be expected to stay in the Army, who were looking for positions outside, and were trying to get out of the Army.  If that were so <Col N="820" /> it would be a very serious position because an officer is not trained in a day.  You do not get young people like them, who had some experience during the emergency, reproduced in a very short period.  Is it true that the Army strength has deteriorated to such an extent that it is quite incapable of doing the work which our Regular Army must do to form the permanent core around which you must build your volunteer force?</P>

      <P>The fact is that if the Minister is in a position to give us the facts and a statement we will have something definite to go upon, and will not have to depend on the rumours that are current.  But the rumours have been disturbing.  They are disturbing, as far as I am able to find out, not merely to the ordinary representatives like ourselves here, but disturbing also to members of the Army.</P>

      <P>I will be very glad to assist anybody in dealing with anything that is untrue because things like these that are untrue can be very damaging and a source of danger.  If the fact is that these things are untrue, the sooner they are exposed the better.  The Minister is being given the opportunity now.  As I have said, I did not expect that the Minister would be ready to do that at the moment, but I would have liked that if it were possible.  The matter is a serious one, and we are anxious to co-operate.  I would prefer if we could have that discussion in connection with this Bill.  I am perfectly <Col N="821" /> certain that the Minister will get the Bill, but what we want to get, and what is of very great importance is that we should get here a discussion on defence&mdash;policy and measures.  The sooner the Minister gives the House an opportunity for that the better.  I do not know to what extent we could discuss that on the Minister's Estimate. If we could discuss it on the Estimate then we could forgo the discussion for a month or so, but I think the earliest opportunity ought to be taken by the Minister for that discussion.  I would like if we could have it on this Bill. The Minister himself may not be prepared to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That being so, I think the Minister ought to help by having an informed discussion on this whole question of national defence at the present time.  If he can help in that he will be doing a service not only to the members of the House but to the people in the country who are very seriously concerned about this whole matter.  This is the opportunity for doing it.  That is why some of us have intervened in this particular way and anything that the Minister can say to reassure us will certainly be received with pleasure as far as we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to impress upon him that we are very seriously concerned about this matter.  First of all, we do not know what is likely to be the defence policy.  I admit that it is not an easy thing to state it in advance of the particular circumstances, but what is the Defence Force policy, if I may put it that way without coming down to the general defence policy?  What is being done, for instance, to build up the organisation of the civil community which would be necessary in case of modern war and attacks from the air? There was the old problem which was a subject of concern during my period of office&mdash;that of evacuation of the civilian population from the cities. Suppose a city like this were to be subject to aerial bombardment, what was to be the policy with regard to the <Col N="822" /> civilian population?  We did the best we could to build up a scheme for the evacuation of our people from large centres of population like this, a scheme which I was very anxious about as to whether it would really work in case of need.</P>
    <P>These are matters to which we shall have to attend in the position in which the world is to-day.  Just like insurance against fire, the fact that we take precautions does not necessarily mean that we are certain that the things will happen.  It only means that we take what would be regarded as reasonable precautions.  We cannot do that if we are not prepared to spend some money on the doing of it.  It would certainly be very poor economy if, for the sake of expenditure on a defence arrangement for a year or two, we should find that an emergency came upon us in which we would lose 100 times as much. It is a question of reasonable assurance. Each of us is in duty bound to see that that insurance is effected.  The premium may be high, but when there is danger I think that reasonable people will have to make up their minds and that they will be prepared to pay the necessary premium.</P>
    <P>If he thinks he is in the position to do it, I hope the Minister will enlighten us on the question of the general defence policy, the Army strength which he thinks should go with that and the arrangement for civil defence which should go with it.  Do not forget also in connection with civil defence that one of the means by which we can defend ourselves is by producing here as much as possible of the necessaries of life.  We ought not to put ourselves in a position in which we could be squeezed, because that is what it means, through lacking some fundamental necessaries of life.</P>
    <P>We ought not to invite attack, as we certainly will if we have an open space which it could be suggested there was nobody to defend.  We, at least, ought to be able to answer to anybody who talks in that way about the position in this part of Ireland which we have under our immediate control: &ldquo;We are able to defend it.  There is no need for you to come in.&rdquo;  If you have not <Col N="823" /> a Defence Force here sufficient to enable you to say that, the temptation for other States to use that excuse for occupation will be very great.  I ask the Minister to bear that in mind and to see to it that the Defence Force will be of such a character that at least the excuse cannot be given by one side that there is a vacuum here which invites attack from the other side.  We may have another occasion for discussing this once the Minister has heard our views, but it would be preferable if he were prepared to do it now in connection with this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is in the happiest position that any Minister for Defence in time of peace has been for a long time in this House.  Before the last war, the then Minister for Defence, who was trying to build up the Army and the Volunteer force, was attacked by the then Opposition.  The only people who would attack the Minister now for spending a reasonable amount of money on the Army would not come from this side of the House.  Indeed, I do not know how the Army would stand if the Government gave a free vote of the House and the Opposition members were not to support the Minister's proposal that there should be an Army for another year.</P>
      <P>The Minister said here by way of interjection to Deputy Colley that they had never been informed about Army policy before the last war.  Not only were they informed about it on every occasion on which there was a defence debate in the Dáil, but they were asked to co-operate.  They refused to co-operate, however.  They did their utmost to prevent any force been built up here which would be effective in enabling the Dáil to choose its own policy and to defend that policy.  We have quite a different situation to-day.</P>

      <P>We want the Minister to give an indication of the Government defence policy in a situation in which most of the countries in Europe are spending 25 per cent. and some of them 30 per cent. and 50 per cent. of their exchequer income on defence.  What does the Government propose in the line of building up the Army and the auxiliary defence forces?  In 1934 we did our utmost to build up a Volunteer force to support the Army and we got the bitterest opposition from the then Opposition.  In 1948, there was in this country the F.C.A., which was comprised of 70,000 or 80,000 of the best young men in the country of all shades of political opinion.  Since that date I have hardly seen one occasion on which the Minister took any particular interest in the activities of that organisation. The standing Regular Army may carry on under its own steam and without much official encouragement, but a Volunteer force such as the F.C.A. will not be a success unless it is given the daily attention of the Minister responsible for the Army, and all the other Ministers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like the Minister here to-day to give some encouragement  <Col N="825" /> to the young men of the country to join the F.C.A. and be diligent in carrying out their duties in that organisation.  We know that a year ago the Government were so parsimonious that they would not spend even a few thousand pounds in bringing them up for annual training.  It would take a lot of visits by the Minister and other members of the Government to even up that grave discouragement, but we want him to give more attention to the F.C.A. than he has been giving it up to the present.  It is alleged that there are certain parts of the country where they cannot get even boots.  The Minister might not be able to get all the weapons we would require, but at least he would be able to get boots and proper uniforms for them and to see that they are supplied in time and in proper quantity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another auxiliary force that is being built up and given great attention to in nearly all European countries at present is the air-raid precautions section.  That is an organisation that can be built up without the spending of a great deal of money on equipment and we should at least do our utmost to see that the civilian population throughout the country are properly protected against such evils of air attack as we can protect them against. Over in England, for the past year or so, they have started a widespread campaign to reconstitute the civilian air precautions service in every town and village.  I cannot see from the papers, at any rate, any sign of any such activity here and we should like the Minister to let us know whether the air-raid precautions section exists to a greater extent than on paper, whether it is active in getting information from outside as to what other countries are doing in the matter of precautions against air-raids, and whether he proposes to impart that information to the people who might be affected.  During the war, we had a very big air-raid precautions organisation widely scattered throughout the country.  All sorts of people made great sacrifices in time and energy in keeping the organisation in being and in getting training, and if the most up-to-date information were conveyed to <Col N="826" /> an organisation of that type, we could at least see to it that we would be able to do almost as much as any other country in protecting our people from the effects of air bombardment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that they never got any indication of defence policy from the Government before the war. As early as 1934, it was laid down by the then Taoiseach that the basic element of our defence policy was that we were not going to allow this country to be used as a basis of attack against our nearest neighbour.  Is that the Government's policy?  Is it their intention to ensure that all proper steps will be taken to make that policy effective? We know that some members of the present Government had widely different views as to what we should do in the event of our nearest neighbour becoming involved in war and we would like to know whether there is in fact any agreed policy between members of the Government and what that policy is.  Does it differ widely from the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government before the war and during the war?  If it is in any way different, we should like to know about it and to know also whether it has the approval of the members supporting the Government and whether, in fact, while the Minister is asking the people through taxation to support an official Army, there is any other section of his Government supporting, through sweepstake tickets and other things circulating throughout the city, an army to attack it.</P>
    <P>The people clearly knew where Fianna Fáil stood in regard to defence policy before the clouds of the last war gathered to any great extent.  We did our utmost to persuade the Dáil and the people to organise themselves so that we would have some chance at least of coming to our own decision in relation to the war which we feared would come upon the world.  We succeeded to the extent that, when this Dáil made up its mind to be neutral, the Army was able to organise its Defence Forces to the extent that that decision was respected.  If to-morrow a war broke out, this Dáil would have to make its decision and its decision would be largely affected by our power <Col N="827" /> to defend ourselves.  If we have no Army, nothing to fight with, if we have not got a reasonable amount of the essentials of life within our shores, or being produced within our shores, the decision will be made by somebody else and we will be kicked around.  It will pay our people to bring home to the Government that it is their duty so to arrange not only the national military defences but our economic defences that we can make our decision and have a reasonable chance of sticking to that decision during the war, in spite of what anybody else may say.</P>
    <P>Before the last war, every penny the Government proposed to spend on the Army was opposed.  We will not oppose any reasonable expense on the Army, and if this Government, instead of increasing taxation by £7,000,000, had decreased it by £10,000,000, as they promised they would, we could keep quite a respectable Army without any additional taxation.  The Government has been squandering money in all sorts of ways.  Notwithstanding the fact that they cut down very severely on the Army, they are collecting another £7,000,000 off the people.  We hope that in the coming Estimates we will see some indication that the Government are aware of the type of world they are living in and that they will carry out their duty to the Irish people to build up a Defence Force here within the State that will enable the Irish people to take their decision and keep it if war should come.</P>

      <P>One would have thought from the papers circulated to the House that this Bill would have been a very transitory matter and that we would have had the permanent Bill before us.  I understand that that Bill is not likely to reach us for some time. We are, therefore, in the position of dealing with the question referred to the House of determining whether we will continue with the Army for a year or perhaps less, or whether we will not. That question seems wide enough to embrace the whole question of defence. One difficulty, however, arises and that is the fact that defence nowadays embraces all Departments of State and <Col N="828" /> it is hardly sufficient in dealing with the problem merely to relate oneself to the armed forces.  One finds oneself very quickly dealing with practically every aspect of the economic life of the community when considering the matter.  For debate purposes it is rather difficult to make all the considerations relevant to the problem actually relevant to the debate itself. Certainly, this much is relevant: in all matters of defence one is concerned not merely with the maintenance of an armed force, but also with the problem of ensuring that adequate preparation is made in advance to enable the Government and the Parliament of the day to make a proper decision in the interests of the people in time of crisis. Ultimately that is the real question which is involved here.</P>
      <P>In any possible or probable crisis the Government and the Parliament of the day should be in a position to make an independent decision in the interests of the people.  Unless preparation is made in advance to put the Government and the Parliament in a position to make such decision, then no choice will be left open.  Accordingly, therefore, every time the Defence Vote comes up that question comes up with it.  What we are faced with here is ensuring that in such a crisis, if such should come, the people through their Government and their representatives here will be in a position to make a choice and not find themselves in the position that they are virtually compelled to bow to the inevitable; not find themselves in the position, for instance, in which the Minister for Finance found himself when devaluation broke.  Nothing had been done. Things had been left drift.  Devaluation came and we were presented with a magnificent statement as to why we should bow to devaluation.</P>

      <P>It is relevant for the purposes of illustration.  I am pointing out that one should have the opportunity of exercising freedom of choice.  Explanations, when no such choice is open, are of no value.  There is another lesson which can be learned <Col N="829" /> from the past.  The events which took place here in the development of our Defence Forces prior to the war put us in the position of making a free choice in 1939.  One cannot consider this defence problem on the narrow basis of merely regarding it as a question of armed forces. One must look at the broad issues involved in order to get a proper perspective. From that point of view we may legitimately ask: what are we doing in regard to defence?  What prudent preparation are we making to face a possible crisis?  Are we carefully anticipating such a crisis?  It is equally relevant to ask: what is the possibility of a crisis?  One has only to read the newspapers to see what the position is.  Right through the past 12 months, to go no further back, practically every country in the world has been preparing for war.  The signs are all there.  Let us hope that war will not come.  Providence may prevent it. We believe in the power of Providence. Even in the rush and intensity of the preparations there are hopeful signs; perhaps war will not come.  Nevertheless, it would be very foolish and imprudent to ignore the portents.  It would be very foolish to bury one's head in the sand whilst other nations consider the situation sufficiently serious to warrant the expenditure of enormous sums of money on defence. Britain and the United States of America are spending huge sums on defence.  Consider the amount that the United States is spending in an effort to build up Western Europe.  Consider the armed might of Russia.  The latest information is that Russia is developing in quite an unexpected direction in regard to naval activities.  Norway is spending £137,000,000 over a six years' programme.  Norway is a little country comparable to us.  She paid the price of lack of preparation in the last war. Apparently she still thinks it worth while to prepare for a crisis.  Holland and Switzerland are going all-out in their defence programmes.  Every country is intensely active.  Yet, we apparently drift along quietly complacent and without paying any attention to this problem that may confront us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another significant feature from our <Col N="830" /> point of view is the fact that Great Britain, quite an insignificant distance from us under modern conditions, is preparing for the defence of her civilian population.  Under modern conditions, where atomic warfare may play a part, very careful advance organisation is necessary to ensure any degree of protection for the civilian population.  With proper organisation and preparation a certain degree, indeed a high degree, of protection is possible.  That preparation largely depends on the training of personnel to organise and direct that activity.  That training is of a very specialised nature.  It takes time.  It has to be itself organised before any civil defence organisation can be set up.  One may justifiably say that all that preparation is taking place on our own front door.  Yet, as far as one can judge, here we are doing absolutely nothing.</P>

      <P>First of all, in 1939 the position was very different. The development of air power and of what one could contemplate from air power was not what it is to-day.  It was then believed that a gas threat was imminent.  For the two years prior to 1939 a gas school was established in Griffith Barracks which was attended by consecutive and continuous classes of people from various local authorities and hospitals, and from other places, who were being put through intensive courses.  That was stepped up and hurried during 1939.  To-day you have no such organisation at all.  To-day you have practically scrapped the technical departments in the Army. Such technical departments as were in the Army at the end of the emergency are now, according to my information, ineffective.  I understand the laboratory in the Army no longer functions as such.  There is the difference between now and 1939&mdash;if Deputy O'Higgins wants to know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="831" /> The important thing for our people to realise is that there is a defence problem facing them; that, fundamentally, what is involved is that if a crisis comes, and particularly if a state of hostilities comes near them, provision will have to be made for their living and survival.  Apart from any question of fighting, and in order to meet that problem of living, preparation must be made in advance and in a particular way.  It will be too late to organise if you wait until the crisis is on you.  Modern war, for instance, will necessitate careful regional organisation in case any particular area is put out of action or in case communications with the central Government are disrupted.  That regional organisation must be such as will enable those in the relatively unaffected parts to carry on.  Transport, communications, food stocks and all that sort of thing are all tied up with defence and yet nothing is being done about it.</P>

      <P>The answer, in the case of 1939, is just like the answer in the case of the gas schools.  The work had gone on.  Turf development had been organised and, therefore, we were in a position to be independent in respect of the threat of lack of fuel. Owing to the policy adopted by the then Government and by the then Minister for Agriculture, we developed our own resources to the extent that we could resist any threat to cut out our fuel and food supplies.  The country was able to feed the people.  The Articles of the Treaty, which would give a juridical excuse for interference, were gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of these things, the Government of the day was in a position to make a free choice.  As I have remarked on another occasion, paradoxically enough, because they were in a position to make that free choice, they got things easier than they would if they had been merely in the position of bowing to the inevitable&mdash; like the Minister for Finance recently in respect of devaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is going to be embarrassed by references to devaluation except the Minister for Finance, who made what was an excellent professorial statement, but who did nothing.  To return to what is relevant, whatever the lessons of the past&mdash;and their importance is that we can learn from the past&mdash;every indication of the present situation is that we should prepare to put ourselves in a position to make an independent choice, to make a decision that will suit our people and that will be in their interests; to make preparation so that life can be carried on for the benefit of our people and not for the benefit of anybody else.  To do that, the prudent thing is to prepare now and not permit ourselves to drift so that should a crisis unfortunately break, you could do no better than bow to the inevitable.  That is the importance of all these considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this question, more narrowly, of defence, the Government and this House has, firstly, a responsibility not only for the welfare of the people at the present moment but also to do all prudent things to secure the welfare of the people in the immediate future and, more important still, not to, by default or otherwise, allow a situation to develop to the disadvantage of our people.  In other words, it is our duty and the duty of the Government to exercise adequate forethought for the benefit of our people.  It is for that reason, as I have said, that this Bill is of such importance.  It is a corollary to that that our people should be told the factual position dispassionately, without minimising it on the <Col N="833" /> one hand or without anything savouring of alarmist rumours or alarmist activity, on the other hand.</P>
    <P>They should be told soberly and quietly the factual position&mdash;what the potentialities of the situation are.  They should be given reasons as to why such an opinion is expressed or as to why these facts are.  They should be told what is going on in other countries. They should be, in other words, conditioned morally to face the problems which, through no fault of their own, or of this country, have to be faced in these unhappy times.  Our people should be told all these things.  Having told them, the Government should survey and prepare prudently, not extravagantly but not inadequately, for any likely situation&mdash;and that is always a difficult problem for any Government. It is normally a particularly difficult problem for a Government where defence matters are concerned because usually the Opposition in Parliament will be such as will tend to defeat them at every turn on the plea of economy. But the present Government and the present Minister have not that situation to cope with.  They have the advantage that the present Opposition are composed of people who themselves had the experience of Government and who are exercising a responsible attitude in this regard.  Therefore, as I think Deputy Aiken remarked, the Minister and his Government are in the very happy and unusual position of being able to command co-operation, all reasonable co-operation, in this important matter.  It is all the more reason then why they should diligently attend to it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the question so depends on the attitude of the people ultimately, that they should be informed of the situation.  Therefore, I think that a considered and reasoned estimate of the situation and a statement of the Government's policy in this regard would now be most opportune.</P>
    <P>Let us move on to consider more specifically what is involved in this Bill. Again, I must emphasise, however, that defence is not a matter of toy soldiers or merely armed forces.  They are an adjunct, a necessary part.  They are, ultimately, one of your fences or <Col N="834" /> hedges, so to speak, to your power of making a decision.  However, when all is said and done, the vital problem is that of enabling the nation and the people to survive during an emergency and to take the best course that can be taken in their interests at such a time.  Where does the Army come in? It comes in firstly as necessary to securing and implementing such a decision&mdash;to securing a favourable stand, so to speak, when a decision is forced upon you.  That fact arises largely from geography.  Let any Deputy look at our geographical position and that will be abundantly clear. It is obvious, as so many other speakers have said, that unless you are in a position here to supply your own security force, and initially at any rate to defend your territory, and to deter anybody else from interfering with you, your possibility of free choice, when a choice becomes necessary or when it is desirable to make one, becomes very prejudiced by the absence of adequate forces and organisation.  That is the case firstly for the Army.  That is the case why this Bill should be passed and why we should exhort the Minister to get ahead with the organisation of these forces as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The second reason is that we are a small country.  We cannot afford overheads in organisation and administration beyond what are necessary.  It, therefore, largely falls on the Army to cater for the organisation and planning of such matters as civil defence. On the Minister's Department will largely fall the responsibility for making the necessary initial recommendations and very probably the duty of preparing a detailed plan for such things as emergency supply services, casualty clearing, air-raid precautions, etc.  If all these things are to be properly handled, it presupposes adequate strength, proper organisation and proper facilities in the Minister's own Department.  It presupposes that the Army itself will be able to supply the necessary information, the necessary plans and the necessary key personnel to handle and direct such activities. Are we in that position to-day? The Minister could very well tell us what, if anything, has been done in the matter of co-ordination of the purely <Col N="835" /> military aspect of the situation with such additional aspects as evacuation, transport, regional organisation supply, etc.  Can the Minister tell us whether anybody in his Department has any liaison with any other Department, or whether any provisions have been made in respect to such important matters as storage, even for food and materials, which proved to be a big problem in the last war?</P>
    <P>What is the situation of our forces, or such forces as we can have, in regard to the supply of materials, during such an emergency, which we could produce at home?  There the whole question of industry and the co-ordination of industry comes up.  Has the Minister got a Department actively attending to that, or again will some officers at a late hour find themselves trying to organise emergency services of that nature?  There are many lessons we could have learned from the past emergency, coupled with the picture which we can now have of what is likely to break in future.  What are we doing on foot of these lessons?  These are all things about which the Minister could tell us.  Some of these matters will arise again on the Estimate and questions of detail perhaps may as well be reserved.</P>
    <P>Then the question of reserves comes up.  I understand, having gone through the figures which the Minister gave in answer to a question last year, that what I might call the first line reserve is quite inadequate to bring such a Defence Force as we have up to any workable strength should mobilisation be necessary.  I have myself for three years now tried to hammer home the lesson that we were completely below any workable strength in 1939 and that it was only because there were six months in which to incorporate the then reserve so as to bring the Army up to the region of something like 14,000, that we were able to handle the situation in 1940.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. T.F. O'Higgins Mr. T.F. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, you were not prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is a lesson to make sure that that does not happen again.  On the figures which I <Col N="836" /> got last year the total strength which can be mobilised, including ordinary reserves, would not much exceed that figure.  However, the Minister may have got in a substantial number of recruits during the year.  He will tell us the present strength.  The situation may be somewhat better at the present moment, but, even so, the total strength to be mobilised, without the guarantee of a time factor that would afford an opportunity of organisation them, would not very much exceed the 1940 figure, I believe.  Therefore, the question of building up the Reserve arises.</P>
      <P>There is also the F.C.A.  One hears complaints in regard to that force.  I have heard complaints, for instance, as to lack of facilities, complaints that they have not been able to get equipment and boots.  I put these points to the Minister.  I understand that it is only very recently, after a considerable delay, that the Minister has made available training personnel.  Having regard to the present strength of our total forces, that force assumes an importance that one might describe as paramount.  You have there excellent material and excellent enthusiasm. But if they are to be effective they need encouragement and facilities, attention and organisation.  Anybody who has experience of a Volunteer force in peace time knows that a certain minimum number of regular or whole-time personnel are necessary if efficiency is to be attained.  Not only are personnel necessary to train them but whole-time personnel are necessary to enable the administration and organisation to work smoothly.  Is the F.C.A. receiving these facilities at the moment?  In other words, is there a sufficient number of whole-time personnel attached to enable the force to reach any degree of efficiency as a body?  These are matters of importance which should be looked into. These are matters upon which the Minister could very well outline his policy and say where we stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there is the question of specialists within the Army itself.  I think it has been remarked on more than one occasion that in the case of an Army, it is not only necessary and essential that the individual specialists <Col N="837" /> should be highly skilled and trained, but it is also necessary that the unit as a whole should be equally skilled and trained.  In other words, the training of specialists, while necessary and essential, is not sufficient.  You need adequate training of the unit as a whole if that unit is going to perform the duties which they may be called upon to perform.  Adequate training and adequate efficiency in that sense are very largely dependent on numbers. Have we a sufficient number of men in specialist units to do collective training and to reach that pitch of efficiency? What policy are we adopting in regard to specialists?  Specialists nowadays embrace practically the whole gamut of military activity &mdash; artillery, cavalry, these are mechanised troops nowadays, signals and any corps you care to name.  They need numbers for efficiency.  What specialised corps have we got and what are the strengths of those corps?  It is not enough to tell the people that we have so many men all round in the Defence Forces; if they are merely maintaining barracks or guards or doing routine work, they cannot be put into the class of the essential specialists.  Thinking people want to know where we stand regarding specialised corps and they would be glad to have the Minister's answer. I have heard &mdash; I may be wrong and would be glad to know definitely what the facts are&mdash;that trained men of the specialised class have actually left the Army and have been re-employed as civilian personnel for some reason or other and that many of our specialised corps, such as cavalry and artillery, are being maintained in many ways by civilian personnel who are not soldiers at all.  If that is true, I do not think that position is satisfactory.  It would be interesting to have information on the point.</P>
    <P>In these days, there can be no question of high secrecy in such matters&mdash; generally, anyway&mdash;and some statement could be made.  It would be reassuring to the people to know exactly where we stand.  It is only in that way that the Minister will get the co-operation of the people in doing what should be done.</P>
    <P>From specialists is a very short cry <Col N="838" /> to another type of Army specialist which is very important.  What is the position in regard to our medical services? Is the Army Medical Service in a position to supply and direct certain key personnel in default of their being supplied elsewhere?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they in a position to cater for problems that may arise in an emergency?  For instance, is there any section or corps to deal with chemical research or production problems of that nature?  Where do we stand in regard to specialised officers?  Is there any Department in the Army making provision for emergency production of materials which might be required in an emergency? Is there any liaison with industry, particularly productive industry, whether engineering or chemical in this country?</P>
      <P>This Bill before us now is of an old type&mdash;one we have been asked to reenact again and again.  It provides mainly for discipline, but in so far as it contemplates the development of the Defence Forces it largely pictures the type of force that was carried on in the days before total war, before people generally were wholly involved and before the multitudinous problems which now arise in connection with arimes arose.  We have no indication that the essential matters I have mentioned are being looked into and provided for.  Judging by the strength of the Army, it would seem to be very tight to provide for them.  If they are not provided for, it is high time that we did something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the net, we are asking the Minister to tell us the factual position and the Government's policy in regard to defence.  We are asking him to tell us what the estimate of the situation is and what he and the Government propose to do about it.  We ask him to reassure us that all the broad aspects of defence have been properly co-ordinated, and that steps are being taken now to ensure that, if it should be necessary to make national decisions that might have a bearing on defence, we are in a position to make a choice <Col N="839" /> in the interest of the people and that we are not driven into a position where, by default, we will be left with no choice and must bow to the inevitable. The Minister is being asked these things in a spirit of co-operation.  Our difficulty is that the very silence and apparent disinterest of the Government Parties in this problem leave us not knowing where precisely we stand.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to statements of policy before 1939, but the important thing is that prior to 1939&mdash;and, if my recollection goes back aright, particularly at the time we got back the ports &mdash;there were, on more than one occasion, made by the then Head of the Government and by other Ministers at the time unequivocal statements as to where we stood, that we were prepared to look after ourselves in time of war or crisis, that we were voluntarily and knowingly undertaking that responsibility and were prepared to discharge the onus of that responsibility.</P>
    <P>There were unequivocal and definite statements that this country would be organised and all proper steps taken to see that it was not used, in particular, as a basis for attack on neighbouring countries.  These things were stated.  It was apparent from the steps taken at the time that that policy was being implemented.  On the economic side, the whole development of our economy was towards self-reliance, enabling us to take an independent decision free of economic pressure. On the political side, the move was the same, with the rejection and abolition of all clauses in treaties or elsewhere tying us to give facilities to anybody outside.  We organised, in spite of opposition and misunderstanding at home, a voluntary reserve on top of the Regular Reserve and Army and we trained them.  Civilian defence organisations were brought into being and the Civil Defence School in Griffith Barracks was developed.  Provision was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce for stocks of foodstuffs and anyone who wants to check it up can go to the statistics and see how the imports of essential fertilisers and so on rose prior to the war in contemplation thereof.  All these steps were <Col N="840" /> taken quietly.  The political situation was difficult because of the attitude of some people then sitting on these benches.</P>

      <P>In any event, all these things were done, and there was an opportunity for a free choice, which was taken, which could not be taken if you were not in that position.  All we are asking the Minister to do is, while time is left, to see that we will try to keep in as favourable a position as we possibly can to meet any future crisis. What time is there?  Who can tell? Many people are pointing towards a five-year interval.  Again, the crisis may never come, but is it prudent to bet everything on that?  If the crisis does come, there are indications that the next five years will be a critical time and one can come to that conclusion whether one approaches it from a military point of view or looks at it purely from an economic point of view on the basis that a war will ultimately be avoided.  In any event, the time in front of us looks like being difficult. Therefore, we should prepare and take adequate precautions.  That is all we ask the Minister to do and, what is more, he is getting the offer of co-operation in any steps that can be taken for the benefit of our people, who are the paramount consideration.  That is all we are asking the Minister.</P>

It is for that very reason that we think that should come from the Minister and the Government.  They will get the proper co-operation.  There is a problem.  It can be faced with the unanimous, calm deliberation of this House.  It can be faced without any minor considerations.  The Minister and I can discuss it in a friendly manner across the House.  I hope we are all fundamentally agreed that the welfare of our people is the paramount consideration, that we have a duty to try to arrange now that, if a crisis breaks, the welfare of our people can be provided for to the maximum extent possible.  That, I hope, is the view of everybody here.  We are merely asking the Minister to enable all people to co-operate in that.  One reads and studies the news of the day, in particular the economic journals.  Read the <i>Economist,</i> for instance, regularly and see what you will get out of it. One feels there is a serious problem. That problem is such that steps should be taken.  They are best taken with the co-operation of the country as a whole and, in order to get the co-operation of the country as a whole, some such statement or help from the Minister or the Government is necessary.</P>

Since the present Government came into office, we have had no definite indication as to where we stand or what our attitude is on this important matter.  Up to the beginning of this year the whole emphasis was on economy.  The whole attitude on this vital question up to January of this year was that we were going into an <Col N="842" /> era of peace; the Government worked on a hypothesis of peace, that we must save as much money as we can.  That was the only indication that we got. There has been a recruiting drive initiated.  I hope it has been successful and that the Minister has received a good response.  I am sorry that two years have been lost.  Nevertheless, I hope the Minister has had a response to that drive and I take it, having regard to the previous attitude, that this has some significance.  It would be good for the country, good for the Government, good for this House, if we got some help in that regard.  That is all we are asking for.</P>

It is extraordinary, having regard to the fact that many Deputies failed to get that measure introduced in the last seven years.  The anxiety of Fianna Fáil on this matter has only been made public in the last few hours.  The measure that the Minister is about to introduce should have been introduced years ago. It sounds very hypocritical when Deputy Major de Valera tells us that there is danger of war and rumours of war.  I am not prepared to accept Deputy Major de Valera as an authority on when we are going to have war.  Neither will I accept him as an authority on our defence measures because I am very much afraid that the type of mentality portrayed in his speech is the mentality that existed in the senior element of the Army for a number of years past. I am afraid that under the brass hats there were a lot of brass heads.  I am afraid some of them have come into this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> I had hoped that this debate would be kept on a high level but Deputy Aiken and Deputy de Valera have gone to great pains to establish the fact, mar dheadh, that this Government is responsible for the small size of the Army to-day.  The responsibility for the size of the Army lies with the ex-Minister opposite.  When the emergency was over, young men poured out of the Army in their thousands.  They are not in this country to-day.  I remember seeing queues of fine young men who had been in the Army outside offices in Dublin, trying to join up the British services or to get work in British mines. In other words, after giving the best years of their lives in the service of this country, they got a miserable gratuity and were tossed out on the labour market, while at the same time men who did not join the Defence Forces during the emergency, but carried on outside, received promotion in their various occupations.  The few ex-Army men who did get work when they came out had to start again at the bottom.</P>
    <P>That is remembered to-day by the men who left the Army, and the advice is given by ex-Army men to every likely recruit: &ldquo;If you have any sense stay out of the Army or you will get the same treatment as we got.&rdquo;  That is the reason why there has been little or no response to the recruiting drive started approximately two years ago.  The morale of the Army had gone down considerably in the years between 1943 and 1946.  In this debate I will not go into the various reasons that caused that decline in morale, but it is well to remember that the responsibility for the small size of our Defence Forces to-day does not lie with this side of the House, but does lie with the men who occupy the Opposition Benches.  It was their short-sighted policy in dealing with the Army personnel that has left a bad taste in the mouths of those men who came out of the Army.</P>
    <P>I hope the present drive for recruits will be successful.  Like Deputy de Valera, I hope that young men will answer the call.  It is the duty of Deputies on both sides of the House to encourage a good type to join our permanent forces.  When we discuss <Col N="844" /> policy with regard to defence, I think we should have a look, first of all, at our position on the map of the world. It would be well for some Deputies opposite who have spoken to remember, when they make a comparison with Norway or other small countries in Europe, that geographically we may appear to be in the same circumstances from the point of size, but our position on the map is far different from that of Denmark, Holland, Norway, Sweden or Belgium and we must take into account, when we are preparing a defence plan, where our island stands on the map.</P>
    <P>The next problem we must face is, in the event of war, are we going to take sides?  Let us say that we do not intend to take part in a war on any side, that we intend to adopt a neutral attitude.  If that is the position, I have no hesitation in saying that we must have adequate ground forces to enable us to remain neutral.  I would like to emphasise that.  I do not want to see a large standing Army; I want to see a small regular force, a highly-trained Volunteer force, something in the form of the F.C.A.  When Deputy de Valera talks about specialists in the Army I think it would be still more important to have these specialists in the F.C.A.  The best form of defence this country can ever hope to undertake is something along the lines of mobile or guerilla warfare.  In the past it seemed to have been in the minds of the General Staff that they could sit down at tables and play about with regiments, divisions and armies, the same as if we had three or a few Rommels or a few Eisenhowers.  We can never hope to take part in warfare of that type.</P>
    <P>We must face realities.  The best we can ever hope to do is to put up a defence in various localities throughout the country, and the most effective force for that is the F.C.A.  The expert training of Army personnel should be passed on to the F.C.A.  I am afraid the position of the F.C.A. to-day is anything but good from the point of view of training.  Undoubtedly a great number of them know how to use small arms, such as rifles, revolvers and hand-grenades.  Outside that their experience is limited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> I advocated before that the F.C.A. should be taught signalling and demolition work.  I have made it my business to check up on the knowledge of the F.C.A. in the rural areas with reference to demolitions, and I found in the majority of cases they are a bigger danger to themselves, when it comes to demolitions, than they would be to any invading forces.  The F.C.A. has existed quite a long time under different names.  At this stage they should have had an opportunity of receiving practical training in demolition work.</P>
    <P>I want to get back again to some of Deputy de Valera's remarks.  He said that during the war we had laboratories established for research purposes, for investigating various possibilities of warfare.  I hope he is not serious in suggesting that we should start more laboratories here and have scientists working again in this country on something&mdash;this must have been in his mind&mdash;in the nature of a hydrogen or an atom bomb.  If he is serious in his suggestion, I would like to know what possible use we can get from such laboratories here when we have at our disposal the findings of other countries in their research laboratories.  If he is serious about going into this research business, is he prepared to ask the Minister to spend millions in so doing? In my opinion it would take more to establish a research laboratory and maintain it than it would to keep a standing army of considerable strength. I think that point raised by Deputy de Valera is very foolish indeed.</P>
    <P>If we decided to remain neutral it will be necessary to have adequate ground forces.  The F.C.A. could be trained in all aspects of warfare and they would provide all that could be required.  In order to have the F.C.A. and the Army in a position to enforce our neutrality, we must have a certain amount of ammunition and other war material available.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that it is no use shelving the question of purchasing war material.  I know the Minister will say that each year something new comes out, some fresh invention, some new weapon, and the possibilities are that <Col N="846" /> if we invest so much in buying guns of a modern type, they may become obsolete within 12 months.  We have to take that chance, and I think that nobody is going to blame the Minister if he invests a certain amount of money in suitable war equipment.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

    <Title>Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Bill, 1949&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon) James M. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Dillon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  In moving the Second Reading of this Bill I should like to recall to the memory of Dáil Éireann that on the occasion when I first moved the Agricultural Estimate in this House I invited the Dáil to judge of the failure or the success of the agricultural policy of this Government by the measure in which agricultural workers shared in any improvement the farmers derived from the new departure.  It gives me some satisfaction then on the second anniversary of that invitation to call the attention of the Dáil to the fact that when this Government took office the minimum agricultural wage over the greater part of this country was £2 10s. 0d. per week with suitable adjustments for one or two special areas; the minimum wage to-day is £3 per week with corresponding adjustments in certain areas.  The Bill which I submit now represents a further advantage to be conferred on agricultural workers by statute and, of course, a corresponding burden of expense on the farmers who employ them.  The temptation to be charitable with your neighbour's goods is always strong.  I submit to Dáil Éireann that there is a duty on any Legislature before they impose a burden by statute on any section of the community to have careful regard to the rights in justice and equity of all parties to the contemplated transaction. Therefore, when I asked myself the question of whether I might properly ask Dáil Éireann to enact this legislation, I had a duty to consider whether those on whom the expense would fall might reasonably be asked to bear the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The minimum rate of agricultural <Col N="847" /> wages has risen by 20 per cent.  These agricultural workers, if Oireachtas Éireann passes this Bill, will now have the right to six days' annual leave with pay and the farmers who must meet those two additional charges will have this fund from which to meet it.  Before these advantages accrued to the agricultural workers, in 1947, the exports of live cattle from this country were worth £15,629,000.  In 1949 they were worth £20,446,000 involving an increase of £4,817,000.  In 1947 the export of eggs was worth £1,547,000.  In 1949 they were worth £5,230,000, an increase of £3,683,000.  Exports of meat and poultry in 1947 were worth £3,128,000. In 1949, they were worth £5,650,000, an increase of £2,522,000.  The exports of milk, condensed and dried, and cheese in 1947 were worth £579,000.  In 1949 they were worth £1,610,000, an increase of £1,031,000.  Exports of chocolate crumb in 1947 were worth £472,000.  In 1949, they were worth £1,748,000.  Exports of potatoes in 1947 were worth £374,000.  In 1949 they were worth £791,000, an increase of £417,000.  Exports of raw wool in 1947 were worth £894,000.  In 1949, they were worth £1,469,000, an increase of £575,000.  So the value of our exports of live cattle has gone up by 30 per cent., of eggs by 231 per cent., of meat and poultry by 80 per cent., of milk, condensed and dried and cheese by 179 per cent., of chocolate crumb by 270 per cent., of potatoes by 111 per cent. and raw wool by 63 per cent.  The estimate of agricultural income is not a figure of which one can attempt to speak with precision and you will bear in mind that these figures I am about to give are approximations. We believe them to be reasonably accurate.  Subject to that warning, the agricultural income in 1947 was believed to be £78,620,000 and in 1948 it was £87,450,000 and we are not without hope that for 1949 the sum of £100,000,000 will not represent any exaggeration.</P>
    <P>It is in these circumstances that I ask the House to pass this Bill, the effect of which is to provide that every agricultural worker, working for wages in this country, will be entitled to have from his employer each year six days' <Col N="848" /> annual leave with pay.  Such a provision has already been made in Argentina, Austria, Belguim, Denmark, France, Great Britain and Northern Ireland, New Zealand, Norway and Sweden.  In making this provision, we must have regard to the fact that a considerable percentage of agricultural workers are employed casually.  It is, therefore, proposed in the Bill that, where an agricultural worker works for two months continuously for one employer, he will be entitled to a day's holiday with pay, subject to the limit, of course, of six days in the 12 months.</P>
    <P>The conditions under which our farmers work, we must remember, are not identical with those in countries where the custom is to have very large holdings, and, consequently, relatively large bodies of agricultural workers. Here, we must bear in mind, there is a very large number of farms on which there is no more than one agricultural worker.  It is to meet that contingency that, I think, prudence demands that, at this stage in any case, we should provide that it will be open to a farmer to give his employee the six days' holidays as individual day's holidays, not necessarily six days in a row, though I do not doubt that the majority of farmers who are so circumstanced as to make that possible will, if the worker wishes it, do their best to meet their worker's convenience.</P>
    <P>In drafting a Bill of this character one has to provide for contingencies which one does not regard as probable but which might turn up and could cause confusion if provision were not made for them.  It could happen that the minimum two months' continuous employment, giving rise to the right to one day's holiday with pay, could be interrupted by the illness of the agricultural worker, and it might be sought to establish that that interruption, arising from illness, destroyed his statutory right to a day's holiday. Provision is made to ensure that the interruption of continuous employment of that kind will not destroy the worker's claim unless the absence from work, owing to illness, extends over a period of eight days.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that the holidays ordinarily enjoyed at the present time <Col N="849" /> by agricultural workers shall be deemed to be the holidays provided for in this Bill.  The intention of this Bill is to provide that, in addition to the holidays ordinarily enjoyed by agricultural workers at the present time, there shall be six days' additional holiday with pay.  We have, I believe, successfully made it clear that Sundays, Church holidays or bank holidays, or any other holiday of that character which is at present enjoyed by the worker, will not be substituted for the six days which it is proposed he should have under this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is provision that the holidays must be given in the course of the employment year, and there is the usual statutory penalty of £20 where it appears to the court that an agricultural employer, well knowing his duty under the Act, has refused to perform it.  The general enforcement of the provision of this Bill, if it becomes an Act, is committed to the care of the Agricultural Wages Board, and provision is made that, in certain circumstances, if the agricultural worker is not in a position to take his holidays before his contract of employment comes to a conclusion, he shall be entitled to have pay in lieu thereof, or if the employer and worker mutually agree, and he does not want to take the holiday, it will be open to both parties to agree to give him a week's pay in lieu of his holidays.  But that arrangement is subject to mutual agreement between the parties.</P>
    <P>I do not anticipate that the administration of this measure will impose any additional charge on public funds because I expect that it will be possible for the Agricultural Wages Board, with its present personnel and equipment, to carry out whatever supervisory work may be required.  But, I think I should tell the House that, on the Committee Stage of the Bill, if the Second Reading is given, I shall have to submit for the approval of the House three drafting amendments.  The House will understand that it is very often extremely difficult to express in terms suitable for a statute of this House very simple concepts.  One would imagine that it was very easy to say that agricultural workers should get a <Col N="850" /> week's holiday with pay, but when one sits down to draft a Bill, difficulties multiply in giving effective expression to the purpose one has in mind.  Therefore, in order to deal with the ambiguity that may arise with regard to Sundays, Church holidays and the like, I propose to submit to the House an amendment to Section 3 which is designed to clarify the fact that these six holidays are to be an addition to the holidays at present allowed.</P>
    <P>Again, in Section 3 another amendment is necessary in order to clarify the fact that if an agricultural worker has, say, worked for six months, and entitled, therefore, to three days' holidays, and then ceases to be employed by the man for whom he has worked six months, he shall be entitled to three days' pay in lieu of the three days' holidays which he would have taken had he continued in that person's employment. The third amendment is simply to place on the Agricultural Wages Board an obligation to provide in its annual report on the workings of the Agricultural Wages Act a paragraph dealing with the working of the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Act, if and when this Bill becomes an Act of this Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There is just one other figure which I should like to give the House with a view to reassuring Deputies as to the care I have tried to take in judging of the capacity of the farming community to meet this charge.  From January 1st to February 18th, 1948, creameries received 3,006,000 gallons of milk; in the same period in 1949 they received 3,929,000 gallons: and in the same period in 1950, 4,653,000 gallons.  I wish the farmers to whom the statistics which I have read out apply joy of their additional profits.  I know that 99 per cent. of the farmers who have reason to thank Providence for those additional profits will gladly avail of an opportunity of sharing with those who helped to earn them.  There will be a microscopic minority of poor, low type of farmers who will grudge their worker a fair share of the increasing prosperity of the industry which farmers and workers jointly serve.  But the smallness of their numbers and the poverty of their character will merely <Col N="851" /> serve as a useful comparison to reaffirm that the Irish farmers, taken as a whole, have always been anxious, ready and willing to treat their workers decently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any approximate figure as to the number of agricultural workers employed?</P>

      <P>It is not an easy figure to ascertain, because if one looks at the statistics of employment, one gets one figure and if one looks at the statistics of the National Health Insurance Society, one gets a second figure. It is very hard to segregate the wage-earning employee from the member of a family who is working because, as the Deputy will remember, the statistics merely give those who work upon the land and family workers are included in them.  They then give the figure of those who work for wages.  How far that figure is reliable I do not know. The nearest figure we care to offer as an estimate, and we do it with reserve, is 85,000 permanent and 50,000 to 51,000 casual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently the Minister has satisfied himself as to the necessity for a measure of this nature.  Looking over the Bill and listening to the Minister's speech, I find nothing to which I can take serious exception, nor can I find anything in its provisions about which one can enthuse.  If there is any doubt in my mind as to the wisdom of this sort of interference as between employer and employee, it arises in this way: that I doubt if a measure of this kind will really make any substantial improvement so far as the conditions of those who work with farmers are concerned.  There are some who will contend that the majority of farmers will treat their workers fairly, and that in introducing a measure of this kind you are really aiming at compelling those who might not live up to such a high standard to toe the line, as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that it will have to <Col N="852" /> be conceded that the relationship which must exist between a farmer and his worker, no matter how much we talk about it, is not in any way comparable with the relations that exist in industrial employment.  I have often heard people say, and, of course, they can say it with a great deal of truth, that men who work on the land are entitled to legal provisions of this kind, just as are those who work in industry.  I think, however, you will find that farmers who employ labour will not adopt the same sort of rigid discipline as to the time at which a worker will appear on a particular morning and, if the worker happens to find himself not in the best condition, will not insist on his doing a heavy task of work; that a farmer will make in a general sort of way provisions to meet his employee, provided the sort of relationship that should exist does exist between them. If I have any doubts in my mind as to the wisdom of this measure, while not obecting to it in principle in any way, it is because I feel that when you attempt to regulate, by law, the relationship between employer and employee you often tempt the good employer, who may be affording concessions to his employee far in excess of those provided by a measure of this kind, to say: &ldquo;This is all the law demands from me and that is all I will concede.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No one would want to impede a Minister or a Government in any way who sets out to improve the lot of those employed on the land.  But one important point to which attention must be given is the extent to which the policy we are pursuing is likely to create opportunities of employment on the land.  While some of the figures given by the Minister may be all very well, I have a feeling that there is a very noticeable tendency all over the country on the part of landowners in general to endeavour to do with less labour.  They are entitled to make their own decision in that regard, but when we hold up this measure as indicative of the progress being made in regard to the conditions of rural workers, we ought also to have at the back of our minds what effect our policy in general is having in so far <Col N="853" /> as the opportunities of work are concerned. For example, I had a parliamentary question on the Order Paper to-day asking for information as to the position in regard to the importation of oats, seed, milling and feeding oats. I discovered, to my surprise, that while it is understandable that we should endeavour to import seed oats, we found it necessary to import a fairly substantial quantity of feeding and milling oats from the Argentine and France.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSmith" hpid="Mr. Smith Mr. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>We have, on the one hand, a Bill before us regulating the conditions of employment as between the farmer and his worker; and, on the other, we are pursuing a policy that will result in our depending on the people of the Argentine and France to produce for us feeding and milling oats and on the Dutch to produce our tomatoes, and I doubt very much if that policy will ultimately prove to be a wise one.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a quarter of a century overdue, but I suppose we have to be thankful for small mercies. I want to welcome the Bill because it represents a stepping forward from the position which agricultural workers in this State have hitherto been in.  I do make complaint that I feel it could have been introduced at an earlier stage.  It was first announced to the country two years ago by the Minister and I think that two years is a long time for agricultural workers to have to wait in order to get a guarantee of a minimum annual leave period.  With the principle of the Bill, which is to provide six days' holidays each year, I am in complete agreement.  I have taken the opportunity over the past 12 months of consulting agricultural labourers in very many different counties as to their views on the Bill and it will be acclaimed by them all without exception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Smith suggested that there was inherent in this Bill a certain danger which might arise from interference, <Col N="854" /> as he put it, with the relations which normally exist between agricultural workers and agricultural employers. I might remind him that one of the very few beneficial actions carried out by the Fianna Fáil Administration was one such piece of interference, when they carried through the House the Agricultural Wages Acts which set up the Agricultural Wages Board.</P>
    <P>Agricultural workers have been, and still are, the most depressed class in this country and even in this House we have heard agricultural employers, with one or two exceptions, state on innumerable occasions that the only reasons why they did not afford better conditions to their workers were economic reasons, their economic inability to do so.  The Minister, in moving the Second Reading, gave figures regarding the improvement in the position so far as agricultural employers are concerned which must demolish once and for all any argument to that effect which may be adduced here.  I doubt if any Deputy will have the temerity to adduce any such argument against the Bill; but, if such an argument were forthcoming, the figures given by the Minister as to the comparative prosperity of agricultural employers or farmers as compared with two or three years ago would immediately rebut that argument.  The comparative prosperity is phenomenal.</P>
    <P>This Bill, in my view, must necessarily be only the first step along the road towards better working conditions for agricultural labour.  I have some experience and knowledge of the relations which exist between farmers and their workers and I am not going to join in the chorus, the note for which has been struck by Deputy Smith, when he tries to imply that the bulk of agricultural employers, if left alone, will do all right by the farm labourer.  Such is definitely not the case, has not been the case and will not be the case, until such time as the rights of the farm labourer are guaranteed by law.  Proof of that is to be found in the fact that, prior to the setting up of the Agricultural Wages Board, farm wages were fixed at any and every level, but, <Col N="855" /> generally speaking, far below subsistence level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>It struck me that the Minister in the course of his remarks was somewhat apologetic in the introduction of this measure, an attitude, indeed, which is very unusual in the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think it is necessary to develop any lengthy argument for the justification of this Bill.  I feel it provides little enough for the agricultural worker without adducing reasons to convince the farmers of its righteousness.  From my point of view there are many flaws in the Bill in its present form, and I propose to attempt to rectify some of those on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not consider the Agricultural Wages Board as at present constituted a competent body to administer this Bill.  I believe that that board is predisposed against the agricultural worker.  I say that, knowing its composition. Allegedly, it is a tribunal equally representative of farmers and workers.  There are so-called neutral nominations to the board.  But the board has always sided in every case with the employer, and the agricultural worker is, therefore, at a definite disadvantage in so far as that board is <Col N="856" /> concerned.  Under those circumstances I do not think the board is a fit body to administer this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like some information on other points.  The Minister stated that he proposed to introduce a drafting amendment on the Committee Stage in order to clarify the position.  He proposes to make it clear that these six days' annual holidays would be in excess of any existing holiday.  What then will be the position of the farm workers in County Dublin, County Meath and portions of County Wicklow where the workers already have six days' annual holidays by virtue of trade union agreements as between their unions and the farmers' organisation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as these particular areas are concerned then this Bill does not represent any improvement. The principle of it is to improve the position of agricultural workers generally.  One of the main flaws in it is the question of the holiday period. I do not think it is fair that that should be left to the will of the employer.  I am sure many Deputies can visualise the position where agricultural workers may be told in the depths of December or January, or after a snowfall in February, that they can take their holidays then.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to see steps taken to safeguard against that eventuality. I think the agricultural worker should have his holidays at the same time as other sections of the community.  He <Col N="857" /> has as much right to have his holidays in good weather and under pleasant conditions as has the industrial worker. If no definite period is laid down the bulk of the farm labourers will be told to take their holidays at periods of the year when, in fact, no holidays can be taken.  I think it is a bad principle to introduce pay in lieu of holidays. Farmers will take that as an excuse not to give holidays; they will give a week's pay instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is quite clear. That can only be done if the worker and the farmer both agree.  There is a danger, is there not, in telling people what is good for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1943" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of pay in lieu being conditional on the worker agreeing is based upon an unrealistic attitude. The results of the operation of the 50-hour week and the 54-hour week are proof of that.  In theory, now, an agricultural worker can go to his employer and tell him that he wants to work a 50-hour week and be paid at an hourly rate.  I wonder what happens to him if he does that.  I wonder what would happen to the agricultural worker if he told his employer he wanted a half-holiday on Saturday.  He would get the road, and get it very quickly.  There have been many cases of that throughout the country.  Agricultural workers are in a subject position. It is blinding one's eyes to facts to suggest that an agricultural worker can discuss either his wages or his conditions, or both, with his employer on equal terms.  That can only be done in the very exceptional case where phenomenally good relationships exist as between employers and employees. The farm labourer, in the majority of the cases, is definitely at a disadvantage. Because he has to depend upon his employer for his livelihood he cannot bargain with him on an equal basis. We should write into this Bill and put on the Statute Book for all time <Col N="858" /> certain minimum rights for agricultural workers.</P>
      <P>A further fault which I find with the Bill is the idea of staggering the holidays. That also can lead to abuse. The farm worker is entitled to have six days' consecutive holidays just as well as any other worker.  As I have said, I propose to try to achieve certain improvements for the agricultural workers on the Committee Stage of the Bill.  We shall, I assume, have a more suitable opportunity of discussing the details of the Bill on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in the course of his opening remarks, also referred to the fact that agricultural workers' wages had increased by 20 per cent. within two years and that at the present time the minimum rate for agricultural workers is £3.  That gives me an opportunity of saying that while getting the acceptance in the Parliament of the country of the principle of annual holidays for agricultural workers is good, at the same time annual holidays on the basis of a £3 per week wage are of very little use.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, I look upon this Bill as the first step along the road <Col N="859" /> towards a better life for the farm labourer.  It has seemed to me, from the moment I entered this House, that it is largely representative of agricultural employers.  That is not an unnatural state of affairs particularly as we are a nation composed chiefly of small farmers.  One of the greatest Irish writers on questions relating to agricultural problems, James Connolly, said many years ago that while the condition of the Irish farmer was depressed and while the Irish farmer could be said to be, at that time at any rate, a slave, the agricultural labourer was the slave of the slave.  I wonder how far we have progressed from that day to this&mdash;personally, I believe very little. Again, I want to reiterate that I welcome this Bill as an initial step along the road towards a better life for the farm labourers of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this Bill has been introduced.  However, I would welcome far more a Bill in this House which would have to carry another Bill with it&mdash;a Bill that would bring agricultural labourers' wages somewhere in the vicinity of the wages paid to other unskilled labour in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to debate agricultural wages, as such.  However, I say that the position of the labourer, as Deputy Dunne has said and there is a lot to be said for it, is still unsatisfactory. I take it that the ordinary labourer down the country now&mdash; that is, the indoor man&mdash;receives £3 per week.  If he gets a week's holidays with pay where is he going to go with <Col N="860" /> his £3?  If he goes into the City of Cork he will come out of it in two days and he will spend the remaining days of his week's holidays in the county home.  It is just as well to be straight and honest on that.</P>

They were very vocal on the uneconomic prices the farmer was getting for his produce.  If an uneconomic price was being paid to the farmer then, what is his position now?  The Minister for Agriculture and I discussed the condition of the unfortunate man in West Cork.  There has been an enormous improvement in his position since the day he had the happiness of having Mr. James Dillon as Minister for Agriculture&mdash;a very happy improvement in his condition.  There was also, then, a very happy improvement in the case of the man with the bacon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what kind of holiday the 1,800 to 2,000 agricultural labourers, who are now looking in over the fence at the grass growing where the 15,000 acres of beet were growing two years ago, expect to get?  Mind you, the reduction of 15,000 acres in the area under beet means the unemployment of something like 1,500 to 2,000 labourers who had constant employment in agricultural work before. You can work out the number of hours for yourself. The Minister had the pleasure of having the hours and the costings made out for him.  That is why <Col N="862" /> I say there is unfortunately very little use in introducing an Agricultural Labourers' Holiday Bill for labourers who will not be there.  You may get a drowning man to struggle against the stream for some time.  He is able to resist at first but eventually he has to submit to superior force.  That is what is happening agriculture to-day.  The employment is not there.  The farmer finds that he is getting the same price for some of his produce as he got two years ago.  For more of it, he finds that he has no market.  This time two years ago we were appealing to the Minister to find some market for the farmers' oats.</P>

I have found the farmers in my constituency, farmers who would not touch him with a forty-foot pole, to be decent men who treat their labourers decently.  So do the bulk of the farmers in this country. The only place in which there is any trouble between farmers and farm labourers appears to be those places where Deputy Dunne gets around on Sunday after Mass.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to see the Minister getting into quick lime, but he got into burnt lime then and he <Col N="864" /> was stuck in it.  To get back to this question of holidays, I suggest that there should be no hard and fast rule. Deputy Dunne has alluded already to holidays enjoyed by the agricultural labourer under custom or in some other way.  Some farmers have had a system of giving staggered holidays.  I consider that the staggered holiday, which every decent farmer&mdash;and that is the bulk of them&mdash;already gives is the best plan.  I know very well what happens in my own case.  One of my men may come to me and say that he would like to go to Ballinray Races, that he would like to take the day off and he is given the day off.</P>
      <P>In the following week another man comes to me and says that he would like to go to Pigeon Hill races and he gets the day off for that purpose.  Another worker would rather some other form of amusement and he gets a day off when he asks for it for that purpose. I have never seen any objection to that practice between any decent farmer and a labourer.  It has been customary to give such days off.  It may be rather a surprise to Deputy Dunne, but it is quite a customary thing right throughout the country, so far as my knowledge goes, and I have travelled over several counties.  That is why I think that there is some justification for the statement of Deputy Smith that the less interference there is between the farmer and his labourers the better for everybody concerned.  I admit that there may be a small number of farmers of the type to which Deputy Dunne alluded, the fellow who goes out and says: &ldquo;Look, I have a patch on the knee of my trousers, but thank God the man who works for me has a patch on each knee and a patch on his back too.&rdquo;  However, they are a very small minority and labourers were always fairly well treated, so far as days off were concerned, with the exception of a period when there was a definite campaign waged in this country against the agricultural labourer, which could have been called a political campaign, and which induced the then Fianna Fáil Government to bring in the Agricultural Wages Bill.  I am one of those who first advocated bringing in that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="865" /> This holiday question must be put definitely on the basis of how many holidays a man is entitled to at present. Are those six days six in addition to that or not?  Many Deputies here, though born and bred in the country, do not understand it.  I heard Deputy Hickey alluding to bank holidays. I never heard farm labourers talk of getting bank holidays.  They would not take them if they got a present of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <P>Some other time.  There will be other opportunities to have this thrashed out.  I am dealing only with the position in Cork County.  That is the position there.  Can we have something definite from the Minister?  First of all he should set out that the labourer would, in the ordinary course, be entitled to the holidays of obligation and on top of that he would get six days' holidays with pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister also to take steps to see that the man who is going to pay for this will get at <Col N="866" /> least some increase in the price of his produce, to make up for his worsening condition financially to-day as compared with two years ago.  That is not an unfair request.  I quite admit that 1/- a week would not break him, neither would these six days.  What is going to break him and mean increased unemployment on the land is the uncertainty of the farmer's position to-day.  He can rely no longer on any statement made by the Minister as to what the price of his produce is going to be.  He is completely at sea. He does no know where he is.  The Minister will say he is a lazy fellow or he would have got so much a lb. for his old hens.  The next day the Minister will turn on Deputy Lehane, Deputy Cogan and Deputy O'Reilly and shove it down their throats that the curer is paying 190/- for pigs, whereas the price is only 170/-.</P>

I emphasise again that for anything produced by the farmer to-day the price has not improved one iota from the 1947 price; but the farmer's costs of production have been increased and the burden being placed on him has led to the disappearance off the land of something like 21,000, whether they be farmers' sons or unpaid labourers, in the past two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I make no apology for intervening briefly in this debate, although I represent a constituency which contains neither farmers nor farm labourers.  I welcome this Bill, and Clann na Poblachta welcomes it, as a step in the right direction.  When Deputy Corry started to enlighten the House, he told us that he welcomed the Bill, but then he spent approximately 40 minutes in trying to show us that the Bill was a bad one, impossible of implementation and creating a hardship on farmer and farm labourer alike.  The burden of Deputy Corry's song was that the poor farmer was not in a position to let the farm labourer have these holidays.  I do not think that is borne out by the facts.  I do not think that it is a view which Deputy Corry could genuinely express, if he had sat down with the undoubted acumen that he brings to every question and given it that mature consideration which is undoubtedly his wont.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry knows as well as every other Deputy that if there was ever a time when farmers were in a position to make this provision for those they employ, it is the present time.  I welcome this Bill, not that I think the Bill in itself represents any very wonderful achievement, but because it is a recognition of an important principle and that the rights of this body of workers are, at last, going to receive some consideration from this House.</P>
      <P>Up to recent times the farm labourer was a member of the most depressed class of workers.  It took the beginning of a revolution, in 1913, for Connolly and Larkin to win for the workers of the cities recognition of the fact that they were not mere slaves.  There was a time lag in so far as agricultural workers were concerned and it is only in very recent times that the community is realising that they, too, have rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> I was amazed to hear Deputy Corry &mdash;with whom I very frequently find myself in agreement because I consider his outlook on many questions a sound outlook&mdash;displaying the attitude of resentment that one would have expected from a Dublin employer in 1913 to the fact that farm workers were at last being organised.  I was amazed at that attitude of mind on the part of Deputy Corry.  The attitude of a Deputy or of a Party to this Bill is a test of faith and sincerity. A lot of lip service is given to what are described as democratic principles and even Christian principles.  The attitude of a farmer who employs labour to a measure such as this is a test of the sincerity of his attachment to those principles.</P>
    <P>Much of the time of this House is devoted, and rightly so, to the problems of the agricultural community.  That is only right, inasmuch as agriculture is our primary industry.  But, why is it necessary for the farmer who speaks as a political farmer, as a professional farmer or as the representative of organised farmers, continually to have a chip on his shoulder?</P>
    <P>This Bill recognises an important principle.  For that reason, we welcome it.  It is important in this respect also, that it is a step towards recognition of the fact that the agricultural labourer is a highly skilled technician.  It is because recognition of that fact has been withheld in the past that there was the flight from the land.  I cannot understand the attitude of some representatives of the agricultural community. On one hand we hear complaints as to the difficulty in getting labour and that dairy herds have had to be reduced.  We have heard these complaints.  The Minister may not have heard them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you hear the figures I read out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConLehane" hpid="Mr. C. Lehane Mr. C. Lehane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Lehane</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard the Minister's figures but I have also heard the complaints and I think the Minister heard them also.  There can be very little sincerity in these complaints when, from the very same people, comes criticism of any effort to entice these highly skilled technicians to remain on the land and to perform the <Col N="869" /> highly skilled work they are employed to do.  If there has been a flight from the land to the cities and to England, it has been due to one fact, that conditions and wages for the agricultural labourer were so unattractive as compared with what was available elsewhere that, naturally, exercising his right as a free born individual, he decided to sling his hook.</P>
      <P>I will give one counsel to the Minister, in conclusion, that is, that he would lend an ear to the advice given to him by Deputy Dunne and, I think, by Deputy Larkin also, that he would accept an amendment which would make it mandatory on the farmer, without reference to this question of the worker's agreement, to accord to the labourer six days' consecutive holidays. I think the Minister interposed a remark at that stage that it was not always wise to tell people what was good for them.  I do not know what substance there is in that but I do think that this is one case when it would be wise to legislate so that people could be prevented from doing what is not good for them.</P>

The labourer will be told: &ldquo;Yes, you are entitled to this. It is your statutory right but, of course, if you insist on that, I will not take any action against you.&rdquo;  Not this week but next week he will get the road.  I would strongly urge the Minister to reconsider his attitude on that matter. I welcome the Bill.  It is a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I merely want to correct what I believe to be a misinterpretation of Deputy Corry's viewpoint.  This Bill, as I see <Col N="870" /> it, is merely putting into legislative form a system that in a great measure already obtains.  It certainly obtains in Deputy Corry's constituency and also in mine.  Maybe Deputy Lehane is right about giving labourers six consecutive days' holidays.  I know I cannot utilise a holiday in so far as it means a mere cessation from work.  If I get a holiday that I want to utilise properly, it must be directed to some particular activity.  Deputy Corry's explanation of labourers in his constituency who get days off to attend particular functions or amusements is an indication of a far better system of relaxation for the labourer.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have stated that agricultural labourers are a depressed class.  That is true.  They are the most depressed class in the country, and when Deputy Dunne is urging, as he has been urging, special terms for forestry workers as against agricultural labourers, instead of raising one particular class he is, I think, trying to depress another, even where the farmers are not as enlightened as they are in my constituency and Deputy Corry's, and have been unused to giving holidays such as our farmers give.  I am all the more moved to support the Bill in view of the fact that I heard Deputy Fagan say here the other night that all the County Limerick farmers are getting £51 per cow per year for milk and £9 for a dropped calf.  That is a condition that I hope is true.  If it is true, there is all the more reason for giving the labourer a holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Minister is giving the recognition that is long due to agricultural workers by bringing in this Bill.  I am indeed surprised at the attitude taken up by some Deputies.  A man would not be honest with himself if he did not admit that now and up to now the farmers and their labourers are the hardest worked people and the worst paid for the work they have been doing.  The times have changed and because they have changed it is only fair that the Minister should bring in this Bill, thus showing recognition for a class that has been really depressed for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise one point <Col N="871" /> in regard to holidays.  By asking for a week's holidays for any worker it is intended to give him a rest from labour, to give him an opportunity of having a quiet week when he can take his wife and family anywhere he wants to take them, to refrain from work for that week.  I would not like to see the principle of a week's holiday being abused in the manner suggested by Deputy Moylan or Deputy Corry&mdash; allowing a man to go, for instance, to a race meeting on a particular day or giving the day off for any other type of function.  Deputy Corry may suggest that some people do not know what they are talking about, but there are different aspects to this question. Every worker in this country and in other countries has six bank holidays in the year.  If the agricultural worker takes a Church holiday in lieu of these holidays I am not objecting.  He is certainly entitled to his bank holidays just the same as any other worker.</P>
    <P>I would not agree that the Minister should leave this an open matter, that it should be by mutual agreement, that the labourer and the farmer would agree to a week's wages in lieu of a week's holidays.  The Holiday Act was passed in 1936 and it is set out in that Act that a man should get a week's holidays and must take the week's holidays and if he is found to be employed during that week he can be fined and so can his employer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good enough to pay a man for 52 weeks of the year without having to pay him for 53 weeks in the manner that you and other Deputies in the House are suggesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not dealt with in the Bill and therefore I will not refer to it.  It is quite possible that a certain farmer might say: &ldquo;Maybe the week after Christmas would be more suitable for you to take holidays and you better take your holidays then.&rdquo; I am quite conscious that you could not get the farmer to allow the labourer to take his holidays in the busy period in <Col N="872" /> the spring and during the harvest. There is an agreement with certain employers that the holidays should operate from April 1st to October 1st. That gives a pretty good margin in which to arrange for holidays.  There is nothing wrong in farmers agreeing to let their workers have a week's holiday in May or June or towards the end of September.  The worker will have some satisfaction then and he will enjoy his rest in reasonably good weather.</P>
      <P>I want to put this holiday question on a different plane.  I do not think it has been properly treated by some Deputies to-night.  There are some farmers who treat their workers as they should treat them, but I would be dishonest with myself if I did not say that I have never yet seen a farmer giving his worker a week's holiday, although one would be inclined to think, from what some Deputies have said, that the workers get all the holidays they want.  That is not so.  Take the average farmer who employs two, three or four workmen.  There should be no difficulty in arranging in May, June or September to give these men an opportunity of taking holidays.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry asked what does any labouring man want a holiday for because he has only £3 a week.  Any person should be ashamed to make such a statement.  Why should not an agricultural labourer get holidays the same as other people?  I will refer Deputies to county council employees on the roads who have £3 a week and who get holidays.  We do not hear anybody saying that these labourers should have broken periods or that their holidays should be staggered. I suggest that the Minister should establish the right for agricultural workers so that they can enjoy a week's rest and take their wives and families to their friends or to any other place that suits them.  Those men are fully entitled to a week off.  I do not see any great difficulty in giving holidays to them over a period of months, say from April to September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many aspects of this matter have been introduced and we have heard Deputies saying that the farmers give a day off to their men to attend certain functions.  These men are fully entitled <Col N="873" /> to that if we are genuinely interested in the people who really matter.  These are the men who produce the food for the nation.  They should have an occasional day off.  Let them enjoy the bank holiday.  If it is a Church holiday this type of worker is entitled to get it.  He is entitled to these holidays plus his six consecutive days as embodied in this Bill and I hope the Minister will be adamant in seeing that carried into effect.</P>

It is too bad to see Deputies getting up here and saying that there is no need for legislation in connection with the attitude between farmers and farm labourers.

      <P>Farm labourers have as much right to annual holidays as any <Col N="874" /> other section of the community and despite what Deputy McQuillan says they get them except in very rare cases. My fear is that this Bill will worsen their position.  It prescribes six days' holidays in the year.  In very many instances in County Galway when labourers are employed for the whole year round&mdash;and that is what I term real employment&mdash;they take 12 days and are paid for them instead of six. In regard to the question of vetting the men who come to Athenry or Galway City from Connemara, they come in there and offer themselves for employment and the wage paid in the Athenry district of County Galway is the highest agricultural wage in Ireland or in the world.</P>

      <P>The Minister was in a hurry to get away as usual.  He would not be in much hurry to go if he wanted to intervene in a debate without hearing it introduced as he did the other night and treated us to a lecture. Section 3, sub-section (5) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Subject to the other provisions of this section, the worker and his employer may make such arrangements as they think fit for the allowance of holidays.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is nothing at all wrong with that, but Section 6 (b) reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It shall be a good defence to a prosecution under this sub-section for the employer to prove that he was rendered unable to allow the holidays by reason of termination of the worker's employment in circumstances which he could not reasonably have anticipated.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In that case I wonder shall it be necessary for the employer and the employee to have a written agreement drawn up at the beginning of each working year? If an agreement is not drawn up I can see a danger, but I would say that the number of cases would be very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> If the employer mentions to the employee: &ldquo;What about the question of holidays?  When does it suit you to take them?  Would it suit you to take a day every two months or six days together?&rdquo;  The employee says: &ldquo;I will take no holidays at all; I will stay on working.&rdquo;  The employer says: &ldquo;All right, I will pay you what is set out in the Act.&rdquo;  However, strained relations might arise between them subsequent to that and if the employee reports the employer and states that he was not given holidays what proof will be necessary for the employer? Will it not be necessary for him to have a written agreement?  Such agreements were not necessary except in very rare cases in the past, and I really fear that as a result of this legislation a number of agricultural labourers in many parts of the country will fare worse than at the present time.  I agree, however, that the principle of the Bill is a good sound one because agricultural labourers are just as entitled to holidays as any other section of the community.</P>

      <P>I wish to welcome this Bill.  Coming from a rural area, one of the best agricultural counties in Ireland, I wish to say that this Bill is one of the best Bills ever introduced in this House and that it is long overdue. Undoubtedly, whatever you may say about the Minister for Agriculture, he had courage to come into this House to do something for the agricultural worker.  The agricultural workers were praised by everybody during the emergency as the men who were keeping the nation going and producing the food, but now the Deputies in the Opposition are saying that they will be worse off.  I cannot see that.  I was employed in an industry for 25 years and I was always glad when summer came along to get a week's holiday.  I had not the money to go to Butlin's Camp or these places, but I had a holiday to rest and lie down in the sun at the foot of Vinegar Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers in my constituency will welcome this Bill with bonfires.  I hear some people talking about farmers giving a man a day off to go to the <Col N="876" /> races.  I have a fair amount of relations who are farm workers, and I know what happened in one area during the local race meeting.  I am quoting this to offset what has been said by Deputy Corry and the others.  Five or six men were in a field working and they said they would like to go to the local race meeting at Killan.  One took his courage in his hands and went to the boss and said: &ldquo;Sir, we would all like to go to the races to-day.&rdquo;  What did he say?  &ldquo;If you go to the races to-day I do not want you to-morrow.&rdquo;  That happened.  The young fellow took courage and went to the races, but the married men, who were afraid they would be sacked, remained at work. The boss is a very big supporter of Fianna Fáil in my constituency.  He has a big salary from the Central Bank. What did he say to the young fellow when he came in the following morning? He asked him: &ldquo;Where were you yesterday?&rdquo; The young fellow replied that he was at the races, and he was then told: &ldquo;You can go to them again to-day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry wants to know where the men would go on holidays?  The agricultural rate of wages in my constituency is £3 a week.  That is also the wage of road workers and they get a week's holiday.  The men working inside the ditch, on the land, have been denied a holiday by a native Government. That went on during the 16 years when the last Government was in office, although they boast here of what they did for the workers.  I know that this Bill is the greatest blow that the Opposition ever got.  We now have a Minister for Agriculture who has the courage to give the workers a holiday. When we had a Minister for Agriculture from the County Wexford he never offered a holiday to the agricultural labourers.</P>

      <P>Yes, and it is welcome. It is long overdue.  From now on the agricultural labourer will be able to have his week's holiday with pay.  We want that made compulsory in the Bill. An agreement between employers and workers about holidays could be evaded.  I know from experience that, although the wage for agricultural labourers is fixed by law, there are some employers to-day who are not paying it.  We all have seen cases in court of farmers being prosecuted for not paying the wages laid down by law.  I am afraid that the same thing will happen if this question of holidays is left to an agreement between the employers and workers.  The worker will not get the holidays that he is entitled to in some cases.  I would like to see the Minister guarantee in the Bill that the agricultural worker will get his week's holidays.</P>

I think it would be a great thing if the Church holidays were observed, as we observe them in Wexford, throughout the Twenty-Six Counties.  If that were done we would be doing our duty to the nation and to the Church to which we belong.</P>

      <P>Coming as I do from a constituency in which the majority of the agricultural workers are migratory labourers I welcome this Bill.  I agree with Deputy Lehane when he says that the present Minister for Agriculture is doing for the agricultural worker what Connolly and Larkin endeavoured to do in 1913 for the city worker.  I think there is a lot to be said for Deputy Hickey's suggestion that there should be a time limit within which the holidays should be granted to these workers.  I think the time suggested by him, namely, the 1st April to the 1st October would be very fair to the agricultural worker.  It would prevent abuses such as Deputy Hickey visualises when he says that during the <Col N="878" /> slack period, in the months of, say, November or February, it might be suggested to these workers that this would be the appropriate time for them to take their holidays.  If such an abuse should occur, it would mean a denial to those men of the right to be able to go to the seaside or to visit their friends in some part of the country during what is customarily the holiday season.  They should not be left in the position of having to take their holidays during months when the weather would not be suitable. I welcome the Bill.  I think that the Minister for Agriculture has now tried to do for the agricultural labourer what he has done for the farmer in the last two years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to this Bill is that it is a very poor industry that cannot afford a week's holidays to its workers.  It is a disgrace that the agricultural worker is the only worker in any industry in this country who has not already got a right to a holiday.  It is a concession that he should get.  It is agreed by everybody that the agricultural worker is the most important unit in the community and, as I say, it is a poor industry that cannot afford a holiday to its workers.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in his opening remarks, quoted figures to show that the agricultural industry is in a position to give a week's holiday to its employees.  He based his assumption on the increased value of agricultural exports in the past year as compared with 1947.  Few, I think, will deny that there was a vast increase in agricultural exports last year.  Few also will deny that there has been a big increase in the imports of agricultural requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further, few I think will deny that owing to the climatic conditions which existed in the country in 1947 we had probably in that year the lowest output of agricultural produce in history. If we take the increased value of agricultural produce exported in 1949 as an indication of the ability of agricultural employers to give this small concession to their workers, and if, in the following year, or in some other year due to climatic or other conditions, <Col N="879" /> there is a drop in agricultural exports, are we then to say that that is evidence of the inability of the industry to give this small concession, or to maintain the miserable wage of £3 a week which the agricultural labourer is getting? If, in the coming year, we find that there is a reduction in our exports of eggs and poultry, is that to be taken as a criterion of the ability of the farming community to pay for the week's holiday?</P>
    <P>We had an indication last week that there was a drop in the number of day-old chicks in the months of December and January as compared to a year ago.  I hope that reduction will be overtaken in the months ahead, but nevertheless it is a pointer that agricutural exports may dwindle.  If we do not export as much potatoes in the present year as we did last year, is that to be taken as evidence of the inability of the agricultural industry to afford this small concession?  I think we can fairly make up our minds that there will not be since the Minister for Agriculture has said that he may have to import potatoes from Amsterdam. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>When the debate on this Bill was adjourned I was making the point that the attitude now adopted by Fianna Fáil towards the introduction of permanent legislation with regard to the Army was as hypocritical as their attitude towards the recruiting campaign that they undertook at the end of the emergency.  One would need great patience to listen to Deputy Traynor and Deputy de Valera when they proceed to tell the House that the country was prepared for any emergency in 1939 owing to the foresight of the then Fianna Fáil Government.  To my mind, that is one of the most dishonest statements that could be made, <Col N="880" /> but it is typical of the Party opposite. They now pretend to be anxious to have this permanent legislation introduced when the Army and the country have been waiting for 27 years for its introduction.  Overnight they have got more than anxious to see it brought in this week.</P>
      <P>It is astonishing to have it claimed by Fianna Fáil that they kept this country out of the war, in other words that the fairy godmother spread her cloak over this country.  That kind of statement does not sound very amusing to me.  I happen to be one of those who joined the Army during the emergency like a good number of other Irishmen.  We joined the forces at the call of the then Government.  But there were many young Irishmen who were just as anxious to serve this country as the men who joined the Defence Forces but who did not join because of the duplicity of the Party opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the services of these men would be given to the Army if the right attitude were adopted.  There is no doubt that thousands of young Irishmen joined the Defence Forces and thousands more joined the L.D.F. in order to serve this country.  I have no hesitation in saying that it was the hope of a great number of these men that, if their services were not required to repel an invader, at any rate their services would be used at a later stage to remove an invader who has been here for years.  That hope, of course, disappeared in the Army after a very short time and the state of the F.C.A. to-day is proof that they had no hope of seeing that position reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are thinking in terms of defence, whether we remain neutral or whether we take the side of either of the combatants in another war which may come, we must have what I may describe as a ground force that will enable us to man all positions in this country.  If we do not do that, we are faced with the alternative that an outside force will come into this country. If any force comes into this country, they will come in in large numbers and I can visualise a position in which we would have in the vicinity of all our seaport towns and in areas where we would have air bases hundreds of thousands of foreign troops.  If we are prepared to welcome in these foreigners, no matter what their nationality may be, that is all right, but I suggest to the House that in countries where foreign troops came in <Col N="882" /> either as friends or as enemies, they had a very demoralising influence.  If such a thing happened here, we would have all sorts of complications.  I think that by pursuing a proper defence policy here we can prevent that kind of thing happening.  I suggest to the Minister that he must see that new life is put into the F.C.A., that they must get some ideal to aim at.  At present there is a sense of frustration both in the Army and in the F.C.A. If he can find a way of removing that sense of frustration, he will have achieved a great deal of work that is necessary in preparing a defence plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In winding up this debate, I shall resist the temptation, which is definitely strong, to follow Deputies opposite back through the years and fight out old battles all over again.  I do agree with one or two Deputies who suggested that, 27 years after the establishment of this State, we should have reached the point when the Army&mdash;not the army of any particular Government but the Army of the country&mdash;should be placed outside the zone of political controversy.  We had that disgusting type of speech which we listened to from Deputy Aiken, an individual who at one time was Minister for Defence and who left that office under very unhappy circumstances, so unhappy that a Deputy sitting behind him says that there are really very terrible lessons to be learned by all from the state of affairs that existed in 1939.</P>
      <P>I come in here with a three-line Bill asking experienced Deputies, particularly men who had been for 16 years in the Government of this country, in view of the fact that we shall have the Army Estimates before us in a couple of weeks' time and a permanent Army Bill in a couple of months' time, and when the law provides for the continuation of the Army after the 31st March, to agree that this Bill might be let through without this rather irrelevant type of debate that we have listened to since half-past three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate was opened by an ex-Minister for Defence who staggers into Dáil Éireann, bent down with the weight of the Dáil debates which he carries under his arm in order to quote <Col N="883" /> speeches made ten or 15 years ago in the light of the circumstances then existing. We had nothing that was even relevant to the Bill before us uttered from his lips.  We had the annual whine with the serious face that he did not get enough information with regard to the policy of this State and its Army policy.  The person who lays down State policy, and the right person to lay it down, is the head of the Government and in a clearer voice than ever was uttered by the head of a Government for 16 years prior.  Clearly and candidly the position, policy and outlook of this country with regard to war and with regard to entanglements and alliances in any direction were announced, not once but many times, by the head of the Government.  But, of course, when it suits Deputies not to read or to throw the blind eye at utterances made, they come in here with the hardy annual whine: &ldquo;What is your policy?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition was so deluded and carried off his feet by the deluge of vicious propaganda from behind him that, I assume in perfectly good faith, he tells us he is terribly disturbed, terribly worried, terribly anxious, because the Army is disappearing, because it is under strength, because the best officers are leaving and because we have no specialists, and the fact of the matter is that we have a bigger Army to-day than his Minister for Defence left behind him.  I do not blame the Leader of the Opposition&mdash; he is living in a cesspool of vicious propaganda against the Army that was started on the very day I became Minister for Defence.  We have these foul articles in the newspaper mainly owned and governed by the political Opposition here and we have their correspondents supplying the English Sunday newspapers with the most damaging propaganda ever used against any Army.  I have read their articles and I have traced them to their source and that is why I ask the Leader of the Opposition to co-operate with me in eradicating that kind of damaging propaganda, propaganda which is damaging to the Army and which is disgusting when its origins are considered to be within this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="884" /> Did we not read the cartoons in the English Sunday papers where the medical officer, attending a soldier in bed, is told: &ldquo;Be careful, doc, he is the last soldier we have&rdquo;?  Surely we can march proudly on St. Patrick's Day because we have poured that kind of filth over the Irish Army, because we have done our best to sap and undermine confidence in that Army.  We had this talk about the Army melting. From the day I came over here, was there ever a question asked here with regard to the Army, its strength, its equipment, its numbers, its personnel, that I ever sheltered behind the public interest and refused to answer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The poor Deputy&mdash; what answer does he want?  Does he want his own nose rubbed in his own past?  I am asked what is the policy, not of the Army but of the Government, and I point out that it has been stated on many occasions by the head of the Government, stated very clearly and without any ambiguity, that this country, no matter how it feels, no matter what its impulses are with regard to the European or world line-up, cannot possibly ally itself with an army that occupies portion of its territory. The other possible alliance is with the Communists over on the other side of Europe.  Do Deputies think we are going to ally ourselves with them? Those who can read and have brains to understand words can read into that sentence what the policy and what the outlook is&mdash;that, as things are, we have to rely on our own strength to hold this island against anybody who may be an aggressor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to Army strength and Army policy.  Absence of policy in the past was smothered and hidden by squandering money in all directions. The spending of money does not make a defence plan or a national defence policy.  We have not got conscription in this country and I do not believe we will have it.  The population of this country are free to join the Army or not.  We recruit up to the strength that we get and that is our strength. It is not our policy; it is our strength. As the Deputy knows when he left me <Col N="885" /> a smaller Army than we have at the moment, he camouflaged that by putting down a figure which misled his Leader this evening&mdash;12,500.  In the Book of Estimates, however, he made provision for an Army of less than 9,000.  Was that either stupidity or dishonesty? The book showed the permission which he was asking the Dáil to give him&mdash;an Army of less than 9,000&mdash;but he floundered around here and pretended that his plan was for an Army 50 per cent. greater than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the policy was for an Army of 12,500.  The Minister knows that better than anybody in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy was to talk about more men than he thought he would get.  That was exactly typical of the whole Administration. You had a policy founded on words and humbug speeches.  I believe in policy founded on facts.  There is one thing in my time here, be it long or short: you will get nothing from me but absolute candour and an absolute statement of fact.  I shall never try to delude the Opposition or the people.  The Deputy in his time had no hope of getting more than 9,000 men.  I have tried and I have not got more than that.  That being so, and facing up to the situation of this country as a country that may have to stand alone, then quite clearly in the absence of conscription one has to look for defensive manpower, for the big numbers, not inside the Army but outside the Army.  That brings me then to the question of the F.C.A.  I found the F.C.A. an unknown force, an invisible <Col N="886" /> army, an army of which I could not get an estimate within 10,000 of its known strength in terms of effectiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is libel on the Army staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a libel on the Army.  It is a statement of fact. It is a statement that so many men joined the F.C.A., got their boots and their uniform, and yet nobody could tell me how many were effective on any given day.  Not one could tell me that.  For practically a whole year I had the greater part of the general staff going out week-end after week-end in order to try to get a firm figure as to the effective strength of that particular force.  The situation was that men were joining the F.C.A.&mdash;and the Deputy must know this&mdash;and getting their equipment, but the greater number of them never appeared again. Others turned up for a week-end or two and then melted away, together with the equipment.  Then, in that set of circumstances, we have a squeal with regard to a shortage of boots.  I was asked&mdash;the suggestion came from Deputy Aiken&mdash;to give more attention to the F.C.A.  I take it he did not mean me as an individual.  He meant that the Army and those responsible for the defence of the country should give more attention to the F.C.A.  The F.C.A. has got more attention from the Army in the last 12 months than it ever got since the date of its inception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Did you hear the remarks of the only Deputy on your side who spoke about the F.C.A.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only that, but as a result of a comprehensive report which I got and as a result of that year of intensive study, the number of regular officers to be attached to the F.C.A. will go up by some hundreds and the number of N.C.O.s by a similar proportion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come now to the question of the training of the F.C.A.  It was said that they were only half-trained or quarter-trained.  The training of any voluntary soldier obviously depends on the amount of time he gives to that training.  It must have been all very happy-go-lucky when one could say on <Col N="887" /> paper there was an F.C.A. force of 60,000 men and the training returns show that only 10 per cent. of that 60,000 came up for training.  That meant that the balance was very much a nominal roll, absorbing uniforms and equipment, but not being trained.  A very intensive and lengthy investigation was made of that particular aspect of the situation.  In spite of that fact the Deputy quite improperly said that they were not called up one year in order to save money.  They were not called up one year for the reason stated; they were not called up because we wanted to study, examine and properly explore the whole situation.</P>
    <P>We found, as a result of that examination, that even if 40 per cent. of them came up for training, with the plan of summer camps in existence, that would be more than could be handled.  The plan was that they would be called up for training during a certain number of months each year and that that training would be carried out at certain named camps.  There was a good deal to be said for that policy.  The summer time is more attractive; the seaside places provide a greater inducement to people to turn up for training. Training is to a great extent a kind of holiday under such conditions.  But a considerable number of the F.C.A. would not be released during that period; a considerable number of them did not find it feasible to come up for training during that period.  If more than 40 per cent. turned up they could not be handled.  I have changed all that.  I am making provision that every month of the year and any month of the year members of the F.C.A. can present themselves for training and they will be trained.  In addition to the other drawbacks, there were no inducements, certainly not in peace time, to that particular force to come up.  There was no provision that a married man would be treated as a married man financially.  There was no bonus.  There was no bounty of any kind for such men when they came up for training although there were such inducements for the regular reservists.  Those matters are now being examined fully in the belief that the F.C.A. is a force <Col N="888" /> to which the country and the people must look and that, so long as that is a force to which we must look, then the outlook of the Minister for Defence and the authorities must be to have that force as highly trained as possible.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of equipment. We have had a lot of cheap heroics about war&mdash;who we will fight, who we should fight, and who should be the untouchables, etc., etc. The fact of the matter is that we do not produce as much as one bullet in this country.  We do not produce as much as one popgun.  We do not produce a single rifle, to go no higher than that.  Anything we buy in the way of military equipment, warlike stores, arms and ammunition has got to be bought from outside the shores of this country.  That is an unhealthy state of affairs militarily.  It is an unpleasant statement to make, but it is a fact.  It is a fact that we must face.  When Deputies opposite criticise me or my Administration because we are not equipped along modern lines as an Army, they must pause and remember that the only place where we can buy our goods is from other armies; and they must remember, too, that those other armies will only sell to us when they have a surplus.  I venture to say offhand that in the way of armaments and warlike stores I have purchased in two years more armaments and warlike stores than were ever purchased before my time in any given two-year period.  I have to be thankful to the British Army for the fact that they have supplied those goods in face of the present world situation and in face of their own difficulties; and it would be ungracious if we did not at least say thanks for that supply, be it only a trickle.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing this matter on the last occasion, Deputies on this side of the House were endeavouring to get some indication from the Minister as to what he means by the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  I endeavoured to point out that unless the Government or the Minister makes some attempt at defining that expression it will lead to endless trouble for everybody who will be connected with the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  &ldquo;Market value&rdquo; has several different definitions as the law stands to-day.  It has a different meaning, for instance, for the Revenue Commissioners than it has for the ordinary auctioneer throughout the country.  It has a different meaning for the Land Registry compared with that which it has for the Revenue Commissioners and it has a different meaning for the income-tax code than it has for either of these other two bodies. Now the Minister boldly wants to shove through this expression of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; without making any attempt whatsoever at defining it.  I think this would look a stupid piece of legislation if it were let go through as it is at the present time and without some attempt being made to define &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  The Lay Commissioners, the Appeal Tribunal or the Land Commission Courts will be just as wise as all of us here now are unless some attempt is made to define this <Col N="890" /> expression.  For instance, if this section is let go through as it is at the moment it may be argued before the Lay Commissioners or before the Land Commission Court that the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; means what the Revenue Commissioners take it to mean for estate duty purposes&mdash;that is, that where the gross value of the estate does not exceed £500 the method is 25 times the poor law valuation minus the redemption value of the annuity.  That method is regarded by the Revenue Commissioners under Section 16 (1) of the Finance Act of 1894 as being the method of arriving at the principal value, as they call it under the 1894 Act, and where the property is over £1,000 under Section 16 (1) of the Finance Act of 1894 they define the value they want as the &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  Therefore we have one method&mdash;the Revenue Commissioners' method for estate duty purposes&mdash;of arriving at &ldquo;market value&rdquo; by a rule of thumb method prescribed under an Act of 1894.</P>

      <P>If, on the other hand, we take the procedure of the Land Registry where a deed is lodged for stamping we find that to ascertain the &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in the case of freehold lands they take the position to be ascertained by adding the redemption value to the annuity to the pecuniary consideration or the value set out in the deed.  We have all these different methods including the method already practised by the Land Commission in vested cases of arriving at the &ldquo;market value.&rdquo;  You have still another method of arriving at it under the Compensation for Land (Compulsory Acquisition) Act of 1890 where you have these arbitration courts.  The principle appears to be the price that would be arrived at between a willing seller and a willing purchaser.  Here we have this extraordinary thing thrown into this Bill without any attempt being made to guide those people who will ultimately try to interpret it.  The whole principle of the Bill, according to the Minister in his previous speeches, was to give a fair deal to the people from whom land is <Col N="891" /> being taken.  Why run away from the definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; now? Why not prescribe in this Bill the method under which &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is going to be ascertained?  Why leave the position in the air?  If the Minister is anxious that those from whom land is going to be acquired will get the &ldquo;market value&rdquo; of their lands surely he should specify in this House now what he means by this much abused expression &ldquo;market value.&rdquo;  Is he going to leave the expression capable of all these different interpretations or is he going to accept the amendments put down by Deputy Moylan and myself?  Is he going to accept a reasonable interpretation and rule for courts to interpret the meaning of the expression?  I think that the fairest method of arriving at what the market value should be is to take the average price in the immediate vicinity of the land being acquired.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a matter which is insoluble. There are, obviously, rules that can be laid down or interpretations that can be made of &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  Surely the Minister realises that if he leaves the section as it is&mdash;and the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in the air&mdash;neither he nor the Lay Commissioners nor the Appeal Tribunal would know what rules to apply in order to ascertain the &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  The Minister knows that, for instance, in the case of lands in County Dublin where farms are being sold the average price per acre <Col N="892" /> differs very widely from the average price per acre in the west of Ireland. The Minister knows, too, that in particular places&mdash;for instance, in his own constituency where there is land hunger &mdash;lands fetch an extremely high price and that even very small farms of £2 10s. to £5 valuation realise prices of from £700 to £800.  The Minister knows that some rule of the type suggested in the amendments must be arrived at.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out to the Minister that, under different Finance Acts, under different legislation of this State there are different interpretations of the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  If the Minister is sincere in endeavouring to ensure that &ldquo;market value&rdquo; as it is commonly understood throughout the country should be paid to the owner of land from whom land is taken, surely he can see the force and effect of the amendments tabled by Deputy Moylan and by myself.</P>
      <P>Is there any reason why the Minister should run away from the task of interpreting the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo;? Does the Minister not see the difficulties which will be created if he does not attempt to elucidate this expression? Do we not all know that this will lead to appeal upon appeal, and that when land is being acquired, nobody will be able to tell the Minister what &ldquo;market value&rdquo; means, and that eventually the matter will have to be brought to the Supreme Court in order to get an authoritative decision from the Supreme Court as to the meaning of the words &ldquo;market value&rdquo;?  I appeal to the Minister to consider particularly the amendment that I myself have tabled in order that we may be able to get some sensible interpretation of the expression.  I put it to the Minister if he wants co-operation throughout the country, if he is anxious to acquire land for the relief of congestion and if he has cases arising from day to day in which people cannot be assured they are going to get the &ldquo;market value&rdquo;, the Minister is not going to get people to offer land for the relief of congestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite well aware that there have been thousands of acres of snipe land offered to the Land Commission that has been of no use to the owners.  I am quite sure that, even before the introduction of this Bill, people who wanted to get rid of such lands and had no use for them, offered them but it is an altogether different proposition where a man is living on his land and the Land Commission are anxious to take it over for the relief of congestion.  That is the man I want to protect under the Bill.  I want to ensure that if the land is taken from him, in spite of his teeth as it were, he will at least get as much for that land as if he were selling it in the open market as a free seller to a willing purchaser. The Minister expressed the hope in some of his previous speeches that he would be able to get over many of the difficulties he had experienced in acquiring land for the relief of congestion if the market value were paid.  In my view, if the Minister does not elucidate what he means by &ldquo;market value&rdquo; he is simply going to dash the hopes of people who would normally be inclined to sell their lands to the Land Commission because if it goes out from this House that nobody knows what &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is and that the Minister is differentiating between what is known as market value and what he calls market price, there is going to be great uncertainty amongst those who are thinking of offering their land to the Land Commission.  In these circumstances people will not take the risk of offering land to him if they can dispose of it otherwise to a willing purchaser in the open market because they at least know the price they will get from that purchaser.  Even from the point of view of making this Bill a good and workable Bill, I again appeal to the Minister not to allow the Bill to pass this House in its present form containing an expression, the meaning of which nobody, not even the Minister, understands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is one solid <Col N="894" /> reason why the Minister should not accept these amendments it is the confused argument advanced by the last speaker.  He has indicated in no uncertain way to the House that it would be fatal for the Minister to endeavour to define this particular term.  I am quite certain that Deputy Moran, from his experience as a legal practitioner, knows that many of the difficulties which he has mentioned in connection with this Bill are so many empty vapours.  The Deputy is making a mountain out of a molehill and he is doing that deliberately to try and impair what might ultimately be the good work achieved by this Bill.  I know perfectly well that there has been difficulty under different codes in regard to the interpretation of &ldquo;market value&rdquo;, and I am warning the Minister here and now that if he endeavours to tie this up within a definition clause or within a rigid definition, he is going to heap confusion on confusion.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Opposition think, as apparently their attitude would suggest, that for some unknown reason people experienced in dealing with land are not going to be able to arrive, in the light of that experience, at what is a reasonable market value in the circumstances of each purchase. A very simple argument suggests itself to my mind.  If you were to take Deputy Moylan's amendment on its merits, who would then tell the Minister how long the period of years would be?  If you were to take a period of years that might include the lunatic period of the Fianna Fáil economic war, the value of land would be practically nil.  On the other hand, if you were to take the period of years covering the panic foreign buying, the price of land might be completely exorbitant, whereas if you leave it to be interpreted reasonably and intelligently by the Minister himself, you will have a better yardstick by which you can arrive at something practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy Moylan or Deputy Moran are in earnest about their amendments.  I think Deputy Moylan still remains the able politician, making confusion out of a situation that presents no real confusion to himself.  He was an experienced and an efficient Minister for Lands and <Col N="895" /> he knows perfectly well in his own good judgment that if there were not so many restrictive definitions in the land code, he might have been able to do a more effective job when he desired to do it.  I think, and I am putting it to the House, that this is a new principle here.  It is an effort, an experiment, something that will be tried out in all its circumstances.  Possibly, in the development of the system, many of the imperfections that might now be envisaged by the Opposition will clear themselves up in practice, or at least they will have some chance of clearing themselves up in practice and it will not be, as it might well be if this section is too well defined, a lawyers' paradise.</P>
    <P>There is one of the real kernels and the really new principles of this legislation evolved in this section.  I say to the Minister, in all earnestness: &ldquo;Have a good try, see how this works, and if you do find that you are forced into the situation that you must be more explanatory about it, or that you have to define it in a more rigid way, come back and test the co-operation that Fianna Fáil allege they want to give you.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last night this Bill was before the House, I clearly intimated that I could not accept either of these two amendments.  I would be anxious to see a definition of market value placed in this particular Bill, but either Deputy Moran's or Deputy Moylan's proposed definitions is absolute nonsense and definitely would give no pointer whatever to the Land Commission in finding the true market value of any particular farm they were acquiring.  The reason this principle has been installed in this Bill is because of the difference that exists in the method of determining the price of unvested land and the price of vested land up to the present.  It would appear, from Deputy Moran's speech and other speeches on that side of the House, that this is the first time the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo; has ever appeared in a Bill.  It has appeared in the 1933, 1936 and 1939 Acts.  It is appearing again here.  The 1939 Act is the one I am most concerned with, as Section 39 of that Act determines that <Col N="896" /> a price equal to market value shall be paid for all resumed land or unvested land.  I have brought in that here exactly word for word, to determine how the price of vested land or acquired land will be paid in the future.</P>
      <P>One thing I must admit I am completely puzzled about is the sudden blast of worry that has come down on the Opposition to safeguard the farmer whose land is being acquired.  The particular four or five words that have caused all the trouble in this Bill are contained in paragraph (a) of Section 5, which says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the said sub-section shall have effect with the substitution of the words &lsquo;the amount to be so fixed shall be an amount equal to the market value of the land&rsquo;...&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If we turn to Section 39 of the 1939 Act, we find that the wording runs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  the resumption price of such holding or part of a holding, that is to say, the compensation to be paid therefore by the Land Commission, shall be the market value of the holding or part of a holding so resumed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the 1936 Act, in Section 28, the Land Commission are expressly commanded to have regard to the market value of the land&mdash;and there is no definition of market value in the 1936 Act.  In the 1933 Act, Section 29 gives a certain amount of protection to people from whom the Land Commission propose to acquire land.  There also they are told they shall make an exchange of land of &ldquo;not less market value&rdquo;&mdash;and again there is no attempt at definition.</P>
      <P>If a proper definition of market value can be worded by any Deputy from any side of the House, I will accept it. Take Deputy Moylan's amendment. His attempted definition is the following and I wonder if he is satisfied.  I believe that Deputy Moylan wants to see market value paid for all land.  He does not want the system of robbery or confiscation that has obtained up to the present time.  I am sure he wants market value, but I wonder again how it was when he was four, five or six years as Minister for Lands he could not do anything about it.  He says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" />&ldquo;The market value of land to be acquired by the Land Commission shall be determined by the average price paid for land of quality similar to that being acquired in the particular district where it is being acquired over the period of the preceding three years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Suppose we take that one and set down that as part of a statute within which the Land Commission must determine the price of acquired land.  We all know that the price of land in every county and district constantly fluctuates: it is either rising or falling for various reasons.  The price of agricultural produce influences the price of land enormously.  If the price is rising, it means we have to pay a lesser price than the man is entitled to, because if we take the average of all the land sold in the locality for three years and strike a mean or average from the present-day price and go back three years, if means a lesser price than we should pay at the moment.  On the other hand, if values are falling, we are bound by that average, if it is taken, to pay a man more than the land is worth.</P>
    <P>There is no account taken of the different qualities of land, for instance. As I said the last night, no account is taken of the fact that land is more valuable if it is located near a town than if it is ten miles out in the country.  It is more valuable if it is beside a country village than if it is three or four miles out in the hinterland. Land running along a main road is always of more value than land only within half a mile of a bad byroad where no one wants to buy a farm if he can help it or unless it goes at a cheap price.  The question of disease enters into it.  We know there is some land infected with blackleg in cattle. We know some types of land are excellent for root crops but have all sorts of diseases for main crops, and <i>vice versa.</i>  Local farmers know that and it is known by the person buying the land.  We know that there is a type of rock or stone land which makes excellent fattening land if there is a wet summer but that, in a dry summer, burns up and turns red.  No two fields of any farmer's land, even with only a fence dividing them, could be said <Col N="898" /> to be of the same quality or value. Similarly, no two holdings are the same value.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moran words his amendment as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The market value of land to be purchased or acquired by the Land Commission shall be determined by the average current price paid for land of similar quality to that being acquired in the immediate vicinity of the district where it is being acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Who is to judge the quality?  Is the best expert in the Department of Agriculture able to judge quality as finely as we would all like to see?  Deputy Moran says &ldquo;of similar quality to that being acquired in the immediate vicinity of the district.&rdquo;  He does not say that the price obtaining in the district is to determine it, but in the immediate vicinity of the district.  He draws a ring, which he does not define and which may be of two, three or four miles, and then takes all the land outside that ring, but he does not say where it is.</P>
    <P>I want to set right an evil that the State has been doing in the past and which is no credit to the State, that was making land owners bear a share of the burden of the relief of congestion, for which those land owners had no responsibility and which was a liability of the State which the State should own up to and shoulder the burden.  I want to leave the definition open.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Opposition may not trust the Appeal Tribunal or trust the lay commissioners in determining a fair price.  So far, my experience has been that, in fixing the price of resumed land, they have been fair and there has been little or no complaint. It was about the method of determining the price of acquired or vested land that all the complaints were coming in.  I think the system that has worked since 1939 for unvested land would, under the same men with the same integrity and knowledge, result in a very satisfactory method of fixing the price for acquired land in the future under this section.</P>

If it is set down in cold blood to be a rule for them then we who are passing the law ought to know what we mean by it.

We had an amendment the other day and, after all the powwow about it, the end was that the Minister had to admit that it had to be <Col N="900" /> left completely to the discretion of the commissioners.

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>What do you mean by market value?  The first thing that would occur to me is the value a person would be likely to get if he sold on the market.  It would be an estimate by some valuer who, from his knowledge of the prices at which a particular thing was being sold, would be able to determine in advance, without putting it to a test, what it was likely to fetch.  Is that what the Minister means&mdash; that the guiding rule for the lay commissioners is to be the price which, in their opinion or the opinion of their valuers, would be given for that particular plot of land if it were put up on the open market?  If it is not that, what is it?  There are two or three Acts.  I went to the trouble of looking at the sections.  I was hoping we had a definition there.  I do not care who passed it, the fact that we ruled it so was bad from the legislative point of view and there is no reason why we should follow bad examples.</P>

If we had a phrase which was not understood, then it was the duty of the House, if they were attending to legislation properly, to seek a definition. Every member of the House who passed it and who agreed to it was equally responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the position is that we only want to make one particular type of land to follow the same rule, why not say so? If the position is that we are to determine market value by the methods that have been used in practice by the Land Commission, why not say so?  Why not ask the Land Commission to tell us by what rules they have determined <Col N="901" /> market value in the past and tell us: &ldquo;This is what we mean by it.  These are the rules we have applied&rdquo;&mdash;if they have applied any rules at all.  If they say that they have not been able to get any rules to apply, that they have had to take each individual case and trust the opinion of the people asked to do it, without any guiding rule other than their intelligence, why not say, straight and fair: &ldquo;The value is to be determined simply at the discretion of the lay commissioners.&rdquo; What I object to is to have words in legislation which we do not understand and do not pretend to understand, when there is a clear way out.  If we cannot define definitely, get a phrase which can be defined and, if you want to bring the two parallel and bring them under the same rule, say that that is what you are doing and, if you want to apply the rules that have been applied by the Land Commission up to the present, ask the commissioners what are the rules they have applied and put them down in form, if possible and, if not, say: &ldquo;All we can do in this matter is simply to say that it is to be at such price as the lay commissioners may consider equitable.&rdquo;  You have the word &ldquo;equitable&rdquo;&mdash;what would be fairer?  We are using a phrase which we all think we understand until we come to define it and try to say exactly what we understand by it. Then we find we do not understand it at all.

      <P>I respectfully submit that the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo; must be left fairly loose if we are to arrive at justice and fair play in the administration of this Bill.  That is the secret of the whole thing.  I do not know if Deputy Moylan is an auctioneer.  I know Deputy Moran is a conveyancer and he should have a fair knowledge of this business.  I wonder does Deputy Moran seriously ask me to insert this amendment as part of the Bill?</P>

      <P>That is what the Deputy asks.  He wants a new sub-section in the following terms:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The market value of land to be purchased or acquired by the Land Commission shall be determined by the average current price paid for land of similar quality to that being acquired in the immediate vicinity of the district where it is being acquired.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Why did the Deputy go outside the district in which the land is being acquired? Why not take the district itself? I cannot accept either one or other of these amendments, because it would mean negativing the intention and the spirit of this Bill, which is nothing more or less than asking the State to carry a responsibility that it should have carried for years, and that is to pay a fair price, the fair market value for the land, not an exorbitant price on the one hand, and not a thieves' price on the other hand.  A fair market price&mdash;that is all that is asked.  We expect to get land as it would go in the open market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is right in not accepting these amendments. It is much better the way it is in the Bill, defining market value. The Land Commission and the owner have their valuers and they come before the board.  The Land Commissioners take the evidence of the valuer for the owner and the valuers for the Land Commission and it is left open in the Bill to do that.  If you insert these amendments you will upset that arrangement and the result will not be so satisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill sets out that &ldquo;in fixing such sum regard shall be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that the Land Commission valuers value the farm, and so do the valuers for the owner.  Anyone knows that where farms are sold privately the price is usually arrived at in that way by valuers.  If you put the amendments in you will have the owner trying to get around them in order to get a bigger price.  In my opinion it is better the way it is in the Bill and it means that the owner will get the value of the land.  Is that not plain enough to anyone?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important section, probably the most important in the Bill.  Any confusion that has been created in connection with it has been created by the Minister, largely in bringing in the section in the manner in which it has been brought in.  He has told us repeatedly that so far as the price for resumed land, unvested land, was concerned, it was fair and reasonable.  In every case he went that far and the only objection <Col N="905" /> he had was where vested land was being acquired and the redemption portion of the annuity was deducted from the price.  If that is so, I think he could have simply brought in a sub-section or even amended the section and that would have got us out of the confusion.  But he has not done that. He has stated here that market value is to be distinct from market price.  I wonder how that will read to the people in the country?  Where can the distinction be drawn between market value and market price?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to that, save that it might recreate a position we already have had experience of and this undefined market value would work out in a way that I will now explain. If the Land Commission propose to acquire a holding and, as in cases that I know of in the past, they receive a suitability and price report from the inspector and accordingly fix the price, the owner may appeal against the price and then the Prices Tribunal may fix a price on the land that is 80 per cent. higher than the value of the inspector in his suitability and price report.  What had the Land Commission to do then?  What they did then was, to make application to the Land Commission court for permission to withdraw the proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>That can happen in this case.  What was created by that position? According to some section in the Land Act of 1923 the Land Commission could not reinstitute proceedings for the acquisition of the land for seven years.  That can happen here too, because of this undefined market value.  I believe the best of all was the section in the 1923 Act and that was a fair price to the owner and to the Land Commission, because in that <Col N="906" /> case the Land Commission was acting on behalf of the incoming tenants.</P>

      <P>The bargainer comes into it to make the bargain.  Any confusion that has been brought into this has been brought in by the reference to market value and we know well why that has been brought in.  It has been brought in because of the propaganda carried on against the activities of the Land Commission in the past and against the legislation enacted by the Fianna Fáil Government.  You are merely playing up to catch-cries&mdash;that is why this section has been inserted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are merely playing up to catch-cries from certain people and that is not good legislation.  I say that if the Land Act of 1923 was allowed to stand and to apply equally to the vested holding as well as the unvested one, we would not have half the length of time spent debating this section in the House.  The Minister is the cause of all the great confusion about this section, and he cannot get away from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want to ask the Deputy one question.  In the method under the 1923 Act and which obtains up to the present time in determining the price of acquired land, is the price which is fair to the Land Commission fair to the vendor?  Did the Deputy ever sell a beast at a fair on that footing? Did he ever go to the fair with a beast worth £30, which he thought was worth £30.  But when the buyer came along and thought it was only worth £20, what happened?  The market price was arrived at between the two of you.  But remember that it was not the buyer's price, which was the Land Commission's price most of <Col N="907" /> the time&mdash;because they had to obey the statute&mdash;that caused the trouble.</P>
      <P>The Deputy said that this is a new principle and that he is a bit nonplussed by it and that he does not understand it too well.  Does the Deputy tell me that, when he was here during the past 11 years as a member of the House when a Department of State administered by a Minister who was a member of his own Party effected the resumption of land under the 1939 Act in the same way.  The Deputy knows quite well that the method of paying for acquired land was a scandal to a civilised country.  He is ashamed of it and what he is sorry for is that his own Minister did not settle the question before he went out of office.  I would ask the Opposition to stop this nonsense, this foolish obstruction to the section and let it through for the benefit of the people of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a good headline to set.  Most of the Minister's arguments in dealing with this question have been abuse.  If the Minister wants co-operation he will get it.  I came in to try to do my part in getting this legislation understood.  I was most interested to know what the Minister and his Department meant by market value when they introduced it.  The first real light I got was when he said that it was the same phrase as is in certain other Acts.  If he had said that in the first place instead of abuse we would have made more progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>So the truth is abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose that this phrase was not defined in them&mdash;as I believe it should have been&mdash;but was defined by practice, why does the Minister not help us and say that the practice and the methods are the same as such-and-such methods and that he is prepared to put them into this Bill if the methods are capable of being explained? If you want the position that this, in the nature of things, must largely be left to the discretion of the commissioners, why not have a phrase like &ldquo;the price shall be such a price as in the opinion of the commissioners shall be equitable having regard to certain <Col N="908" /> things&rdquo;?  There are ways by which difficulties of definition are avoided in legislation and the Minister should know these ways, but no attempt whatsoever is being made by him to meet these difficulties.  He finds fault with the amendments that have been given.  That is all right.  He can find fault with them, but if this principle is not right he should play his part in setting it right.  If he wants co-operation we are as anxious as he is not to waste time if he will try to approach it in the proper spirit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to ask Deputy de Valera an honest question a few minutes ago but he got rather excited and did not answer.  The question was this: Why should you define a definition?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardSweetman" hpid="Mr. Sweetman Mr. Sweetman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sweetman</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked why should you define a definition.  If you attempt to do it is going to be very pleasant for Deputy Moran, Deputy Timoney and myself, and for all the lawyers because once you try to define what in fact is a definition you always get endless law.  When the Deputy did not like answering the question I gave it to him.  You always get endless trouble if you try to make your definitions much too close, if you try to define a definition.  As far as market value is concerned, even before the 1923 Act or the 1939 Act there have been over the years cases in the courts in reference to which it was necessary to refer to the term market value.  I think it would be accepted by the courts and I think that was the reason why it was accepted by the draftsmen who were advising Deputy de Valera's Minister for Lands&mdash;I forget who he was&mdash;in 1939 when it was being put in the 1939 Land Act.  The term market value was considered to be in itself a definition.  It was considered a definition, a wide definition if you like, but a definition which it would be very undesirable to attempt to narrow or define still further because if you did so you would get completely bogged.  I think that that was the reason why Deputy de Valera's Minister of the day, whoever he was, accepted the use of the words <Col N="909" /> in 1939 and I think it is for the same reason that the words should be accepted now.</P>
      <P>There are two questions here, the question of the definition of the term and the question of the alteration of the previous phrase, &ldquo;a price which shall be fair to the Land Commission and to the owner respectively&rdquo;.  As far as I am aware, the first argument by which the term market value was defined was somewhere just before the turn of the century when the Court of Appeal made a dictum as to the basis upon which they would interpret the definition of market value, the basis and the decision being that market value was a term to mean the price, or rather the value&mdash;I think the price is what you pay and the value is what you estimate the price should be&mdash;which an ordinary prudent person who was reasonably solvent, who was not trying to go out of his depth on the one hand and who was not niggardly on the other, would put on a particular place whether it was a farm, a shop in the city or a private house in the town in which to live, hoping to get a just, fair and reasonable return over and above the outgoings he would have to pay. They laid that down many many years ago and, following those lines of precedent, market value has been interpreted by the Appeal tribunal under the Land Acts in respect of resumed land.  The reason why it was not defined in any more strict sense was because the draftsmen of that day found that it was a definition in itself and to try to define the definition would only make confusion worse confounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Beegan discussed the other question as to whether it was desirable to alter the 1923 Act in this way or not. His view was that it was not desirable to amend the 1923 Act, which contained the words, &ldquo;fair to the Land Commission and owner respectively&rdquo;.  I want the Deputy to remember that the occasions on which a price has to be computed are not the same as the occasions on which there is the sale of a farm in the open market.  If the Deputy has a farm which he wishes to sell and the price that he is offered for it is not adequate, the answer is that he will not sell.  If the Deputy thinks the farm <Col N="910" /> is worth £3,000 and someone comes along and only bids him £2,000 he is not going to sell.  If I make that bid to him he will not sell to me.  If I bid him £2,500 merely because that happens to be the half-way house between us he will not sell either and will take his farm off the market until such time as someone comes along and offers him what he believes to be the value of the farm.</P>
    <P>That is not the sort of case that we are dealing with here.  Here the Land Commission compulsorily steps in.  The land is being taken regardless of whether Deputy Beegan wants to sell it or not.  It means, therefore, that the Deputy is not in the position of being able to withdraw the sale and say: &ldquo;That is not my idea of the value to me and I am going to hold back until someone comes along with a bid that is nearer to my value of the farm.&rdquo;  The Land Commission steps in and takes it.  Let us suppose that the Deputy has two farms.  They are both the same size, the land is more or less the same quality and they are more or less of the same value. Through one of the farms an internal road runs which is not of very much value to the farm as one unit.  There is no such road through the other farm. On the second farm there is plenty of water for use as one unit.  The Deputy is in the position that the Land Commission comes along and compulsorily says that both these farms must be taken.  The market value of both would be approximately the same for use by a person as one unit.  Under the definition in the 1923 Land Act, the Land Commission are bound to look not at the value of the farm as a unit but the value of the farm when it is divided.  In one case it will be easy to divide it.  There is going to be very little money spent on it because there will be no necessity to run a road through it to divide it.  The road is there already.  In the other case there will necessarily have to be a great deal of money spent on the holding for division purposes though, in fact, it is perfectly good for use as a unit.  Money will have to be spent on it in the sinking of additional wells and so forth. According to the law as it was under the 1923 Act, all the money spent on <Col N="911" /> that farm for Land Commission purposes must be deducted from the value of the farm to the owner when the Land Commission are fixing the price. That is the law as it stands at the present.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that when all that has to be done in the public interest, and it is in the public interest that land has to be acquired for the remedy of social evils, it is the public who should pay rather than the particular person who happens to own the land.  That is the whole basis of the change in this particular section.  You are going to arrive at a situation in which Deputy Moran and everybody else will find that when the Land Commission courts come to consider the matter they are going to do so along exactly the same lines as they have considered this phrase right down since it was used first.  You are going to get it assessed in exactly the same way as it is assessed and has been assessed for a resumed holding; that is, what a reasonable person who is solvent and is not covetous of a particular holding but is anxious to get a fair return but not an exorbitant return would assess the holding as being valued for, as being the amount which he would pay if he had to consider whether he would buy it or not.  To try and define that any more would only cause more trouble. It might be pleasant for Deputy Moran, Deputy Timoney and myself, but this House does not want to create work for lawyers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had taken the line of Deputy Sweetman in trying to explain what he at least understood by it we would have started on a very different basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>We would have started on quite a different basis because there would be an indication on the part of the person speaking like that, that he had some idea of what he was aiming at.  If the Minister had made that statement we could have asked him if it was not possible for him to reduce that explanation to a simple form and put it in as a definition clause.  Everyone in <Col N="912" /> this House knows that in Bill after Bill terms occur in legislation which are defined in the definition clause. These definitions are intended to do what we are trying to get done here, that is to get a term which is used in common parlance&mdash;to get it interpreted legally may be difficult&mdash;and give it some precise meaning, or at least a meaning as close to precision as we can get, leaving to the courts the freedom which they will have of determining afterwards its exact meaning and how it is to be applied.</P>
      <P>If the Land Commission has been using a certain method for determining market price, why should it not be put down here if the idea is that the price that is intended is to be the price used in another connection: the price that might be expected to be paid by a willing purchaser to a willing seller? Why not put that down?  As was pointed out, there have been definitions of market value in other cases. Why should we run away from it here? If the position really comes to this that it cannot be defined, why can we not say that it shall be such as, in the opinion of the Land Commission, is fair, considering the price of land generally?  Our only anxiety is to try and get the thing made clear.  As regards price, it should not be beyond the wit of the Minister, or of his staff, to get something that would be acceptable. If the Minister thinks that our amendments are not satisfactory there is a duty on him to try and produce one that would be more acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say that I was fully alive to the fact that there was no definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in this Bill.  I intended that there would not be because I wanted to see a fair price paid to those from whom land would be acquired.  I did not put in a definition.  I do know that it might be possible to define &ldquo;market value&rdquo; if one were to put in a definition that would fill a volume.  I have no intention of doing that.  I think that Deputy Sweetman has covered the ground fairly well in that regard.  Let me say that the definitions of Deputy Moran and Deputy Moylan are, to my mind, just empty formulae.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why <Col N="913" /> there should be such a long-winded discussion on this particular amendment to the section.  I was one of those who had been pressing for the market value to be paid for land acquired, just the same as it is paid in the case of resumed land.  So far as I can see, the definition in this Bill is fair and reasonable. It is a wide definition and, although I have not a legal mind, I am inclined to agree that any attempt to narrow down the definition might only weaken the position from the point of view of the farmer whose land is being acquired.</P>
      <P>If, for example, the suggestion made by Deputy de Valera was adopted, I think it would be detrimental to the value of land, inasmuch as it would give certain powers to the Land Commission which they would not have under this particular definition.  This is a broad definition that the price to be paid shall be the market value of the land, and it seems to me that that would be defined in any court as the price which that land would make if it were sold by a willing seller to a willing buyer.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why I feel that this definition is satisfactory is that it is the same definition as is in the 1939 Act in regard to the resumption of land.  When I introduced a Land Bill last year which sought to achieve the object which will be achieved by this section, I received several hundred letters from farmers in various parts of the country.  In these letters I received many complaints with regard to the injustice done to farmers, but I did not receive even one complaint from a person whose land was resumed under the terms of the 1939 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am making is that the same provision in the 1939 Act with regard to resumption of land has worked satisfactorily so far as I know and there has not been much complaint about it.  Deputy Moylan could probably tell us if any difficulty arose in interpreting that section so far as resumption of land was concerned. So far as I know, that particular provision <Col N="914" /> has worked satisfactorily in regard to non-vested land, and I do not see any reason why it should not work satisfactorily in connection with this Bill.  I was hoping that the Minister would explain the administrative machinery in regard to the resumption of non-vested land.  The Dáil would be interested to know how the actual value is fixed administratively under that Act.  So far as I know, at any rate, there has not been any serious complaint. As there has not been any serious complaint, why should we not let well enough alone?  If we find later on that something is being done under this section which should not be done, we may be able to amend it.  But, as the same provision as is in this section has worked satisfactorily under the other Act, there is no reason why it should not work under this.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister let the cat out of the bag in regard to this when he said that it was deliberately intended that there should be no definition of market value.  If that is deliberately intended by the Minister and the Government, it means that it is intended to throw over the whole principle upon which we were told this Bill was being introduced, namely, for the purpose of getting more land, particularly for the relief of congestion, at a fair price to those from whom it will be acquired.  I wonder does the House realise the position in connection with a man living in a congested area who is working a farm which is being acquired by the Land Commission. What happens is this.  Notice is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the man comes along to the Appeal Tribunal to fix the price of his land.  I am talking about a case to which the expression &ldquo;market value&rdquo; applies since the 1939 Act.  He produces valuers to give evidence as to the value of his holding. The Appeal Tribunal reserve their decision. There is no land legislation prior to the passing of this Bill to guide the Appeal Tribunal as to what is meant by market value.  After the case has been heard in open court and evidence has been given on behalf of the owner as to market value, some valuer from the vicinity of Dublin appointed by the court, who may or <Col N="915" /> may not be familiar with the location of the land or the value of land in the particular area, is sent down to inspect the holding.  That valuer reports to the Appeal Tribunal behind closed doors.  There is no opportunity of cross-examining him on behalf of the owner.  Ultimately, again behind closed doors, the Appeal Tribunal deliver judgment setting out what, in their opinion, is the market value of the land.</P>

      <P>Evidently the Minister was not aware on the last night that the Land Commission court sends down valuers to inspect the land.  That was evidently news to the Minister when I was speaking on this section at that time.  He had to question one of his officials as to whether it was a fact that the Land Commission sent out these gentlement from Dublin to report on the market value of land.  I want to emphasise that where land is being acquired from an owner and he has produced his evidence of value in open court a valuer is sent down to his holding by the Land Commission, the owner not knowing who he is, that he reports back to the Land Commission without the owner's counsel having a chance to cross-examine him, and that the court, on that basis, comes to some conclusion as to what the market value is.  I also want to point out to the House that there is no appeal from that finding except on the question of law to the Supreme Court.  Obviously, the question of market value is not a question of law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>It is none of my business to point out that.  The Minister should be aware of it.  He should be well aware that there is no appeal except on a question of law from the Appeal Tribunal to the Supreme Court. It may interest the House to know that I am personally aware of one case to which this definition of market value applied.  It was the case of a <Col N="916" /> small holding purchased in 1925 for £250.  In 1949, some gentleman from Dublin appointed by this tribunal decided that the value of that holding was £142, although everybody knows that the value of land has increased out of all proportion since 1925.</P>
      <P>The reason why I attempted to put down this definition here is that this method of working is unsatisfactory, and that nobody is satisfied with it. The man from whom land is acquired &mdash;I am not speaking of people whose lands may be taken compulsory because they have been letting them or have not been working them but of people in a congested area where, even though land is being worked, it may be taken for the purpose of relieving congestion&mdash;should be entitled to the full market value of that land.  For the reasons I have stated, I have made my own attempt to define market value in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMoran" hpid="Mr. Moran Mr. Moran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister talks round and about it, but he made no attempt whatever, and deliberately made no attempt, to define it.  I wonder what the Minister would think if, for instance, the Land Commission court decided to arrive at market value in the way in which the Land Registry does it, that is in the case of a farm of land which is sold, paying the purchase price and adding the redemption value of the annuity on to it for the purpose of arriving at the value.  There are several different definitions under different Finance Acts and surely it is not beyond the power of the Minister or his officials to indicate to the House, and to the country particularly, what they intend to provide under this heading of &ldquo;market value.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was common talk throughout the country prior to the introduction of this Bill that, if the Land Commission decided to take your land, you would get nothing for it, which, in itself, was a deterrent in the case of people who might otherwise offer their lands to the Land Commission or who might be prepared to sell their lands to them if they got a reasonable price.  Everybody knew that, in practice, it worked <Col N="917" /> out that, if the Land Commission stepped in and took your land, you would get only half or two-third its value.  The Minister said quite clearly that he intended to remedy that situation, and if he now defines this expression and brings it home to the people that, if the Land Commission take their land, they will get at least as much as they would get for it in the open market, he may have many people offering him land for the purpose of relieving congestion, and he will not have the farmers terrified lest the Land Commission should step in and deciding to sell their lands by private treaty to get rid of them in case the Land Commission should do so.</P>
    <P>If he is prepared to face up to defining this expression, he may be able to get what he is looking for in order to relieve congestion, but what are the people to expect if he merely tells us blandly that he has deliberately refrained from defining &ldquo;market value&rdquo;. Will every person not say: &ldquo;This is simply another method of getting our lands.  We do not know what this phrase means and we will get the same old price which the Land Commission will decide behind closed doors as we always did.&rdquo;  I appeal to the House to support one or the other of these amendments because they make at least some attempt to define what the man in the street understands as market value.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a lot of confusion in connection with both these amendments and the people are anxious to know what the Minister means by this expression. In view of the fact that this phrase &ldquo;market value&rdquo; has been operated since 1939 in relation to resumed land, it is extraordinary that at this stage of their careers Opposition Deputies should be asking the Minister <Col N="918" /> for a definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo;&mdash; something which they introduced themselves. Listening to some of the Deputies reminded me of a classic statement made not very long ago: &ldquo;We do not know whether it is a good thing or a bad thing, this market value.&rdquo;  That is the impression I got from listening to Deputy de Valera and Deputy Moran.</P>
      <P>I am no lover of giving what we call market value to people in certain parts of the country.  Like other western Deputies on both sides of the House, I want to see this problem of congestion finished once and for all.  I want to see the solution of that problem speeded up and it was for the purpose of relieving that congestion and providing economic holdings that the Minister introduced this section.  The method of determining the value of land prior to the introduction of this section was that provided by Section 25 of the 1923 Act, the provision being that regard should be had to the fair value of the land to the Land Commission and the owner respectively.  It has been found from experience that there is not sufficient scope in that provision to enable the Land Commission to acquire enough land and to acquire it quickly enough to bring the problem of congestion to an end and the Miniister in this section substitutes a number of words to the effect that the amount fixed shall be an amount equal to the market value of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The machinery in operation up to date could be described as a cart horse in action but now the Minister has introduced, if you like, a racehorse for the job.  The two amendments would have the effect of tying up that racehorse and leaving the situation still worse.  They fulfil no useful purpose and I cannot see why the Deputies are so persistent in putting them forward.  One of the amendments says that the market value shall be determined by the average price paid for land of quality similar to that being acquired in the particular district where it is being acquired over the period of the preceding three years, but, as some Deputy asked, how will that amendment work out if no land has been acquired in that area?  If the Deputies opposite <Col N="919" /> still have, as they profess, an interest in relieving congestion and solving a great social evil, as it has been described, they will withdraw these amendments and give the Minister that extra power to deal quickly with the acquisition of land which is provided in the sub-section.</P>

      <P>The lawyers are often talked about, but after this debate I think we can regard ourselves as having our own back.  The Minister's sub-section says that the amount to be so fixed shall be an amount equal to the market value of the land, but if I were drawing that sub-section I would say: &ldquo;The amount to be fixed shall be the market value of the land.&rdquo; Why it must be an amount equal to the market value and not the market value, I do not know.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any harm in being economical.  Let us look at it from this point of view. What is the purpose of the section? What is the purpose of the Bill?  Is it the purpose of the Bill to compensate people generously whose lands will be acquired?  Is it the purpose of the Bill to acquire land for people who need it? I think it would be of assistance if we knew the answers to those questions. Therein lies my principal difficulty in regard to the matter.  In so far as the Bill is an attempt to acquire land and divide it, giving it to those people who need land, then I am in favour of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Possibly by a reconstitution of the Land Commission, <Col N="920" /> the section as it stands in the Bill can be operated with advantage to the community as a whole.  To that extent and in the hope that the Land Commission will be reconstituted in order to ensure that land will be acquired and divided amongst those people who want to work it, I am in favour of the section rather than of the two amendments standing in the names of Deputy Moylan and Deputy Moran.  I think it is just as well to leave it loose. If we tie it up in the way suggested in these amendments we might put obstacles in the way of the Land Commission acquiring land or dividing it. I agree the definition is not a satisfactory definition.  How can we improve it?</P>
      <P>Land is a peculiar commodity.  It has different characteristics and different values.  Will the same price be paid per acre for a farm running into thousands of acres as will be paid for a small farm?  That is one of the difficulties inherent in the amendments tabled by both Deputy Moylan and Deputy Moran.  I have made my position clear.  I want a rather loose arrangement in regard to the value to be put upon land and the price paid to those from whom land is acquired for division.  I want the power to fix the price to rest in the Land Commission. I do not want any prospect of an appeal to any court.  I hope Deputy Moran is right when he says that there can be no appeal to the Supreme Court on the question of market value.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moran said it is a question of fact and, as such, there can be no appeal from it.  On the basis on which the Land Commission may decide, however, it might be more than a question of fact.  It might be a question of law.  To that extent, this definition might involve us in litigation, but I am prepared to take a chance on that.  There are very substantial tracts of land that ought to be acquired by the Land Commission and divided amongst the people.  For years past people have been crying out for land.  I think we are mainly concerned here with that particular problem. The Minister says that he is <Col N="921" /> held up in his work of acquiring and dividing land because he has not got the powers that are contained in this measure.  I appeal to the House to give the Minister these powers as quickly as possible.  If the Minister does not then carry out his duty of acquiring and dividing land, we shall deal with him.</P>

      <P>There has been so much said by so many that I doubt if, even as the mover of the amendment, I can add anything new.  But I am tempted into speaking to-night because the Minister is in such a mild and benign mood.  I am a timid individual and I confess that on the last occasion the Minister spoke he positively terrified me when he yelled across the floor of the House at me, beat the table with his first and shouted &ldquo;Fee, fo, fum&rdquo;. I began to wonder whether he was a giant or a stuffed shirt.  Now the Minister has been complaining of obstruction. I think there has been as much irrelevancy on the Government Benches as there has been on the Opposition Benches.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture told us all about the American Constitution and its bearing on the amendment.  The Minister for Lands chased a pig to China to prove he was master in the Land Commission.  He told us about the ignorance of coloured men, I take it from the point of view of the Herrenvolk of the Land Commission.  I put down this amendment purely for the purpose of getting a definition from the Minister.  I have not got that definition. There ought to be some definition. If the Minister would leave well enough alone everybody would be satisfied and there would be no difficulty. But the Minister wants to be too obliging to his friends by times.  When Deputy Commons produced his famous amendment a few nights ago, the Minister was all assurances that what Deputy Commons said was the perfect end to all his efforts until the Minister for Agriculture came along and threw a brick instead of a bouquet.  Then the Minister for Lands changed his tune.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-night he has been just as indefinite in regard to this particular amendment as he was in relation to Deputy <Col N="922" /> Commons' amendment.  He expatiated at length on the different values of land in different parts of the country. He said land beside a road was much more valuable than land on a mountain. He said land beside a town was more valuable still.  We all know that.  If the Minister, on perhaps the request of Deputy Fitzpatrick, decided to take over College Park for a car park, a proposition that has been mooted, then the price of College Park per acre would be far greater than the price of a piece of land on a mountainside in County Mayo.  Deputy Cogan has a great belief and a great liking for the sound of his own voice&mdash;he is in a minority of one.  He is inclined to say anything that comes into his mind and he does not care how he misinterprets any particular statement of an opponent.  &ldquo;Another point,&rdquo; Deputy Cogan says, &ldquo;made by Deputy Moylan was that he doubts very much the equity of the particular section.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Volume 119, No. 5, column 774.  I do not doubt the equity at all of paying a fair price.  I have been most anxious that people should get adequate value for their property and I am trying to get a definition of that particular price.  The Minister, when he gets on his feet, loses his temper and is apt to say very peculiar things which give us cause for definite concern.  &ldquo;We are not prepared to give a price which is unfair to ourselves for land.&rdquo;  This, Sir, is from Volume 118, No. 9, column 1311.  If that is the position with the Minister, why get away from the famous definition of the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan&mdash; a price fair to the owner and fair to the Land Commission.  But this is what the present Minister says: &ldquo;We are not prepared to give a price which is unfair to ourselves for land and for that reason I took very good care not to say in the Bill that we were giving market price but that we were giving market value.&rdquo;  The Minister has talked a good deal about robbery and confiscation.  Yet, on the other hand, he pointed out in his Second Reading <Col N="923" /> speech that there was very little inequity in the operations of the Land Commission and hardly any person was adversely affected.  That was in the Second Reading speech.  I want to repeat again what the Minister said: &ldquo;I took very good care to say in the Bill that we were giving market value, not market price.&rdquo;  Well, I am not a lawyer and maybe I am all wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I think a number of people to-night have missed the point in regard to the whole argument. This is the Land Act of 1939.  The Minister read the section, or portion of it, and if I am wrong let me know it.  The section is Section 39 (5) and it reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5)  It is hereby declared and enacted that whenever the Land Commission resumes a holding or part of a holding, the following provisions apply and shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the resumption price of such holding or part of a holding, that is to say, the compensation to be paid therefore by the Land Commission, shall be the market value of the holding or part of a holding so resumed.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister read that portion.  But there is a further portion and maybe I am wrong but, if I am, tell me so.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 43 of the Land Act, 1931, shall apply and have effect in relation to a resumption price fixed under the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section and, for the purpose of such application the words &lsquo;basis on which resumption prices have heretofore been fixed&rsquo; in the said Section 43 shall be deemed to mean the market price of the holding or part of a holding so resumed;&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>That is in the Land Act of 1939.  The Minister said that while he was prepared to pay market value he was not prepared to pay market <Col N="924" /> price.  I presume that if that is true we are repealing the section of the Act of 1939 and not making any real change in the price offered by the Land Commission. I admit that, not being a lawyer, I may have read the thing wrongly but as a layman it seems quite clear to me that the section says market value is market price.  Perhaps I need not say any more.  I think it is up to the Minister to answer that particular point in the Land Act, 1939, as I read it&mdash;that the definition of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; is &ldquo;market price&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On the amendment and on the section in so far as it has been discussed in relation to both these amendments, first, might I say that I can see a considerable danger in endeavouring to define in any sort of a direct way the meaning of the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  It has been tried on previous occasions in respect of Acts passed by the Oireachtas and the very defining caused considerable confusion in the practical application of the section. I think it is wiser to leave the section very much as it stands now with no definition added of what &ldquo;market value&rdquo; might be.</P>
      <P>After all, we must appreciate, despite what has been urged by Deputy Moylan, that those who are going to fix the price of land acquired by the Land Commission under this section are not going to be living in balloons.  They are practical men with a practical knowledge of the countryside and a very real knowledge of land. When a case comes before them for the fixing of the price of land to be acquired they are going to be bound by a section of an Act of Parliament which says that it is their duty&mdash;that it is a &ldquo;shall&rdquo; on them&mdash;to pay and fix a price equal to the market value of that land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that the proposal in the Bill apparently is to apply the method and price now paid for resumption to acquisition?  That is correct I think.  If that is so, does this Section 39 of the Act of 1939 not say that &ldquo;market value&rdquo; at a further resumption shall be &ldquo;market price?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the point the Deputy has made and I shall deal with that particular aspect of the matter in a moment.  But might I first of all say with regard to the question of defining &ldquo;market value&rdquo; generally that I see a danger in it and that I think it can safely be left to the tribunal itself to apply its commonsense on the evidence before it, knowing that it is bound to give the market value of land.  I do not want to discuss any legal questions arising out of that, as this is not the place for so doing, but I think anyone can appreciate that when a statutory duty is imposed by a section of an Act of this Parliament that statutory duty is mandatory on the person or bodies to whom it applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the duty is imposed to apply the market value test to the purchase price of any land, that duty will have to be carried out.  I can see in the two amendments suggested here, the very difficulties involved in trying to define the obvious.  I notice that in Deputy Moylan's amendment he suggests that the test should be the average price paid for land of a quality similar to that being acquired in the particular district where it is being acquired over the period of the preceding three years. If that test were applied, then the value of the land becomes merely a mathematical problem dependent on whether proper information is available as to the varying prices over a certain period.  If that were applied all over the country, I can see that considerable problems and difficulties would arise in trying to apply the test contained in Deputy Moylan's amendment and which is contained in a varying degree in the amendment suggested by Deputy Moran.  I do not appreciate the sense behind both of these amendments but I do see this force in what has been urged by Deputy Moylan, that certainly it is very hard to understand the distinction made by the Minister between market value and market price.  I shall say to the Minister, that if he is going to insert in the Bill the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo; as contained in this section, certainly anybody endeavouring to interpret that section later must consider that he means &ldquo;market price&rdquo;.  I certainly cannot <Col N="926" /> see the distinction which he seeks to draw between &ldquo;market value&rdquo; and &ldquo;market price&rdquo;.  If there is a distinction, I can see a different test being applied in respect to the provisions with regard to the price to be paid for the resumption of land and what it is proposed to pay now for the acquisition of land.  I am certain that the matter will be examined further by the Minister but I should like to express my opposition to any further attempt to define &ldquo;market value&rdquo;.  I think it would lead to countless difficulties.</P>
    <P>May I say in conclusion that the proposal to give the market value for land acquired, irrespective of what Deputy Moylan may have said, certainly marks an important advance and from my point of view and the point of people outside this House is a very welcome change in the land code?  There has undoubtedly been in some cases what can only be described as a process of literal confiscation in the acquisition of land.  I think this is a welcome change and if it leads to speedier acquisition of land that should be acquired, it is doubly welcome.  I do not think we should try, even with well-intentioned definitions, to impose any hampering restrictions on the powers which the Minister seeks under this section.  For these reasons I think neither of these amendments should be accepted by the House.</P>

      <P>I think that the mathematical precision asked for, by the Leader of the Opposition particularly, would be fatal to the usefulness of the section, the provisions of which these two amendments seek to clarify.  That seems to be the general opinion on this side of the House.  I regret that that view is confined to this side because I am accepting that the amendments put down by Deputy Moylan and Deputy Moran were tabled in perfectly good faith, with the object of trying to make improvements in the section as presented in this Bill.  I thought it rather regrettable that Deputy Moran spoiled my view of his <i>bona fides</i> by making a case which I think he must have appreciated had no foundation in fact.  He tried to draw an analogy between the term &ldquo;market value&rdquo; as used in this Bill and the &ldquo;market <Col N="927" /> value&rdquo; which is used by the Revenue Commissioners when assessing the value of land for estate duty purposes. While he was speaking on that matter I intervened, but he passed over my intervention and that is really the reason I have risen to speak now.  First of all, he knows that the value of land for estate duty purposes where it is under £1,000 is ascertained by a rule of thumb method&mdash;by multiplying the poor law valuation by 25 and subtracting the redemption value from the product.</P>

      <P>I deny it is a method of ascertaining the real market value.  It is a method of ascertining the artificial value for the benefit of small estates, so that there will be an easy method of calculation and to save expense.  This particular method is weighted in favour of the small taxpayer and it is very misleading of Deputy Moran to come in and produce that method of calculation as an argument in this debate. The Deputy then went on to deal with the question of &ldquo;market value&rdquo; in a case where a deed is lodged for assesment of stamp duty.  I move to report progress.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On last Thursday I asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs some questions about the appointment of a temporary auxiliary postman in Milford district.  I put down three questions, seeking information as to how the appointment was made.  In my first question, I asked for the names of the applicants and the places or marks obtained by each of them at the first interview.  I received no information on that subject from the Minister, who more or less indicated that it was not his policy nor was it a good thing that such information should be made known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my other questions, I asked the Minister whether it was a fact that three interviews were held to fill one and the same job, and also whether <Col N="928" /> it was a fact that the second interview was a special interview for one of the candidates who had already been interviewed.  Thirdly, I asked him, under this same question, whether another and third interview had been held to interview a candidate for the position who had not been interviewed either at the first interview or at the second interview and who, apparently, had not been an applicant at that time for this position.  I got no information whatever on any of these three points from the Minister.  On the one particular point on which he did deign to give me some little information when I questioned him as to the policy in making such appointments, he stated that his policy was to appoint the most qualified applicant, regard being had to the claims of ex-Army applicants, to Irish qualifications in the case of vacancies in the Gaeltacht, and to candidates' domestic responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In the first interview, which was held last October, my information is that there were 11 candidates interviewed, that those 11 were the persons whose names were submitted by the local employment exchange as suitable unemployed men in the vicinity.  That, I think, is as it should be.  However, the man who was placed first in the list of the candidates interviewed did not, it is safe to assume, meet with some requirements known only to the Minister himself and that, I suggest, is the reason why it was seen fit to have a second interview about a fortnight later, at which another candidate, who was placed lower in the list, was interviewed, with a view to having this man placed in the position.</P>
    <P>It apparently transpired that this second interview was not sufficient either in itself to make this man qualify or come first on the list.  This man's name, to my knowledge, is Sweeney.  Had he got this position, while I would still feel aggrieved that the person who had held the temporary position did not succeed, I would not feel so much aggrieved as I do that the man, Leavy by name, has succeeded in getting the job.  The man who held the temporary position for 16 months, prior to the appointment which took place recently, by name Tony Duggan, carried <Col N="929" /> out the duties attached to the temporary post in what I am safe in saying was an exemplary manner and a manner satisfactory to all concerned. Furthermore, he is a married man with a wife and two dependent children.  He has got no means of support whatever and, as well as that, his Army service, despite what the Minister may say to the contrary, is beyond question and is far greater and much more meritorious than that of the candidate appointed.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated here, in answer to a Supplementary Question, that the candidate selected had some years' service in the Marine Force, that the other man had no Army service, and that another person recommended by Deputy Blaney had one month's Army service and was discharged on medical grounds.  Let us see what this month's service actually entails.  This man to whom the Minister referred was this Tony Duggan in question.  Dugan in 1934 joined the Irish Volunteers and served in those Volunteers, and attended all the courses connected with the Volunteer Force until 1938, when he had the misfortune to be involved in a very serious accident, the result of which was that he was confined to bed for two years.  That brought us into 1940.  The war was then on and recruits were being looked for and requested for the Army.  Duggan volunteered for the Army again, was accepted, but after a month's service it was found that, due to his disability suffered in that accident in 1938, he was medically unfit and was so discharged.</P>
    <P>The night after his discharge, on arriving back again at his home, he came along and joined the L.S.F.&mdash;A Group.  Later he was transferred to the L.D.F., in which he served as section leader and later as assistant group leader and group leader.  He continued in that force until that force was disbanded and then he transferred to the F.C.A., in which he is to-day a serving member.  This is his service, and if there is anything to be said about it I think it should be that it is a credit to Duggan himself.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, let us take the Marine Service by the man appointed, Leavy.  He joined the Marine Service in 1946 and served until 1948.  Leavy <Col N="930" /> was in this country and available for service in the marines, Army or Local auxiliary services during the war, but I do not think you will find his name figuring to the extent of even a month in any of them.  Furthermore, the two years which he did serve in the marines were, I think all will agree, to his own advantage, since during those two years and during the time he was there he was actually learning or perfecting his trade as cobbler; and on returning home in 1948 and since then he has been fully employed in that capacity; and, as a matter of fact, was employed up to the very day before he took on this position which was granted.</P>
    <P>He is a single man, he has no dependants whatsoever; he has a trade and was employed in continuous employment for the past two years; and there is no reason to believe that he will not, and could not, be in it for the next 20 years.  Here we find him being given precedence over a man who carried out the temporary job satisfactorily, a man who is married and has dependent children, who has no house of his own and who, due to the accident he had, is medically unfit to do a manual labourer's work.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister in conscience stand over this selection?  Will he say that these appointments are made without his knowledge and that he really does not have much to do with them?  Knowing that such an excuse has been used in the past by various Ministers, on hearing the rumour that Leavy was likely to be appointed, I took it on myself to write personally to the Minister to indicate that he would be doing a grave injustice if he overlooked Duggan's claims.  I pointed out Duggan's volunteer service, his offer of service to the Army and his service in the L.D.F., so that the Minister would not, by some mistake, appoint someone who was less qualified and less deserving. The Minister cannot fall back on such an excuse.  I wonder what the Minister will say or what the House will think when I say that this appointment absolutely stinks of that political corruption and jobbery to end which the Minister claims he got into office and put Fianna Fáil out.</P>

      <P>I may forget it but the people in the area where this appointment took place will not forget it.  Had the Minister appointed the other candidate who was given special consideration or any one of a number of other candidates who were interviewed in the first instance, I would not have the grievance that I now have.  What better Army service could Duggan have given?  Was it any fault of his that he was medically unfit in 1940?  Did he not offer himself?  Was he not accepted? Did he not remain in the Army until he was discharged as medically unfit? What Army service did the person who was appointed give?  Why did he not offer his service at that time?  If he did offer his service when the emergency was over, he should not be compensated for it by being given a job because he was very well compensated in that he has a trade to-day whereby he can earn a good living, a much better living than Duggan can earn in any capacity.  Duggan is not medically fit and a medical certificate can be produced to prove that he is not fit for heavy manual work.  He has no trade of any kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, this is the compensation Duggan gets for his time and energy that were devoted to the country during the emergency, before the emergency and after the emergency. The Minister comes in here and squeaks about Marine Force service, and talks about domestic responsibilities.  What domestic responsibilities has this man Leavy and in what way are his two years in the Marine service comparable with the other man's service from 1934 to 1950?  There is no comparison, as the Minister knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is it not a fact that the Minister is the one person in the Department who has entire responsibility for this appointment?  Had his visit to Letter-kenny a short time before this appointment <Col N="932" /> was made known anything to do with the appointment?  Was the political pressure so great that the Minister had to come from the west of Ireland to Donegal to see that this small job was filled to suit his political colleagues? He may say what he likes but the people know what to think.  Let him not think that the little work he has given Duggan now will repair the injustice done to him.  The Minister told us the other day that Duggan is still in the employment of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  That is quite true, but will he be in the employment of that Department a fortnight or a month hence?  This man is doing temporary relief duty.  Apparently he is well fitted to do any type of temporary work for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but is not suitable when it comes to permanent employment on the same work.</P>
    <P>Was Duggan placed first on the list at the first interview?  Why was this man Sweeney interviewed a second time, when no one else was interviewed? Is it true that, despite the second special interview, despite all the political pulling and twisting that could be done, it was not felt that Sweeney's appointment could be justified; that nothing was done, publicly, at any rate, until well into December when a third and, last, interview was held for this job and a man who had not been in the first list of applicants was brought to a special interview, all for himself, and appointed?</P>

The Deputy was the first person to bring to the Department's notice that this man had suffered an injury and was not capable of performing heavy work.  The result was, as Deputy Blaney knows, that I was merely carrying out the rules and regulations laid down by my predecessor, and one of these is that for a quasipermanent job you must have a medical certificate.

He may thank Deputy Blaney for it all because there was no report sent to the Department about this man's injury and that he was unable to do the work, until Deputy Blaney sent in his letter.  It was a serious injury, the Deputy said, and the man was unable to do any hard work.  The Deputy appealed to the Department, not to me; it was to the Department he sent the letter.  Probably, I would have taken a more humane line than the Department if I had received the letter.  So far as I am concerned, I was prepared to treat the case mainly from the domestic point of view, everything else being equal, and I did treat it under the regulations made by the previous Government, having the three points in view.

      <P>And some other people had their names signed for them. There was no public representative who made any representation on behalf of the candidate other than yourself, and you spoiled your own candidate's chance.  No county councillor or public <Col N="938" /> representative made any representation other than you, and I advise you when you are making representations again to take a different line and not mention to any Department that a man is unable to do the work he is supposed to do, knowing it will be brought before the Department, and that he could not get a medical certificate. You are a young and inexperienced politician.  If you want advice go to Deputy Moran.  He will advise you and he will not ruin his application by condemning the man for whom he is applying for the job.</P>
