    <Speaker pid="ThomasWalsh" hpid="Mr. T. Walsh Mr. T. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was referring to the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I have not much more to say in connection with that except to impress on the Minister the necessity for having most of these works, particularly those concerned with drainage, carried out during the summer.  Last year I saw men going to work in drains in October and November.  No matter what protective clothing they have, that is not suitable work for them at that time of the year.  I know there are difficulties so far as the county councils are concerned and, particularly, the county surveyors, because the summer months are the best months, for instance, for tarring.  In fact, it is the only time of the year in which that can be done.  Possibly the county surveyor has to spread out the work over a long period.  Consequently, many of those works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act have been postponed until the winter.  However, I would stress on the Minister the necessity for pointing out to the county councils that these works, so far as possible, should be carried out in the summer.  I do attach a small amount of blame to the Department in that respect, because in many cases when schemes are sent forward they are not sanctioned in time to permit of the council having them carried out in the summer months.</P>
      <P>Another matter I wish to refer to is in connection with road workers.  I would ask the Minister to give permission to the councils during the summer period to allow these workers a break for tea, particularly those who are working on stone crushing.  Representations have been made to me about these men working all day in a cloud of dust.  They should be allowed a break for tea at 3 or 3.30 p.m.  I do not mean that the working hours should be shortened, but that permission should be given to the councils to allow half an hour for tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter is in connection with the purchase of materials by small contractors. In Kilkenny we have different building schemes in operation. We have the small building contractors <Col N="792" /> and we have direct labour.  I find that the small contractor is under a grave disadvantage in regard to the purchase of materials.  As we know, the councils go into the market.  They have money at their disposal.  They buy in big quantities and corner the market, so far as materials are concerned. Where there is a small contractor, who cannot pay cash at the time, the builders' providers are rather hesitant about giving him the same facilities as they are prepared to give to the council who can pay cash.  I would suggest that, if possible, the purchase of materials for the county should be placed in the hands of the council, that small contractors be given the option of buying from the council and that the moneys due to the council on foot of the transaction be withheld from the moneys due to the contractor.  I think in that way we would be helping small contractors, and it would be an inducement to them to come into the market and build houses for us.</P>
    <P>At the present time they are handicapped in so far as they are not able to get materials in large quantities. Consequently, they are able to take contracts only for a small number of houses.  If they were put into a position in which they could draw upon all the materials they required I believe we would have more contractors than we have at present.  I do not think the scheme which I have suggested is unworkable and at least it would be worth the experiment.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to refer again to the question of granting cottage tenancies to people who were the original applicants.  There are one or two points which I forgot last night in referring to this question. Take the case of old people, the members of whose families, boys or girls, have gone to England or have come to Dublin here and who, in many cases, get married.  When they are married in England or elsewhere, they do not wish to go back to the hovels in which they were reared.  Consequently, the old pair are denied the pleasure of having their families with them since they have no proper place to receive their daughters-in-law or their sons-in-law, as the case may be.  For <Col N="793" /> that reason, I would urge on the Minister the necessity of making a regulation whereby the manager, or whoever is responsible for the allocation of tenancies, would be given the option of giving a cottage, in the proportion of one in five at least, to the original applicants.  The number of these original applicants now surviving, as I pointed out last night, is small.  Many of them have their families reared, but there are a number of old couples throughout the country who are still living in the hovels in which they were reared.  I do not think that, in this age, when we are building new houses for young and old, we should deny these people the right of having some small comfort in their old age.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of grants for roads.  Grants should be made available for roads leading into tourist centres.  The Carlow County Council a short time ago sent a deputation to the Parliamentary Secretary seeking a grant for one particular road in that county, but he was not able to accede to their request.  There are several tourist centres in which there are very bad roads.  Many of the beautiful scenic spots amongst our hills have bad county roads leading into them, and I suggest that grants should be made available to put these roads into proper repair.  If we expect to develop the tourist industry and to attract tourists to this country, grants are essential for this purpose.  Most of the people who travel to-day over our county roads go away with a very bad impression of the country.  If we were able to give them a good impression of the condition of our roads, they would probably come back here again.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to compliment the Department and particularly the officials.  I heard Deputy Dr. Brennan and also Deputy Beirne making an attack on the officials of the Department last night.  I do not think there was any justification for these attacks. It has been my experience, as a member of the county council for a good many years, that when a scheme was put forward there was no undue <Col N="794" /> delay so far as the Department was concerned.  They have been most reasonable.  I think that applies to all the officials working under the jurisdiction of the Department of Local Government.  My view is that if Deputy Dr. Brennan put his own house in order he would be much better occupied than in making unfounded attacks on the officials of the Department. I compliment the officials on the help they have given to my county and I hope that the matters to which I have drawn attention here will get consideration.</P>

      <P>I look upon the Estimate for the Department of Local Government as being the Estimate next in importance to that upon which the debate concluded yesterday, namely, the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  I do not propose to explore every avenue of this Department, but there are one or two points to which I should like to draw the attention of the Minister in the few minutes during which I intend to take up the time of the House.  In the first place, let me say how glad I am that the Minister has informed the House and the country that in the next few months he intends to introduce a Bill to repeal the County Management Act. That Act, I understand, was passed in 1940 or 1941.  If ever an Act had the effect of dampening the ardour of councils throughout the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two points to which I would like to draw the attention of the Minister.  Number one is the very long delay in giving to applicants housing grants when they have been passed and certified by the engineers for payment.  Since I came into this House I have had one case which has extended back, I think, over the past two years.  It has been certified by the engineers as correct.  I have <Col N="795" /> been bombarded by the applicant, who wants his money, and for the past 12 months I am trying to get it out of the Department.  I know that my grievance is not alone, as I have discussed the matter with several members of various Parties, and I would appeal to the Minister to give a gee-up to the financial side of his Department.</P>
      <P>When people who save a certain amount of money over 20 or 25 years embark on building a house and put their life savings into it and when the house is ready and certified, I think they should get the grant at least within a period of from two to three months.  Two hundred and seventy-five pounds may not seem a lot to the Department, but it is a considerable amount of money to a man who is waiting for it and who is being pestered by the merchant who has supplied him with the requisite materials for his house.  I make this suggestion in all good faith to the Minister, and I hope that he will see that there will not be the same long delays in the future.</P>
      <P>Several Deputies have spoken on the various branches of local government. I intend to confine myself to one this morning.  I mentioned the matter when the Department of Industry and Commerce Estimate was before the House and I was informed by the Ceann Comhairle&mdash;and rightly so&mdash; that it was more appropriate to local government.  It is a matter which, for many years past, has caused me a considerable amount of pain, but more particularly so since I became a member of this House.  It is what I might describe as the famous, or perhaps the infamous, Youghal Bridge. There are members of this House from different parts of the country who may not have been down South, so may I recite the facts for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This bridge, somewhere in the region of 460 yards in length, was erected away back about 1880.  It was designed in those days to carry traffic of two or three or four tons.  It was built of metal, but due to corrosion by the salt water, it was regarded in December, 1938, as unsafe for vehicular traffic exceeding 3½ tons.  One can <Col N="796" /> realise the shock the people of Youghal got when they found in that December, just before Christmas, a notice posted on both ends of the bridge saying that no traffic over 3½ tons would be permitted to cross it.  Gates were put up and the bridge is that way since.  In the early stages members of the Garda Síochána were detailed for duty to ensure that no motor car would cross this 460-yard bridge at a greater pace than five miles per hour.</P>
    <P>Every one of us here can realise what a car driving at five miles per hour across a bridge would be like and it was the joke of the century to see 15 or 21 cars crossing it at a snail's pace.  If you broke the regulation of five miles per hour the next thing you got was a docket for exceeding the speed limit and that incurred a certain amount of hostility from people from various parts of the country who were unaware of the facts.  With a view to getting over that the county councils of Cork and Waterford decided to put barrels filled with concrete on it at intervals of about 15 yards.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly sobered the people of Youghal considerably in their request for a bridge.  That was decided by the County Surveyor of Waterford, Mr. John Bowen, a very brilliant engineer, and by Mr. R. F. O'Connor, the Cork County Surveyor, both of whom have gone to their reward many years since, but still the bridge remains.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure you that I am speaking as seriously as I have ever spoken at any gathering in my life when I speak on this matter.  I understand that the Minister for Local Government in 1938 was a gentleman who now holds an extremely high position in this country and whose name I do not propose to bring into this House.  The next Minister was, I think, Deputy Ruttledge. The representations made to the Department of Local Government just did not seem to get anywhere.  Then the war intervened from September, 1939, to May, 1945, and nothing was done.  Realising the cancerous growth, if I may put it that way, on the trade of the town of Youghal, we members <Col N="797" /> of the urban council, of which I happen to be chairman, acting in conjunction with the county councils of Cork and Waterford, met on numerous occasions but we were always greeted with: &ldquo;There is a war on and nothing can be done.&rdquo;  I can assure you of the irreparable damage that has been done to the trade of my town by the continuous neglect in this matter and I use the words &ldquo;continuous neglect&rdquo; advisedly.  I doubt if there are any people in any part of Ireland who would have taken such a serious matter with such equanimity over all those years.  Personally I doubt if I would ever have been in this House were it not for the requests made to me by the people of my own town to allow myself to go forward to see if I could expedite here in Dáil Éireann the construction of Youghal Bridge.  That is quite true.</P>
    <P>Cork and Waterford County Councils met on numerous occasions&mdash;managers, engineers, members and others.  A bridge committee was formed and numerous requests were made to previous Ministers of the Department of Local Government.  That dormant body after all those years seems to be just breaking into some kind of little flame as I saw in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> lately that they were looking for a firm of borers to bore down to get the foundation. The bridge was built in approximately 1880 by a firm in Stockton-onTees who have now gone out of business. We tried numerous institutes of engineers in London and elsewhere, and we tried the offices of Waterford and Cork County Councils but no blueprint of the original bridge could be found anywhere.  Now after 11 years the borings are about to take place for the foundation and if it goes on at its present rate of progress I think that every member of this House will have crossed the Great Divide before the bridge is built.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It will last all the longer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you have one in Wexford, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a real blot on the Department of Local Government and I certainly am holding them responsible. This bridge was a national highway connecting the Counties of Waterford <Col N="798" /> and Cork and the whole situation has done a considerable amount of damage to our tourist trade, because we are on the direct route from Rosslare and Waterford to Killarney.  In pre-war years, before the bridge was condemned as unfit for heavy traffic, touring buses from all Ireland came to Youghal and I have often seen as many as eight and ten buses, carrying 30 and 35 passengers each, in the town and one can imagine the financial benefit to hotel keepers and business people through having day after day 300 and 400 extra people in the town on holidays and prepared to spend money. That traffic is now being diverted to a more northerly route.  Our fairs and markets have sunk to a negligible degree.  As I said on the Industry and Commerce Vote, the northern end of Youghal derived its livelihood to a considerable extent from the Waterford trade.  Now all that trade is being diverted to the neighbouring towns of Dungarvan, Cappoquin and intervening villages.  Any business man will tell you that once you lose trade, once you lose a customer, it is very hard to get him back again.</P>
    <P>This bridge is about one and half miles outside the town across the Blackwater, connecting the two counties, and it is in the region of 460 or 470 yards long.  Along the bridge, barrels are set at intervals and a motor car going through has to twist and turn around these barrels.  If another car is coming towards you, you must move up to a barrel to make room for that car to pass.  The Waterford bus picks up the passengers on the Waterford side when the Cork bus drops them on the Cork side.  One can imagine the feelings of people who have to cross that bridge drenched to the skin on a winter night, with a strong south-westerly gale blowing and rain pouring down and one can well imagine their state when they get to the other side.  People from Ardmore, a prosperous little village nearby, come in to me, and, when I remark that I have not seen them for a considerable time, they say that they are going somewhere else now, because &ldquo;we got drenched at the bridge the last time and do not intend to take any more <Col N="799" /> chances.&rdquo;  They can get their bus at Ardmore, go to Dungarvan and do their shopping and be dropped again at their own doors without having to get drenched.</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter, the importance of which I want to impress on the Minister.  As I have said, our fairs were dependent to a considerable extent on the Waterford side, but they have practically disappeared now because the people go to the neighbouring villages now and do not come in to us. Many Deputies will have seen photographs of this bridge.  I have seen several in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and <i>Times Pictorial</i>, and, within the past month, I met a man who lived in the district about eight or nine years ago. He had been all through the recent war, and, when I met him, the first thing he said to me was: &ldquo;The greatest shock I ever got was when I saw that Youghal Bridge was as I passed over it nine years ago.&rdquo;  He had served in the British Army during the war and had landed in Normandy on D-day.  He took part in the drive through Germany and he spoke of the speed with which the army was able to throw bridges across the Rhine to carry tanks ten and 15 tons in weight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJamesOGorman" hpid="Mr. O'Gorman Mr. O'Gorman">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Gorman</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will not require a war to get Youghal Bridge erected.  It often struck me that it was a great pity that, when the bridge was closed by the occupation forces, the British Army, back in the 20's, they did not make a proper job of it and blow it up, because we would now have a decent bridge.  Now we are just depending on our own Government and are doing exactly nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have interviewed the Minister on several occasions in connection with this bridge.  One of the first jobs I undertook was to contact the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy Murphy, who promised to do his very best in the matter and to expedite the erection of this bridge. God intervened and took him away and he was followed by the present Minister.  Realising the very onerous <Col N="800" /> duties devolving on the Minister at such short notice, I did not worry him too much, but 12 months have now passed, and I have been in the House for two and a half years, and we seem to have got as far with the erection of the bridge as when I came in first. The Leaders of all the political Parties on the eve of the last general election were interviewed by members of my council on their visits to Youghal. Every one of them, without exception, promised that, if they got the support of the people, the bridge would be under way within six months. Politicians' promises!</P>
    <P>I am not going to be as emphatic as Deputy Brennan was last night, but, unless this bridge is well under way before the next general election, I doubt very much if I would have the cheek&mdash;I am speaking very sincerely and very bluntly&mdash;to ask the people, 95 per cent. of whom supported me in my own town and sent me here to do a specific job for them, to support me again.  The business of the town has been hit very hard.  Had I known I would have been speaking on this Estimate this morning I would have brought more papers with me, but I have one letter which I have received here in which I am asked &ldquo;to continue to pester the appropriate Government Department in regard to the proposed new Youghal Bridge&rdquo;.  The writer continues:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In this connection, as I have acquainted you in a previous communication, the people are so tired of waiting for something to be done that they propose to start&mdash;and I do not blame them&mdash;a pay-no-rates campaign.  Another matter which worries them is where the new bridge will be erected.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have heard that it was the intention in the past, on the advice of engineering experts in Local Government. to erect the bridge further up the Blackwater.  If that is done, I tell the Department straight that they may as well not build it at all.  On behalf of the people of Youghal, I want to insist that, if and when that bridge is erected, it must not be erected a yard further, up the river than the present bridge. Otherwise, it will be no use to the <Col N="801" /> people of Youghal.  We heard, too, that it was the intention six or seven years ago to erect a suspension bridge over the river at Ardsallagh.  That is no use because it is a mile or a mile and a half further up.  The people of Youghal want the bridge in one place&mdash; as close as possible to the existing bridge and not further up the river. Business people in the town of Youghal have been driven almost desperate and one of the biggest employers in the town has told me that he proposes to close down.  Unfortunately, like many other towns, we have our share of unemployment.  If work on that bridge had been started, all the unemployed who are on the dole would be absorbed for the next five or six years. I would appeal to the Minister to consider this matter and I hope that the officers of his Department, a considerable number of whom I see alongside him, will take serious notice of this matter.</P>

      <P>I hope to convey my remarks, through the Minister, to the officers of his Department.  Thank you, Sir.  This is a very serious matter and I want to see a move made quickly in connection with it.  I shall not say anything in regard to houses and the various other points, a note of which I have here, because I understand there is a race against time.  I want the Minister to act in connection with this bridge.  Whoever is responsible for the long delay must be got rid of.  If God spares me, and if I have to talk on this Estimate this time 12 months, I doubt if I would ever face my own people again if work on this bridge is not proceeded with in the next 12 or 18 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">

      <P>I have a few complaints to make.  One is in regard to the housing grants as applied to North Mayo.  There are great complaints from all over the area about the delay in paying these grants.  I do not know what is the cause and I do not know who is responsible.  Whoever is responsible should be spurred into action <Col N="802" /> because it is a dreadful thing that, where a grant has been sanctioned, it is not paid for 12 months after the house is completed.  There are complaints from the applicants and from the merchants supplying the materials. In nearly all cases, merchants are refusing to supply the materials unless the money is paid down, as they cannot afford to wait indefinitely for the money.  Houses that have been built for 12 months have not yet received the grants.  I cannot understand the reason for that delay.  I do not know what will happen eventually. I do not know whether it is the Department or its inspectors or the Department of Finance that are responsible, but whoever is responsible should be brought to book.</P>
      <P>In my opinion, the grants should be paid on the completion of the house. I think that is the undertaking given by the Department.  It is the least that would be expected that the grant would be paid when the house was roofed.  I would ask the Minister to remedy this matter at once and to see that the grants are paid immediately. I know cases where inspectors have not issued certificates although they have been notified for a long time that the houses were completed.</P>
      <P>Merchants cannot afford to wait 12 months for the money and are refusing to supply the material.  I know several cases where men have borrowed money from the bank on the understanding that when the houses would be completed the money would be repaid. When the grant is not paid, the persons concerned have to pay interest for a further six months to the bank.  It is very unfair.  I would ask the Minister to have that matter dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another complaint in regard to road grants.  Last year we got no main roads grant.  In the area I represent there are at least two main roads that are in a deplorable condition at present.  The Minister has had correspondence in regard to the north coast road from Belmullet to Ballycastle. That road is in a deplorable condition.  A bus service which operated on that road had to be discontinued owing to the bad condition of the road.  I would <Col N="803" /> ask the Minister to do something about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Ballyeroy-Mulranny road is another main road that is in a shocking condition.  It is even worse than the north-coast road.  They never got a main road grant.  I do not see why.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to consider these cases and to see that a grant would be given.  The present condition of the roads is a disgrace.  They are two of the nicest roads in the whole county as regards scenery.  The Ballycroy-Mulranny road is very important from a tourist point of view. The best fishing rivers in the West of Ireland for trout and salmon are in the surrounding area.  They are a great tourist attraction, but tourists do not come there a second time, because the roads are in such a bad state.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce would be able to tell the Minister about it.  He travelled that road recently.</P>
    <P>A special grant should be given for the repair of these two roads.  During the emergency these roads had to carry an enormous amount of turf traffic. Hundreds of thousands of tons of turf were carried over them.  That cut them to pieces, and it would be very difficult to put them into a proper state of repair now.  No money was spent on those roads for a number of years except the small amount of the roads rural grant.  That was all that was given.  That was not sufficient for roads that had been cut up in such a manner by the haulage of turf.</P>
    <P>I would again appeal to the Minister to see that grants would be given.  The county roads are in almost the same condition.  Many of them were cut up so badly that it is difficult to restore them.  I would ask the Minister to investigate these cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the discussion on this Estimate is over-shadowed to a certain extent by pending legislation to reform the whole system of local administration and the proposed Housing Bill, tends to curtail the discussion on the Estimate.  It is gratifying to learn that legislation is on the way. Therefore, I do not propose to speak <Col N="804" /> at any great length but there are certain outstanding matters to which I must direct the Minister's attention. The first is the fact that local expenditure still tends to rise and the direct burden upon the ordinary ratepayer is becoming an intolerable nightmare.  In an unguarded moment during the past year the Minister expressed the view publicly that the question of rates did not give any cause for alarm.  I think the ratepayers of the country generally were deeply incensed by that remark. I know that during the past year there was an intensive organised effort on the part of ratepayers for their own protection. The question of rates gives cause for alarm not only to the large ratepayers but also to the small ratepayers. As we know, rates are directly collected in a lump sum from the ratepayer and that also imposes a very definite hardship. The Minister should use all his power and influence to stay the upward tendency of rates.  It is true that, as a result of an agitation during the past year, substantial increases in rates were not made in most places but we can anticipate that an effort will be made in the coming year to force rates still higher.  The Minister should set his face against such a tendency and give all possible encouragement in respect of the keeping down of rates to the lowest level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local administration, as we are aware, is to a great extent under dual control: it is under the control of the local authorities in the first instance and they, in turn, are subject to the control of the Department.  That system of dual control does not make for efficiency.  Frequently, when members of a county council ask why such and such a work is not being undertaken they are informed that the plans are awaiting the sanction of the Department.  All this evasion of responsibility on the part of local officials&mdash; all this confusion as to who is responsible&mdash;is, in many cases, the cause of long delays which I think should be avoided.  Deputy O'Gorman referred to the celebrated Youghal Bridge. Examples of similar works left undone could be quoted from almost every part of the country.  It is very difficult to fix responsibility.  Naturally, the local ratepayers will fix responsibility on the <Col N="805" /> local council, and it in turn will always accuse the Department.  Therefore, we have confusion and lack of clarity, and that, inevitably, makes for inefficiency, waste of time and waste of money.  I hope the Minister will endeavour to clear up this matter.  I hope he will impose clear-cut, definite obligations on local authorities which they will have to carry out and which he will insist on their carrying out expeditiously. I hope he will clearly define the responsibility of these officials and that they, in turn, will seek to carry out their work with the utmost expedition. In addition, I hope the Minister will always be ready to resist all attempts by the Minister for Finance to impose additional burdens on the local authorities and, through them, on the local ratepayers.  We look to the Minister for Local Government to fight the Department of Finance on behalf of the ratepayers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was discussing the provision of substantial grants from the State towards the complete reconstruction of roads, and particularly county roads.  That is not a matter that we ought to continue to deal with in a piecemeal way.  There are thousands of miles of county roads which are deteriorating day by day. They are being kept, at enormous expense, in a permanent condition of disrepair, and the problem is being met by the Government by means of very inadequate grants which provide for the frequent reconstruction of just a tiny, minute fraction of the total county road mileage in each county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of what benefit is it to the community to select a few miles of road in each county for reconstruction, to do those few miles each year, and to proceed in that way on a programme of reconstruction which could not be <Col N="809" /> completed within 50 years?  Is there not a waste of public money there, in the first place, through the inability of the local engineering staffs to organise a complete scheme of reconstruction, to acquire the proper machinery and to put this work in hand on a standardised and regularised basis?  All the present effort means nothing more than waste and inefficiency. While a small mileage of the roads is being reconstructed from year to year, more than 90 per cent. of the roads is being maintained in a primitive, old-fashioned way, putting on a small amount of loose material which is deposited in the fields and ditches in the course of a few days. Almost every penny that is being spent on that type of road-making is wasted money.  That money is wrung from the ratepayers and the taxpayers and it is being squandered recklessly.</P>
    <P>It is time to introduce some sound method of organisation.  We should think of a five years' plan of road reconstruction and we should have every assurance that the grants necessary will be forthcoming.  In that way engineers can plan their road reconstruction schemes much in the same way as the Electricity Supply Board have planned their rural electrification scheme or much as any nation-wide undertaking would be planned.  We are aware that in the Six Counties there has been a substantial improvement in road-making during the past few years.  That is mainly due to the fact that better financial provision is being made.</P>
    <P>We know that when we provide housing accommodation in areas adjacent to our towns and cities, we always seek to provide decent roads to the houses, decent concrete or tarbound roads leading right to the new houses.  That is as it should be.  But the people who live on the hillsides and on the bogs are just as much entitled to a decent road to their houses as the people who live near the towns and cities.  I think we will never really solve the problem of rural depopulation until we provide that type of amenity in addition to other amenities that may be required.  It is depressing for young people who are <Col N="810" /> thinking of marrying and settling down, even in a house that is worthy of habitation, if they have to flounder over a rough boreen to a public road and then travel for miles along a badly maintained public road before they can reach the town or the village or get to the chapel on Sundays.</P>
    <P>We ought not to continue to deal with this matter in a half-hearted, haphazard way.  We are providing substantial grants for drainage work, and considerable numbers of men are being employed on this work.  It is to be hoped that the work will be completed within a short time, in so far as it is intended to proceed with it.  When it is completed, there will again be an unemployment problem, and I suggest that plans should be made so as to ensure that the men who are at present working, and who are doing very good work on drainage schemes in many counties, will be drafted on to a big scheme of road construction.  I am not so much concerned about the main roads, but I am really concerned about the county roads, many of which have never been treated with tar or have never been concreted or treated with any other permanent surfacing material.  These roads are now a disgrace to the community.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there is some provision in this Estimate for an inquiry into the question of making roads safe for horses.  While the horse may be condemned by the Minister for Agriculture and other progressive people, he will still remain in the rural areas for a certain time, and it is desirable, when putting a permanent surface on a road, whether tar or concrete, that the requirements of horse-drawn traffic and animal traffic generally should be considered.  I do not want to go into the matter very exhaustively, but it would be no harm to keep it in mind, and I am glad the Minister is giving it some attention.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, I have a few observations to make.  There are three different types of people who require housing accommodation.  You first have the family, and then you <Col N="811" /> have young people who were either recently married or who intend to marry, and then you have the older people who have no children or dependents, old single people or old couples whose families have settled down.  Those three types of people are all entitled to housing accommodation.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed, of course, to put the first emphasis on the need of the family.  That need ought to be and should be met as quickly as possible, but we cannot neglect the old people who have not dependents.  They are just as much entitled to decent housing accommodation as the younger sections of the community.  Perhaps it might be well if provision were made for a smaller type of house at a lower rent for, say, old age pensioners.  In many towns there are terraces of small houses which are now regarded as being too small for family accommodation. I do not think all of them should be demolished.  Very many of them are structurally sound and it would be well, I think, if they were reserved for old people without dependents.</P>
    <P>In addition, there is the other type of accommodation for people of the older generation.  That could be met by the provision of an additional room to an existing house.  It would be natural and desirable that an old man or woman whose son or daughter was married should continue to live with them in the same house, or near them if possible.  In most cases the ordinary county council house is too small for a young man and his wife with perhaps a large family, and for the older people.  I think it would be a good social reform to provide, wherever necessary, an additional room for the grandparents in which they could live with a certain amount of independence from the rest of the family.  In that way they would be near their children and grandchildren and could be of assistance to them.  They could also receive some assistance from the younger people.  I think that some sort of a semi-detached room such as I suggest in these council houses would be very desirable.  Whatever additional charge in the way of rent arose in a case of that sort could be paid for by the occupants out of their means.  That is <Col N="812" /> a reform in housing which I think is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>It is rather strange that Deputy T. Walsh should have mentioned a complaint that has been brought to my notice by small contractors.  The complaint is that, since county councils have undertaken the building of houses on a large scale by direct labour, it has become impossible for the small contractor to get housing materials of any kind, and particularly housing materials which are in short supply. The big suppliers supply the county councils.  I suppose the small contractor is just regarded as small fry by them, and that they prefer to deal with the big consumers so far as these materials are concerned.  I suggest to the House that the small contractor is also fulfilling a very useful purpose in the community.  He is making a substantial contribution to the solution of the housing problem and, therefore, it is essential that he should get at least his quota of whatever supplies are available, so that he will be able to continue to make this contribution to a solution of this problem.  It is also desirable that the small and the private contractor in the building of houses should not be eliminated.</P>

      <P>Under no circumstances would I give the private contractor more for the building of these houses than they can be built for by direct labour.  I have been altogether in favour of county councils undertaking direct labour schemes.  I think that a little healthy competition between the county councils and contractors in the building of houses is a good thing. Healthy competition is good for everybody. Without meaning any disrespect to them, I am certain that contractors, if left to themselves, would exploit the community.  I am also certain, in the same way, that if local authorities were left to themselves there would be an exploitation of the community, not perhaps by the county councils or the Department of Local Government but by vested interests&mdash;by organisations of <Col N="813" /> skilled workers who would extract from the ratepayers and the community generally excessive charges just the same as contractors, through their organisations, seek to extract excessive profits from the community.</P>

      <P>I have the feeling that there is no more powerful monopoly in this country than the organised trade unions of skilled workers.  In my opinion, the time has come to attack in a vigorous way this monopoly by ensuring that the artificial shortage of skilled workers be brought to an end, and that there should not be in this country, with all the young vigorous and intelligent people that we have, any scarcity whatever of skilled workers.  We have young people leaving the primary schools and going into the technical schools where they could be trained to become skilled workers in a couple of years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with housing, and one of the difficulties that has been mentioned is the shortage of skilled workers.  Appeals have been made to our skilled workers in Britain to return, but I do not think they have responded as one would have expected they would.  I believe that the real source of supply of skilled workers is to be found in our young boys who are leaving our primary schools.  If these young people were sent into our technical schools and trained there in building work, that, I believe, would contribute enormously to a solution of the housing problem&mdash;that is, if they <Col N="814" /> were not restricted or controlled from entering into these trades.</P>
      <P>If I have made any attack on trade unions or on contractors, the attack was made for no other reason than to get this problem solved as speedily as possible.  It is dreadful to see people short of housing accommodation and shelter, old people in their declining years, young married people and those intending to marry, because of these restrictive practices which hold up the entry into skilled trades of young and vigorous boys who could contribute to the solution of the problem in a very few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time that the problem of repairing labourers' cottages throughout the country was solved.  We know that the demand for repairs to these cottages is a problem the county councils must face.  It has become a very expensive item in local administration.  In many cases it is costing the county councils more to keep the cottages in repair than the actual rent they receive from the tenants.  I think the best way to solve the problem would be to transfer the ownership of the cottages to the tenants as quickly as possible.  I think nothing is more conducive to a strong nation than that every man should own his own home and should himself endeavour to keep it in repair. Ownership cannot always be transferred perhaps in the towns and cities where repair work may be a complicated process, but in the rural areas there should be no difficulty whatsoever in making the tenants the owners of their own houses and then imposing upon them the responsibility of keeping those houses in a proper state of repair.  I am sure that 99 per cent. of the tenants would keep their homes in good repair if they were the owners of them and the recalcitrant 1 per cent. could be compelled to follow suit.  It is absurd that the county councils should be compelled to spend more on the repair of these cottages than they actually collect by way of rent.  That position would not be tolerated by any private landlord.  It is not a healthy position.  It is sheer waste of public money to go on tinkering with this problem.  The tenants should be urged to avail of whatever purchase facilities <Col N="815" /> there are, through legislation or otherwise, in order to take over the ownership of their own homes, and the actual transfer of such ownership should be expedited.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is wrong in regard to the grants for drainage under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  In the Estimate substantial provision is made for these works but in actual fact only a small proportion of the grants has been made available so far to the local authorities.  There is a good deal of uneasiness amongst those concerned as to whether those grants will be forthcoming in order to carry the schemes already under way to completion.  I would like the Minister to give a definite assurance in regard to that matter.  As far as I know the county councils have only got a small proportion of the money for the present year.  In many cases they have been compelled to disemploy men and leave schemes uncompleted.  There is one very important scheme in connection with the Derry river in South Wicklow.  That is a very large scheme. Work commenced last year but has not been completed.  I would like a definite assurance from the Minister that the money necessary for the completion of the scheme will be forthcoming.  The scheme involves the construction of a new waterway and the acquisition of land for that purpose.  In its incomplete stage it is interfering to a considerable extent with farming operations in the area.  I know, of course, that it would be absurd to undertake a work of this kind and leave it unfinished and I am sure that I am pushing an open door when asking the Minister to give an assurance that the necessary money will be forthcoming to complete the scheme.</P>

      <P>While I do not agree with the policy of the Minister in many respects, I wish to compliment him on the way in which he has presented his Estimate and on the tenor of his statement in general.  We had none of the sarcastic witticisms to which we have become accustomed.  Because of that, the debate has been carried on on a much better level than has been <Col N="816" /> the case with other Estimates where sarcastic and offensive remarks were made for which, as far as I could see, there was no justification whatsoever in an introductory statement on an Estimate.</P>
      <P>Yesterday evening a rather well-thought-out attack was made by a Deputy here on the officials of the Department of Local Government.  I have had occasion to visit many Departments of State and I must say that I have always been received, and this is particularly true of the Department of Local Government, with civility and courtesy.  There has been no change in that attitude since the change of Government.  We hear a good deal about red tape.  If the red tape does exist, it is not the officials who are responsible for it; it is the laws made in this House that make the red tape.  If the officials adhere too rigidly to the laws, perhaps there is good reason for that in many cases. There was a time when we claimed to be a nation of saints and scholars. Sometimes one meets a scholar who is anything but a gracious saint when it comes to trying to put across something which the law does not permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal item mentioned here has been housing.  It is a very important item.  Great strides have been made in the past.  The present Administration is continuing to deal with that problem.  While there is an urban problem in my constituency, there is, at the same time, a fairly acute rural problem.  The principal difficulty that I see in the solution of the problem in my area is the fact that we have compulsory powers of acquisition. Delay is due in a great measure to that.  I know very well that compulsory acquisition was introduced not merely to try to speed up the work, but also in an endeavour to get sites at a reasonable price.  If we continue that voluntary basis of acquisition, I suppose it is only natural that the holders of land will try to drive the hardest bargain they can.  The voluntary agreement system worked better with us from 1934 to 1939-40 than the compulsory acquisition system. Even though we had to give a little <Col N="817" /> more per acre, at the same time we could get on much more easily and quickly with the work.  The holding of an inquiry always takes a considerable time.  I do not know who is responsible for it, but there is another thing which holds up the acquisition regarding the purchase of sites and that is the transfer of title.  The Land Commission would have something to do with that, I think.  There is very often very great delay in regard to the transfer of title.</P>
    <P>I have heard Deputies state that the payment of housing grants in their area was unsatisfactory.  That has not been my experience because the payment, in the main, has been satisfactory.  I know of a few cases, however&mdash;there may be a considerable number over the country&mdash;where a very great hardship has been inflicted and I want to bring the matter specially to the notice of the Minister.  In the 1948 Housing Act there was a section inserted for which Deputy T. O'Sullivan and myself had as much responsibility as anybody else. That section provided that in the case of houses commenced before a certain period an increased grant would be paid.  It happened, however, in some cases that people who had not their houses completed by 31st March, 1950, were denied the grant.  Of course Deputies and the Minister may take the view that these people do not deserve much sympathy.  There is one case, however, which I think deserves sympathy.  On the 14th April, 1949, a certificate for the first instalment of the grant was issued in this case.  For some reason or other which I cannot understand, that first instalment of £90 was not paid although the house was roofed. The people concerned therefore were not able to carry on with the completion of the work.  Had that grant been paid at the time at which it was certified for or a month or two later the work would have been finally completed by 31st March, 1950.  I should like to bring that case to the notice of the Minister.  If Section 17 of the 1948 Act prevents the Minister from making that payment now, I hope that he will have it repealed in the new Housing Bill. I think that would be only fair, because it was a mistake or oversight in this <Col N="818" /> case on the part of some official or officials in his Department which was perhaps responsible for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh last night referred to an Order recently made by the Minister and sent down to local authorities under which certain regulations are prescribed in regard to people who would get labourers' cottages.  As was pointed out by Deputy Walsh, in the case of a number of those who made applications for cottages, sites were made available to the local authorities voluntarily by the parents of the applicants, by their employers, or by some neighbours.</P>
    <P>According to the new regulations, the original applicants in many instances are not going to get preference for the cottages.  These sites would not have been given voluntarily were it not for the fact that the owners of the land knew the circumstances of the applicants.  If the sites had not been given voluntarily, the local authority would have been put to the trouble of acquiring them compulsorily.  I think that that is not right.  I believe the original applicants should get preference.</P>
    <P>I also believe that an applicant for a cottage who is a genuine agricultural labourer and who gets a site from his parents or his employer or a neighbour should have a cottage provided for him, whether he is married or single, because, so far as marriage is concerned for an agricultural labourer, the great drawback is that he has not a house to occupy.  Agricultural labourers are a very important class in the community and there should be no restrictions on genuine agricultural labourers, whether married or single, getting cottages, provided they get a site voluntarily, as the extra cost of acquiring a site compulsorily is avoided.</P>
    <P>So far as the housing drive is concerned, we are led to believe that it is going well in the City of Dublin and other cities.  It was stated by the Minister that the largest sum ever made available was being made available this year for housing.  It is only natural to expect that that would be so, as a larger sum will be required <Col N="819" /> owing to the change in money values. That does not mean, however, that there will be a greater number of houses built.  The Minister stated that there was 125 per cent. of an increase since 1939 in the cost of maintaining the roads, and I am sure the same thing applies to houses.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister when replying to inform the House what the response has been to the advertisement which was published in the papers here for a considerable time and I am sure in the Press on the other side and the appeals made on the radio to workers abroad in connection with the housing drive that &ldquo;Ireland is Building&rdquo;.  I should like the Minister to give the total number who have responded to that call, distinguishing between nationals and non-nationals, if he can do so.  We would also like to know if these workers are still coming back.  If the response has not been as good as was expected, we would like to know what is the cause, because we are led to believe that the wages here are better than across the water.  If that is the case, there must be some other reason for it if the response has not been as good as was expected.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of road grants.  Undoubtedly, the problem of the improvement and maintenance of roads is a very big and complex one, much more so than appears from a superficial glance.  I do think, however, that one of the most unwise forms of the economy and retrenchment made by the present Government was the reduction of the road grants in 1949-50.  In fact they reduced them also after coming into office in 1948. They went on the basis of the previous year and not on the basis that had been in operation for two or three years previously&mdash;that was, for the expenditure on main roads 90 per cent., and the expenditure on maintenance work on county roads, 75 per cent.  That was all changed.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the Minister an example of what has happened to us in County Galway and I think what has happened in Galway is typical of what happened all over the country. <Col N="820" /> Road expenditure in County Galway in 1948-49 was £377,932.  That was the estimate that was prepared on the basis of the grants that were being given by Fianna Fáil.  The Government grant in that year was £244,560, which meant that £133,372 was borne by the rates. In 1949-50, the expenditure on the roads was reduced to £331,989 and the Government grant, which had been £244,000 in the previous year, was reduced to £174,000.  The amount to be borne by the rates in 1949-50 was £157,271, the reduction in the Government grant as compared with 1948-49 being £69,842.  That meant that there was an increase on the rates for the county over the 1948-49 figure of £23,820.  The county surveyor's estimate was based on the grants given in previous years.  He made out an estimate for submission to the county council which was included in the general estimate.  He based his estimate, which amounted to £519,275, on his knowledge of what was required to bring the roads up to the standard to which, in his opinion, they should have been brought.  Also basing his estimate on the basis of the grant given by the Fianna Fáil Government, he estimated that the receipts would work out at £359,740.  That would mean, of course, that the rates would carry £159,535.  It was in that year that, instead of spending £519,275, we were cut down as a result of the action of the Government to £331,989.  That was a big slash and, undoubtedly, it had a big effect on the roads.  The improvement that was desired could not be continued and was not continued.  The result is that the county roads were never in a worse condition than they are at the present time.  Most of the county roads in Galway are in a terrible condition and I must also say that the main roads are deteriorating except in the few portions where improvement works are being carried out.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I think that was a very foolish form of economy for many reasons.  The tourist industry, as was stated by Deputy Walsh, is a very important industry for this country.  It was not regarded, of course, as so important by the members of the present Government when they <Col N="821" /> were in opposition.  We know how they utilised it.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I, as an ordinary Deputy of the House, take objection to any curtailment of the debates on the Estimates in particular.  I object also to a number of Bills being thrown on top of the Estimates at this stage.  A number of these Bills could very well have been taken during the slack period of the year, last autumn.  I certainly consider that I would not be doing justice to my constituents in agreeing to any curtailment of discussion on the various Estimates.  Furthermore, an agreement that was reached in this House yesterday in connection with a motion has been flagrantly broken.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking of the road grants and how they affected us in County Galway, and I suppose that what happened in County Galway was typical of the whole country.  I pointed out also that, in my opinion, and in the opinion, I am sure, of nearly everybody, the policy of retrenchment in connection with the roads practised by the present Government when they attained office was an unwise one.  As Deputy Walsh pointed out, the tourist industry cannot be brought up to the standard at which we would wish to see it if the roads are left in a bad condition. <Col N="823" /> That is true.  The tourist industry some years ago did not appear to be of such value to the country in the view of members of the present Government. They used every conceivable occasion to make it appear that we had no interest whatever in the people of this country and that any interest we had was in foreigners.  I am not going to travel along those lines, but I am glad to see their change of attitude and change of heart in this matter. There is very little use in sending commissions to the United States or elsewhere to study the tourist industry and see what we should do to develop it if the roads of the country are left in their present state.  I am sure that the Minister will counter that by saying that we are getting a higher grant for the improvement of county roads than was ever given before.</P>
      <P>The fact of the matter is if we are to continue only at the pace which is possible on the existing grants it will be 40 years before the county roads, in my county anyhow, are brought up to the standard.  It takes £2,000 a mile and as we got £65,000 last year it would mean that 33 statute miles of roads could be surfaced and tarred.  Thirtythree statute miles are a very small fraction of the total mileage of county roads in County Galway.</P>
      <P>Another reason why I hold that it was a very unwise and foolish thing to reduce the road grants is that no matter whether it might be made appear not to interfere with employment, it certainly did.  It caused a considerable amount of unemployment and the emigration figures for the past two years would not be nearly so great if the present Government had continued the grants as they were given by Fianna Fáil&mdash;they might change the basis somewhat if they so desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday evening Deputy Childers made a very interesting contribution to this debate and it was remarkable how he went into this matter in detail. He seemed to have a thorough grasp of what he was speaking about and I do hope that the Minister will give his suggestions and ideas very serious consideration. After all, the question of the roads should not be a Party matter <Col N="824" /> at all.  It is a big national problem just the same as housing and it should be treated as such by every Party in the House.  The money spent on roads is money that will circulate in this country because generally the people who are employed on roads are not people who will go outside this country on holidays.  Consequently I would try to impress again on the Minister that he should give very serious consideration to this and fight his corner with the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There is a portion of road between Enfield and Kilcock on the main Dublin-Galway road and I am sure that any motorist who travels that road finds it a pleasure to drive on and perfectly safe for himself and all other traffic. If we had&mdash;as we should have as Deputy Childers pointed out&mdash;a plan on the lines of that portion of road as quickly as possible it would be a very great thing indeed&mdash;of course it could not come all at once and nobody expects that it could.  The continuation of that is something we want to look forward to.  I believe that the work should be started at both ends and at the centre as that would give employment along the whole route and the same, of course, applies to the other roads.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I wish to bring to the Minister's notice.  In 1947 we passed in this House what is known as the Local Authorities (Superannuation) Act, which meant, of course, that when employees of local authorities came to a certain age they would retire and get a pension; but it has proved in certain respects to be somewhat defective.  Perhaps it went through this House rather hurriedly as it was somewhat prior to the general election of 1948.  In my county there are a number of gangers who have been working for Galway County Council for anything from 15 to 35 years and they are deprived of the benefit of that Act by reason of the fact that they had not the prescribed number of days working for the county council.  In effect, however, they were working for the county council because the county council took over the supervision of minor relief schemes, rural improvement and bog development schemes <Col N="825" /> in our county, and I presume it was on the instructions of the Department. Our county surveyor generally put the most capable gangers in charge of these schemes and that broke the prescribed period of days in a working year.</P>
    <P>Now these people who have made application to be put on the register have been informed that because they were working in such a place from such a date to such a date they would not come within the Act.  Of course they will come within the Act if they continue for a further two or three years, but at the same time there are a number of them who are anxious to retire now and who have been anxious since the Act came into operation.  I hold that it is unfair to them and that the technical point should be got over in some way.  If it requires amending legislation I think that the Minister should do it.  I gave his Parliamentary Secretary the reply that was sent to one of these people.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, it has worked out satisfactorily in my county, because our engineering staff were very careful to undertake only works of a nature that would not cause damage.  They acted in a very careful way in that respect. In the roads estimate which has been presented to us, we find that receipts include an estimated sum of £60,000 which we are to get under that Act. I have no objection to its being credited to the roads, where it is utilised solely for the purpose of the improvement of roads, but, where it is used for the draining of land, it should not be credited to the Government grant we are getting for roads.  There should be some segregation there.  I should like the Minister to take note of these points I have made, the matter of the housing grant which has been cancelled, although the applicant got a certificate for a first instalment in 1949, and the matter of the gangers deprived of the benefits of the Local Authorities (Employees) Superannuation Act and that he will remedy them as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>If any Deputy who is also a member of a local authority <Col N="826" /> were to discuss everything he could discuss on this Estimate, he could speak at great length, but now that we have decided to make our points as quickly as possible, it is only right that I should be brief.  There are some matters in respect of which I very definitely find fault with the Department. I may or may not be as critical as Deputy Brennan was last night, but I want to point out that in many cases unnecessary slowness and red tape are holding up very important activities of local authorities.  My main cause of complaint is the delay in the payment of housing grants.  In the case of the individual builder, the small wageearner or farmer, with very little money in his pocket, who sets out to build a house and builds it solely through the goodwill of the building contractor or builders' supplier, who advances material without payment in many cases until the grant comes through, it is very unfair that there should be a delay of almost two years before the final payment is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be fair and agree that there must occasionally be delays.  Inspectors are asked to make reports as to whether a house has been finally completed and is being occupied, and during his tour of inspection, an inspector may try to examine half-a-dozen or a dozen houses in a particular area and may find that certain individuals have not moved into occupation of their houses.  That inspector must then report back that the owner is not in occupation, which involves delay in the payment of the grant.  There must, as I say, be delays; but there should not be unnecessary delays.  There is no need for a delay of 18 months or for anything more than three or six months, because the intention of every house-builder is to build his house as quickly as possible.  Nowadays, when building contractors have so much work on hands and houses are being built, in the main, of concrete block&mdash;and three or four good block layers can get a house almost sidewall high in two days&mdash;there is no reason for any inspector's report to the effect that a house is not ready for occupation within a certain time, and I hope that during the coming year the Minister <Col N="827" /> will speed up the payment of these grants, because the people who apply for grants want the money.  The money is very necessary and many houses would never have been built but for the generosity of the building contractor or supplier.  In my constituency and in every other constituency, these suppliers find themselves down by tens of thousands of pounds&mdash;they, in turn, owe money to the banks&mdash;because of the delay in the payment of these grants.</P>
    <P>Another point of criticism is the slowness in sanctioning schemes of waterworks and sewerage which are submitted with the best intentions in the world by the local authorities. There are a number of small-sized towns in my constituency, as there are in other areas, which are going to get the benefit of good water and sewerage schemes, and we have submitted on three or four occasions to the Department plans for such schemes for the different towns, but we find that, after almost a year, there is still no sign of any effort to start.  Sanction has been given in a couple of instances, but in other instances, it has not been given. In the case of Claremorris, a waterworks scheme was envisaged six years ago and we still do not know where we stand.  The same applies with regard to housing in that town.  I asked a parliamentary question six months ago about it and I was told there was no undue delay&mdash;in respect of a scheme started four and a half or five years ago.  I wonder what is undue delay in the mind of the Department?</P>
    <P>I realise the vast amount of work thrown on the officials.  During the war years all these schemes were left in abeyance, because, in a sense, it would have been foolish to carry them on&mdash;a number of houses might have been built and no one knew whether they might not have been knocked down the following week-end&mdash;and there is, as a result, an overload of this type of work on the Department's hands.  I feel, however, that the Department should adopt a system of giving a definite answer within a month or two months and of telling the local authority, as in the case of the Claremorris <Col N="828" /> housing and waterworks and sewerage scheme: &ldquo;You cannot go ahead with this work; we are not prepared to sanction it&rdquo;, or alternatively, telling the local authority to go ahead. The county council should not be left in a vague position about the whole business.  I think that would be possible. There is no reason why it should not be possible, because the more schemes of any sort which are stored in a Government Department the longer they are inclined to lie there and the less notice is taken of them. They may never be attended to until the secretary of a county council, on the advice of the councillors, gets in touch with the Department or until a Deputy representing the area raises a question in the House.  I hope that during the coming year more attention will be paid to these matters and a greater effort made to give speedy authorisation for going ahead with work of this kind.</P>
    <P>The building of subsidy houses by local authorities is going ahead and the biggest delay in many cases is the securing of the site or suitable ground on which to erect these houses.  I do not want to go into the question of proposed legislation but we will have a good move made in the near future. It will be possible to get inside the old demesne wall which kept out the local authority on many occasions and the landlord who obstructed the efforts of the local authorities will soon be upset.</P>
    <P>I have very definite encouragement and praise for the Department of Local Government in connection with the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I do not know why there is such desire on the part of the Opposition to spend so much money on roads.  I became a member of a county council in 1945 and for ten years prior to that I was a very close observer of the activities of the county council.  It was my opinion that money was being wasted on roads both pre-war and post-war.  I always maintained, and my colleagues on the county councils maintained, that less money should be spent on roads and that the money thus saved should be applied to more useful work.  The Local Authorities (Works) Act is one of the most beneficial pieces of legislation <Col N="829" /> ever introduced.  I am glad to say that the attitude of the Government and of the Minister for Finance is favourable to the implementation of such legislation, particularly in regard to drainage.</P>
    <P>At column 1890, Volume 121 of the Dáil Debates, the Minister for Finance, speaking on the Finance Bill, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On roads generally, although it is not a subject-matter for this debate, I would like to express a personal point of view.  As between devoting money to such a thing as reclamation of land, drainage of land, or the local authority type of work which is progressing under the legislation we brought in, I would be prepared to give £20 any time towards work of such a productive nature to the single 1/- that I would devote to road costs.  With regard to the restoration of the roads, that matter was considered and certain moneys were appropriated.  My information is that more money than what was expected to provide the full cost of the restoration has been spent.  I understand that the restoration programme has, in the main, been completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with that statement of the Minister for Finance.  It is statements like that we want to hear. When it comes to a choice as between devoting large sums of money to the restoration of roads or to the restoration of land, as far as we are concerned, we should see that the greater portion of the money would go to the restoration of fertility in the land.</P>
    <P>Our county has benefited fairly well, despite a slow start, under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  We favoured the spending of money on schemes under Schedule B, that is, drainage, because it is a wet county of very small holdings.  When we are getting free money we decided that we should spend as much as possible under Schedule B, or the land drainage programme.  During the winter months, when it was difficult to do satisfactory drainage, we proceeded as best we could.  Now, during the summer months, we expect, with the grants that have been allocated, to be able <Col N="830" /> to carry out very useful and beneficial work.  On one occasion, to allay the fears of many councillors on all sides that serious flooding would be caused by the opening of drains and allowing more water to flow into rivers from which the outfalls were not satisfactory, the county engineer pointed out that they were not allowing more water in, that they were allowing the same quantity of water to go in at a slightly quicker rate at the outset, but that when upstream was cleaned the amount that would flow would be practically the same as before, and would add only very little to the danger of flooding downstream.  We have proceeded almost entirely with Schedule B schemes.  It is very useful work.  I have always maintained that £1,000 spent on drainage is much more valuable than £1,000 spent on road work in providing employment, because, in drainage, all the money goes into the pockets of the workers.  It is amazing how much employment £700 or £800 will give over a period of months to a good gang of 15 men who will work continually.  The same amount of money devoted to roads would not provide as much employment because a great deal of it would be spent on the purchase of material and machinery. The position is entirely different in the case of drainage and similar schemes. One needs only picks, shovels and spades and men to work them.  The men are available.  There should be no complaint in regard to the expenditure of this money and no complaint is being made in regard to it by anybody in this House.</P>
    <P>We must maintain a certain standard of roads.  That is only fair to motorists who have such high rates of taxation on vehicles and petrol and of insurance. Motoring is a very expensive luxury when compared with the position in any other country in the world, with England, for instance, where the tax per horse power is much lower, or the United States, where the price of cars and the tax on petrol are negligible as compared with what they are here.  People with motor cars in this country are definitely entitled to a good-class road.  I make no secret of that belief.  There is a great distinction, <Col N="831" /> however, between a good, satisfactory road and a luxury road.  We can never have straight roads in this country.  We can never have the same types of roads which they have in other countries because our roads have grown out of a series of beaten paths in the country.  In the landlord days, in order to divide estates, they laid out paths and roads.  Later on these paths and roads were made into sanded roads, and from 1922 onwards they have been steam-rolled and tarred. The result is that we have the twisting, winding type of road, and we shall always have it.  No matter what Government might be in power and no matter what amount of money might be devoted to roads within the next five years, nothing whatever could be done about the twisting and winding. All that could be done would be an effort to widen a turn where there might be a dangerous corner so as to make it safer for motor traffic.  I would say that it would be impossible to straighten out 20 or 30 miles of road in this country at any time.  Therefore, we should try to make the best of the roads we have and bring them up to as high a standard as we possibly can.</P>
    <P>Another fault which developed in the earlier stages of our road construction was the desire to raise the centre of the road.  With regard to almost 90 per cent. of the roads at present, because of the amount of tar which has been spread over the centre in the course of a number of years&mdash;without any thought whatsoever being given to the sides&mdash;we have a round centre and that is most dangerous, particularly to horse traffic.  Very rightly, our engineers in charge of road construction have departed from that concept. Where new roads are now being constructed they are almost level from grass margin to grass margin.  Even if, in these circumstances, they should hold slightly more water than the roads which are round in the centre, they are much safer for traffic generally and particularly for horse-drawn traffic and the ordinary cyclists.  However, we had to lose in order to learn.  I think that if we could start again as we started in 1922, with the knowledge <Col N="832" /> which we now possess, our roads would be laid out in the proper manner.</P>
    <P>A useful project in operation in County Mayo at the moment with the approval of the Minister and his Department is the number of good class county roads which we are steam-rolling and tarring each year.  We started that programme last year and we did a lot of useful work.  These roads could not be described as main roads but they are very useful county roads.  We are able to do a very good mileage and to tar it at a very reasonable cost and this year we shall go ahead in the same way and we hope to be able to do the same amount of work as was done last year.  I think that we in our county have no complaint in regard to road restoration.  I know the roads of the county as well as anybody and there is no complaint whatsoever as to the condition of the main roads.  There is no complaint, except in very few cases, in regard to the condition of our county roads which are tarred and steam-rolled and there is great support and enthusiasm for the good work being done in respect of the taking over, steam-rolling and tarring of new roads.  We had no authority to do that until last year.  I hope that the programme will continue because it is, without a shadow of doubt, useful and beneficial work.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of rates.  Last year, a determined effort was made by every county council to hold the rates at their then level.  I do not know whether the National Ratepayers' Association were responsible for it or not&mdash;personally, I do not think they were responsible for anything.  I consider that that effort to hold the level of the rates was due to the commonsense of the county councillors in question. Many difficulties had to be faced. Everybody knows well that the demands made on the rates are now much heavier than what they were nine or ten years ago.  There are waterworks, sewerage schemes and other schemes which have to be financed by loan.  We have to repay the loan charges.  We have to repay the loans in respect of housing schemes.  We have to pay our assistants.  We have <Col N="833" /> to pay hospital bills for people who are too poor to do so themselves. These and other items tend to force an upward trend so far as rates are concerned.  That is where the county councillors find themselves in difficulties. I am glad to say that we in our county are able to forget Party politics: our sole concern is to do our duty by the ratepayers.  We succeeded in holding our own rates to last year's level.  Our county is heavily rated and we have to pay a lot of assistance and help a lot of poor people.  However, we succeeded in holding the rate and so did many other counties.  I hope that we will succeed again this year and that rates will be held at their present level.  The people are burdened enough as it is.  We are constantly hearing complaints about increases in rates.  We are reminded of the good old times when rates were only 7/6 in the £.  While people smile or weep, as the case may be, and remark that it was well to be alive in those days and that they had wonderful councillors and a good Government in 1914, 1915 and 1916, and so forth&mdash;and that the rates were only so high&mdash;they forget the many social benefits that have been introduced, are being introduced and must be introduced.  When I was a member of the Opposition I never complained about an increase in rates provided the money was put to good purpose and not wasted extravagantly. I was always opposed to extravagant expenditure on main roads.  I was always opposed to burdening the people just for the purpose of having 40-foot, 50-foot or 60-foot highways which are not necessary in this country and which should never be necessary in this country.  Now that an effort is being made to hold the rates in check and to spend money in the most useful way possible so as to achieve the greatest benefit, very useful work will be done and I hope that it will be allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal mostly with the housing problem in this country.  I think that the Minister and the Department and the people generally have not a proper idea of what is necessary at all, especially in places such as Dublin and Cork.  Some months ago, I asked the Minister a parliamentary <Col N="834" /> question and I was told that, according to a recent survey, 3,761 people needed houses in Cork and that it would take ten years to provide that number of people with houses.  I discovered that that survey was made in 1944 and, a few months later, I put down another question in connection with the matter and was told that there were 5,000 applicants for houses in Cork, that is, applicants for houses from the Cork Corporation.  The Minister and his departmental officials must be aware of the rate of progress in regard to the building of houses by the Cork Corporation&mdash;an average of 200 per year.  He can work out for himself how long it will take, at that rate of progress, to provide 5,000 houses for the present number of applicants for houses.  I suggest he should make a few trips now.  He has had a very pleasant time going round different parts of the country and opening housing schemes&mdash;sometimes of a very small kind.  I suggest that now he and some of his officials should take a walk around the slums of Dublin and Cork, and perhaps the two other county boroughs, and get an idea of the conditions under which the people are living in these places.  He should try to find out how many people who are married a few years and who are living apart.  He should try to find out how many families are living in overcrowded houses with their in-laws. He should try to discover what friction is caused between those young couples with young families and their in-laws, and get some idea of the continual disputes and arguments that are going on.  Find out how many people there are who have not even in-laws to live with and how many have to live in the county homes when their houses are condemned.  I think that would be very important from the point of view of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no hope for the majority of the present-day applicants for corporation houses in Cork City ever getting a house.  Some of them have their applications in for the past ten or 12 years.  I am not blaming the Minister for all this.  Most of it is the result of the legacy left us when the British got out of this <Col N="835" /> country.  A certain amount of progress was made by the two previous Governments, but it was interrupted by the war.  I am thinking, from the complaints I am continually hearing almost hour after hour in Cork, that we are not taking this matter seriously enough.  There are grown-up families, boys and girls of 15 and 16, living and sleeping in the one room, and I think that is all wrong.  It is a matter that other authorities should take serious notice of.</P>
    <P>I really believe, from what I see of building in the County of Cork, that if half of the forces at work providing houses in North, South and West Cork were concentrated in the boroughs, it would be much better.  No matter what the people in the rural areas may think, I believe there is not anything like the necessity for housing there as there is in the county boroughs, where people are living under scandalous conditions.  I am sorry to have to say that after 30 years of native Government.</P>

It all depends on the capacity of the building organisations in the area.  We cannot build houses because there is no one to build them in the city.  I would nearly go so far as stopping any other kind of building in order to house the people first.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell you that so far as the suburbs of Cork are concerned&mdash;and I said this in the presence of the Minister when he was down there some time ago&mdash;the South Cork Board of Health entirely neglected it <Col N="836" /> until within the last six months.  That is so far as the suburbs are concerned. I can tell Deputy Corry, as the Chairman of the South Cork Board of Health, that we have had to house numerous people from his area in the city because they happened to be working in the city and we felt we should house them.  There has not been a house built in the suburbs of Cork in ten years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out to Deputy Corry that it is more than ten years ago since they built them.  This matter is too serious for an exchange of views now between Deputy Corry and myself; we can have that going down in the train any day. I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the mentality of the Cork Corporation and the mentality of the person in charge of the Cork Corporation. The Minister was present when the Cork City manager said at a luncheon after opening the Ballyphehane scheme:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are matters we should consider such as finance, and then, should we build rapidly now and maybe have idleness after, or should we have a steady programme of building?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I was surprised that the Minister did not pass some remark on that. Probably as he was only a guest at the luncheon, he did not like to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Should we build rapidly now and have idleness after, or should we make steady progress in building?&rdquo; If that was the mentality behind the rate of progress in Cork for years, it only shows the position we are in.  That statement was published in the Press and it was made in the presence of the Minister. I know that houses will not grow and I know they take a considerable amount of trouble and organisation, but I think there should be a greater advance in Cork, at any rate&mdash; some serious effort to overcome the <Col N="837" /> desperate state of affairs that exists there.</P>
    <P>I now come to another matter, and this was mentioned by the city manager&mdash;finance.  In the Dáil on 16th May, the Minister for Finance, in Volume 121, column 50, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Take a house at an average price of £1,400.  The total assistance given in respect of the building of such a house is £765, excluding Dublin and Cork.  In Dublin and Cork the assistance given in respect of such a house would be £667.  The figures vary in relation to the cost of the house.  In the county boroughs, except Dublin and Cork, the total assistance given for a £1,000-house is £712.  In Dublin and Cork it is £667.  I do not know how anybody can expect anything more.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I thoroughly agree with the Minister for Finance, I do not know how anybody could expect anything more.  I put down a question to the Minister on 17th May asking what financial assistance did Cork get for houses built since 1945 for each financial year and what assistance was given to the four county boroughs.  I was informed that up to the financial year 1948-49 Cork built 182 houses and that they did not get one brass farthing by way of assistance from the Government. There was not a farthing offered to encourage housing in Cork.  I was told that Limerick built 148 houses and got £101,600 out of the Transition Development Fund.</P>
    <P>It was only by probing and putting down questions that I could get any information.  I asked more questions, and I was told that Cork could not get anything from the Transition Development Fund because they were awaiting final figures.  I was told that Limerick got about £40,000 for houses completed in March, 1950, but Cork could not get anything at all for houses that were actually occupied in April, 1946, four years previously&mdash;not one brass farthing.</P>
    <P>I was told that they could not get it because we had not the final figures. I am perfectly well aware that money was paid out of the Transition Development <Col N="838" /> Fund in many cases as soon as the houses were started.  I need not go outside County Cork for that.  The £400 was paid when the building of the houses was started, but in Cork County Borough we must wait for the final figures four years after.  I do not know whether we are going to get this or not.  After putting down several questions, I was informed one day that we were getting an instalment of £25,000.  We have 340 houses built that were occupied since the establishment of the Transition Development Fund. We have about 320 houses in the course of construction.  As regards the houses in course of construction, we should at least be getting half the grant in respect of them.  I contend that there is at least £200,000 due to the Cork Corporation at the present time, that is, if Cork is going to be treated the same as the rest of the country.  I do not think the Minister or anybody else expects the taxpayers in Cork to pay taxes and to give grants of £400 to the rest of the country and not get the same grants themselves.  If we assume that we are going to get these grants, I would like to know from the Minister who is going to be responsible for the payment of interest on this money that we should have got.  I put down a question about the overdraft and of how the Cork houses were financed.  I got a reply stating that the Cork Corporation was authorised to borrow by means of raising stock a sum of £400,000 for the financing of their housing schemes.  That was in December, 1948.  The reply went on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is understood from the local authority that at present the overdraft on the housing capital account is £125,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was after the instalment of £25,000 had been paid in to reduce it. I have got figures here with regard to the amount of interest that has been paid.  The figure is £14,939 4s. 2d., paid by way of interest on that loan and overdraft.  I want to know, if we are going to get our grants, are we going to get a refund of the interest that we have paid since, the interest that should be due to us for <Col N="839" /> these houses, 90 of which were occupied in April, 1946.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not know who is to blame. I certainly think it is not the business of an individual member of the corporation to go probing into things like this, to find out, question by question, what the position is, and to go and interview people who have had experience of the building of these houses and of getting paid those grants.  Why is there discrimination made as regards Cork?  I hope the Minister will tell me that, and also who is going to be responsible for the interest that has been paid on this money.  It is a terrible state of affairs that up to 17th May this year Cork had not got one brass farthing from the Department after all the talk of the Minister for Finance saying we were getting £667 a house.  I had to prove by way of question that that was quite untrue as far as Cork is concerned and that we did not get one farthing.  By persisting in asking questions we did get an instalment of £25,000.  This is a matter that I think would cover some of the finance that was spoken about at the luncheon at which the Minister was present.  I do not think it is the business of an ordinary individual to be probing into these matters.  I think there are people appointed and paid for looking after them, for checking them.  I hope the Minister realises the great injustice that was done to the people of Cork.</P>
    <P>I asked this question about Limerick:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will indicate how much of the sums of £15,000 and £86,600 mentioned in his reply to a question on 17th May, 1950, as being payments from the Transition Development Fund to Limerick Corporation, were referable to the 148 houses built in the financial years 1944-45 to 1948-49, and to what houses, giving the numbers, location and date of completion, the balance was referable and the amount of grant per house.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply I got from the Minister was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" />&ldquo;The reply to the first part of the Deputy's question is £59,200.  The balance of the sums referred to by the Deputy, namely, £42,400, was distributed as follows:</P>
    <P>(a) £40,000 towards a scheme of 128 houses at Ballinacurra, Weston, which was finally completed in March, 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Cork houses were occupied in April, 1946, and not a farthing was paid.  The reply goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount of the Transition Development Fund grant per house already paid is £312 10s. 0d.; and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>that is clear proof to me that an instalment had been paid on houses in the course of construction.  The reply concludes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;&mdash;&mdash; (b) £2,400 towards a scheme of 36 houses at Palmerstown, which was finally completed in May, 1949. The full grant of £400 per house has been paid.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to another matter.  I think the Minister should seriously look into it.  It deals with the rents of houses.  I put down this question to the Minister:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Local Government if he will indicate (a) the number of prosecutions during the past two financial years of corporation tenants for arrears of rent in each of the four county boroughs; (b) the minimum and maximum number of weeks' rent due in these cases in each area, and (c) the number of evictions carried out by each local authority concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reply I received was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The number of prosecutions during the past two financial years of corporation tenants for arrears of rent in each of the four county boroughs was:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> I want to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that people are prosecuted for as little as two weeks' rent and in Cork three weeks' rent.  In Waterford and Limerick they do not prosecute anybody who is in arrear for less than eight weeks.  I know it is easier to get two weeks' rent than to get two months' rent when the tenants go into arrear.  I know of cases, however, where people threatened with prosecution brought down the rent to the city hall and the rent was refused. The lord mayor asked me to draw attention to one case this week where a woman, the mother of nine children, had a clear book up to the month of May this year.  In that month, two of her children were confirmed and she had to let the rent go for two weeks. The rent collector subsequently, I take it on instructions, refused to take the money.  She went down to the county manager and he accepted it.  In the past fortnight she was preparing to go into hospital to have her tenth child. While she was away making arrangements the rent collector called.  On the following day she offered the rent and it was refused.  The city manager was away and the lord mayor accepted the rent from her and gave her a receipt for it.  He told the official in charge that he would hold him responsible if anything happened to the woman.  She got notice to quit.</P>
    <P>We have been told that the differential rent system will cure a lot of this. The Minister can take it from me that most of these things happen in cases where there are differential rents.  The county manager recently boasted to us of the prosperity of the people in the differential rent houses because the income from rents had increased so much.  I can assure the Minister that there are people paying rents who need the money very badly for the ordinary necessaries.  They know that if they do not pay the rent they will get short shrift.  I do not think that is the kind of attitude that should be adopted in these cases.</P>
    <P>During my inquiries in relation to Limerick, I asked for a few particulars there about houses.  I was told of six houses in Clancy Strand with an area of some 730 square feet, four rooms, a <Col N="842" /> bathroom and scullery, the rent of which is 7/6 a week; £400 was paid from the Transition Development Fund in respect of these houses.  I was told of six houses at Crosby Row, 780 square feet, the same number of rooms, bathroom and scullery, 17/- a week, exclusive of rates; 30 houses at Palmerstown, 633 square feet&mdash;observe the reduction in the floor area&mdash;four rooms, bathroom to be provided later, at differential rents ranging from 11/- to 30/- a week; 106 houses at Pennywell, 720 square feet, four rooms and a bathroom, differential rents ranging from 11/- to 30/- per week, inclusive of rates.  I do not know what the feelings of an industrious, hard-working man will be when he discovers that a tenant in Clancy Strand with an area of 730 square feet, ten square feet more than him, and, in the case of Palmerstown, 100 square feet more, when he is called upon to pay 30/- a week, while the other man pays a fixed rent of 7/6 a week and the man in Crosby Row 17/-.  Surely the Minister does not think that position can make for contentment amongst the tenants. Surely 30/- a week under a differential rent is out of all proportion.  We had such a scheme in Cork, and I heard Deputy Hickey say that the people were paying more than an economic rent for the houses.  I might point out that in that case the maximum rent was 18/6 a week.  I do not know what the differential rents are in other areas.  My object in these questions was to find out principally why Cork was neglected so far as the Transition Development Fund is concerned or any other financial assistance given for the building of houses.  That situation cannot make for contentment.  All these houses were built recently.</P>
    <P>As far as my experience of the Department goes, I have nothing but praise for the officials.  I have always received the greatest courtesy from the Minister.  We have known one another for a long time.  I might mention, however, that recently Cork Corporation applied to have a deputation meet the Minister in relation to the Transition Development Fund.  We were told that the Minister was not available. So far no arrangements have <Col N="843" /> been made for that deputation.  We were also told that the officials of the Department would have to meet the officials of the Cork Corporation first and go into the figures with them. There could have been no need to go into figures.  There was no need to go into figures in other places.  The Transition Development Fund moneys were paid in other areas just as soon as the scheme started.  I believe there is a necessity to go into figures in relation to the payment of contributions towards loan charges, but the £400 grant, as far as my information goes, was acknowledged as due to any local authority which had built houses for the working classes.  The Minister may not have been able to meet us. The lord mayor and I went over and met the officials, together with the city manager and city accountant.  We were not able to make any headway, and I was told by the secretary of the Department that we could not expect any finality in an interview like that. I agreed with him that there could be no finality when the Minister was not present.  It was a very short interview and we got no satisfaction.  We were asked to wait until the officials went into the figures.  We agreed to that, but I did ask how much of the £101,600 was given towards the 148 houses; £400 multiplied by 148 only amounts to £59,200.  I wanted to know what the balance was given for, and I was told that it was probably given for houses in course of construction. I had to put a parliamentary question in order to get the information, which was that the Limerick houses were completed in March and were paid for in the month of May.  I omitted to ask how many months previous to that they were paid for, but they had been paid for when I put the question down. The Cork Corporation did not get a penny for houses that had been completed in April, 1946.  The answer I got was that no claim for contribution was made from the loans fund and that payment from the Transition Development Fund could not be made until the final figures were given.  I think I can prove conclusively that other people did get the grants before the final figures were given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I have to follow in the same critical lines as the two previous speakers, on the position of housing.  Like Deputy McGrath, I have always received the utmost courtesy from the present Minister and his officials, personally and on deputations, but courtesy is of no avail to people in dire need of houses. There are 26,000 families living in tenement houses in Dublin or 28,500, according to the figures for 1938 given in answer to a question yesterday, and the Minister will agree with me that the position has not improved. Courtesy is of very little use to those people.  They are commencing to lose confidence in their public representatives as well as in the Government. We receive letters in reply to applications from people who, we feel, should get houses, on the lines that they are still &ldquo;dealing with families of six&rdquo; and we wonder what the position of the parents with one, two or three children is, and whether there will ever be any hope for them.  In a previous question to the Minister some two months ago, I asked if there was any hope for those people under the present rate of progress, whether they would ever be housed, and his answer was that my guess was as good as his.</P>
      <P>It is an extraordinary position and I feel that some of us are wasting our time in getting up here in Leinster House and voicing our criticism, giving our views, recommendations and suggestions to the Minister, when they are let in one ear and out by the other, and the Minister proceeds to-morrow and the day after to act on the advice of the officials and ignores the suggestions made by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago, in response to a request from his predecessor, the late Deputy Murphy, I suggested that, to relieve the appalling situation in Dublin and other big centres, smaller houses should be erected.  I suggested that a system could be adopted whereby a basic house would be erected first, that would suit small families and, as the families grew, a second and even a third storey could be built on.  The present Minister's predecessor gave that suggestion very sympathetic consideration, and I thought at the time that I was making progress.  The <Col N="845" /> objection to the suggestion in the start was that the people in Dublin deserved something better, when they did get a house, than just one storey or a three-roomed apartment.  I was not satisfied, so I called several meetings of the people in Dublin who were living in tenement houses and received their suggestions.  I had representatives from all Parties here attend such conferences and the people were not alone satisfied, but with open acclamation received the suggestion, as anything would be better than the conditions under which they were compelled to live.</P>
    <P>There were many excuses and explantations at the time, as to why this system of mass production could not be entered into.  Later, it was money or material that was the difficulty. Responsible people said that we had the money and material, but there was a shortage of labour.  The principal shortage there was of plasterers.  On behalf of the people who wanted houses, I suggested at a conference that we were prepared to accept the houses without plaster, as they would be more congenial and more hygienic than the present slums, where the plaster on the walls was 100 years old and now a breeding-ground for mice, cockroaches, wood-lice and other insects detrimental to the health of the family.</P>
    <P>My experience has been that, instead of any of those suggestions being adopted or entertained, a sort of frozen hostility to myself or anyone else who approved of what was termed revolutionary schemes was adopted. Anyone that I have recommended for houses to the Dublin Corporation, any families who are in a bad state, have not been facilitated.  I have received the customary polite reply: &ldquo;Your letter has been received and it will have sympathetic consideration&rdquo;.  On one occasion, when there was a slight change of officials, about last June 12 months, I received one letter here in Leinster House in reply to an application for one individual.  It asked: &ldquo;Will this man be prepared to take a house and be in a position to pay 22/6 a week&rdquo;?  I went over to the man's dwelling, climbed up four flights of <Col N="846" /> stairs and presented the letter and asked him about it.  He said he would be prepared to pay 22/- or even 42/- if he could get out of the place he was in.  He said: &ldquo;I was ordered out, by medical advice, seven years ago&rdquo;.  I wrote to the corporation, rung them up, and was informed on the phone: &ldquo;Well, do not hold us to a week or two; give us at least a month&rdquo;.  A year has passed by and this unfortunate individual has hobbled over to the corporation several times, to be told: &ldquo;Well, Deputy Fitzpatrick was wrong&rdquo;.  Seemingly I was wrong; there were no houses available in Sarsfield Road; they all had been occupied.  He was asked to try Donnycarney. There were over 100 houses vacant there, but they were being held for some other purpose, and so he was sent from Billy to Jack.  He has got no house yet, and I do not think he has a hope in the world that he will. I want to state that, due to the attitude I adopted on this housing question, anyone I recommend for a house has no hope of getting one.  I feel that to come in here and make a demand that is critical of the officials of this Department and of the Dublin Corporation is not in the interest of those who are looking for houses, and that we Deputies who are not on the corporation should keep quiet if we want to help the people that we represent. Until the position changes, I do not feel that I can do anything for those people.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the present Minister or his Department will not adopt what his predecessor asked for, some suggestions that would change the orthodox system of building houses, if they continue to build for families of six a certain type of house in Crumlin, Cabra, Donnycarney or Sarsfield Road.  They are all corporation houses.  Seemingly they must be that and anyone who goes along and passes by there, can see they are corporation houses.  There is no reason why the outward appearance and size should not be changed.  However, it is appalling that small families have no hope of getting a house.</P>
    <P>This morning I opened a letter, since I came into the Chamber, which is an <Col N="847" /> indication of the type Deputies receive possibly every day in the week.  It is:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No. 1 James Street (South Dublin Union).</P>
    <P>4th July, 1950.</P>
    <P>Dear Mr. Fitzpatrick,</P>
    <P>We were evicted from a condemned lodge on Saturday and this is the only place my child of five years and I could find a bed to sleep in.  It is a shocking state of affairs for an Irish mother, coming from a family that suffered so much for the old cause... I believed that we were due a house, being evicted from a condemned dwelling, but we must go into the union and my home is broken up and I am separated from my husband.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister or those responsible in his Department or the Dublin Corporation realise the conditions under which these people have to live.  I wonder if in the years to come they will make any change to give some hope to them.  They are not in a position to build a house for themselves or buy one, and have not the number of children required to put them on the list for a corporation dwelling.</P>
    <P>The number of houses built last year and the year before, I am glad to say, was in excess of the previous years. It has not yet reached the peak reached in pre-war years, but it seems to be developing in the right direction.  I must appeal to the Minister to find out from his officers if some system for small houses could be adopted, to suit small families and newly-weds, who could be changed when the family grows.  Where a man with two or three children is condemned to live in two rooms in a Dublin slum, some provision should be made, and could be made if we could force those responsible to give up working a system that was handed down from their predecessors.</P>
    <P>There is a lot more I could say, but I do not wish to waste the time of the House.  This is a deplorable position, and we come year after year with the same complaint, without any <Col N="848" /> great hope.  I hope the new Bill, which may come before the House this evening, will give hope to a certain section of the community.  We will offer it a welcome and be glad to see it come, though it will not provide for those who cannot put down a deposit.</P>
    <P>In a great number of houses there seems to be a system I cannot understand, whereby the family anxious to be house-proud and keep gates, doors and windows painted are not allowed to do so.  The corporation say it must be green paint or red paint, and if the occupant likes white paint he is not allowed to use it, as that seems to be a crime.  I cannot understand why there should be such a rule or regulation.  Any such old stereotyped regulation should be removed.</P>
    <P>As on previous occasions on this Estimate, I wish to refer to the traffic congestion in Dublin which, day by day and hour by hour, is getting worse.  Leave Leinster House at 5.15 and if you are lucky you will reach Nelson Pillar at 5.45.  If you are in a hurry and have a car, leave the car; do not take a bus, but walk.  That is the only possible hope of getting to the pillar at the peak traffic hour. Driving a car has become slow enough and also daily more dangerous.  I suggested a few remedies last year, but, like my suggestions on housing, they were not noted or were listened to and put off.  I suggested that some drastic action be taken to relieve the congestion in the centre of the city.</P>
    <P>We heard from the Parliamentary Secretary yesterday in reply to a question from my colleague, that there was under consideration the question of erecting a further bridge across the Liffey below Butt Bridge and a road at the back of the Custom House, coming from Amiens Street.  I suggest that if that is done, it will speed up the flow of traffic into the bottleneck in Pearse Street, where it cannot turn to the right into College Green.  It will be jammed in Pearse Street.  I have driven through that street at 5.30 and find the longest way round is the shortest way home.  Any suggestion of a new bridge and road from the far side would relieve congestion on the north side but would jam it completely <Col N="849" /> on the south side.  In the peak hours, coming from Pearse Street, College Street, College Green, D'Olier Street, Dawson Street, or Nassau Street, it is impossible to get through.  What is responsible for it?  I will have the courage to mention for the second time that what is definitely responsible for the jam in the centre of this city is Trinity College and the lawn attached to it.  Trinity College being the cradle of British imperialism here, it is heresy for any Irishman to get up and suggest that a tree should be pulled down there so that we might see where we are going or some railings or walls knocked down in case people who drive cars and pay for the right of driving them, people who believe they own this city which is the capital of the Republic, should dare to look over the walls of that college.</P>
    <P>Last year, when I made the suggestion in regard to this matter, the only support I got was criticism.  It was suggested that I should not have mentioned it, that it was heresy to mention such a thing, that, after all, those connected with Trinity were Irishmen, that they are entitled to their playground, that they are as good Irishmen as those who suggested they could go to the Phoenix Park to play.  While that plot of ground stands in the way of traffic regulation in this city, I shall, here or elsewhere, voice my objection to it. As a ratepayer who drives a car and pays for the right of doing so, I believe I have the right to be protected. There is no protection in this city at present.  At the peak hours, it is impossible for traffic to get through owing to the congestion.  I am not telling a story or trying to build up my case.  I came to Leinster House a couple of months ago from the north side and when I got to the front gate of Trinity College I saw two cars locked together by the bumpers.  That happens quite regularly in the city.  I did not take much notice of that, but when I came to the corner of Dawson Street I saw three cars locked together.  The Garda who was trying to regulate the traffic there held up the first car.  A second car, which was a military vehicle, bumped <Col N="850" /> into that and then another bumped into the second.  They were there quite a long time.  Yet the lawn of Trinity College, surrounded by its walls and railings, which should be used to relieve the traffic congestion, is regarded as sacred to the memory of people who wanted to keep Ireland within the British Empire and therefore should not be touched.  The Minister should have the courage to bring in legislation giving him power to take over the lawn of Trinity College and, instead of building bridges or making tunnels under the Liffey, try to relieve the traffic congestion by running two roads through the lawn at the back of Trinity College and use the space in between for a car park.  That would do a lot to relieve the traffic congestion which is growing in this city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick, I presume I have become hardened to having any appeal I make here fall on deaf ears.  However, I shall mention some of the more urgent problems that call for the attention of the Department.  Unlike Deputy Fitzpatrick, I have, fortunately, had some success in the matter of trying to procure houses for people who asked my assistance in the matter.  In the course of two and a half years as a Deputy, out of hundreds of people who have come to me for help in procuring houses, I have received letters on two occasions from people who thanked me for my efforts on their behalf and said they were successful in securing houses. Whether my efforts were responsible for that or not, I do not know.  Anyway, that is more progress than Deputy Fitzpatrick was able to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main contribution to this debate will also refer to housing.  As Deputy McGrath pointed out, on 3rd March last year there were 5,225 applicants for corporation houses in Cork. Taking those applicants as the heads of families and taking an average of four people in each of these families, we can assume that there are approximately 20,000 people looking for houses.  On the same day, the Minister informed me that the rate of progress of building in Cork in the current year was 120 houses for the <Col N="851" /> first half-year and 146 for the second half, making a total of 266 houses per year.  People who know the problem better than I do tell me that that is quite a reasonable rate of progress, having regard to the labour difficulties and the difficulty of providing money. It is poor comfort, however, for the people who are on the big waiting list to know that before they are provided for 20 years will have elapsed at the current rate of progress.  It is poor consolation to any public representative, be he a member of the Dáil or of a corporation or a council, to have to tell these unfortunate people that there are difficulties in regard to skilled labour and the providing of money.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan touched on the question of skilled labour and I think he did it in a bold manner.  There is a habit in this House to speak with reference to trade unions and other monopolies of that kind with bated breath, as a result of which all but very few public representatives are afraid to speak their minds.  So far as the bottleneck with regard to the admission to trades is concerned, I have a very definite view as to what should be done.  I think, as most other people think, that that bottleneck should be appreciably widened so that people who have had no relatives in a trade for a number of years should be allowed to be apprenticed to many of these trades.  By all means, there could be a safeguard for families who have had a monopoly of certain trades by ensuring that if any members of these families who are skilled tradesmen are idle none of a new category should be allowed to be employed. But, so far as the shortage of skilled labour is responsible for the slow progress in building, I think steps should be taken to open up the bottleneck and provide more skilled workers by allowing more young men to become apprenticed to skilled trades.</P>
    <P>We have had the cry for many years now that our universities are overcrowded. That is not due to the fact that the average person looks upon a tradesman as belonging to a lower social grade, but because a young lad going to school, who might normally <Col N="852" /> turn his attention in the direction of a good trade, finds he is not able to get into that trade, continues in school for a few more years and eventually finds himself in a university if he fails to get a job elsewhere.  I think that few Deputies will deny that many of those attending universities at present, if they had been lucky enough to get jobs earlier in life in trades or in business, would not have gone to a university. If they had succeeded in getting other employment, we would not have the problem of sending our professional men, doctors and engineers, etc., abroad.  I ask the Minister, as a staunch trade unionist all his life, in association with his fellow trade unionist Ministers, to give this problem his urgent, sincere and unfettered attention.  In that way he will be going a long way towards overcoming the shortage of houses which exists all over the country.</P>
    <P>As regards the type of people who are looking for houses, nobody will deny that the man who has a large family is entitled to first choice.  But, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out, there is another class of persons who have very little chance of procuring a house while those with large families are without them.  That is the young married couple who may have one or two children. I would urge on the Minister to introduce a system as a general scheme into all local authority houses, whereby a certain percentage of the houses would be allocated to newly-weds and young married couples.  A system has been in operation in Dublin&mdash;whether it is to be continued or not I do not know&mdash;of building a certain number of houses and distributing them by way of lottery amongst young married couples. I think that that system, whether operated by way of lottery or by providing a certain percentage of houses for these young people, should be applied generally.  The young man who at present is forced to live apart from his young wife should be given a chance of meeting his commitments to humanity.  I think that the present system, whereby a man and his wife have to live apart, is not only anti-social, but is anti-Christian.  Everybody <Col N="853" /> in the country is interested in the propagation of our people, but while this position exists, and is permitted to exist, I am afraid that, with the drain on population by emigration and the restraint put on it by these means, we shall never be restored to the position in which we had man-power in the country capable of utilising the resources of the country to the full.</P>
    <P>I would also urge on the Minister that, in most of his housing schemes, he should make some provision, if only by way of a vacant lot, for recreational facilities for people in newly-built areas.  I agree, by all means, that all the available man-power and materials should be utilised for housing at present, but it would not add to the difficulty of the problem to leave at least an area sufficient to permit children to play games and frolic around.  In one area I know well, where there is possibly one of the biggest housing schemes in the country, the Gurranebraher area in Cork, whether by accident or design, such a plot was left vacant.  The people of the district got together, formed various leagues and provided funds by various means, and the playground so provided is one of the outstanding amenities in the district where young men and children can play hurling, football and indulge in other forms of sport.</P>
    <P>Last year, I advocated the provision of swimming pools, and I am still of the opinion that, in built-up areas, particularly in large housing schemes, some provision should be made for swimming pools.  If they cannot be provided at present, at least a space should be left there in which they can be provided when the housing shortage becomes less acute.  It is folly to cover up square yard after square yard with houses and make no provision for the ordinary amenities that a modern community requires in the way of recreational facilities.  As I say, I am not advocating that money should be poured into it immediately, but at least the necessary vacant space should be left so that these amenities can be provided at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="854" /> Some time ago I asked the Minister if he had any request for a tenant-purchase scheme from Cork.  The Minister said he had no knowledge of any specific application.  I am aware that there is a movement amongst certain of the tenants, at least, to have a tenant-purchase scheme initiated.  People who have been paying from 15/- to 22/- a week for houses over a number of years would, I think, be prepared to pay a little more in order to put themselves in the same position as those who were a little better off and who were able to put down £100 or £200 each as an instalment towards the purchase of their houses from the local authority.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibilities of a tenant-purchase scheme and to announce his decision to the House, if he is able to make up his mind one way or another.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, since I became a Deputy I have had occasion to drive between Dublin and Cork almost every week and I could not help noticing the lack of progress in putting the highway into the condition in which it should be as one of the main highways in the country.  There is a stretch which I have particularly noticed between Cahir and Cashel, where certain very ambitious schemes are in progress, but in many parts of the roadway, which have been newly cut out and newly surfaced with some temporary dressing, I see the grass protruding.  I think that is a position that should not be allowed to continue. If the project was one that was worthy of being commenced, it should be worthy of being pursued to completion. I think Deputy Commons supplied the answer to that particular problem when he quoted the Minister for Finance, as reported in Volume 121, column 1890.  That was the reference the Deputy gave.  The Minister, in that statement, made some reference to the amount of money which was being poured into the maintenance of roads and said that it would be far better to devote the money to drainage and other schemes.  I presume it was in the course of the same speech that the Minister for Finance said that he feared too much money was being put into the roads.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> I do not know whether the Minister for Finance has to drive his own car and tax it at the present time but I would ask him and the Minister for Local Government to look at the position from the point of view of the ordinary person who is forced to drive a car in this country at present.  Even with a 10 h.p. car, the first thing a driver has to do is to pay £15 tax, apart from insurance.  I take as a typical example my own case.  In the course of my duties, perhaps intermixed with a certain amount of pleasure, I drive approximately 25,000 miles a year.  That represents a consumption of 800 gallons of petrol. According to a reply given by the Minister for Finance some time ago in the Dáil, the cost of petrol to the State or to the importers is something like 1/1 per gallon and the State gets something like 1/9 per gallon profit.  To anybody who makes up these figures, 1/9 a gallon on 800 gallons a year, it will be apparent how much the motorist contributes to the State annually for the purpose of keeping the roads in a fit condition to drive his car.  I am not going into the motion in regard to roads to any extent but I would ask the Minister to appreciate that point of view.  The motorist, first of all, pays £15 in taxes and he then pays from £30 to £80 in petrol duties, so that apart from ordinary rates and taxes, he has to pay between £50 and £100 for the privilege of driving his car whether for business or pleasure on the road.</P>
    <P>The last matter to which I wish to refer is the question of development associations.  I do not know what cooperation there is between the Department and the development associations that have been springing up all over the country recently, but I know, and I am sure the Minister does, that these development associations, apart possibly from being a little bit of a nuisance to his Department and local authorities, are performing a very useful function in the areas which they serve.  These associations are possibly the best form of voluntary effort any Minister for Local Government could have in the background. <Col N="856" /> In Cork we have some, largely concentrated in the suburban areas.  We have one in Bishopstown, Spangle Hill, Blackrock, Ballinlough and Gurranebraher.  We have about ten associations altogether.  These people have got together for the sole purpose of advancing the amenities of their own district, making the residents aware of the value of developing the districts for their own enjoyment and trying to instil into the young people a certain amount of civic spirit and pride.  I would ask the Minister to hearken more to the appeals of these associations.  They are not looking altogether to the Department to provide everything they want.  The Minister must know that there is a large degree of self-help among each of them and in his future dealings with them I would ask him to give them all possible assistance, because, in nine cases out of ten, at any rate, I know that there is a certain percentage of local contribution for the purpose of providing whatever amenities they require.</P>
    <P>To revert to roads for a moment, many Deputies have complained in this House over the past couple of years of the reduction in the grants that they have been getting from the Department in their respective counties.  I would like to register a complaint on behalf of the constituency I represent: In the last year of the last Government's administration £16,000 was provided for road maintenance and repair; since this Government got into power, not one penny has been provided for a similar purpose. That does not mean that the roads and streets of Cork City are in such excellent condition as to require no contribution from the Government. There is a very heavy charge on the rates in Cork for that purpose.  Many of the roads and streets are in such condition as to require immediate attention, and I would ask the Minister to provide at least as much money as his predecessor provided to keep the roads and streets of Cork in proper condition and not to leave them as they are at present in such a condition as to be dangerous not only to horse traffic but to pedestrian traffic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate the two principal matters which came under discussion were housing and roads.  On the question of housing I have very little to say, except to support the statements made in reference to the figures given by the Minister showing that in 1947-48, 729 houses were built; in 1948-49, 1,871, and in 1949-50, 5,299.  The average individual outside reading the Press reports of this Dáil meeting will receive the impression that this great increase from 1947-48 to 1949-50 was all due to the work of the Department under the Coalition Government.  Of course, we all know that the schemes by which those houses were built had all been initiated under the Fianna Fáil régime.  While in the county for which I am a Deputy we have not made the progress anticipated, the Minister, in advocating the system of the erection of houses under the Labourers Act and the erection of houses in urban areas last year, held up the direct labour scheme carried out by County Wicklow to local bodies as an example to be followed.  I can assure the Minister, however, that even we in County Wicklow who are responsible for that all-glorious scheme have not made the progress anticipated by those upon whose shoulders fell the responsibility for the organisation of housing throughout the county and I am not surprised at that. I can say that we have made fairly good progress, taking into consideration all the factors that militated against a big drive, largely the dearth of skilled tradesmen.  At the same time, I think that that scheme has never proved itself to merit all the praise it received from the Minister and his Department when it was held up to other local bodies throughout the country in order to influence them to adopt direct labour methods for the erection of houses.</P>
      <P>References have been made to the difference not alone in cost, but in quality of the finished article between direct labour and contract houses.  I have heard people expressing views on that subject, and I believe that they know nothing about it at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the cost of houses is concerned, we in County Wicklow are on practically a 50-50 basis, so far as direct labour and contract building are concerned.  The claim that you get a better finished article under the direct labour system than under the contract system, I suggest, is all boloney.  If the contractor can get away with anything, it is the funeral of the engineers, the clerk of works and those responsible for seeing that the contractor carries out the job in accordance with the plans and specifications submitted and they should not be in their jobs.  On the other hand, in cases where the last word in the matter of quality is expected, it is well within the bounds of possibility that the material may not go into a house which would go into it where a contractor is operating.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the housing committee of Wicklow County Council and we are building close on 500 cottages under the Labourers Acts.  The scheme was initiated in 1946 and was started late in 1948.  Our attention was drawn by the Minister to the methods which should be adopted in the carrying out of the scheme under the direct labour system in relation to the filing and collecting of costings, and the Department even went to the extent of allowing the council to appoint an extra official in the person of a costings clerk to keep records of all the moneys expended on labour, materials and otherwise, so that the costs would be available to the Department and, I presume, to the members of the council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the scheme of close on 500 cottages, 110 or 120 have been completed, some of which are single and some double cottages.  Influenced by the fact that the Department insisted on proper costings being kept, I repeatedly asked at the housing committee meetings for information as to the cost of a particular cottage.  I maintain that, with this official and the general staff, professional and otherwise, whom we are paying, if any member of the county council at any time asks for the cost of a particular cottage&mdash;naming the cottage&mdash;if the officials are carrying out of the instructions <Col N="859" /> of the Department, they should be in a position to give the required information.  I have repeatedly asked for that information and I am still awaiting the information as to the cost of the particular cottage.  I will not get the information.  What I will get is the average cost of a number of cottages which may be distributed over an area three-quarters of a mile or a mile from a central point.  They bulk in ten or 11 cottages and give the average cost.  I maintain that that is not carrying out the instructions of the Department.  The county engineer, the county manager or any other official should be able to tell any member of a local body, if he asks for it, the cost of a particular cottage in a particular townland.</P>
    <P>When I argue that that information should be available, I find that the officials concerned consider that, in looking for that information, my attitude is absurd, that it could not be given and that I, as a building contractor, do not keep accounts to that extent.  Of course, I do.  If I am building a house at a particular point and another house three-quarters of a mile away, I know what goes into one house in a particular townland as I know what goes into the other house, and I know what time it will take to carry out certain works in one or the other.  If it takes any more than I think it should, I will make inquiries why that is so.  In this case, we have timekeepers, storekeepers, clerks of works, local engineers, assistant engineers and county engineers, and still we find that, when a member of the local body asks for information as to the cost of a particular house in a particular townland, he cannot be given it, but will be given instead the average cost of a number of houses spread over a radius of one, one and a half or two miles.  I could not get that information.  A very responsible official was prepared to argue the matter with me and considered that my attitude in looking for that information was unorthodox.  I asked him why it could not be given.  They had timekeepers.  The time-book would show the time given in the respective trades and unskilled labour.  There <Col N="860" /> were storekeepers who could indicate where the cement went and the amount of timber, tiles and other materials that went to each cottage.  While all that information is there, I could not see why I could not get it.  What am I told?  That the material goes out from the store in the lorry for two, three or four houses, that that is the check. There is no check.  I told them that. It was tantamount to telling me that there was no check on each particular house as to the amount of material that went into it.  It would take an average of 12 tons of cement to erect a house.  There is no guarantee that 12 tons went to a house.  &ldquo;Jerrying&rdquo; can be done in direct labour, but if the engineers responsible to the county council carry out their work properly, the contractor cannot carry out any &ldquo;jerrying&rdquo;.  I will say no more on that point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasBrennan" hpid="Mr. T. Brennan Mr. T. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I use the word &ldquo;jerrying&rdquo;, I mean that the materials may not go to a particular house, but could go somewhere else.  One house could get more than another.  The possibility is there.  It cannot happen in the other case if the engineers are carrying out their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the allocation of tenancies, I agree with the remarks made by Deputy Tom Walsh and Deputy Beegan.  A scheme having been initiated, applications having been invited for cottages, the inquiry where necessary having been held, naturally the applicant would expect that, when the particular cottage for which he applied is built, he would get it.  I can assure the Minister that the memorandum in regard to the new regulations for the allocation of houses came as a bombshell to the County Wicklow Housing Committee.  It must be admitted that the regulation was there under a certain Act, but it had never been put into operation.  Why introduce it now?  I have no objection to the principle, but where an individual applies, in response to a public advertisement, and has got a voluntary site from a farmer, it is altogether wrong that he should not be given <Col N="861" /> the cottage when it is built, irrespective of whether there are other people who, in the opinion of the Minister or the Department, are in need of houses or not.</P>
    <P>Let me draw the Minister's attention to this fact.  Lately I have attended housing meetings in certain areas where there was a big demand for house.  People were invited to attend and to make their case.  One would be surprised at the number of people who are looking for houses.  When you ask them did they make a application under the 1949 scheme&mdash;which is a supplementary scheme to the 1946 scheme&mdash;they say &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  These are the people who are clamouring for houses, and yet they will not take advantage of the opportunity that is given to them to make application. Then they expect the council to be in a position to provide them with a house right away.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not insist on the regulation governing the allocation of cottages being carried to its logical conclusion, at any rate, in cases where schemes had been initiated and were in progress, and persons had applied before the Minister decided to issue that particular memorandum to the local bodies.  I hope I have made clear to the Minister what I have in mind. I have no objection to the regulation in general.  I admit that it is the most deserving people who should get houses but we are placed in the very awkward position, where a voluntary site is in question, that the farmer concerned would not have given that site but for the fact that he had a certain amount of respect for the applicant and was confident that he would treat his property respectfully.  He would not have given it voluntarily to some other individual but would have insisted on his rights and would have put the council to the trouble of an inquiry.  I do not wish to labour that point at length.  I think I have made it clear to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I think it was a mistake that the grants for main roads were not continued. The Minister will agree, I think, that the roads deteriorated during the emergency period and that deterioration set in when the amount <Col N="862" /> of traffic that it was possible to have on the roads was very light, when there was no motor traffic worth talking about.  I think the Minister will admit that the work done during 1946, 1947, 1948 in resurfacing main roads was a very good job.  It is a pity that it was not completed.  Within the past few years the demand made on our main roads and on our county roads, due to the enormous increase in motor traffic, is something that I do not believe either the Minister or his Department contemplated would occur within such a short period of time.  If we are to keep our main roads up to anything approaching a decent standard we shall be compelled in the immediate future to carry out a certain amount of maintenance work on every square yard of them in the country not every two years or every three years but annually.  The position is becoming more acute every day.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies must be aware of the condition of the county roads in Wicklow.  I heard a Deputy from Mayo speak on this Estimate and he gave the impression that the county roads in Mayo are very good.  He is lucky&mdash; and so are the farmers in that county&mdash; if that is so.  I regret that I cannot say the same of County Wicklow.  We have roads there which are in an extremely bad condition.  How the local authority is going to meet all the clamour which has been going on for the past 12 months and the demands of representatives from every area of the county to have something done to the roads in their respective areas I do not know.  Certainly the local authority will not be in a position financially to meet the cost.  Therefore, the Minister or his Department will have to take some steps to provide moneys for the purpose.  There is hardly a consecutive meeting of the Wicklow County Council at which we do not have a deputation or deputations from different areas demanding further expenditure and demanding also that further work be carried out on the county roads.  Something will have to be done about the matter.  I believe that the best possible method has been adopted by my county with regard to the distribution of the <Col N="863" /> amount of money allocated.  How far it will bring us towards the objective which we should all like to attain as far as our roads are concerned, I do not know, but I must say that I am afraid it will not bring us very far and that, as some of the Deputies have said to-day, we shall be all dead and gone before some of these roads are improved.  Something should be done and done at once.  All those county roads lead to the approaches and residences of the largest section of the community in this county and of the people who pay a large portion of the rates of the county.  Something should be done to satisfy those people by giving them decent approaches to their residences and to satisfy them that it is not our job alone to cater for the big motorists and the other types of individuals who use the main roads but that we have an obligation also to that section of the community which is the mainstay of the whole lot&mdash;the farming community.  How it is going to be done I do not know, and I cannot make a suggestion, but I am only too well aware that something needs to be done and done immediately because there is a general outcry from the people who are affected.  The ratepaying community are not able to meet anything approaching the financial demand necessary to carry out the work. All we can do is to suggest that we pass it on to the Minister and the Department to see what they can do in connection with the matter.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion I can make in connection with county roads.  When the Local Authorities (Works) Act was first being operated the Department asked the county councils to prepare and submit schemes for the carrying out of necessary works such as the cleaning of rivers and so forth which rivers, during an abnormal period of rainfall, are responsible for the flooding of roads or are a danger to other property of the county council.  There was also provision for the cleaning of rivers in order to prevent the flooding of land.  That scheme is all right.  It was anticipated that it would be very helpful.  While that Bill was going through this House it received a certain <Col N="864" /> amount of criticism from Deputies on this side of the House but I think time has proved that that criticism was not altogether sabotage on our part. Time has proved that it was not criticism for the purpose&mdash;as has been stated down the country, and elsewhere&mdash;of holding up the passage of the Bill.  Be that as it may, schemes were prepared and one scheme, which was referred to by Deputy Cogan, was in connection with the Derry River in that portion of my constituency in which I live.  I heard Deputy Beegan pay tribute to the work carried out in County Galway under the Local Authorities (Works) Act and I heard Deputy Commons pay a sort of a tribute also.  While we all&mdash;certainly in my own case&mdash;are prepared to commend any scheme which will give employment, I must say that I am very particular in regard to the manner in which public moneys are expended.  We were told, and as a matter of fact the statement was broadcast, that the grant was to be a 100 per cent. free grant.  It was a 100 per cent. free grant so far as the ordinary ratepayer was concerned but we all know that the money has to be paid back.  Therefore, it is public money which is being expended and there is nothing free about it.  When we come to the expenditure of public moneys such as these, it should be the responsibility of every officer on the professional, administrative and technical side of the job to ensure that not alone should the idea of giving employment be taken into consideration, but also the results that are to accrue in the interests of a community as a whole.</P>
    <P>We had a very big scheme on the Derry River.  The outlay on it from November or December, 1949, up to March or April, 1950, must have been in the region of £20,000 or £24,000.  To expend such a large sum of money, steps other than those that were taken in the early stages of the scheme should have been taken.  A scheme was submitted, and immediately it received the sanction of the Minister the work started on this river without a proper survey being taken and without any discussion with the representatives of the engineering sections in County <Col N="865" /> Wicklow and in County Carlow, the counties through which the river passes before it enters the Slaney. This work was rushed and, because of that fact, I came to the conclusion long ago that the principal objective in having that scheme put into operation was to get men employed.  &ldquo;Put men on the job, irrespective of where you get them, and later on we can talk about whether a survey was carried out or whether the scheme will be any addition to the land concerned or the roads and bridges that are involved.&rdquo; When I speak about this particular scheme, I am not doing so with any personal motives, but merely in the best interests of those who will eventually pay through the nose.</P>
    <P>There is one particular piece of road which was affected heretofore by an abnormal rainfall and there was a certain amount of flooding caused. Knowing this road, and knowing what could happen there on a dark winter night, I would be prepared to go to a lot of expense to ensure that the flooding of that road should be prevented as far as possible.  I think even to carry out that job it was not necessary to undertake the big scheme that was undertaken on the Derry River. It cost £20,000 or £24,000 to drain it from its source.  If there was any possibility that I could see of reaching finality with regard to that scheme, I might not be inclined to speak so strongly.  I was down there only a fortnight ago and, having walked over certain areas there, I got up on one of the heaps of muck or gravel, or whatever it is that is thrown there.  I had a bird's eye view of the whole scheme and I must confess&mdash;and I think I am one who can visualise the intention of any engineer or engineers in a lay-out &mdash;that the whole thing to me was a jigsaw puzzle.  I could not say what is going to happen or what is the intention.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying I would like him to inform us what is his intention with regard to the completion of that scheme.  Will he take any steps to ensure that both County Wicklow and County Carlow will play their part in ensuring that the money expended on the work that has been carried out on the Derry River will <Col N="866" /> not be regarded as wasted money because of the failure on the part of either council to carry out its obligations? I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether he intends to make a creamery stop at Carrigeen, Headford, County Kerry, where 20 new suppliers, who live three miles from the nearest creamery, are awaiting facilities.</P>

      <P>The Dairy Disposal Company have, at my request, made a survey of the Headford area of County Kerry and have informed me that it would not be practicable for them to arrange for a travelling creamery stop at Carrigeen as suggested.  This area is within three miles of the company's cream-separating station at Bealnadeega and just over three and a half miles from their separating station at Clohane.  A new stop there would <Col N="869" /> attract only about 12 new milk suppliers. I would suggest that these farmers should co-operate in making arrangements for the conveyance of their combined milk supplies to the nearest separating station, as is at present being done by farmers in many other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The taxes chargeable on the profits of a company carrying on business in this country are income-tax and corporation profits tax.  There are reciprocal double taxation relief arrangements in force between this country and Great Britain which provide for the treatment, for taxation purposes, of the companies of one country which are carrying on business in the other country.  Under the Residence Agreement of 1926 (as amended by later agreements of 1928 and 1947) a company managed and controlled in Great Britain is exempt from Irish income-tax.  Such a company is, however, chargeable to Irish corporation profits tax here in respect of its profits arising in this country.</P>
      <P>I might add that a company managed and controlled here is exempt from British income-tax.</P>

      <P>As the reply to the Deputy's question is in the form of a tabular statement I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the reply:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The question refers to &ldquo;goods received from U.S.A.,&rdquo; and the reply therefore excludes commodities delivered to Ireland during 1949 under E.C.A. procurement from countries other than U.S.A.</P>
      <P>In view of devaluation of sterling in September, 1949, and of the fact that the date of delivery of goods and the date of payment therefor do not necessarily coincide, it would be impossible, without a detailed investigation, for which staff cannot at present be spared, to determine the exact sterling equivalent of the dollar cost of the commodities shown in the tabular statement.  Accordingly, the price is shown in United States dollars according to the bill of lading cost of the goods as recorded in my Department.</P>
      <P>The quantity is given in column 2 in all cases in which sufficient information is available in the Department.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware, of course, that, in regard to <Col N="872" /> trade unions and other matters, there has been considerable difficulty in regard to the principle involved in this question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter with regard to the banks has been under consideration by at least two commissions, already established, which have made reports.  I do not entirely accept the full content of these commissions' reports in regard to every matter.  I am not convinced at all that the implications that are in the Deputy's question are real, that is to say that there are serious national problems arising out of this fact.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to workmen <Col N="873" /> employed by the contractors to the Commissioners of Public Works in the Dublin area.  It is incorrect, however, to refer to them as having been dismissed; their services were terminated because, as casual employees, their retention depended on the nature and duration of the work for which they were taken on.  The replies to the Deputy's questions are as follows: (a) 14; (b) five; (c) 12 months; (d) seven months; (e) preference for employment is given to men who have had certain service in the Defence Forces and men, with military service in the period 1916-23, who have been granted active or general service medals.  I am not aware that any of the men in question who may be eligible for preference accordingly have been refused re-employment.  I may point out, however, that the engagements of all the men covered by the question were purely temporary and gave no claim to continued employment or re-employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that some of the men who were not re-employed got a Christmas box in Christmas week and dismissal?  The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that the average period of employment was seven months.  Is he aware that one man out of the number on whose behalf I am speaking was engaged for 18 months, and was not given any explanation as to why priority was given to people with shorter service?</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that a man who was in employment for 18 months was dismissed, or let go, shall we say, through redundancy; it is all the same to him.  He subsequently got a letter to report for work in February and when he went down in February he was asked for his discharge papers.  The only discharge papers he had were from Brixton prison and the Curragh. He was told to go about his business. He cannot get employment here.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the cash allowances payable under the Infectious Diseases (Maintenance) Regulations, 1948 and 1949, to persons suffering from tuberculosis.  The regulations governing the payment of allowances provide for slightly higher rates of allowance in the case of beneficiaries resident in the four county boroughs in recognition of the fact that the cost of living generally is somewhat higher in those areas than elsewhere in the country.  The disparity, however, between the rates of allowances payable in county <Col N="892" /> boroughs and those payable elsewhere does not necessarily involve payment of allowances at lower rates to persons resident immediately outside the county borough owing to the discretion in regard to abatement vested in health authorities.  If the Deputy is aware of any specific case in which there appears to be any hardship in the circumstances he describes I shall be glad if he will bring it to my notice and I have no doubt that a satisfactory solution of the difficulty can be found.</P>

I would go even further and invite the Minister down to the boundaries of practically three counties to see for himself the work that has been carried out there.  I know that two responsible officers from his Department have been there already and I presume that the Minister has had a report on the scheme.  I should be thankful if the Minister could see his way, in replying, to give the House an idea of what those two officials thought of that job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is surely responsible as he sent the grant.  That is the information we have.  At that point we now have a pool of water of a depth of nine or ten feet.  There is a block of solid material parked at a <Col N="894" /> portion of the bed of the river where it flows into Wexford and Carlow.  We have an underground weir of six or seven feet at which point the water must rise to that point before it starts to flow.  We have a first-class swimming pool and what ran through my mind when I saw it was that it was an approach to the proposed blue lagoon.</P>
      <P>I believe that the moneys expended will not give the results desired.  I believe that with far less outlay it could have relieved the flooding on the road to which I referred and on some of the land.  Agreed, its only redeeming feature was that it created employment and I believe that that was the ulterior motive.  Unfortunately it created such a position that men who had spent years working with farmers took a job there.</P>
      <P>Now that the major job is complete the men can get no further employment. The farmers do not want them as they have found out that they can do without them.  From the point of view of the people who left constant jobs thinking that this job would hold for a number of years, some of them looking upon this job as a gift, it has had repercussions and it will not return the kudos which, in my opinion, it was intended to return from the point of view of employment.  I maintain that if the larger portion of the money expended on that river had been diverted to the construction and maintenance of county roads in the same area it would have given practically the same amount of employment.  It would have relieved the county council and we would have been in a position to state that we were meeting the wishes of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the actual work itself, I disagreed with the method adopted apart altogether from the cost.  The existing banks had a growth over numberless years of heavy sedge, small alder trees, sally trees and other trees, the roots of which had integrated with the banks, thereby reinforcing them against abnormal flooding but now all those trees have been cut and the raw banks are exposed.  We had a very mild winter and had yet no test but eventually we are bound to have one and I believe that these banks cannot <Col N="895" /> stand up to the waters of a heavy flood with the result that portion of them will be eaten away and more ground will be lost.  I might also mention that there have been complaints about fencing along the banks where trees have been cut.  They all formed a sort of fence but now that the banks are exposed and the water is down to a certain depth the farmers are asking protection for their cattle, involving further expense on the council.</P>
    <P>That is all I have to say on the matter and I hope that whatever moneys have been expended up to the present&mdash;a fair amount according to the returns I have received&mdash;will not be wasted and that the Minister will see that the job is completed to ensure that and at the same time to give the farming community some little relief when there is heavy flooding in the area.</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry laboured under a sense of grievance with regard to a certain motion.  I think he understands the circumstances better now.  He did state when he intervened in this debate before that he confined himself to the question of roads, the charge therefor and expenditure for them.  In view of the circumstances and of the fact that he did not refer to any other aspect of this Vote, I am allowing him, without at all creating a precedent, to intervene briefly on other aspects of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for your indulgence, Sir, because there were a number of matters to which I wished to refer but to which I did not refer when speaking earlier.  The first of these is the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I notice that there is a sum of £1,750,000 set aside this year under that heading.  I am aware that at present the county engineers under the Cork County Council are paring down as between one approved scheme and another because they received notification that only a certain amount would be given.  I want to notify the Minister that Cork county's rightful share of that money is £300,000 and we are not taking any less.  The Minister <Col N="896" /> can regard that as an ultimatum or as anything else he likes, but, if there is a sum of £1,750,000 to be given, Cork County is entitled to £300,000.  I am grateful for the manner in which this money was given last year and I can assure the Minister that not £1 of it has been wasted.  I am sorry that the money about which Deputy Brennan has been complaining was not sent our way, because we could find good use for it.</P>
      <P>I have a complaint to make with regard to what I consider to be cheeseparing on the part of the inspector sent down by the Minister, cheeseparing which is particularly noticeable in relation to the Midleton-Dungourney River, which was cut down to £4,000 odd.  The county surveyor assures me that that sum will not enable us to lower the bed of the river and unless the bed of the river is lowered, drainage will be very little use.  I should like the Minister to get his engineers to have another run over that river.  There is also the position with regard to the Youghal sea wall.</P>
      <P>My colleagues, Deputy O'Gorman and, I think, Deputy Keane, are deeply interested in this wall, as am I.  That is one of the schemes&mdash;a scheme relating to thousands of pounds' worth of property which, together with the public road, is in danger&mdash;which should be first approved by the Minister, and I hope there will not be any further delay.  I have already raised the matter by question and I do not want to have to raise these matters in the House, if it is possible to avoide doing so.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Gorman was anxious about the Youghal bridge.  I am also anxious about that bridge and I can assure the Minister that, so far as the local authority is concerned, there will be no delay.  I hope that there will not be any delay on his side, as I am sure there will not be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must complain about the delay in the payment of housing grants.  As was pointed out by Deputy Commons, people who are endeavouring to build houses, particularly for themselves, to-day are in very poor circumstances, people who are undertaking something which, in the ordinary course, they <Col N="897" /> would not undertake, having been tempted into doing so by the flaithúil grants given by the local authorities, in the first instance, and by the Department in the second.  They find themselves held up because the suppliers of building materials cannot be expected to keep them on their books all their lives and this delay of six, nine and, in some cases, 12 months is ridiculous and should not take place.</P>
    <P>I got a reply to a question yesterday with regard to the purchase of cottages in the North Cork area.  It is not my health area, but I am amazed that cottages can be put through and vested in South Cork within a six months or a 12 months' period, whereas cottiers who applied for vesting in 1944 in the North Cork area are not yet vested.  If there is any position more ridiculous than that, I do not know what it is.  I cannot blame the Minister for the whole of it, because the fellow who applied in 1944 had a taste of the former Minister for Local Government before the present Government took charge of him.  The idea of an unfortunate man seeking to own his house under an Act passed by this House, applying for that purchase in 1944 and in 1950, six years after, still held up by, moryah, legal difficulties.</P>

      <P>North Cork.  There are apparently some 30 of these cases.  The ratepayers of the county have still to pay for the repairs of these cottages, which is a rather hefty bill, and these people are deprived of the reconstruction grant, if they want to add a room and are also deprived of their water supply under the new water supply scheme, so that I urge the Minister to get rid of whatever delay there is and to get rid of it quickly.  I do not wish to trouble him by asking questions about these matters, but I <Col N="898" /> can assure him that I have received serious complaints from that area in this connection.</P>
      <P>I want to refer also to the delay in the Department in regard to sanctioning housing schemes.  For one reason or another, or on one excuse or another, the scheme at Ballynoe, Newtown, Cobh, a direct labour scheme, was held up for some six months.  A letter was sent down to-day looking for this and another letter to-morrow looking for that and a third letter later looking for something else, and, in the end, I, as chairman of the board, which wanted to get the houses built, had to move that they be advertised for public tender.  They are now being built by contract.  I am speaking on this matter as one who favoured building by direct labour if it was at all possible, but I became so disgusted with the attitude of the Local Government Department, with all the queries that went backwards and forwards and all the red tape, that there was no alternative but to get them built by contract.  If that is the attitude of the Department towards the direct labour system, it would be better if they said frankly that they did not want it, and be done with it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Rockgrove housing scheme, the scheme for these houses was sent up to the Department of Local Government about three years ago.  We then entered into an agreement with the Minister for Defence for the purchase of the site and the next things we knew was that the refugees arrived and were shoved in there.  When we got the all-clear, we immediately set to work to get the reconstruction of the houses started.  Then we got a letter from the Department of Local Government complaining that certain facilities were not there.  The site of these houses is within 50 yards of the railway station that has 11 trains each way each day and passing by is a bus service of 11 buses each way each day.  That would give facilities enough for people who, in the main, would be employed in Cork City, the suburbs of Cork or Cobh.  A school and churches are within about three quarters of a mile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we got the reports from the <Col N="899" /> inspector, we wrote to the Department and told them to send him along to us and we would have a chat with him. Apparently, he shied at coming.  Next we got a letter from the Department telling us that the inspector would not arrive.</P>
    <P>We have now decided to take over the houses.  That matter is awaiting the sanction of the Minister and I hope that sanction will be forthcoming immediately.  I want to tell the Minister that there are 57 houses there and that we have already received 87 applications from people within a two-mile radius of these houses.  They are mainly soldiers who served in Cork during the war, who got married locally and who are living in labourers' cottages with their people-in-law.  I am sure that is a condition of affairs that the Minister does not want to continue.</P>
    <P>The next matter I wish to deal with is a comment made by Deputy Keane yesterday when Deputy Desmond asked a question in regard to contractors. Deputy Keane interjected that I happen to be chairman of the board, as if I had used any influence in getting the contractor relieved of his responsibility. I want to point out quite clearly that, as far as contractors are concerned, the first warning that I gave in regard to housing grants was that a penalty clause was to be put into each contract, and I gave a second warning to the officials concerned that I am holding them directly responsible if that penalty clause is not fully enforced. I look to the Minister's officers to see that the surcharge is put on, and kept on, any official who disobeys that.  If a contractor takes a contract for a number of houses, unless there is very good and definite reason, there is no justification for that contractor carrying on for months and, perhaps, in some cases, years beyond the time of the contract.  I, at least, will see to that.  I felt very sore at the idea of Deputy Seán Keane making that remark.  I do not wish to delay the House.  As I said, I am grateful for the indulgence given.</P>

      <P>There are just a few matters that I wish to refer to in regard to this Estimate.  Certain works were referred to by my colleague and friend, Deputy Brennan.  I have heard nothing about them.  As far as the matter affects Wexford County Council, if the position is as described by Deputy Brennan, the engineers would be loath to take it over.  I would be very doubtful that the Wicklow County Council would not be asked to complete the work that they started.  The Department and the Minister should see to it that the work would be completed by the local authority that commenced it.  Wexford did not refuse to do anything.  I doubt if they have heard anything about it.  I did not, and I do not know that any member of the council heard anything about it up to now.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters arising out of the Local Authorities (Works) Act to which I want to refer.  I want to refer to an attempt at misrepresentation from the Department of Local Government of members of the Wexford County Council in that respect. At no time since this Act came into operation did the Wexford County Council refuse to operate it in any single respect.  The services of this State should not be used to attempt to blackguard any member or members of a local authority.  I want to have that clear.  At no time, in no specific instance, did the members of the Wexford County Council refuse, in any area in the county, to put into operation or to start any works for which there was sanction.  When we see the State Department used for official letters to be written down to groups of people who were interested in getting work and who were unemployed the thing has gone a bit too far and it is time to call a halt to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I see the Local Authorities (Works) Act operating, there is an amount of useful work being done under it and an amount of work being done under it in regard to which there is a big question of doubt as to whether it will give a return or not.  The question of the cost of the administration of this scheme is another important matter.  The full cost of administering this scheme and of providing the skilled personnel to do the planning and so forth, is thrown on the local authorities.  It may be that the engineers are fully occupied and that they have not the time to devote to the proper planning of those schemes.  Rather large schemes that are not fully and properly planned are bound to create problems.  There is the danger that the money would be badly spent and there is also the danget that charges might be made on the <Col N="903" /> local rates for damages that might take place as a result of faulty planning.  It has been represented to the Minister before now that the cost of the necessary engineering facilities which are required for the planning of those schemes should be paid out of the same find that pays for schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  I would say that 70 per cent. of the money which is being spent is being spent for the relief of unemployment and undoubtedly it has been a useful scheme in that respect because it has relieved a great number of men who had no other employment.  Unfortunately, it has had its disadvantages too.  Up and down the country we have heard of numbers of men who have left their permanent employment with farmers to take up temporary work on those schemes.  These men will now join those on the permanent list of unemployed.</P>
      <P>Deputy T. Brennan mentioned a very large scheme in an area adjoining Wexford.  Last spring a complaint was made by many farmers that their men had left them to go to work on that scheme.  I need hardly say that that state of affairs was bad.  The wages were no greater than those which the farmers were paying to the men.  The scheme has stopped now and these men are out of employment. I suppose it is only natural that men will try to get public work if they can and we cannot blame them for it but steps should be taken to ensure, in the giving of employment under this scheme, that it will not ultimately result in a greater amount of rural unemployment than existed before the scheme started in the area.  Workers' representatives and every representative should bear that point very closely in mind.  They should ensure that no man will be encouraged or allowed to leave permanent employment in order to take up temporary employment under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel sure that the Minister for Local Government would be opposed to that state of affairs.  Undoubtedly, the moneys which have been spent have relieved rural unemployment <Col N="904" /> during the past two years.  At that time there was a large amount of rural unemployment which was created (1) by the reduction in tillage and (2) by a reduction, quite suddenly, in one year of a rather considerable sum of money in respect of road grants.  As a result of the reduction in tillage, the tendency is for farmers to employ less men than formerly on the land and the reduction in the road grants created a certain unemployment problem also. I believe that the main purpose of the Act was the relief of unemployment. An amount of useful work was done here and there throughout the country and an amount of work was done which, thought of doubtful benefit, provided employment.  We must not forget that these moneys have to be repaid. They have not to be repaid out of present taxation but future generations and even the present generation will be responsible for the repayment of that money and the interest thereon. It is, therefore, important that all of the money should be well spent.  I would emphasise that it cannot be well spent unless some provision is made so that costs incurred where special examination of works to be carried out is necessary will be met out of the fund also.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Gorman devoted all his remarks to-day to the subject of the bridge at Youghal.  Wexford County has a similar bridge.  I think it is every bit as long as the Youghal bridge, if not longer; at any rate, there is not much difference.  I would say to Deputy O'Gorman that the Cork and Waterford County Councils will, however, have to take their place in the queue behind Wexford.  We were in the field many years before them in connection with this bridge which is affecting the people in the town and the trade of Wexford very considerably. It is of the very same type as the Youghal bridge and it has barricades too exactly the same as those at Youghal.  That has been the position for the past 10 years.  Before the war, the borings and soundings were made and all the records completed in connection with the improvement of the position at Wexford.  Further, a competition was held between engineers and something like £500 was <Col N="905" /> spent in that respect.  A very competent board selected an engineer&mdash;a Corkman, by the way: so Cork have some brains, we will admit.  The design was agreed upon.  I would impress on the Minister that for quite a considerable time now there has been an application for a bridge Order under existing legislation to enable the Wexford County Council to proceed with the erection of the proposed bridge.  It will be a huge job and it, will cost a lot of money.  Therefore, the sooner the matter is attended to the better.</P>
    <P>The old bridge is costing the ratepayers a considerable sum of money this year for its upkeep but, when all is said and done, it is nothing but a danger to traffic and it is doubtful if there will not be a tragedy before the new bridge is erected.  It is the only way into the town from a large area of the country and it is also the only way to the cemetery.  The matter is extremely urgent and I would urge on the Minister the necessity for getting a move on in the matter.  I do not think there is any hope of having a new bridge erected there inside less than five years.  We must remember all the preliminary works which have to be undertaken.  It is possible that there may even have to be an inquiry first; then a contract and then the erection of the bridge.  Even proceeding at the fastest possible rate, it will be five, six or seven years before the new bridge will be erected.  God knows, that is long enough considering the length of time this work has been necessary.  I think it was in 1936 that the county council first took action: they were advised then by their officers as to the best method of proceeding in the matter.  All the preliminary work has been done by them. All the documents, piles of documents &mdash;nearly miles of paper&mdash;were sent to the Department with the application for a bridge Order.</P>

I think we should get precedence over Youghal.  They want a bridge and I have no objection, but it should not hold up the building of our bridge.  I doubt if they are as advanced as we are, or if they have the documents and soundings necessary.  We have everything done and we are ready to go ahead with the building in the morning if we get the word.  The plans are approved for the building of our bridge.</P>
      <P>The regulations recently made under the Housing Acts have been referred to.  Of all the regulations and amendments of housing legislation that have been framed in the last 20 years nothing created so much dissatisfaction among local authorities as the regulations under which the specific instance has no longer a right to a house. There is a serious matter and if it is pursued to its logical conclusion it will take all the initiative and drive from members of local authorities to get houses built.  It will do considerable damage to the whole effort to house the rural population.</P>
      <P>Advertisements appeared from local authorities asking persons who needed houses to make representations to have houses built for them.  They went to particular farmers and secured an acre of land voluntarily.  The county council then proceed to build a house and, let us say, it is built in six or 12 months.  Then it is found that the specific instance is not entitled to get the house.  I ask the Minister seriously to consider having those regulations amended.  The specific instance who arranges to have a house built should get the house, if he is otherwise qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Wexford some 300 or 400 people made representations to have houses built on specific plots.  All the applications were examined by the medical officer of health, the engineers and the members of the local authority and those people were accepted as persons eligible and qualified and needing houses.  Under the regulations to which I have referred none of these persons may get a house when the houses are erected.  There is nothing more calculated to create a revolution in the <Col N="907" /> county, nothing that is likely to cause so much dissatisfaction, particularly among the members of a local authority.</P>
    <P>All the members of local authorities with whom I have had any contact are unanimous that it is the worst possible thing that has happened and it is regarded as a dangerous thing.  If it is persisted in, no member of a local authority will be concerned about the erection of houses in rural areas.  He will have 12 or 20 men on his doorstep protesting against the operation of these regulations.</P>
    <P>The old system that has operated for 40 or 50 years, ever since rural cottages were first built, is much more satisfactory. Under that system the specific instance gets the house unless some grave reason is put forward to disqualify him.  We have had cases of men who applied for plots in 1937.  The plots were not built on because of the war, but the houses have been completed now.  Inside the past couple of weeks the people who were paying rent for the plots and who were tilling them for the last 12 or 13 years were refused the cottages.  Someone who was considered better qualified, according to the regulations, was selected by the medical officer of health, possibly as having one more child, or for some other reason, and that person will get the house in preference to the specific instance.</P>
    <P>This is all wrong and it is the unanimous view of local authorities that the sooner those regulations are changed the better for the future of housing.  It is an injustice to any worker who needs a house.  He gets a plot and he finds when the house is erected that some person who possibly never applied for a house will get it in preference to him and he has to remain in his hut or hovel.  I am sure the Minister appreciates the point I have raised and I hope he will have the grievance remedied immediately. Houses are being completed every day in the week and these regulations should no longer apply.  The county councils or the county managers are the best judges and the specific instance <Col N="908" /> was entitled in law, up to the framing of those regulations, to get the house and no one else had a right to it.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters I could refer to but I do not wish to take up the time of the House any longer. I will ask the Minister to attend immediately to that very pressing matter to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to take up much of the time of the House.  In my opinion, most of the discussion on this Estimate would be more appropriate to the local council chambers.</P>
      <P>First of all, I would like to compliment the Minister on the success of his efforts generally, and I would like to pay a compliment to the members of the present Government for the important strides they have made, especially in the matter of housing.  That applies particularly to their direct labour schemes.  The only direct labour schemes that were carried out by the previous Government were those which had to be done by direct labour because of the failure of unsatisfactory contractors who obtained certain contracts and secured the sanction of the Minister at that time.  There was never any encouragement given by the Governments before the present Government to any local authorities to build houses by direct labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On previous occasions I availed of this opportunity to refer to the desirability of giving more power to the engineers of local authorities to formulate plans for houses more in keeping with the requirements of prospective tenants.  I am glad that the houses that are now being erected show a considerable advance in that direction. I believe there are possibilities for further improvement.  On a previous occasion I mentioned the desirability of relieving working-class people of the obligation of having to purchase such an article of furniture as, for instance, a wardrobe, and I am glad to note that the plans of the present-day houses make provision whereby the tenant can have that very valuable piece of furniture in the form of a built-in wardrobe. That means a considerable saving for the tenant and it occupies what would otherwise be waste space.  Every effort <Col N="909" /> should be made by the experts planning those buildings to eliminate waste space, particularly in a working-class house.  I am pleased with the advance that has been made and I earnestly hope that the brains and energy of the expert planners will be concentrated on further improving the internal makeup of future houses.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion also I stressed the importance of reducing by every possible means the all-in cost of these houses, because that is reflected in the rents which the tenants have to pay, at least over the period of the repayment of the loan.  I have not been convinced that there is any justification for including in the all-in cost of these houses the cost of such work as the making of roads, the laying of water mains, sewerage works, and gas and electricity costings, because in most cases these roadways will become public roads.  Some of them have actually become main roads.  Therefore I do not think it is fair that the initial cost of making them should become part of the rent of the houses that are erected on these sites.  I would ask the Minister to have that question further examined.  In view of abnormal building costs nowadays, it is more desirable than ever it was to find some way of financing that kind of work as distinct from the actual building costs.</P>
    <P>References were made during the discussion to rural cottages.  Deputy Allen, when speaking, made a complaint about old applicants.  My colleague, Deputy T. Walsh, made the same sort of complaint last evening. We all complain about it, but I did not hear any of the Deputies on the opposite side tell us who was responsible for denying those old applicants the right that has been referred to. They have deliberately refrained from reminding the House that it was their own Party when in power which removed that right.  Up to the advent of Fianna Fáil to power, it was possible for a farmer or a landowner to say to a local authority that he was prepared to give his workman or neighbour a site for a cottage on his land, and, by agreement with the local authority, he got paid for the site, and the cottage was built for his workman, neighbour <Col N="910" /> or friend.  New regulations, however, were made by the Fianna Fáil Minister whereby every cottage, irrespective of when the site was acquired, had to be advertised, and every application form had to be submitted to the medical officer of health.  I quite agree with the complaint that has been made in regard to these old applicants.  The sites spoken of were got by agreement prior to the making of the special regulations to which I have referred.  I would imagine that the old applicants in every county are few in number and so the right which they enjoyed heretofore ought to be restored to them.  There are a number of them in my own county and I am sure in every other county. The records in regard to their cases are available in the offices of the local authorities.  These will prove that the sites were acquired on their behalf by the local authority and therefore they ought to be automatically appointed as tenants.  I hope the Minister will see his way to amend the regulations so that what I suggest may be done.</P>
    <P>If reference has not already been made to the cost of cottage repairs, I want to say now that the cost of these repairs has been terrific over the last number of years, due, in my opinion, to the deliberate neglect of our predecessors, the old district councils. Apparently, the members of these councils regarded it as good economy to keep the local rates down to the lowest possible figure and to have no regard to their responsibility as regards carrying out repairs to cottages.  They left that as a legacy to those who succeeded them.  In this connection, when the 1936 Labourers Act was passed, it provided for what was unfortunately described by some people as an attractive purchase scheme for the occupants of the cottages.  I am very glad that most of those tenants had the good sense not to be caught by that proposal, but the point is that the local authorities under that Act were required to have every cottage examined and put into proper repair.</P>
    <P>It was found by the local authorities, as a result of the survey that was made, that that was going to be a very costly work.  I know that in my county the first estimate that was submitted <Col N="911" /> amounted to in or about £40,000.  The figure I think was much higher in other counties.  The necessity for such heavy expenditure was due, not to bad workmanship, but to the fact that no repairs whatever had been done in some cases for generations. I think that the local authorities to-day are making a very fair effort to put these cottages into a proper state of repair, and to maintain them by means of a systematic and regular method of inspection.</P>
    <P>I do not know if I would be in order in referring to the Labourers Act of 1936.  I do hope that if the Minister contemplates anything in the way of making the cottages the property of the tenants in the near future, as advocated by Deputy Cogan this morning, his scheme will be a good, sound economic one for those people, and that it will not be a case of buying &ldquo;a pig in a poke&rdquo; which, I think, is the only way to describe the provision in the 1936 Act.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of reference to road grants, and of the action of the present Government in cutting down main road grants, but I observed that there was almost complete silence about the county roads.  There was no reference to the fact that the Minister's predecessor, the late Mr. T.J. Murphy, at the first opportunity implemented what he had been advocating for years when a Fianna Fáil Government was in power.  During that period he repeatedly deplored the manner in which that Government had neglected the county roads.  That reminds me that the Opposition speakers seem to have forgotten that there was a special debate here on one occasion on a motion from the Opposition dealing with the action of the Government in, according to their statement, reducing road grants.  In view of the full discussion that we had on that occasion and of the decision of the House, I fail to see why this matter should be revived on the Minister's Estimate this year, except that it is another futile effort to try and manufacture some new prop for their political support.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I want to compliment the Minister on the very good work <Col N="912" /> that he is doing.  I can assure him that he has the appreciation, particularly of those people who had almost despaired of ever getting proper housing until the policy of the present Government was put into operation, a policy which encourages local authorities not to be wasting time looking for contractors but to tackle the job themselves in an organised way and carry it out without the delays that were inevitable waiting for sanction in regard to contracts.  There is now a continuous volume of production, and I would say that, in half the time estimated by those who went before the present Government, the housing problem in this country will be solved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>My only reason for intervening in this debate arises out of some statements made by Deputy Allen. May I say that I am a little surprised that he did not wait to hear some of my observations because I am sure he had some idea that I would make some sort of a reply to him?  Last year Deputy Allen spoke in the same strain. He came in here and made veiled allegations about the Department being used for political purposes.  He said that the Department had sent certain communications to Wexford County Council and to other county councils trying to insist that they do certain things.  He did not substantiate these allegations.  He has made similar allegations down the country as to the use of machinery of the Department for political purposes, I take it on my behalf.  To-day he had the impudence again to come in here and make the same allegations.  He was asked across the floor of the House to give one example, any example at all, that he cared to substantiate his allegations. His reaction to that invitation was to mutter behind his hand and say: &ldquo;You will hear more about them again.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think most of his references are in connection with the non-working, might I say, for one period of local authorities' works schemes down in Wexford. He accused me of accusing him and the Fianna Fáil Party of being opposed to these schemes.  I have no hesitation <Col N="913" /> in saying that they were opposed to these schemes, not alone in County Wexford but in other counties as well. I have no hesitation in saying that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were afraid to commit themselves.  They wanted the schemes but, on the other hand, they wanted to oppose them.  I have a certain amount of admiration for Deputy MacEntee in this particular instance because he at least has been consistent.  He opposed the whole drainage scheme under this particular Act right through; he opposed it again yesterday and gave some of his reasons, though they were not quite correct.  He even went so far as to try to endeavour to enlist the aid of the Minister for Finance to his support.  He alleged that the Minister for Finance also thought that money spent on these schemes was not worth while.  I am sure he will agree that he knew full well that he was quoting the Minister entirely out of context.  With the permission of the Chair, I now propose to give the full quotation.  Speaking on 31st March of this year the Minister said at column 2071 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That leaves attached&mdash;and I do want it attached&mdash;to the land rehabilitation project moneys we propose to spend this year on drainage. Years ago, there was brought into this House, arising out of the drainage inquiry report, a scheme which I think was supposed to warrant an expenditure of £5,000,000 or £6,000,000; but the Parliamentary Secretary who introduced it here on a particular occasion came back, as if scared with what he had done, told us that, of course, no expenditure would take place at a higher rate than about £200,000 a year&mdash;so the drainage scheme proposed at that time was going to take a generation to accomplish.  Arising out of the progress under the land rehabilitation scheme, it was found that, if only for that purpose, more money would be required for the immediate purpose of drainage.  We discovered here and there that land rehabilitation was held up by the fact that, where the waters had been channelled in various ways, they could not be run off properly because the outfall <Col N="914" /> had not been prepared properly under the land drainage scheme.  We hope that by putting the two schemes together and quickening the pace of the drainage works, the betterment of the soil will occur, through the impact both of these schemes will have on the land of the country.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That last sentence was not referred to at all by Deputy MacEntee.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give the Deputy the particular quotation again.  At column 2072 the Minister said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the same way, the moneys grouped here... grants to local authorities for the execution of works under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, can be regarded also as an addition to or at least an improvement of the land, land already sought to be improved by the land rehabilitation scheme and by the effect of drainage as a scheme.  I would ask Deputies interested in land rehabilitation to note the new pace we propose to set regarding drainage and the extra moneys put at the disposal of local authorities under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, as all aiming at the development of the soil of this country and as being truly productive, even in the most austere, economic way.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee would have us believe that the Minister spoke against these drainage schemes under that particular Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Walsh could not make up his mind last night.  Deputy Allen more or less adopted the same attitude. Another Deputy definitely stated that he had not yet succeeded in making up his mind; on the one hand he knew that the farmers and owners of land and the workers welcomed the scheme, wanted the scheme and still want it. But they all had reservations at the backs of their minds in all their <Col N="915" /> speeches.  If anything did occur, and they were afraid of their lives damage might not occur, they could always turn round and say: &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo; They have all adopted a little bit of the line of policy Deputy MacEntee has set since the Bill was first introduced. If Deputy MacEntee is in doubt as to the usefulness or benefit of these schemes to the workers, the farmers and the landowners all he has to do is to turn round and ask the members of his Party, who are also members of local authorities, what they think of it.  Never once has there been any objection by any Fianna Fáil T.D., who is also a member of a local authority, to the reception of these grants from the Department of Local Government or to the implementation of any of the schemes.</P>
    <P>They talk about the damage that may be done.  Deputy Walsh warned us in particular of the damage that may be done in County Kilkenny.  If the local authority in County Kilkenny, or in any other county, believes that damage will be done, all that authority need do is refuse the grant and send back the money.  Surely, that is quite simple. The Act under which they can carry out these schemes is an enabling Act. County councils have complete liberty. They may do the schemes, or they may not do them.  The Minister for Local Government says: &ldquo;Here is a certain amount of money; if you want to do the schemes you may do them and if you do not want to do them nobody will make you do them.&rdquo;  I think that is perfectly fair and reasonable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Allen was annoyed because last year in some of my public statements and in some of the public statements of members of my Party reference was made to the fact that the particular county council in which he is interested was not availing of the grants being offered.  As a Deputy, apart altogether from being a Parliamentary Secretary, I was concerned. I may be a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government but that does not mean that I forget my duty as a Deputy.  I do not believe Deputy MacEntee, even though he was a Minister, ever forgot he was a Deputy.  Was there ever any Minister or Parliamentary Secretary who forgot <Col N="916" /> he had a particular interest in a particular constituency?  If I see pockets of unemployment in my constituency I use every legitimate means I can to ensure that employment is provided and that good work is done.  If Deputy Allen has any particular example in mind of where I have erred in that respect, surely the place to mention that is here in this House.  Why should he seek cover behind his hands for his innuendoes, veiled threats and allegations. If he is man enough to suggest these things, he should be man enough to give specific examples.  Least of all, should he allege that I have any influence with the particular county council over which he presides remembering, as most people do, the constitution of that particular body. Surely, Deputy Allen would not allege that I can bring any influence to bear on that county council. Surely he does not believe that I, a member of the Labour Party, could bring any influence to bear on the county council of which he has charge. If he has any allegation to make in that respect, he should make it in public, whether in the county council or on a public platform.</P>
    <P>The accent has been on roads in this debate and we have had the old statements from Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party about the cut in the road grants.  We have had the boast about what they did in 1946-47 and in 1947-48, trying to give the impression that they got money from some source other than the Road Fund and out of their generosity said to the county councils in the Twenty-Six Counties: &ldquo;Here is extra money for you, here is money that the Fianna Fáil Government, by their special effort, made available for the roads.&rdquo;  They have said that, knowing in their heart and soul, as pointed out on many occasions, that it was not through the generosity of the Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government that these increased or abnormal grants were made in the three or four years after the emergency.  As Deputy Desmond pointed out yesterday, these moneys were merely the accumulation of the Road Fund from 1940-41 to 1946-47, when the increased grants were first given.  These moneys&mdash;which could not be spent, due to the scarcity of materials and other things during the <Col N="917" /> war years&mdash;lay there and all the Fianna Fáil Minister had to do at that particular time was to distribute them as he should have done or might have done if there had been no emergency over ten years from 1940.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee told us last night that it was the intention of the last Government to make available an extra sum of £2,000,000.  There is not the slightest evidence in the world that Fianna Fáil ever contemplated making available to the local authorities any more money than was collected into the Road Fund.  There was never any suggestion of that in the wide earthly world.  They may criticise this Government or the Minister for Finance when he resists any plea in that respect, but the plain fact is that the evidence is there that Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Finance, refused to give any more for the repair, upkeep and maintenance of roads other than what money was collected from motor taxation. Let us be quite clear on that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It was needed elsewhere. It was considered that the roads in country areas had deteriorated so much from 1940 to 1947 that it would be better spent in the country areas. There was no indication by the Fianna Fail Government or the then Minister of any intention to keep up this scale of grants.  The reports made to him at that time by his chief engineering officers and by the county engineers of the different counties showed that the roads would be restored to pre-war condition in one or two years and <Col N="918" /> grants were given out on that assumption. The grants were based in 1946-47 on the assumption that they would continue for a period of one, or at the most, two years.</P>
      <P>Opposition Deputies would have us believe that the roads have seriously deteriorated since 1948.  Not one Deputy on the far side believes that.  I do not say that the roads are all they should be: I would like to see them much better.  Might I pay a tribute here to Deputy Childers, who seemed to be the only one in this debate who approached this in a practical way? From his past experience, he has a definite appreciation of the question and of the financial problems involved. There is no use in a Deputy telling us the roads are three times worse than they were in 1948.  Not alone from the information which I get from the different engineers around the country, but from all my own experience in travelling around the country, I believe that the roads are slightly better than they were in 1948.  There may be instances where particular roads have deteriorated but, generally speaking, on the main roads and the county roads we must agree there has been an improvement, especially on county roads.  Deputies would also do well to bear in mind that, right up to 1946-47, no money was made available from the Department in respect of county roads.  In 1946-47, there was nearly £500,000.  In 1949-50, up to 31st March this year, there was £1,200,000.</P>
      <P>We hear a great plea from all sides about the rates and we had Deputy Cogan this morning speaking about the increasing burden on the ratepayers. We all have an appreciation of the burden carried by ratepayers and taxpayers.  On the one hand, the Deputy tells us we should make an effort to keep the rates down, but very glibly in the next five minutes he says we should have a five-year plan for roads.  He asks why the users of the Dublin-Cork road should have a concrete or tarmacadam road when the person whose house is at the end of a boreen must rattle along in a horse and cart over crooked stones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears to me that Deputy Cogan wants us to tarmacadam or concrete <Col N="919" /> every single road in Ireland.  He is a man who inside and outside the House talks about the burden on the taxpayers which is increasing daily. He wants these things to be done, but does not want the burden to go on the ratepayers.  If the ratepayers are not to pay, who is to pay?  Is it the taxpayers? The taxpayer means everybody. Deputy Cogan ought to make up his mind.  So should Deputy Corry and those who talk about increasing burdens on the people.  If we want hospitals, roads, houses, water supplies, swimming pools, someone must pay for them.  Deputy Cogan does not want the ratepayers to pay, so it must be the taxpayers.  Does it not all come to the one thing?  They ought to make up their minds in that respect.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Desmond says, the local authorities have the statutory responsibility for the upkeep, maintenance, building and improvement of the roads in their functional area.  We must remember that in 1938-39 as far as expenditure on roads is concerned, the local authorities were contributing two-thirds of the total cost.  At the present time, they are contributing less than 50 per cent.  The central authority has done its bit.  It has made its contribution, whether it was under the Fianna Fáil Government or the present inter-Party Government.  As the money came into the Road Fund, it was paid out to the local authorities &mdash;but the local authorities have not responded in the same degree.  I have sympathy with ratepayers in any extra burden they may have to meet, but there is no use in any representative of the ratepayers &ldquo;hollering&rdquo; and shouting to have things done, unless he is prepared to advocate that they be paid for.  The only argument against increasing rates is one against wastage and extravagance.  We have some Deputies calling for swimming pools, hospitals, roads and houses, and the next day or even in the next ten minutes they say the rates are too high.</P>
    <P>We need these things.  We are a very small country, a relatively poor country, and if people advocate these things it is only reasonable that they should say whether they are prepared to pay for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="920" /> Finally, I again invite Deputy Allen, on any other occasion he likes, in this House or elsewhere, to show where the Department has abused its functions, privileges or machinery to bring political influence to bear either on Wexford County Council or any other county council.  If he is slightly jealous of the attention I may happen to pay to my constituency and to my county, that is his affair.</P>

      <P>I was not present for the full speech by Deputy Dr. Brennan last night and came in only for the tail end.  I may have got a wrong impression, but the impression I got was that he was rather critical of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation and some of the officials.  I agree with the Deputy that there are very many distressing cases regarding housing in Dún Laoghaire and in the Rathdown area, but I can only speak with authority for the Dún Laoghaire Borough area as I am not on the county council. I would like to say, in defence of the officials there, that I am satisfied that we have in Dún Laoghaire as efficient a body of officials, particularly those recently appointed to deal with this question of housing, as any county council or public authority could wish for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that we are not satisfied with the progress that has been made in housing, nor can any public representative be satisfied while there is one very distressing case left in the particular area for which he serves on the local authority.  Briefly, our housing programme in Dún Laoghaire was completely solved as far back as when President Seán T. O'Kelly was Minister responsible for that Department.  As I mentioned last year, we had at that time a number of houses at what we considered then very high rents, that is, 15/- a week, for which we found it difficult to get tenants.  I would like to explain this to those who wonder why the problem is still such a big one in spite of what I said about having solved it.  One explanation is that the population of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire in 1936 was 39,785, while the last census of 1946 showed it to have increased to 44,689, and the latest estimated figure for the borough is 50,000. <Col N="921" /> In other words, we have increased the population of the borough during that period by 10,215 and, therefore, we have created a new problem since the housing problem was solved, as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Another question which I felt was referred to was the manner in which houses in the borough were allocated. All I have to say is that the present official in charge of this has given eminent satisfaction to everybody and that the system adopted is the most satisfactory system of all.</P>
    <P>The medical officer with his assistant makes a thorough examination&mdash;and a sympathetic examination, which is a very essential thing, as we have had officials that I personally felt were not sympathetic in their approach to those who were in bad need of housing.  We now have an officer with an assistant who has given satisfaction to everybody by the way in which he examines the applicants' present housing conditions and by the sympathy with which he approaches the matter.  When he compiles his list of priorities, it is submitted in strict confidence at a housing meeting of the members of the corporation, who with their local knowledge are sometimes able to make suggestions that will alter the priority of allocation.  A system of that kind is, in my experience, the only one that will give complete satisfaction.  The members of the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation are quite satisfied with the official in charge of this problem.</P>
    <P>The present problem is that our total requirement of houses is roughly 700. It is estimated that these allocations will be completely made by the summer of 1952.  I admit that, to a person who is living in very appalling conditions, it is little consolation to say: &ldquo;In two years' time, we hope to give you a house.&rdquo;  I do not know why it has taken so long to build houses, but I was surprised and impressed by a statement made by Deputy McGrath to-day.  All I have to say with reference to that is that if anybody&mdash;&mdash;whether he be a member of a local body or an official of any kind, whether he be a trade union operative or leader&mdash;does anything that slows up <Col N="922" /> house building, while even one person is living under conditions such as I myself have knowledge of, that person is acting criminally and there should be no mercy on the part of the Minister if he comes under his control.</P>
    <P>There is another side to the problem, that is, that speed is not everything in the building of houses.  We have had cases where some contractors have produced them more quickly than others, but it has been discovered that the work is not as well done.  To my mind, that is a very bad way to try to solve the problem.  To put people into a new house and find after 12 months or two years that the wallpaper will not remain on the walls unless it is nailed there, or that the walls are cracking, or that the floors or the concrete surrounds around the house are sagging, is to my mind something that all officials should take particular care to guard against.  That has happened in many cases to my own knowledge.  I have seen houses recently completed and only occupied within the last few months in which practically all the woodwork has shrunk to such an extent that although tongued and grooved wood was used for the doors, daylight could be easily seen through the crevices.  In other cases, the doors of the hot presses have completely fallen asunder because small nails were used for the battens of those doors.  I have also seen houses where gutters, apparently, had no filling in the joints and, on the first rainy day, a considerable amount of damp appeared owing to the pouring of the water down the sides of the houses.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I observed, probably due to the rushing of the job, and that is that the builder, with the modern heavy equipment that is used, ploughed up the land around the houses and, when the scheme was completed and the tenants were in possession with certain finishing work to be done such as putting up railings to divide the gardens, the contractor used up all the rubble, including large defective concrete blocks to fill up the ruts in the ground which was eventually handed over to the tenants for gardens.  I do not think that that should be tolerated. If tenants are put into new houses, the gardens should be handed over to them <Col N="923" /> in a condition in which, with reasonable labour, they would be able to cultivate them.  In some cases which I have recently seen it would be humanly impossible to make a garden unless a considerable amount of money was spent carting away material that, to my mind, should have been carted away by the contractor.</P>
    <P>Another thing reported to me only yesterday, and I hope it is not true, is that in certain housing schemes in the county council area of Rathdown mass concrete has been used.  I have not had time to check up on that and I only mention it to the Minister in the hope that the information is inaccurate, because any houses I have seen in County Dublin which were built of mass concrete were not at all satisfactory. After a short time cracks appeared in the walls and dampness inside which made the houses quite uncomfortable.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of one scheme which has been put into operation in Dún Laoghaire.  I mention it so that he may encourage the further development of this scheme and give it all possible assistance.  To my mind it is an ideal way of solving the housing problem. In the beginning I was thoroughly opposed to it because I thought it would be a complete failure.  I saw snags in it which I did not believe could be overcome.  I refer to the &ldquo;build-your-own-house&rdquo; scheme on which magnificent work has been done. The reason I am so enthusiastic about it is that once the houses are built by the workmen themselves they take a greater pride in them because they are their own property, and the corporation, instead of having to pay for repairs, the cost of which in corporation houses is very high, have an income from the houses by way of rates.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should also like to draw the Minister's attention.  It is only a small problem and for that reason I hope he will agree to give the concession asked for.  In Dún Laoghaire&mdash;I suppose the same applies to other districts&mdash;we had quite a number of people, who were born and reared there and who, <Col N="924" /> while they were waiting for us to provide them with houses&mdash;I have personal knowledge of eight cases&mdash;in desperation had to go outside the borough boundary in order to get accommodation in a room or a hovel or a shack.</P>
    <P>These people now find themselves in the position that they have not got the residence qualification in the county council area and, if we offered them houses in the Dún Laoghaire area, according to the regulations they are not entitled to be accepted as tenants for a certain class of houses for which grants are given.  That is a very small problem but it means a lot to those people.  I think the secretary of the corporation has taken the matter up with the Minister's Department.  It is such a small matter, I think the Minister should recognise these people as being resident in Dún Laoghaire for the purpose of getting houses.</P>
    <P>Then there is another point in connection with the clearance of a site where houses had to be demolished because they were ready to collapse. These houses were very old and the rent, I think, was somewhere in the neighbourhood of 3/-.  A number of people who were born and reared in these houses are now housed in a very attractive housing scheme but, under the new system of differential rents, some of these people have to pay a rent of 22/6 a week.  I purposely am not mentioning the district&mdash;it may apply to various districts.  These people went into these new houses at a rent of 15/- and then suddenly, after a few weeks, the rent was increased to 22/6.  In addition to that, without any notice whatever, the Electricity Supply Board charges were about trebled.  I am not saying that the income of these people is not sufficient to justify that grading.  But the position that these people find themselves in is that they were compelled to leave the houses which they had at a very low rent.  Having been transferred to the new houses, it was necessary for the majority if not all of these people to buy new furniture.  They find themselves now in the position that they are saddled with the cost of furnishing a new house, that they have to meet a very greatly increased rent and with charges, such as Electricity <Col N="925" /> Supply Board charges, increased also.</P>
    <P>The suggestion I make in such cases is that it would be well to allow the rent to remain for a period even at 15/-. The reason I make that suggestion is that to my own knowledge in some of those houses which I visited there is a vacant room unfurnished.  I clearly see what is going to happen in the next few weeks, if it has not already happened. These people, in spite of the regulations, will take in a tenant in order to tide them over that difficult period.  I think it would be better not to rush into imposing this increased rent in cases of that kind.  I am talking now of a case of a particular type; I do not think it would be very widespread.  I think it would be much better in such cases to leave the rent as it was, at 15/- a week for a period, let us say, of 12 months.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect and I think this is a matter in regard to which the legislation would have to be changed. I understand that in the county council area&mdash;I am not sufficiently conversant with the conditions but this is just a case that came to my notice&mdash;it is compulsory on the local authority, when a house becomes vacant, to advertise that house.  Then the medical officer has to examine all the applicants for the house.  Here is what is happening in the case that came under my notice.  In a certain district there was a serious tuberculosis case.  The man was living under deplorable conditions and two of his children were suspect. He had just come home after, I think, nine months' treatment in hospital. Two of his children, as I have said, were suspect and were receiving medical attention.  It was known locally that he would get this house, so much so that no other applicant was anxious to get the house.  The owner of every house which I inspected said: &ldquo;There is one person who has priority over all others for that house.&rdquo;  The family conditions were deplorable, as I said, and this house was idle for months&mdash; I think for a period of three months. During that time children broke into the house and did a considerable amount of damage&mdash;I think to the extent of about £60.  The local authority <Col N="926" /> lost the rent for a period of about three months and the bill they had to pay for repairs was £60.  This urgent tuberculosis case was all that time without the house but my information is that nothing could be done.  I should be glad if the Minister would take a note of that and see if some change could not be made to deal with cases like that, so that a list could be prepared and an examination of all applicants carried out beforehand so that when the house becomes idle a tenant will go into it without delay.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to the question of roads.  I am sorry that the Parliamentary Secretary has left the House because while he was speaking it was quite evident to me that one cannot make general statements about any of these problems.  In the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, we have a very serious problem so far as roads are concerned.  We have a total of 63 miles of roads and 26 miles of these would, in the normal way, be classed as main roads but because of our constitution we have no main roads at all, technically speaking.  I want to put these facts before the Minister. The position is that from 1941 to 1946 no grant at all was made to the Dún Laoghaire Corporation for roads.  In 1947-48 we got £5,000 and in 1948-49 we got £10,000.  Here is our particular problem.  The roads have got into such a serious state of disrepair that we estimate that it would take £600,000 to do the job thoroughly.  Of that total, £150,000 refers to the roads still occupied by tram lines.  The contract for the Blackrock stretch would be £27,000, for Dún Laoghaire, £30,000 and for Glasthule, £19,000.  We applied to the Minister on the 2nd October, 1949, for a grant for these particular stretches and that grant was refused.</P>
    <P>I want to make an appeal to the Minister in this matter.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that roads had not fallen into a serious state of dilapidation since 1948.  Our position is that a considerable stretch of the road, almost from Merrion Gates to Dalkey, is occupied by tram lines.  Formerly, we received from the Tramway Company a considerable sum in rates.  The space which they occupied on the road was valued at £2,290.  That would mean <Col N="927" /> that on this year's rate we would be receiving from the Tramway Company £2,950.  As well as that we would receive annually £877 from the Tramway Company for wayleaves.  It is true that in 1944 we received a sum of £9,500 to clear off that indebtedness. That was calculated on the basis of 11 years' purchase, but along with that income from the Tramway Company, the company was responsible for the complete upkeep from path to path of large stretches of that road.  In other parts of the borough, they were responsible for the upkeep of the centre portion of the road, that is, for a width of 18 inches each side of the rails.  Now we are in the position that we are deprived of that revenue and, owing to the tram lines, our roads are in a deplorable state whilst the traffic has considerably increased.  I want to put it to the Minister, and I think that in all fairness he will agree, that for that stretch of the road for which we applied for a grant we are surely entitled to a considerable grant.  I am putting the facts before the Minister now in the hope that he will reconsider the whole question and give us a grant for that purpose.</P>
    <P>Finally there is just one other point that I should like to mention.  I think that the Local Government Acts are in urgent need of being brought up to date.  There is very considerable confusion. No matter what you try to do as a member of a local body you find it very difficult to find out what exactly the legal position is.  I will mention one particular case that came to my notice recently, that is, membership of the borough corporation.  A point was raised as to qualifications.  I went and looked up the Acts myself and I was very doubtful about it.  I consulted several people and discovered that I had raised a first class legal problem. It was finally decided by the Local Government office that for Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation the qualifications were to be found in the 1898 Act.  A number of people think that that is the only Act but it has been discovered that there is a later Act, the Representation of the People Act of 1912, which gives further qualifications. I am mentioning this to the <Col N="928" /> Minister just as an example of the position as far as Local Government Acts are concerned and I would be very glad to hear from him that it is his intention to bring them up to date and have them in some unified form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it must be obvious to everybody who looks at the position as far as housing is concerned &mdash;and most of the discussion on this Estimate has centred around housing&mdash; that the present Administration represents a very great improvement on what went before.  In County Dublin, which I have the honour to represent on the local authority, a very considerable problem has been left to us by the county commissioner who was operating before the county council was reconstituted, but by dint of the fact that there has been a unanimous resolve on the part of representatives on that council to break down the housing problem, very considerable progress has been made.</P>
      <P>Listening to Deputies from different parts of the country speaking of laxity as far as the housing drive is concerned or of failure on the part of their own local authorities to tackle it effectively, it strikes me that something has been said here to-day which has a very close application to the facts, that is, that in order to break down the housing problem which is allegedly the desire of every public representative in the country we must begin at the beginning.  The organisms which are going to solve the problem are the local authorities and the measure of success the housing drive will achieve will be decided by their enthusiasm, efforts and work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have as Minister at present&mdash;as we had in his predecessor, the late Deputy T.J. Murphy&mdash;a man whose heart and soul is in this drive, a man who knows every aspect of the problem and the difficulties that beset the path of anybody who tries to solve it.  I should like to think that there is throughout the country the same degree of enthusiasm to give houses to the people as exists in the mind of the Minister and I should also like to think that there is among local authorities throughout the country as great an enthusiasm to give houses to the <Col N="929" /> working people as there is to keep down the rates, but I doubt that that is so.</P>
    <P>If an example is desired of what can be done by a local authority in getting houses in a short time that example can be found in County Dublin.  We have at the present time within County Dublin in course of completion 1,000 houses for the workers.  That is 100 less than were built by Fianna Fáil in 15 years.</P>

      <P>The example is there of what can be done.  We have got co-operation of a very excellent kind from the Minister and I must also take this opportunity of paying a tribute with other Deputies to the activities and efforts of the housing director in the City and County of Dublin who has applied himself to this problem with tremendous energy.</P>
      <P>Dublin City and County have a very special problem of their own.  In my constituency we get the overflow from the city and it is obvious to everybody that during the years of the war the housing problem in Dublin City was very much aggravated by the gathering together of the population and the increase in it and by the fact that during the war years those who were crossing to England made Dublin their half-way stop and many went no further while many of those coming home in like manner went no further.  Many of these young people stayed there, got married and raised families in the slums and later they moved out into the county and all that gives Dublin City and County a peculiar problem.  I do think, having felt very keenly on the problem and having a pretty thorough knowledge of it as far as my own area is concerned, that with the gathering impetus of the present drive, in Dublin County area at any rate, we will be within sight of the end of the housing problem in the course of two years.  It has been said truly that it is not very much consolation to a person in need of a house to say: &ldquo;We will give you a house in two years.&rdquo; but it is a much more hopeful outlook than that which existed prior to the advent of this Administration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The present situation, as far as housing is concerned, is one that holds out much more hope than ever before.  There has been criticism, of <Col N="931" /> course, of various aspects of the drive and, in some cases, criticism may be levelled with some degree of justice. There is, for instance, a considerable amount of delay occasioned in the housing drive by the system whereby plans for houses and building schemes must be continually referred to the Department, having been checked, rechecked and rechecked again by the local authority.  That is one aspect of the matter which could be considered by the Minister.  Some method should be found of shortening the procedure whereby these plans are sanctioned.</P>
      <P>I want to direct the Minister's attention to another point in this connection. We are at present building houses for the average family.  In County Dublin, we are building a type of house which will house a family of from three to five children in relative comfort, a better type of house than ever has been built, but we are not providing adequately, in my view, for the larger family.  I do not think that the provision of a three-bedroomed house&mdash; and in some cases in rural areas I understand that houses with only two bedrooms are being built&mdash;is making adequate provision for the family of seven, eight, ten and 12, thousands of which will be found throughout the country in need of houses, so that there is need for some special provision for houses for families of that size.  The cubic capacity of even a new house is overtaxed when the family is very large, and I ask the Minister to consider the advisability of doing something in that regard, if it is possible to do so, in connection with his new Housing Bill.</P>
      <P>The rents of houses are also a problem and a difficult problem.  A very admirable scheme has been introduced in some parts of the country whereby an effort is made to relate rents to the income of families.  It seems to me that, in many instances, this scheme is not being applied realistically.  It is all very well to estimate that a family has a gross income of a certain amount, but in most cases in which the scheme is being applied local authorities make little or no provision for deduction from the earnings of any member of a family, and there will be deductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> We all know well that boys who are working do not give to their parents every penny they earn.  It is true to say they should and, in an ideal state of things, they probably would, but, human nature being as it is, it just does not happen that way, and I therefore think it is a mistake for local authorities to estimate the income of a family upon the gross earnings.  The Minister might give some consideration to that matter, because I think it was at his behest that local authorities decided to introduce this scheme of differential rents.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing undoubtedly has been large.  There has been a noticeable trend, within the past year or year and a half, towards a reduction in the cost, but nevertheless the relatively high costs reflect themselves in high rents, and I believe that in many cases the impost upon the rates in the different counties is not sufficiently large to reduce rents.  I agree that there is no case whatever for a reduction of rent or a low rent for a family with a high income, but I have in mind farm workers in County Dublin who are earning a maximum of £3 10s. a week and who have to pay 9/- a week for their cottages.  I do not think that is right or just, particularly in cases where farm labourers have four, six and eight children.  The local authority has a responsibility in cases such as those to reduce the rent of the cottage, even if it means imposing to some small extent upon the rates.</P>
    <P>Some speeches were made here in connection with rates and Deputy Cogan shrouded himself in the mantle of the champion of the ratepayer.  Ratepayers, in my view, are a very nebulous body.  It is difficult to identify them clearly.  I consider that every person living within the area of a local authority with very few exceptions, is a ratepayer.  The ordinary farm worker who pays rent for a cottage pays rates also, included in the rent, but there has grown up a condition of mind which seems to believe that the ratepayers are a section of the community set apart from all others upon whom every possible expenditure is heaped by local authorities.  In many cases, this talk of ratepayers and the <Col N="933" /> hardships of ratepayers can be a ramp and I have a feeling that it has been made a ramp in some instances. It has been truly said that nobody wants to impose extraordinary hardships upon the persons whose money makes it possible to administer the different areas under local authorities, but it is undoubtedly equally true that, if services are to be provided for the people in need of them, money must be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that those most vociferous, most loquacious and most noisy in connection with rates are usually those who can best afford to pay rates.  The people who get the benefit of rate collections are, usually and generally speaking, the less fortunate in the community.  If you like, it is one method whereby wealth is redistributed and I think the Minister is wise enough not to be taken in by any rate reducing campaign which may have the effect of impairing the essential services of local authorities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Local Authorities (Works) Act, any Deputy who can clear his mind of the political issues involved will have to admit that it is one of the finest pieces of legislation for local authorities ever introduced into this House.</P>

      <P>It was delayed for something like two or three months by amendments which were brought forward, some of which were pressed and some withdrawn, and efforts were made to make Deputies visualise what awful things would happen if it were put into effect&mdash;how property rights would be encroached upon and how hardships would be caused to farmers by its implementation.  Everybody knows now that all that was groundless. Everybody knows that it has worked out, as it was planned to work out, as one of the greatest boons ever presented to the local authorities. Those of us who have any connection at all with rural areas know that very well.</P>
      <P>It has another side to it in which I am vitally interested, that is, the question of employment.  It will be recalled that when the road grants were cut some time ago, a very determined effort was made here to create the impression that this would mean wholesale and mass unemployment for years for those who had been engaged in county council work.  What are the facts?  The facts, if analysed, will prove that there are more workers engaged by local authorities at the present time upon road and drainage work than ever there were before. That speaks for itself.  Certainly, in County Dublin, never in the history of local authorities were there as many men employed upon road work or drainage work as there are now.</P>
      <P>We are finding that drainage has not just the apparently negative value that roadwork sometimes has but that it has definite positive value to the community, particularly to those who are suffering from flooding, and there are many such cases throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Local Authorities (Works) Act has been a complete justification of the policy of the late Minister for Local Government and of the present Minister.  If it has not been availed of to the full in some counties, that is very regrettable.  I am not in a position to say what has happened in such counties where the grants have not been availed of to the full but I can say, as far as County Dublin is concerned, that every effort has been <Col N="935" /> made by the local authority as a united body to avail of these grants, with the result that the position in the county, generally, from the point of view of employment, has never been as good as it is now.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I would like to refer to the point made by Deputy Cogan to-day when he referred to the trade unions as being private or public monopolies.  I forget the exact term he used but, at any rate, he described them as monopolies.  It is well, when Deputies are discussing this question of the restriction on apprenticeships in skilled trades, and so on, that they should remember the background of these matters.  Trade unions, as they exist in this country, particularly the skilled trade unions, have a very long history, in some cases stretching back over 200 years.  Their path has not been a rosy one.  They have had to struggle to achieve some form of economic security for their members over a long time and they have memories of periods when unemployment was widespread and they know that unemployment, in our present social set up, generally makes for low wages.  So, when we talk in terms of trade unions being monopolies or when we speak of the restrictions in so far as skilled trades are concerned, we should consider the facts in their true perspective.</P>
    <P>I believe that the time has come when there should be some degree of relaxation so far as apprenticeships to skilled trades are concerned but, at the same time, it is not a wise thing that any trade or occupation should be thrown open to such an extent that there will not be a living in it for anybody. That can happen and has happened.</P>

      <P>I definitely agree.  That, of course, will eventually happen.  It will represent a contribution towards the solution of the housing problem.  It would be a contribution the effect of which would not be felt for some time. In my view, it would be as well for those whose contact with the trade union movement has been practically nil to refrain from pontificating about it.  The trade union movement is an integral part of our social set up.  It will remain so, no matter who likes or dislikes it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many hours have been spent in discussing this Estimate.  Most of the discussion centred on the question of housing.  I suggest that the main problem which is agitating the minds of Deputies and that of the Minister is housing costs.  I should like the Minister to pay careful attention to a story which I am about to tell him. Only two weeks ago a gentleman who acted as an agent of a merchant who <Col N="938" /> supplies such material for houses as baths, piping, taps, hand-basins, and so forth, informed me that during his time with the merchant it was a common occurrence that when a local authority advertised in a newspaper for a supply of such material for direct labour schemes&mdash;at least two people had to submit an estimate before the official in charge of the scheme could accept a tender&mdash;they would report to the office of their organisation in Dublin and that it would be decided there which merchant should secure each particular contract and that the other members of the organisation would be informed that they were to tender at a particular figure.  If that is correct, I suggest that it is no wonder we claim there is a ring in connection with house building and house supplies.</P>
      <P>This gentleman further states that he has now gone into that very business and that he is prevented by Government regulations from supplying at a cheaper rate the very same material for our houses.  Should the Minister so desire, this gentleman is perfectly willing that I should give to the Minister in private his name and address when he will then supply to the Minister and his officials confirmation of that statement.  I suggest the Minister should accept that challenge and either prove that the gentleman in question is telling an untruth or, if he is telling the truth, have that system stopped. Houses are being built by direct labour with the intention of reducing the costs.  If such a thing could happen&mdash; and this statement was made in the presence of an engineer who agreed that such a thing could happen and is happening&mdash;the matter should be investigated immediately.  Houses are being built by direct labour with the intention of having them put up as cheaply as possible for the working people.  If such a state of affairs can exist under the present system, then it is a shame for us to allow it to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to stress upon the Minister the necessity for his continued support of direct labour in house building.  When direct labour was started some two years ago it was put into operation with the intention of forcing the contractors to bring their <Col N="939" /> prices down to a reasonable level.  At that time they had a firm and closed ring and they were quoting figures that would have made it impossible for us to house our working people.  Direct labour has broken that ring.  The prices quoted by housing contractors are now dropping to somewhat near the figures of houses being put up by direct labour.  I am afraid that the Department is inclined to suggest to the councils that direct labour has served its purpose and that we should now rely upon the contractors.  Now that we have the organised set-up and that we have the men trained in house building, it is the duty of the Minister to give local authorities who were anxious to proceed with all their schemes by direct labour the full co-operation of his Department and sanction if asked for.  Over 50 per cent. of our cottages in County Waterford have been built by direct labour.  Only last Monday, our housing officer was questioned as to whether or not the houses he had put up could compare with those put up by contract.  He was able to prove to the satisfaction of the members that not only had we got better houses, not only had we got them quicker, but that we had got them cheaper in every case than those built by contract.  Equally so in the case of the Dungarvan housing scheme, which was one of the first schemes initiated by the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy T.J. Murphy.  We are now in the last month of completing 74 houses.  I understand that, in respect of that scheme&mdash; although the final figures are not yet available&mdash;we shall save some £20,000. We shall save that sum of money although we have installed electric fittings and electric light bulbs, and although we have built concrete surrounds where, in a former estimate, these were to be built of posts and wire.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry, in his speech on this Estimate, claimed that certain extra provision should be made by the Minister because of the condition of the roads and particularly those in his own constituency in East Cork.  I suggest to Deputy Corry that if his county council had acted as the Waterford County Council acted and availed of <Col N="940" /> the grants given by the Fianna Fáil Government when they were in office to bring back the roads to a proper state of repair&mdash;and that if they had put up the money during 1946, 1947 and 1948&mdash;the roads would now be in the same condition as they are in County Waterford.</P>
    <P>Further, I would suggest that with the substitution of the Local Authorities (Works) Act we can do work that we could never do under the ordinary road schemes and we are deriving great benefit from that Act.  I should like to repeat what Deputy Dunne has said&mdash;that that Act, which was put through this House by the late Minister for Local Government, Deputy T. J. Murphy, has proved a boon to the councils, ratepayers and the workers of the councils.  Under that Act essential work which could not have been attempted under any other scheme can be done and has been done.  As well as that, men who might otherwise have been unemployed were put into productive employment.</P>
    <P>I desire to refer to a point made by Deputy Corry and I agree with it and ask the Minister if anything can be done in connection with the vesting of labourers' cottages.  It would appear that in my county a considerable number of cottages were built without proper title being secured.  Now there is a hold-up; there has been for the past three or four years.  Officials have come to Dublin and endeavoured to solve this problem.  I appeal to the Minister to give, through his Department, whatever help is possible&mdash;to give us a chance of having the cottages vested in those tenants who are prepared to purchase them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOReilly" hpid="Mr. P. O'Reilly Mr. P. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House very long.  To go over the ground that has been covered by so many Deputies would just be like drawing turf to the bog.  I want to draw attention to a forgotten section of the community.  I refer to the people of rural Ireland who are living, as they say, at the back of the hills. The roads that lead to their homes are more like cattle tracks than anything else.  We hear a good deal of talk about providing amenities for city and <Col N="941" /> town dwellers, but those people of whom I speak, although they contribute their share in rates and taxes, are neglected when it comes to providing roads to their homes.  The best they can do is to apply under the rural improvements scheme, under which they are called upon to put up 25 per cent. of the cost of the repair of a road leading to their homes.</P>
      <P>These roads have been so long neglected that to put them in a proper state of repair would involve a considerable expenditure, even with the 25 per cent.  I have known cases where four or five homes along one of those boreens were called upon to pay £80, £90 or £100, and that does not appear fair in these days when amenities of all descriptions are provided for the people living in more favourable situations along public roads, in the towns, or adjacent to the towns.</P>
      <P>I understand that this thing first arose about 1925.  Up to that period the county councils used to strike a special rate for the repair of by-roads and cul-de-sac roads.  At that period this work was diverted to the Board of Works and these roads were to be brought under an unemployment grant. The result has been that a big proportion of them were done about once in ten years.  In many cases they were not attended to at all.  In consequence, they have become very bad and the cost of putting them into a proper condition would indeed be a big item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An improvement is contemplated by the introduction of an amendment to the legislation whereby those people will be called upon to put up a smaller contribution; but even with that there would seem to be some injustice.  It appears to be only reasonable that anyone who contributes his due share to the rates for the provision of good roads should not be asked to contribute specially towards the construction or maintenance of a road to his own home.  I suggest that some arrangement should be come to whereby, if it is a case of having to do some work under a rural improvements scheme, the Department should make it possible for county councils to contribute out of the rates the required 25 per cent. or whatever smaller contribution <Col N="942" /> is decided upon.  In that way the work could be carried out to the satisfaction of all concerned.  These boreens and cul-de-sac roads constitute an important issue in my county, and I trust the Minister will give serious attention to the suggestions I have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardWalsh" hpid="Mr. R. Walsh Mr. R. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not very much to say and I rise merely to get some information from the Minister. As regards cottage holders, what are their legal rights?  Can they dispose of their interest in the cottages?  Cases have come under my notice recently and there seems to be some confusion as to their position and I would like the Minister to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>I have heard a lot of talk about roads and anybody who is a member of a local authority will realise that roads are becoming an almost impossible burden so far as the ratepayers are concerned.  Undoubtedly the position has been reached when the main highways, anyhow, will have to become a national charge, wholly borne by the State.  Even then there will only be a slight relief.</P>
      <P>We have heard much talk about the ratepayer and the burden he is carrying. No doubt he is carrying a very big burden.  When you analyse the expenditure in any county, and set apart the cost of maintenance of institutions such as the county hospital, the mental home, the county home and other buildings under the control of the local authority, and then when you consider administrative charges and the cost of the county staff, and when you see the comparatively small percentage of the money collected from the ratepayers that is expended for the direct benefit of the people of the county, you will be simply astounded.  I believe that anybody who seriously examines that aspect must conclude that if anything in this country needs a thorough inquiry it is the expenditure of local bodies and the cost of local government generally.  In my opinion it requires the closest scrutiny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a new Bill on the stocks. It is not going to settle local government any more than past legislation has settled it.  There is one outstanding <Col N="943" /> fact in relation to local government and that is that there is a complete lack of knowledge among the general run of our people of what it costs or what it means.  What they do not know is that out of every £10 collected from the ratepayers only £1 goes to the benefit of the people who pay the money and the rest goes in the cost of administration. That is the actual position. I believe that if the bulk of the people realised how their money is being expended there would be an insistent call for reform of a drastic character.</P>
    <P>Some speakers, the Parliamentary Secretary for Local Government among them, mentioned increasing costs and he also referred to the negligence of Fianna Fáil in regard to housing&mdash;if he did not mention it other speakers did; I think Deputy Dunne made a great lot of it.  All that I have to say in that connection is that in my county we have done a considerable amount of house building, but not enough.  We must remember that when Fianna Fáil was in office there was a great war and a shortage of materials&mdash;there is no denying that.  I do not know what delays may have arisen in County Dublin and elsewhere.  Undoubtedly there were obstacles in a lot of cases and these caused delay.  I do not think there is a lot to be got by saying: &ldquo;We did so much and you did so much&rdquo;. The problem is there for us to solve and we must do our best to solve it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish said that he would like to have evidence of certain cases. There is one outstanding case.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not making any accusation against the present Minister because he had nothing whatever to do with it.  What happened was as a result of the reorganisation of the Hospitals Trust.  I have no hesitation in saying that a group of people lost their jobs there, to put it bluntly, because they were Fianna Fáil. There is no denying that.  It was one of the meanest and most despicable things that occurred in our time here. It was the case of two or three men who had national records that could hardly be challenged, and I do not <Col N="944" /> think their private characters or business capacity could be challenged either.  I would not have mentioned this case at all were it not for the challenge that was thrown down by the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would again ask the Minister if he would have the matter which I referred to cleared up.</P>
    <P>There is another question, and that is the provision of public health schemes for small towns throughout the country.  Quite a number of them are very badly provided for from the public health point of view, especially in regard to water supplies and sewerage works.  In my opinion, organised schemes of this kind should be introduced, particularly for the small towns in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make about labourers' cottages, but, before doing so, I should like to reply to a statement made by Deputy Kyne about roads.  He said that if Fianna Fáil had provided moneys for the roads that they would not be in the bad state they are in to-day.  The reverse is the case.  In County Galway, as a result of the reduction in the road grants, I think the county lost a sum of about £200,000 last year.  I want to relate that to the hardship which is inflicted on a very large section of the population in one part of Connemara. I refer to the roads connecting the islands on the south coast of Connemara, particularly the districts of Lettermore, Gorumna and Lettermullen. As a result of the cutting down of the road grants, the bridges and causeways there have been left in a state of semi-completion.  The result is that the Córas Iompair Éireann services have been suspended, and that a very large population has been denied this service.  I did ask a few questions about it, but I now want to impress on the Minister the very grave hardship which is being inflicted on those people and to ask him to do what he can to see that the necessary money is provided so that, in co-operation with the Galway County Council, the works there will be completed as soon as possible and that the bus service may be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to labourers' cottages, there is one aspect of this question <Col N="945" /> which I want to bring to the Minister's attention.  It is that there are places where it is very difficult to get sites for cottages.  I think it would be interesting if a survey were made by the county councils of the number of derelict houses, particularly in small towns.  There is a Derelict Sites Act, and it seems to me that this question of providing sites for labourers' cottages could be linked up with the administration of that Act.  It is a fact that a considerable number of houses have been allowed to become derelict by the landlords in those small towns for some reason or another.  It may be that they do not want to undertake the costs of repair, or that they feel that, if they did so, they would not get an economic rent for the houses.  Whatever the reason, the houses are left derelict.  In some places, I know that the county councils cannot get a sufficient number of sites on which to build cottages.  I want to bring that matter to the special attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question which I want to refer to, namely the provision of cottages in rural areas, which are situated some distance out from the local towns.  Land is more easily obtainable in these rural areas, but the machinery provided for the getting of the land and for the building of the cottages is rather slow. There are a great many applicants for cottages in these rural areas who would be capable of building their own houses in co-operation with fellow applicants&mdash;just as small farmers build houses&mdash;if sites were provided for them.  I suggest that, where they would be prepared to do that, a larger grant should be made to them than that which is available to the ordinary applicant for a house.  I imagine that if what I suggest were done the work of building cottages would go on more speedily and that the cost would be somewhat less than the cost of a cottage built by contract.  It has been suggested to me that a scheme of that sort would be availed of by a considerable number of applicants for labourers' cottages.  I commend the idea to the Minister for his consideration.</P>

      <P>The annual review which takes place on the Estimate for the Department affords Deputies from the different parts of the country an opportunity of expressing their views on the main problems which have been engaging the attention of the Department during the previous year, and of directing attention to what they regard as the shortcomings of the Administration. It also furnished the Minister with a very good opportunity of appreciating the difficulties or the shortcomings that may reveal themselves. I think I can say that the two days' discussion has been, in the main, very helpful to me.  There were indications given to me as to how I might improve and better the objectives which I am aiming at with the help of my officials.</P>
      <P>Deputies from every part of the country have given expression to their views as to the methods we are using and as to whether we could not do something better.  In the main, as I said, the discussion has been helpful.  I should say that some of the matters referred to were irrelevant because they do not come under the control of my Department at all.  Apart from that, the discussion was of a helpful nature.  I hope to benefit by it and to improve in some directions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two main subjects discussed were housing and roads.  They are the two main problems with which the Department is concerned.  Deputy MacEntee led off for the Opposition.  He, and some other Opposition Deputies, madeobjection to my quoting figures relating to the rate of progress that has been made in regard to housing.  I want to say that I have never, either privately or publicly, in any utterances that I have made on this subject made any comparison with what somebody else had done.  I simply gave, for the benefit of the House and the country, figures relating to the day-to-day and the year-to-year progress of the housing drive. In doing so, I was not making any boast or trying to score about the lack of preparation or the great preparation, that had been made by my predecessors. I think that would be a perfectly wrong approach to make.  I deprecate anyone, either from my own side of the House or from the Opposition <Col N="947" /> side, trying to give a political tinge or flavour to the housing drive. I have never lent myself to anything like that and never will.  I think to try to create an atmosphere of that kind would certainly not be to the advantage of the housing drive in which we are all engaged.  It is in the interests of everybody to get it speeded up to the utmost extent.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEntee referred to the number of sites that they had when they were the Government.  I have figures here as to the sites that were available when we started operations in 1948, and particulars relating to the number of sites that have been acquired since then.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into detail It is, I think, sufficient for me to say that the housing drive is going on splendidly.  There can be no question at all about that.  We have speeded up the output of houses to an extent that we did not think would be possible 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>As every Deputy knows, this does take a good deal of preparation.  One cannot always guarantee the maximum of speed in a short time.  I think we have good reason to be satisfied with the acceleration that has taken place in what one might fairly describe as the second year of the housing drive. We all know the long lapse there was in housing because of the war, the absence of materials and the flight from this country to Britain of our young men in search of work.  We had during those years neither the men nor the materials.  When we did get going eventually the problem had intensified itself.  We were faced with a colossal problem which required the attention and help of everybody in order to tackle it.  Not only has the Department of Local Government reason to be proud, but I think everybody has reason to be satisfied with the very considerable progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>Some of the Deputies advocated direct labour.  We are utilising both direct and contract labour and I think it is essential to utilise both of these classes in this drive.  If normality <Col N="948" /> obtained here I would not have any desire to take the building of houses away from those whose normal business it is.  But I could not afford to wait for normal times.  Because we are living in abnormal times we had to crush into service every man that could be got on both the direct labour and the contract side.  We did have grave difficulty in getting contractors to come forward at times. Competition was not been enough.  But I am very grateful for the efforts that have been made and the contributions offered by way of direct labour towards the completion of this drive and, more particularly, I am very grateful for the effect that has had in helping to bring prices down somewhat. Prices have not come down to anything like the extent to which we would like them to come down, but we have to face facts.</P>
    <P>We are living in a world of realism. Materials are not in full supply, prices are high and labour costs are high. All we can do is try to get the maximum results and the best possible value for the money that is expended from everybody engaged in the drive, realising that it is the sort of enterprise that can be exploited by either direct or contract labour.</P>
    <P>I heard one Deputy suggest to-day that if one has a contract labour scheme, the local authority is likely to exploit themselves.  I think that was the net result of the argument advanced, and that one cannot be exploited by a contractor if he is properly watched by the engineers; there is great danger one may exploit oneself if one does the work by direct labour.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity of expressing my very sincere gratitude to the local authorities, both urban and rural, for the magnificent efforts they are making to <Col N="949" /> join in this drive for the relieving of the housing shortage.  We may hear complaints from some particular place that they are not as far forward as they might be.  Everyone cannot be first.  The heartening thing is that everybody wants to be in the front line. It is very heartening to me, as it must be to every Deputy, to see the cooperative effort that is being made and to realise that, because of that coordinated drive, there is now no danger but that there will be an early solution of the housing problem.  We must also bear in mind in relation to that matter that it is not alone Dublin, Cork, Waterford or Limerick that one must deal with; it is the country as a whole that is our concern.  I think Deputy McGrath suggested that we should not build so much in the rural areas to the exclusion of Cork City.  There may possibly be complaints of that kind.</P>

I had approaches made to me by people in high places appealing to me not to do so much building in the cities to the exclusion of the country and I was happy to be able to tell them that that was not happening. We want to keep as many as we possibly can on the land and away from the cities altogether, if we can possibly manage it.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with housing.  I want to refer briefly now to the roads.  The Parliamentary Secretary made a short reply to-day in that connection. Naturally, I would like to have more money for the roads.  I do not suppose there was ever a Minister for Local Government who would not have liked to get more money if he could get it out of his colleague, the Minister for Finance.  I, like Deputy Corry, would like more money for the roads, if I could get it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with roads now.  I am not prepared to admit that the roads are gone to pot, as was alleged by some Deputies.  At the <Col N="951" /> moment we are allocating £2,300,000 from the Central Fund towards a total expenditure of £4,600,000.  In 1938-39, before the outbreak of war, the contribution from the Central Fund was £700,000 out of a total expenditure of £2,300,000.  In 1938-39 one-third was given.  We are now contributing half and we are giving three times as much again as was given before the war.  In addition to that, under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, there is a contribution of £1,600,000; that can be added to the £2,300,000, because the work done under that Act will have a certain effect upon the roads particularly in those areas where the roads were liable to damage by flooding. There is as much money now being given to the county councils as was given in the peak year following the hold-up of the moneys collected in the Road Fund; I refer to the allocation made in the years 1946, 1947 and 1948. Excellent work is being done on the roads because of the Road Fund grant plus the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  Considerable employment is being provided.  We have been asked by some Deputies not to allow a situation to arise where agricultural workers might be diverted from their normal labours to these other works.  That is a matter we leave to the discretion of the local authorities but we advise them to examine all the local circumstances surrounding the spending of these moneys in an effort to avoid any clash with ordinary agricultural work. The county councils must have a discretion. They must use their own common sense in avoiding taking people away from agricultural work when it is available in order to carry out schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act which can be carried out outside of the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to have more money to spend upon the roads.  I think there is a slight improvement, that there is a build up noticeable already.  The contribution being made for the construction of county and main roads, and the ordinary maintenance grant that is being given, is more than going to hold its own against the increase in traffic, in my opinion, and stretches <Col N="952" /> of road have been brought back into proper construction by degrees.  You cannot do the whole thing at once. Deputy Cogan said to-day it was hardly worth while doing it at all, as we were doing so little.  He seemed to want us to do everything overnight, which is not a sensible proposition. These things can only be done piece-meal, doing a certain amount of construction each year and carrying on the ordinary maintenance.  I believe that in a short time we will have recovered the lost ground and brought the roads back into proper condition.</P>
    <P>I agree thoroughly with Deputy Childers' remarks on this, about which he has considerable experience.  He says that the concrete road would eventually justify itself, and I can endorse that heartily.  I have experience of roads put into concrete as long as 20 years ago, streets on the one hand and roads on the other, and I believe if we could have all road in concrete the expenditure would justify itself. At the present time, however, I could not indulge in that luxury.  Cement is very scarce.  We imported about 300,000 tons of it and we manufactured some 400,000 and we want all that for housing and urgent hospital work, so at present it is hard to devote any great portion of it to road building. There are places where we have to utilise it for road building, for stretches of bog road where we have to reinforce the road and use concrete. For general purposes, however, we will have to carry on until the housing problems are nearer solu tion than at present, or until we have an increased output of cement&mdash;which we hope to have in the next year or two by the additions to the factories at Mungret and Drogheda.  We are doing the best we can on the roads. We would like to do more, but while we have the necessities of housing calling for cement, we must look to the county councils at least to maintain them or improve on the present position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister one question, since he has made such a nice reference to what I have said?  Has he tried the little calculation of £225 doing the work of £100, on the Minister for Finance yet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of the scarcity of materials, which is the principal trouble.  Deputy MacEntee asked me about the text-book on the law relating to local government.  That has been completed and it would already have been published, but it was considered undesirable to issue it for permanent reference with a summary of the existing county management system included in it, in case that system is to be reviewed.  Meanwhile, the author is engaged in the further task of preparing for the consolidation of the sanitary law.  There is at present before the Seanad the Local Government (Repeal of Enactments) Bill, to repeal obsolete Acts and to prune the dead-wood from the legal framework of local government.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee complains about our administration having been too costly and our Government spending too much.  We are not spending too much.  We are spending a good deal more than in his last Estimate, if you compare one with the other.  In that spending, where he spent £300,000 on private housing grants we are spending £1,635,000.  We are making a new provision of £1,750,000 under the Local Authorities (Works) Act.  These two increases come to £3,085,000.  If you take these amounts spent on essential works you find the corresponding amount is only £300,000 in the last Estimate of Fianna Fáil.  I believe, as I said earlier, that the money is not being spent in squandermania fashion. It is being spent on useful and necessary works and the county councils realise the necessity to improve the amenities and health of the people. There is no wasteful extravagance in the moneys being spent by local authorities or by the Department of Local Government, having regard to the high costs and the determination of the local bodies to do the best they can in improving the amenities of the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke and Deputy MacEntee were inquiring about <Col N="954" /> the North Dublin regional water supply scheme.  It has been approved in principle.  Outline plans have been approved and the Department is now awaiting the submission of contract documents by the county council.  Regarding the Howth scheme which Deputy Cowan was asking about, it has progressed as far as possible. Deputy Cowan suggests taking the job in three shifts, as if it merely meant sinking holes and laying down pipes.  But there is considerable engineering work to be done and detailed surveys to be made.  All pressure is being brought to bear to bring the work nearer to completion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>We realise the essentiality of that scheme, as in one and a half or two years it would constitute a serious hold-up in the Dublin housing programme on the north side if it had not been completed by then.  Deputy MacEntee felt like twitting me on being pusillanimous in abandoning the Bray Road scheme.  As a matter of fact, I have not abandoned it, as I never had it at all on hands to abandon it.  I am prepared to accept the good advice he gave me, that it be abandoned pending the local election, and that when the election is over it be brought out again.  There will not be an election in that local authority area until 1953.  If the county council submits it again at that time and if I am knocking around here, I will consider what I should do about it, but we will leave it at present in the list of dim and distant future possibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe said, and rightly, that families of seven or eight or over are put into small houses by the corporation and these have since grown to ten adults and that there is no proper segregation of the sexes and he asked that some provision should be made in relation to Small Dwelling Acquisition Act houses.  I realise that fully.  By far the greater proportion of Dublin Corporation houses consist of four-roomed houses.  Up to the <Col N="955" /> present, these houses have been admittedly of a somewhat low accommodation standard.  This enabled the maximum output of houses to be achieved within the shortest possible time.  The Dublin Corporation are now arranging for an increase in the floor area of the four-roomed houses to be built in future schemes, and provision is being made for a proportion of fiveroomed houses to meet the needs of large families.  It is the general experience of the corporation that large families rehoused by them tend to decrease rather than increase, due to children leaving the house on marriage, etc.  Where families have increased, transfers are arranged to larger houses and in fact the corporation have gone so far as to allocate two houses to a single large family. The addition of extra accommodation to corporation houses would involve expenditure which would be proportionately very high.  The question of designing a Small Dwellings Act house in such a way as to permit of extra rooms being added is a matter for the individual who will occupy the house. The new Housing Bill proposes to provide State assistance in urban areas for reconstruction work, including the addition of accommodation to a house after a lapse of 15 years and this provision should meet the point raised by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>I would also say, in respect of the point made by Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick&mdash;that suggestions made to Ministers go in one ear and out the other&mdash;that I do not think the Deputy is quite right there.  Ministers get many suggestions which have to go that way, as one cannot give effect to them.  His suggestion was to build small one-storey houses and to put on another storey later when the family had increased.  That was considered and some plans of houses were submitted to my Department.  The matter was very seriously considered but it was not eventually approved of.  Personally, I do not think it is an attractive proposition to build houses of one storey and then build another storey on top.  After a while you would have some people wanting an extra storey while others would not want it, <Col N="956" /> so that the whole scheme would have a higgledy-piggledy appearance.  I would rather have the small houses such as are being built at present in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and other cities for old couples and newly-weds. The newly-weds can be transferred from these into larger houses subsequently and have the first call on them on the expiration of four or five years, if the size of their family justifies it.  There are cases of some fairly big estates on which an interchange from a small house to a big house can take place.  I should like to say to Deputy Fitzpatrick that it was not a question of ignoring the suggestion he made, but it was not found to be one which commended itself to the Department.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe was anxious about abatements in connection with differential rents.  That is provided for in the scheme of differential rents.  Under the scheme there can be adjustments made according as the circumstances of the tenants improve or disimprove. Otherwise it would be impossible to carry it on, because you might inflict hardship on some people.  Provision is made in some cases for an inquiry every six months so that there may be a periodic revision of the rents paid by people on these schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe also wanted the Minister to state in connection with corporation housing that as long as the corporation has to continue large-scale building the State will see that there is no hold up due to money if the corporation fail to get the required funds at economic interest rates.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated and I have stated on the authority of the Government that there will be no financial hold up as far as housing is concerned.  A guarantee has been given by the Taoiseach, by the Minister for Finance, by the Minister for Local Government and by the Cabinet as a whole that the housing programme will not be held up for want of money so far as the finances of this State allow.</P>

      <P>They will get it as cheaply as we can get it ourselves.  I think the last provision was not a bad one in that <Col N="957" /> respect.  Deputy Dr. Brennan complained that the provision of local authority houses in Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown is totally inadequate.  I regret to say that Deputy Dr. Brennan thought fit to make what I consider was a rather vicious approach in presenting his case on behalf of Dún Laoghaire.  I think it was unwarranted.  I am prepared to take whatever is said about myself as Minister, but I do not think it is fair for a Deputy to make an attack such as was made by Deputy Dr. Brennan on the officials of the Department. I have been Minister for Local Government for just over a year, but I have an experience of the Local Government Department ranging over 20 years as an Opposition Deputy and most of that time as mayor of my own city, and I have always found the officials of the Department courteous, efficient and helpful.  Since I went to the Custom House I found that these officials are actuated by one desire, namely, to do the best they can to carry out the programme set down by the Dáil, irrespective of who is in control of the Government.  When Deputy Dr. Brennan was speaking he may have had in mind the occupants of the Custom House and the civil servants who were there in the early 1900's.  I do not think his remarks are applicable to the men who occupy the Custom House at present.  I think it was an unfair and unworthy attack to make upon them.</P>
      <P>The Deputy spoke about housing in Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown.  Deputy Brady also dealt with that matter this afternoon, but he did not find it necessary to make the same kind of personal abusive attack.  The position at Dún Laoghaire is that the housing needs are estimated at 1,000 houses.  Since March, 1947, 248 houses have been built.  At the moment 367 are in course of erection and sites have been acquired for a further 122, making a total of 737.  Therefore, Dún Laoghaire is one of the most advanced places in the country so far as the housing programme is concerned and I cannot understand why Deputy Brennan is so perturbed about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy made a complaint about the allocation of houses which I should <Col N="958" /> like to take very serious notice of.  If the allocations are as stated by Deputy Brennan, I would be prepared to institute an inquiry at his request without any hesitation.  He put up a case which seemed to be a very bad type of case.  If he likes, I am prepared to set up an inquiry into that particular case with the Deputy's co-operation. The allocation of houses in Dún Laoghaire is on a par with the allocation in every other part of the country and the profession of which he is an honourable member has a very large part in the allocation of houses.  It is the medical officer of health who has to decide and help the manager and the corporation in the selection of tenants, irrespective of whoever is in charge. If there is a case of the kind the Deputy stated, I am prepared to have that investigated and inquired into and I am sure I will have the Deputy's co-operation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan expressed the hope that there is no substantial foundation for the <i>Irish Press</i> report that men were displaced recently from housing schemes in Dublin.  As a matter of fact, that was replied to by the city manager a week ago in the Press.  What was involved there merely was a change of contractors. The contractor whose men were let go had not succeeded in getting a further contract in recent competitions for contracts.  As far as the Dublin Corporation are aware, any suitable skilled man at the present time seeking work on corporation contracts is immediately taken on.  What happened was that one of the builders who had men employed on a contract did not succeed in getting another contract.  The corporation could not continue to give housing contracts to the existing contractor without having some competitive tendering. There was no question of unemployment being caused.  It was only a question of changing from one contractor to another.</P>

There does not seem to be much consistency between these two statements.  What I am giving to the Deputy is the correct explanation that the contractor did not get any new contracts.  Other people got them who had plenty of room for the workers to come to work with them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke stated that &ldquo;the present satisfactory housing progress in County Dublin is due to the previous Government having made the sites available.  Housing is however at a stand-still in a number of areas in the county due to difficulty in getting sites.&rdquo;  May I say that over 700 sites for cottages have been acquired in County Dublin since March, 1948, and provision is being made for the acquisition of over 1,000 further sites; 561 cottages have been completed since March, 1947, while a further 537 cottages are now in progress. Thus, houses to meet almost half the estimated needs of County Dublin have been or are being built, while active steps are being taken to acquire sufficient sites to meet the remainder of the estimated needs. That should be sufficiently satisfactory for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="961" /> Deputy MacEntee asked for some information in connection with the competitions for designs for housing schemes.  It is expected that the competitions will be completed in the present financial year.  The conditions of one competition are in proof and ready for the final printing while the conditions of the second are ready for printing.  For the third competition the draft conditions are before the relevant local authority (the Dublin Corporation) for examination and approval.</P>
    <P>A question that has caused considerable discussion is that of the slowness in having cottages vested in the occupier. This has caused considerable friction and annoyance.  We are doing all we can to speed up matters but the county council in all cases have the same complaint&mdash;the difficulty in establishing title.  Some sort of speeding-up processes will be necessary because some cases have been held up for three or four years.  I cannot say at the moment what is going to be the remedy but we have been pressing for speed in the matter.</P>

      <P>The question of spreading the cost of installation of water supplies and sewerage to householders over a number of years was raised by Deputy Childers.  The powers under the Act are ample to achieve this and no amendment is necessary.  These powers, in fact, go back to the Act of 1878.  A circular letter has issued referring to powers of local authorities <Col N="962" /> to connect and recover cost of installation by instalments.  There is no necessity for amending legislation in that case at all.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh wanted me to define an &ldquo;agricultural labourer.&rdquo;  The general definition is that any person who works for hire in a rural area is an agricultural labourer.  The Deputy asked whether, for instance, a man working on the rural electrification scheme would be an agricultural labourer.  In our opinion, such a man would come within the broad definition. There are further definitions but, in case of priorities, a man who would be working on the land and tilling the land, who had the same number of children and an equally unsuitable house as a man working on a rural electrification scheme, would have priority over the man working on the rural electrification scheme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowan suggested that proceedings for evictions for non-payment of rent were initiated on the instructions of the Department.  That is not correct.  The Minister has no functions in regard to the administration of housing estates beyond seeing that the allocations are made in accordance with the subsidy and letting regulations. The control and management of housing estates is vested by statute in local authorities.</P>

      <P>There is one point to which I wish to refer to specially. Deputy McGrath and Deputy Brady also referred to a statement which I was supposed to have made in Cork. I do not want to be tarred with any brush which I do not deserve.  My recollection is that Mr. Monahan, the Cork City manager, was the last speaker at a luncheon following the opening of the Ballyphehane scheme where I was the chief guest.  There was no opportunity for any official comments on his remarks which included a statement of the old Manchester theory of restricting employment so that there may not be resultant unemployment when the programme was finished.  I am sure the Deputy did not expect me at that <Col N="963" /> stage of the proceedings to contradict the manager.</P>

      <P>Deputy Commons and a number of other Deputies referred to the delay in dealing with housing grants.  He referred to a period of two years in many cases.  I think there must be some little exaggeration in that and I should be glad if the Deputy would send us particulars of cases in which he says there has been two years' delay, and I shall have the matter attended to immediately.  While there may have been some delays, in the main payments have been regularly made.  You are bound to have some little irregularities where such a huge number of payments are involved.  We have put on additional inspectors recently because following the dark period of the year, when there was not so much work doing, there has been an increase in the number of houses that are being built and the work is being accelerated every day.  As I say, we put on a number of additional inspectors recently and no avoidable delay should take place in the future in giving people the money they have bargained for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Beegan referred to the cancellation of the grant in retrospective cases.  Retrospective plans under Section 17 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, related to houses begun before 1st November, 1947, and were subject to the erection being completed on or before 1st April, 1950&mdash;a two and <Col N="964" /> a half year period.  In every case where the Department's records showed that work was incomplete at the beginning of 1950, a warning was issued to the applicant for the grant in mid-January last.  This warning notice was published in the city and provincial newspapers and was broadcast on the radio.  The particular case referred to by the Deputy is on the facts being regarded as eligible for a grant which will be paid shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan asked that the transfer of cottages to tenants be facilitated. The Labourers Act is being looked into at the moment with a view to introducing amending legislation to speed that matter up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan also suggested that small contractors were being forced out.  The very opposite is the fact. There is no question of small contractors being forced out but they are actually being hauled in.</P>
    <P>The question of the Derry River was referred to by Deputy Cogan and Deputy Brennan.  The position is that the grant in 1949-50 was £17,720 and the total grant this year was £12,500, making a total of £30,220.  Of this sum £5,000 was allocated early and the balance, £7,500, is now being approved for the completion of the work that the council has taken on.  That is not the completion of the entire scheme as envisaged by the county council because it aimed at an expenditure of £84,000 and the chief engineer of the Department did not consider that the expenditure of that money would be warranted by the results.  The scheme aims at improving the speed and fall of the Derry River into the River Slaney. Carlow is prepared to do the short stretch for which they are responsible and there should definitely be an improvement in the flow into the Slaney. The other possibility which envisaged a total of £84,000 has not been approved by the Department engineers who have been on the spot and examined it and took a very careful interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan referred to the question of rates.  I adverted to this question in my opening speech when I pointed out that since 1938-39 Government grants to local authorities have <Col N="965" /> improved by over £10,000,000 whereas rates have risen by £4.6 million.  In 1948-49 and 1949-50 Government grants to local authorities exceeded the rates collected.  The figures are: 1948-49, total rates collected were £9,500,000 and State grants £10,749,000; in 1949-50 rates collected were £10,900,000 and State grants were £13,649,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kilroy stated that Mayo had not got a main road improvement grant this year.  A grant of £34,500 has been allocated to the county council for main road improvements this year and £73,200 for county road improvements. It is left to the local authority to decide how these grants are to be applied and what roads they are going to spend them on.</P>
    <P>With reference to the question of increased valuations I want to repeat again that my Department has no responsibility whatever for the increase in valuations.  It is a statutory obligation on rate collectors to make reports on certain institutions or holdings to the valuation office but at no stage does the Local Government office enter into it.  I want to state that flatly and categorically because this idea has been going into circulation throughout the country and those gentlemen in the country have been very active on the question of increased valuations and I have been pestered by fellows&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry and Deputy O'Gorman spoke of the question of Youghal Bridge.  The recon struction is primarily a matter for the local authorities concerned.  Cork <Col N="966" /> County Council have applied for a bridge Order for the construction of a new bridge and they have been asked for a preliminary report prior to the holding of a local inquiry.  Before they furnish a preliminary report they will require to make trial borings as advised by their consulting engineer. Approval has been issued to this proposal. A special grant of £5,000 has been allocated well over a year ago to help the council in the financing of the work of preparing the preliminary report and it is for them to see to its expeditious preparation.  I want to say that we will not push that bridge one inch up or down stream.  It will go where the local authority and their engineers want it.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath suggests that different treatment has been given to Cork with regard to Transition Development Fund grants, treatment less favourable than has been given to Limerick, but that is entirely wrong.  The Limerick schemes were <i>prima facie</i> eligible from the beginning. The figures given by the Limerick people disclose that there would be a loss on the scheme.  In the Cork scheme <i>prima facie</i> evidence was furnished by the Cork Corporation that the rents fixed by them for a large number of these 182 houses would be sufficient to meet all the cost.  These rents were fixed on the initiative of the Cork Corporation itself.  The scheme was, it appears, intended for a special class who could pay the full rents. Transition Development Fund grants are not allocated for the purpose of enabling a local authority to make a profit on their scheme.  State grants and subsidies should be given only where they are needed.  The position in which the Minister has been placed by the corporation is that there is grave doubt that there is a loss on these schemes which would justify the Transition Development Fund grant being paid.  An opportunity arose lately for a fresh examination of the position in Cork.  Discussions took place at the Department with local <Col N="967" /> representatives and local officials. Further figures are being examined and it is hoped to bring the matter to its final stage within a few weeks.</P>

      <P>On occasions, the subject matter of motions has been discussed with Estimates.  As the Deputy is aware, and as I have already stated, there is only one motion before the House at a time.  What was before the House was: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; There was a misunderstanding, or an oversight.  There was some mistake made which gave the Deputy a wrong idea of an agreement.  There was no such agreement.  The agreement would have to be by the Government to give Government time for the formal moving and seconding of the Deputy's motion and the taking of a division.  Neither the Minister not the Cabinet knew it, through some misunderstanding.  I did not know it and consequently the Government are not giving time for a division on it.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The general purposes of the Bill are to remedy certain defects in existing housing legislation which have come to light from experience, to supplement the existing statutory powers of local authorities in relation to housing, to amend the law governing the administration of State assistance towards private enterprise housing and to confer a number of new powers on both the Minister and the local authorities for the purpose of securing a more effective implementation of the housing programme.</P>
      <P>Even under the existing law, our housing activities in both central and local administration have been now so accelerated that we expect in the present year to re-establish the levels of output in housing which had been reached before the world war and its aftermath caused practically a complete shut down in the work of rehousing. It is, I know, the wish of all parties that these levels should not only be reached and maintained but that they should be raised.  The practical object of this Bill is to clear the way for this purpose and provide a better legislative basis for that comprehensive expansion in operations which both local authorities and private persons are now prepared to undertake.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year, Deputies showed a keen and, from my point of view, a welcome interest in housing progress.  In addition to the views and suggestions put forward to me in this House from time to time, I have also had the advantage of having discussed <Col N="972" /> with many representative bodies, mainly local authorities, in the past year a considerable number of matters affected by anomalies, restrictions or deficiencies in the present housing code.  As the contents of the present Bill are largely based on the experience thus gained, I have every reason to believe that it will meet with general acceptance.</P>
    <P>I propose to explain first the provisions of the Bill dealing with the matters administered primarily or directly by the Minister for Local Government. The main items in this category relate to the conditions and procedure governing the making of State grants to private enterprise engaged in erecting or reconstructing houses. Private enterprise is a considerable part of the national housing effort and since 1924, its importance as a contributory factor towards solving the housing problem has been recognised in successive Acts.  The Bill makes a number of important changes in the existing law dealing with this subject.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the abolition of the existing prohibition on the payment of second grants towards reconstruction work, provided a period of 15 years has elapsed since the date of completion of erection or reconstruction of the house for which the first grant was given. &ldquo;Reconstruction&rdquo; for the purposes of the second grant must involve the provision of a new roof or the increasing of the extent of the accommodation afforded by the house.  Applications involving works of ordinary maintenance will not be considered.</P>
    <P>A number of applications for second grants have been received in recent years and it is felt that a strong case exists for the removal of the existing restriction.  As the statutes under which reconstruction grants were made available date back to 1924, it is reasonable to assume that a substantial number of houses dealt with in the succeeding decade are now in need of further alterations or repairs necessary to prolong their habitability.  It is not intended that reconstruction grants will be paid at the end of 15 years as a matter of course and applications will be carefully examined in every instance <Col N="973" /> to ensure that the work of reconstruction is necessary for the purpose of rendering the houses more suitable for human habitation.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in Section 11 to remove the statutory requirements laid down in Section 5 (3) (e) of the 1932 Act, which provides that a grant shall not be paid in respect of the reconstruction of a house unless, before reconstruction commences, such house was certified by an officer appointed by the Minister to be suitable for reconstruction. The effect will be that the work may be certified subsequent to its commencement.  The enforcement of the existing requirement has resulted in considerable administrative difficulties, and has also created hardship in cases where applicants proceeded with work in ignorance of the law.  It is felt that adequate safeguards dealing with such cases can be better provided for administratively than under an inflexible statutory restriction.</P>
    <P>Section 9 of the Bill proposes to include property which was the subject of an award under the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, in the categories for which grants under the Housing Acts will not be made available. Compensation payable under the Neutrality (War Damage to Property) Act, 1941, was made conditional on the owner erecting new buildings, and it is desired to ensure that State assistance in such cases will not be duplicated.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed in Section 15 to amend the Act of 1948, by raising from £35 to £50 the maximum aggregate of the rateable value of the agricultural holding of an applicant for a reconstruction grant, thus ensuring in effect that over 90 per cent. of the farming class will become eligible for these grants.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for a new type of reconstruction grant in urban and rural areas.  In urban areas the grant will be available to persons having control of working-class dwellings not exceeding £12 valuation and in rural areas it will be available to persons having control of houses with a similar valuation limit who are not already eligible for the existing reconstruction grants on the grounds that they are not agricultural labourers or <Col N="974" /> persons who derive their living solely or mainly from agriculture.</P>
    <P>Persons thus being made eligible for such grants include such classes as domestic servants, fishermen, serving soldiers, nurses, midwives, teachers, and local and State servants.  The exclusion of these classes in the past undoubtedly created undesirable anomalies and it is felt that the removal of the bar on eligibility is long overdue. The cost of reconstruction will be met equally by the applicant, the local authority and the State, subject to the contributions of the local authority and the State not exceeding £80 each. It will not be obligatory on the local authority to make a grant.  If they decline to do so the State will not withhold its own grant on this account, except in the cases of the four county boroughs and the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  The general purpose of the provision is to forestall decay and to avert obsolescence of property. Obsolescence in towns of all sizes is a matter which might impose heavy future liabilities on both the State and local authorities and it is important that existing houses of the working-class type should last as long as possible.  The operation of this provision will, I hope, result in a reduction of capital expenditure on new housing.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, grants are payable to private persons and public utility societies for the erection of houses for owner-occupation.  That Act terminated the system of grants for speculative building and replaced it by a system which required a private person to enter into a contract for the erection of a house as a condition precedent to the payment of a grant.  At present, therefore, grants cannot be given for the purchase of a completed house; nor if the contract is entered into after the commencement of the building operations.  It has been strongly represented to me on numerous occasions that these restrictions have had an adverse effect on private building activities, and have resulted in the creation of a number of serious difficulties and hardships both for the intending purchaser and the builder.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> The purchaser is required to enter into commitments at the stage when the only visual evidence of his house is represented by plans or drawings, the details of which he may not fully understand. The builder, on the other hand, is forced to await individual orders before he can commence or continue building operations.  He is thus compelled to develop a site in stages, with resultant delays in his building programme and possible increases in cost.</P>
    <P>The law, as it stands, also precludes the transfer of a grant where an intending purchaser is unable, for one reason or another, to fulfil his contract.  The builder may thus be left with a completed house on his hands and the person for whom the house is intended may also be involved in serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed under Section 6 of the Bill, that grants will in future be payable to persons purchasing new houses for their own occupation.  The prospective purchaser will thus be in a position to pick and choose in an open market.  He will be relieved of all anxiety in regard to the selection of site, preparation of plans, etc., before the construction of the house is begun and will be enabled to see the finished product before he decides to buy.  The builder can initiate his plans to the full projected scale and he will not be hampered in his operations by any uncertainty in regard to grants not being available on eventual sale, if the houses will comply with the necessary standards of space and construction.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to alter the present scales of grants for new houses nor is it intended to interfere further with the statutory requirements governing the construction of grant houses, except in so far as the maximum floor area of the house is concerned.  The existing maximum is 1,250 square feet and Section 13 of the Bill proposes that this maximum be extended to 1,400 square feet.  This extension is desirable to meet the requirements of large families.  Experience has shown that it is a matter of difficulty to design a satisfactory house for the larger family within the existing limit of 1,250 square <Col N="976" /> feet.  It is not considered that the new limit will result in considerable extension of the classes claiming grants.  It is felt, rather, that persons with large families in a position to build houses up to the existing maximum of 1,250 square feet will be enabled to purchase a reasonably larger type of house for the accommodation of their families.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes that Irish nationals purchasing houses to which Section 6 relates will be exempt from payment of the increase in the stamp duty imposed by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the Bill is intended to remove doubts in regard to the validity of payment of grants under Section 16 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, as extended, in circumstances where a house is occupied by the legal successor in title of an applicant who dies between the date of application for a grant and the completion of construction or reconstruction.  In so far as new houses are concerned, this difficulty will be resolved in future cases by the application of the provisions of Section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill further proposes in the First Schedule to abolish the limitations imposed by successive Housing Acts in the past, on the aggregate amount of payments of housing grants.  These limitations have made it necessary for me and for my predecessors to come before the House from time to time seeking legislative authority for extensions of the prescribed limits.  The present limit is £1,750,000 fixed by Section 1 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1949.  The annual amounts to be expended will, of course, be subject to the control of the Dáil as they will form part of the annual Vote for the Department.</P>
    <P>At present the existing scales of grants apply to houses completed before the 1st April, 1952.  I do not propose to make any change in this respect but policy regarding the scales of grants applicable to houses completed after the existing terminal date will be placed before this House in due course and in sufficient time to enable prospective applicants contemplating building <Col N="977" /> after the 1st April, 1952, to know clearly how they will stand in regard to grants.</P>
    <P>Retrospective grant payments under Section 17 of the Act of 1948, related to houses erected within the period 1st November, 1945, to 1st November, 1947. This section was inserted at a late stage in the passage of the 1947 Bill, and it was inadvertently omitted at that time to provide for the remission of rates in respect of these houses such as was granted in every other case where a grant was made under the Housing Acts.  This omission is being rectified by Section 14 of this Bill. Rates remissions for new houses built under Section 6 of the Bill are also proposed.</P>
    <P>I now proceed to the provisions of the Bill which deal with matters primarily and directly dealt with by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 16 proposes to confer powers on local authorities to acquire land compulsorily to enable them to lease or sell plots to private persons and public utility societies.  It has been held that local authorities already possess powers in this respect, but the matter is not altogether free from doubt and the new section will make the position quite clear and will remove any difficulties which tend to deter local authorities from acquiring land for these purposes.  Deputies are doubtless aware of the high costs and difficulty of acquisition of suitable sites in most urban areas at present. These factors have reacted unfavourably on the efforts of private individuals and public utility societies to provide houses.  The common-sense approach to this problem is to enable housing authorities to acquire and develop such lands as may be needed not only for their own housing operations, but also for the needs of other classes, particularly those who are eligible for State grants and Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts loans.  I have every hope that the effective operation of this provision will tend towards better planning and control of general urban development as well as resulting in a better balance of classes in the new community settlements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> Section 19 provides that where lands acquired and cottages erected under the Labourers Acts are brought within an urban area, as a result of the extension of borough or other urban boundaries, such lands and cottages will be dealt with as if they had been provided by the urban district council under the Housing of the Working Classes Act.  This will regularise the procedure in such matters as the selection of tenants for vacant houses of this class.  The right of an existing tenant to purchase under the Labourers Act, 1936, will, however, be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill will give extended powers to rural authorities in dealing with lands acquired under the Labourers Acts.  Section 16 of the 1885 Act enables rural authorities to acquire lands to be used for the purpose of allotments by agricultural labourers. These lands, when acquired, however, must be held for all time for use as allotments.  It is felt that a general discretion should be given to rural authorities to use such lands at any time they consider necessary for any of their powers under the Labourers Acts.  The need for this discretion is of particular importance in non-municipal towns where suitable sites for building are not always available.</P>
    <P>It is intended to repeal the final sentence of Section 6 of the Labourers (Ireland) Act, 1883, which requires housing authorities acquiring land for the erection of labourers' cottages to &ldquo;avoid all interference with demesne and amenity of residence of the owner of the lands proposed to be taken, or with any home farm or lands immediately adjoining and customarily occupied with such residence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The exemption of these categories from compulsory acquisition has seriously interfered with the efforts of some housing authorities to secure suitable sites.  The exemption represents a special type of statutory protection of limited application not applying to the general class of agricultural holder in this country.  While the terms of this statutory protection are absolute, the interpretation of the terms &ldquo;demesne&rdquo;, &ldquo;amenity of residence&rdquo; and &ldquo;home farm&rdquo; has caused much litigation which has not, however, left the matter <Col N="979" /> in any clearer position.  The introduction of these exemptions in the 1883 Act was effected by an amendment. They represented an exclusive type of privilege which cannot be defended in present-day circumstances.</P>
    <P>The existing procedure to be followed by housing authorities proceeding with the compulsory acquisition of land contains adequate safeguards for the protection of the rights of property owners as a whole.  Owners are given an opportunity to appeal to the Minister against compulsory acquisition proposals which are considered by them to be unreasonable. The Minister is required to hold a public local inquiry in any case in which an objection is lodged by an owner of property, and the latter can then appear or be represented at the inquiry to support his objection.  It is felt, therefore, that no case exists at present for the continuance of the type of privilege afforded under the 1883 Act and that owners of demesne lands should be treated similarly to ordinary property owners.</P>
    <P>A similar protection of a less absolute type from compulsory acquisition by urban authorities is given by Section 9 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, to every home farm, park, garden, or pleasure ground required for the amenity or convenience of any dwelling-house.  It is likewise proposed to repeal this section.</P>
    <P>Section 25 of the Bill proposes to give a general power to the Minister to correct obvious mistakes in Compulsory Purchase Orders proposed under the Labourers Acts and to dispense with the services of notices, advertisements, etc., in the circumstances where he is satisfied that the interests of property owners will not be prejudiced by such dispensation.  This power is similar to that already applicable to orders made by urban authorities under Section 45 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  No new principle is, therefore, involved in the extension of these powers to rural areas.</P>
    <P>Section 16 will empower all housing authorities to provide houses for letting or for sale to classes other than the present &ldquo;working classes&rdquo; or <Col N="980" />&ldquo;agricultural labourer&rdquo; class.  These houses will be eligible for grants on the scales at present applicable to private persons erecting new houses for their own occupation.  It is not intended that this type of house should be provided until a local authority has first satisfied the needs of the working classes and the agricultural labourer classes in their districts.  The question of providing for the most urgent and needy classes must receive priority.</P>
    <P>Houses erected under the new provisions should be self-supporting. There will thus be no financial loss to the local authority and when the loan repayments are amortised the houses should prove to be a valuable source of revenue to the local authority if it desires to retain them.</P>
    <P>Under Section 20 of the Bill it is proposed to provide for the application of the provisions of Part II of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931, to rural housing authorities so as to enable county councils to deal effectively with unhealthy areas in non-municipal towns and villages.  This amendment will enable the clearance order procedure to operate in rural areas as it does in urban areas.  County councils are not at present empowered to make clearance orders dealing with unhealthy areas nor are they empowered to purchase compulsorily unfit property on the same terms as those applicable to urban housing authorities; that is, the estimated value of the site less the cost of clearance.  There is no valid reason for this restriction on the powers of rural housing authorities. The conditions in many of the small non-municipal towns are often as bad as, if not worse than, those obtaining in urban areas and it is clearly desirable that rural authorities should be placed on the same footing as urban authorities for the purpose of dealing with unhealthy areas.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill provides for an extension of the powers of rural housing authorities to enable them to provide houses for letting to persons other than agricultural labourers living in rural areas, non-municipal towns, and, in some instances, in town commissioners' areas.  This extension is very necessary.  As the law stands, rural housing authorities are restricted <Col N="981" /> in their operations under the Labourers Acts to the provision of cottages for persons who come within the extended definition of an agricultural labourer. While this definition is undoubtedly wide, it does not embrace all types of workers and, in the result, categories such as serving soldiers, pensioners, midwives, etc., living in unincorporated towns and villages, are not eligible for local authority houses.  This anomaly presents considerable difficulties in the larger non-municipal towns where persons of these classes are fairly considerable in number, and where they may be living in overcrowded conditions or in insanitary dwellings.</P>
    <P>The extension of the powers of rural housing authorities in the manner suggested will enable them to give equal consideration to all classes of workers, irrespective of occupations, whose need for housing accomodation is established.  It is the intention to apply the same rates of subsidy, payable in respect of cottages provided under the Labourers Acts, to houses to be built under this provision.</P>
    <P>In Section 17 it is proposed to amend Section 30 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, to enable all urban housing authorities to provide reserved houses for occupation by persons of a particular class.  The 1948 Act restricted this power to county boroughs, boroughs and urban areas with a population of over 12,000.  The original intention of this section was to provide houses for classes such as newly-weds and aged couples, who might not require accommodation of a normal size required for larger family units.  In my opinion this method of providing for the needs of newly-weds and aged couples represents an excellent and economical procedure and it should be extended to the other urban areas. In fact, some councils in the areas at present not covered by the provision have expressed a desire to provide for these classes in this manner.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes certain amendments of the small Dwellings Acquisition Acts.  There have been many criticisms of certain provisions of these Acts and the present circumstances justify a number of important amendments.  Section 27 amends the <Col N="982" /> definition of the market value of the premises which forms the basis on which local authorities make advances to applicants under the Acts.  At present the market value is related solely to the estimated value which the house would realise in an open sale.  Representations have been made to me by public representatives, builders and individual borrowers that strict adherence to this principle on the part of local authorities has resulted in unduly conservative advances being made.  It has been represented that the result of this policy has been to create hardship to the person with limited resources who desires to avail himself of the borrowing facilities afforded under the Acts.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment will relate the market value of a new house to the reasonable cost of construction.  This will enable local authorities to give more liberal advances in the future, and if builders are prepared to keep prices at a reasonable level, there will be nothing to prevent the advances being fixed at percentages corresponding to equivalent proportions of the selling price.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to enable county councils to operate the Acts in urban areas where the urban district councils are unable or unwilling to make advances.  This amendment is intended to cover the case of the smaller urban districts with low valuations and slender resources.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to repeal sub-section 9 (4) of the Act of 1899, which prevents local authorities from operating the Act for a period of five years following any financial year in which the loss under the Acts equals or exceeds the sum of one halfpenny in the £ in a county borough or one penny in the £ in an urban district.  This provision has operated unsatisfactorily in some urban areas and it is felt that there is no need for its retention in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 28 of the Bill removes any doubts on the powers of housing authorities to base their loans under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts on a provisional valuation basis, that is, the market value estimated at the <Col N="983" /> time the plans for the house are submitted by the applicant to the local authority.  It has been suggested that local authorities could fix a valuation for the purpose of the loan only when the house was completed.  Such an interpretation would lead to hardship and the matter is accordingly now being placed beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>Section 29 of the Bill introduces a principle of a minimum cash contribution of 5 per cent. of the market value of the house to be made by the applicant out of his own resources.  Thus, in the case of a house valued at say £1,400 the applicant will be expected to make a cash contribution of not less than £70.  The State grant plus the loan to be made by the housing authority under the Act should normally be sufficient to make up the balance of the purchase price, if the builder's price and the local authority's valuation show a reasonable correspondence with each other.</P>
    <P>These amendments of the Small Dwellings Acquisition Acts are, in general, intended to promote the smoother working of the Acts and to eliminate as far as possible the various causes of complaints which have been made in recent years, particularly in regard to the position of the borrower.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides for the continuance in operation of the Labourers Acts for a period of five years expiring on 31st December, 1955.  The intention here is to avoid having to provide each year as at present in the Expiring Laws Act for the continuance of the 1883 Act.  It is hoped in the intervening period to effect a consolidation of the Labourers Acts code and also the other enactments relating to housing.</P>
    <P>Finally, two further amendments of the Housing Acts of a miscellaneous type are included in the Bill.  It is proposed in Section 18 to extend the period in which the demolition or use otherwise than as dwellings of urban habitable houses, except with the permission of the local authority, is prohibited, from 31st December, 1950, to 31st December, 1960.  It is felt that, in view of the general shortage of houses, all proposals involving demolition or <Col N="984" /> conversion for purposes other than use as dwellings should continue to be subject to control by housing authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill is intended to remedy a defect in existing legislation where it is not quite clear that, as a condition for payment of subsidy or grant, the existing requirement that appropriate rates of wages or conditions of labour generally recognised by trade unions shall be paid or observed, applies at all stages of the construction of a house.</P>
    <P>This completes my outline of the main features of the Bill which, as I have already stated, is designed primarily to secure the elimination of the more obvious defects in existing legislation, and to supplement and extend, where necessary, the existing powers and duties of all housing authorities.</P>
    <P>I feel assured that the passing of the Bill will be of considerable assistance in pressing forward the general campaign for better housing in this country, and that its passage will be welcomed by all classes of the community who desire to participate in the national housing drive.  There is no need for me to elaborate on the benefits that will accrue to the country as a whole by the earliest possible solution of the housing problem. These are well known to all of you and it is with confidence, therefore, that I recommend this measure for the early and sympathetic consideration of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey) Daniel Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Morrissey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The objects of the Bill are: (i) To provide for the increased cost of carrying out the programme of development which Bord na Móna was authorised to undertake by the Turf Development Act, 1946; (ii) to authorise Bord na Móna to proceed with a second development programme to increase the annual production to 2,000,000 tons; (iii) to make provision for housing <Col N="985" /> accommodation for the board's workers; (iv) to provide for an increase from £120,000 to £250,000 in the grants for the board's experimental station.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the programme authorised by the Turf Development Act, 1946, was £3,750,000. When compiling the Estimate it was assumed that costs of material would be 50 per cent. higher than pre-war and for wages costs the levels of 1943-44 were assumed.  The increase in material costs has been much higher than that assumed in the Estimate, while wages have increased considerably over the 1943-44 levels.  In addition, experience has shown that the plans drawn up in 1946 required revision in certain minor respects.  A revised Estimate has now been made which shows that the cost of the first programme will amount to £5,520,000, an increase over the original Estimate of £1,770,000.  The first programme of development for which a total of £5,520,000 is required provides for an annual output of approximately 1,000,000 tons of machine turf, 20,000 tons of briquettes and 50,000 bales of peat moss.</P>
      <P>The House will appreciate that the development of a bog to the point of full mechanised production is necessarily a lengthy process.  Moreover, up to recently, the industrial after-effects of the last war rendered it difficult for the board to obtain delivery of the specialised machines for which it was the only customer.  These machines had to be specially designed and developed by the board and during the post-war period a certain difficulty was experienced in securing suitable firms to undertake their manufacture. It will also be understood that progress in the early stages of a pioneer project such as this is necessarily slow; once a certain stage is reached, however, the rate of progress tends to accelerate progressively.  That critical stage has now been reached in the first development programme and output is expected to expand rapidly on the bogs covered by that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the reasons which I have given it may not be possible to complete the first programme in the case of every bog within the period of five years <Col N="986" /> which was contemplated, but the preparation in the case of all the bogs is generally well advanced and some of the bogs are actually in production. Production is in progress at Clonsast, Derryounce, Glenties, Barna, Timahoe South, Turraun, Lyrecrumpane, Blackriver, Ballydermot and Glashabaun. Briquettes are being produced at Lullymore and peat moss at Kilberry.  Other bogs would be in production by now were it not for difficulties in regard to the delivery of turf-cutting machinery. The drainage of the remainder of the bogs included in the board's programme is proceeding.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that at Portarlington the turf-fired electricity generating station is in production. The station which went into partial production in January, 1950, is designed for two generating sets of 12,500 k.w. each, and is expected to be working to full capacity before the end of the year.  This station will have a consumption of 120,000 tons of turf per annum which is the total estimated annual output from the Clonsast bogs and will be capable of producing 90,000,000 units of electricity per annum.  I may inform the House that the performance of the station since it went into commission has been highly satisfactory.  The turf from the Timahoe bogs (County Kildare) will supply the generating station under construction at Allenwood.  The Timahoe North bog will provide 60,000 tons per annum and it is hoped to have the first generating set in commission by the winter of 1951.  The Timahoe South bog will provide 120,000 tons per annum and when the second generating set is installed, probably by the summer of 1952, the total generating capacity will be approximately 130,000,000 units per annum.  The bulk of the estimated annual output of 180,000 tons at Boora, which is the largest bog in the board's first programme, is intended for consumption in a further electricity generating station which it is hoped will be put into commission in 1954.  It is expected that production of turf on Boora bog will commence in 1951 and any turf produced will be stockpiled if it is not disposed of commercially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> In regard to Lullymore, where the present target is 20,000 tons of briquettes per annum, the limiting factor in output has been the availability of milled peat.  Additional bog machines, ordered some time ago, have now been delivered and will ensure that, even in unfavourable weather, a sufficient quantity of milled peat can be harvested, for the production of 20,000 tons of briquettes per annum; it is hoped that this will be increased within a reasonable time to 30,000 tons.  The output of milled peat in 1949 constituted a record for the works.  I may mention that a bridge has been erected over the Grand Canal in order to provide direct access to the factory from the public road.</P>
    <P>The production of peat most at the Kilberry factory commenced during 1947.  The output of the factory has increased from 24,130 bales in the year ended 31st March, 1940, to 85,616 in the year ended 31st March, 1950.  In the year 1949, peat moss was an important export to the United States, when over £22,000 worth of this product was shipped to that country.  Substantial quantites are also being exported to Great Britain and the Channel Islands. Intensive efforts are being made to increase exports, especially to dollar areas.</P>
    <P>The board has experienced a shortage of labour at many of the bogs, despite all efforts to recruit the required number of men.  In its recruitment campaign last year the board maintained a close liaison with the Department of Social Welfare; Press and radio publicity was carried out; ex-employees to the number of 2,500 were offered reemployment by way of circular issued to their home address; free travel vouchers were issued to all applicants for employment on bogs to which hostels were attached; and at some of the works long-distance lorry transport was used to bring the men to work from as far distant as 20 miles.  This year the board made a particularly thorough and determined effort to recruit adequate labour.  Nevertheless, there remain to-day as many as 1,000 unfilled jobs in the board.  I should like to make it clear to the House that <Col N="988" /> a labour deficiency of such dimensions, if it contiuues, will seriously delay the development and production programme of the board.</P>
    <P>The second development programme approved by the Government contemplates the production of an additional 1,000,000 tons of machine turf per annum in ten years from its inception, or earlier if this can be achieved.  The full capital cost of the second development programme is estimated at £7,000,000, but it is proposed to provide in this Bill only for the cost of the preliminary work of drainage and preparation of the bogs.  This work, which is estimated to cost £2,750,000, will be spread over a period of seven years. The second programme will include the development of bogs in the Counties of Offaly, Westmeath, Meath, Galway, Tipperary, Laoighis and Mayo.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to indicate exactly how the board's entire output will be disposed of; markets are being built up as output becomes available but a preliminary survey which the board has made indicates that an annual output of 2,000,000 tons (1,000,000 from the first programme and 1,000,000 from the second) will be disposed of in the following manner: electricity generating stations, 900,000 tons; local markets, 900,000 tons; cities, 200,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Apart from the important contribution towards the production of native fuel which the board's programme will provide, an equally important contribution towards the national welfare will be the additional employment represented by these schemes. It is expected that employment will be available at peak in 1951-52 for 8,000 men gradually rising to 12,800 by 1959-60 on the assumption that the second programme will be in full production by then.</P>
    <P>In submitting its post-war plans to the Government some years ago the board emphasised the necessity for providing houses for workers, and efforts were made to have this problem solved by the erection of labourers' cottages by county councils.  For a variety of reasons it was not found <Col N="989" /> practicable to have labourers' cottages built for the board by county councils and the board resolved to tackle the problem itself.  The number of cottages which it is proposed to erect is about 1,100 and the cost of the scheme is estimated at about £1,318,000.  No decision has yet been taken as to whether the work will be by tender or by direct labour.  It is proposed that the outlay shall be defrayed partly by grants and partly by repayable advances.  Free grants equal to those made to rural housing authorities will be provided out of voted moneys and repayable advances from the Central Fund.  Provision is made accordingly in Section 6 of the Bill.  Free grants from the Transition Development Fund similar to those made to housing authorities will also be given.  Provision for this purpose did not need to be made in the Bill since the power to make grants from that fund already exists under Section 30 of the Finance Act, 1946.</P>
    <P>The board consulted a planning expert to advise on the housing scheme and as a result of his advice it has now been decided to group the cottages on a village basis instead of dispersing them along the roadside as originally contemplated.  The board came to the conclusion that houses grouped in villages should be provided with water and sewerage and it is unlikely in any event that the public health authorities would look with favour on the creation of villages in which houses did not possess these amenities.  It is, accordingly, proposed that the houses should be provided with water and sewerage.  The rents to be charged, plus the board's contribution, will be applied in the payment of interest and repayment of the capital provided by the repayable advances.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for an increase in the amount of the free grant towards experimental and research work by the board.  Under the Act of 1946 an experimental station was set up by the board at Droichead Nua and has been in operation for over three years.  The sum provided in that Act, viz., £120,000, has proved insufficient and it is proposed that it should be increased to £250,000.  Deputies will <Col N="990" /> agree that it is essential that the board should be encouraged to develop new methods as well as cheaper and more efficient means of producing turf and turf products; they will also appreciate that this cannot properly be accomplished unless the various problems involved are studied on a scientific basis.</P>
    <P>A substantial proportion of the expenditure on the experimental station to date has been incurred on designing and testing machines, appliances and methods for increasing the degree of mechanisation in the board's operations.  Such outlay, in my opinion, is money well and wisely spent, for I feel that the success of Bord na Móna will be measured by the extent to which it can mechanise the operations of turf winning.  Mechanisation will increase productivity per man, reduce the cost of turf and remove much of the drudgery traditionally associated with turf production.</P>
    <P>A brief review of the progress achieved to date with mechanisation may be of interest to members of the House.  Starting with the drainage of virgin bog it has been demonstrated that first cuts to a depth of three feet can be quickly and successfully carried out in most areas by a Disc Ditcher, or more cheaply and expeditiously by a new type of machine known as a trencher.  The problem of mechanising the first cuts, which are the most difficult, has, in fact, been solved in a very satisfactory manner and the savings resulting from the use of these machines will be of great importance in the board's economies.  The suitability of other machines for this purpose and for deeper cuts is being examined by the board's experimental station.  A machine for stripping the top layer of light turf from the bog prior to cutting has been designed and will shortly be in commission. Another machine for levelling the surface of the spread grounds has been designed and is now in use.  Dragline excavators have been used on a large scale for heavy work on the outfalls to the bogs.  The operation of cutting and spreading the turf has been completely mechanised.  Up to the present the turf has been footed by hand and <Col N="991" /> the footings have been loaded manually into sod collectors which rick them mechanically.  The experimental station has designed a machine which, if successful, will eliminate manual labour on footing to a great extent.  It is too soon yet to be optimistic as to the performance of this machine, but it is clear that, until some method of overcoming the difficulty of footing turf by hand has been devised, it will be the greatest labour problem facing the board.  At present the turf is loaded by hand from the ricks into the light railway wagons, but loading machines are on order which will carry out this operation at the larger bogs.  One of these machines is now in use in Clonsast. The turf is transported by light railway from the ricks to the loading point, and loaded on purchasers' vehicles by elevator or tipper in a manner which entails little manual work.  The movement of the light rail track from one portion of a bog to another at present involves considerable manual work, but a machine devised for the purpose of eliminating much of this labour is about to be tested.</P>
    <P>In addition to its activities designed to further mechanisation, the experimental station has undertaken a considerable amount of other useful work. It has completed an investigation into the production of waxes from peat, work which was initiated by Professor Reilly, University College, Cork.  The Department is endeavouring to interest private initiative in the manufacture of these waxes, as a considerable market appears to exist for them.  An experiment has been completed in the production of hydro-peat at Drumaru Bog, County Kildare, the object of which was to determine if high bog could be utilised for spreading and drying.  A large-scale experiment in the production of hydro-peat is in progress this year at Derrylea Bog.  The hydro-peat process is largely used on the continent and is of particular advantage in bogs with a high timber content which renders the operation of the normal turfcutting machine difficult and expensive. Small-scale experiments have been <Col N="992" /> undertaken with the afforestation of high bog and cut-away and the agricultural reclamation of cut-away bog. The application of a statistical method to the variables in turf, to enable the average moisture content of air-dried sods to be measured, was made the subject of special study.  Members of the staff have undergone special training in the testing of domestic cooking and heating appliances, and the estimation of the efficiency of such appliances for use with turf will be a special feature of the station's work. Structural alterations have been carried out to the existing building in the old military barracks, to provide suitable accommodation for the staff.</P>
    <P>It is the intention that the station should continue the work for which it is maintained.  It is expected that its activities will be concerned with many problems, but the energies of its personnel will be specially directed towards greater mechanisation and the cheapening of the cost of turf.  The testing of domestic heating and cooking appliances for turf burning will be continued.  Research will be undertaken into the possibility of commercially exploiting turf or the by-products of turf as a raw material for industry, e.g., insulating board.  Inquiries will be continued into the utilisation of peat moss for agricultural, horticultural and industrial purposes.  Fundamental research bearing on the production and use of turf and turf products will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Contact has been established and will be maintained with agencies abroad engaged on work of a similar nature, so that by a constant exchange of information and ideas this country may benefit from new inventions and developments.  In this connection it is relevant to mention an important development with which the board has been associated and which, if successful, is likely to have important repercussions on the turf industry.  Investigations are proceeding in Great Britain, under the auspices of the Ministry of Fuel and Power, for the development of gas turbines using peat of very high moisture content, and if these are successful a source of very cheap power from turf will be readily available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="993" /> It is also relevant to refer to the possibilities of milled peat as a source of power, especially for electricity generation.  Milled peat is the material from which briquettes are manufac tured at the board's Lullymore factory. The material is air dried on the bog to 55 per cent. moisture before being brought to the factory where, for the purpose of briquetting, it is artifically dried to 10 or 15 per cent. moisture. It now appears to be well established that the air dried material at 55 per cent. moisture can be effectively used as pulverised fuel without any pre-drying for firing boilers.  The board is in communication with the Electricity Supply Board on this and all other subjects connected with the generation of electricity from turf.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to pay a tribute to the members of Board na Móna, as well as to its staff, for the progress achieved to date.  In doing so, I would point out that the board did not inherit, as it were, a ready-made undertaking, operating a known and defined technique.  On the contrary, the production of turf by mechanical methods on a large scale had to be devised by the board, which had not the advantage of the experience of others.  The successful development of our large turf deposits on an economic basis depends upon the exercise of a high degree of ingenuity and skill.  It is gratifying, too, that the preliminary operations have not resulted in a financial loss. The proven capacity of Bord na Móna in the field, and the soundness of its organisation, outdoor and indoor, give every ground for believing that the board's future, both productively and financially, is assured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know about that.  I do not think there has been any change because of the delay.  It is perhaps a fitting footnote to the arrangement made here to-day, to complete the business of the Dáil by <Col N="994" /> next Friday, to refer to the fact that we are now hastily discussing a Bill, in the congested circumstances of this period, that was ordered by the Dáil to be printed on 19th July, 1949.  However, here we have the Bill.  As I mentioned on many occasions since it was introduced, it is an unopposed measure, one we are anxious to have enacted by the Dáil, in the belief that its enactment is necessary to enable Bord na Móna to proceed with the plans for the extension of its activities which were deemed practicable and approved some years ago.  Any proposal which the Minister brings here, which appears designed to extend the scope of the board's activities and which is practicable to that end, will be supported by Deputies on this side of the House.  We regard our bogs as one of the nation's most important sources of wealth and employment.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, there are still technical and scientific problems to be solved in the development of our peat bogs both for the production of solid fuel and other industrial materials.  What the potentialities of the bogs in relation to other industrial materials may be is still a very questionable matter.  It is a source of considerable disappointment that the very favourable report on the production of montaigne wax from peat, which was prepared as a result of the investigations carried out by Professor Reilly of Cork and published ten years ago, has not yet attracted from commercial interests the attention that it deserves.</P>
      <P>However, the circumstances during those ten years were perhaps abnormal and it may be that, nowadays, commercial interests may have their attention attracted to that report with more prospect of their acting upon it than existed during that ten-year period. The main interest we have at the moment in the plans of Bord na Móna concerns the production of solid fuel and we regard those plans as of such tremendous importance to the country that almost any effort to complete them or any expenditure that may be involved in them is justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are immediate problems, however, and I do not know that the Minister dealt sufficiently with them.  The <Col N="995" /> problems of utilising the peat resources of this country for fuel production come under three heads: (1) economical and efficient methods of production; (2)  economical and efficient methods of transportation; (3) provision of a market.  So far as production is concerned, the job is very largely done.  If the new sod collector and footing machines prove to be as satisfactory as the officials of Bord na Móna hope, then the task is finished.  No mechanical task is ever completely finished but, in so far as the main work was to mechanise all the processes of production, that will be done and the officers and technicians of the board can concentrate their attention upon the improvement of those devices.  Not nearly the same progress has been made in regard to the methods of transporting turf.  The problem of providing turf as a satisfactory and cheap fuel in areas away from the bog has been always mainly a matter of devising suitable transport arrangements.  The State has spent a great deal of money trying to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>Under the original Turf Development Act, which was passed before Bord na Móna was set up, under which production through the means of co-operative societies was the main aim, substantial investment upon various methods of solving the problem of transportation was made, but not with success.  No doubt the Board has made some progress, but in so far as turf is a fuel which deteriorates with very much handling and, unlike coal, absorbs moisture from the atmosphere, it is obvious that there exists in the matter of its transportation a problem of some difficulty.</P>
    <P>In that connection I am anxious to find out from the Minister to what extent the board contemplate dealing in turf fuel as a retailer, in so far as they will have, from their total estimated production of 2,000,000 tons, turf for sale to persons other than the Electricity Supply Board or large-scale industrial users.  One of the most acute difficulties in dealing with the problem of distributing turf during the war years arose from the decision which was taken at the beginning of <Col N="996" /> the emergency, a decision which was generally approved by the Dáil, to leave the handling of turf and its retail distribution to consumers entirely to persons who were before the war in business as fuel merchants.  That decision was based on the desire to cause the least dislocation of employment or of trade.  In fact, a very large number of the fuel merchants were not interested at all in turf.  Some of them were hostile to it; none of them regarded it as a fuel with a future or were willing to incur any substantial capital expenditure on apparatus for its storage or its handling.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether it is the board's intention to deal direct with individual consumers of comparatively small quantities or whether they intend to market turf for domestic purposes through fuel merchants.  But if they do propose to use the fuel merchants, I think the Minister will have to take certain powers to insist that these merchants locate their yards and equip them so as to eliminate unnecessary cost in that end of the business in order to ensure that the addition to the board's price which the merchant must make in order to recover his expenditure and his profit will not be unduly large.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the turf which will be produced through Bord na Móna schemes will, of course, be sold, I expect, for power production or industrial purposes.  I hope that the successful operation of the Portarlington station has convinced the Minister and the Electricity Supply Board that there is no justification whatever for the establishment in this country in future ever of a steam-generating station using any type of fuel other than turf.  I do not know if it is possible to have the decision to build a rather large coal burning station in Dublin reversed.  If it is possible, I hope it will be reversed.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to note from the figures given by the Minister that it is contemplated that the programme for the erection of turf-burning stations will ultimately go beyond the stations already planned for Portarlington, Allenwood and Boora, because he told us that, of the 2,000,000 tons, it is assumed that <Col N="997" /> 900,000 tons will go to electricity stations, and these three stations will only require about 500,000 tons.  From the point of view of the Electricity Supply Board there may be some slight administrative problem in that regard.  But I feel certain that it is one than can be overcome, given goodwill on their part.</P>
    <P>If the operation of the Portarlington station continues to be as satisfactory as it has been to date, then we can regard that as another battle won, which will not have to be fought again, and get it generally accepted, not merely in the Dáil but by everybody concerned with electricity development, that steam stations additional to the existing generating stations can be entirely fuelled by turf.  I think also that we can make it a national policy, accepted here by all Parties, and therefore unlikely to be changed when changes of Government take place, that where it can be shown that any industry can be operated economically utilising turf fuel, subject to the installation of proper equipment, that the granting or continuance of State assistance in any form, whether by tariff, subsidy or any form whatever, will be conditional on their utilising turf only.</P>
    <P>Many industries located in bog areas are, I know, using turf, and using turf because they find it the most satisfactory and economical fuel, but some are not, and in their case, I think the reason they are not doing so is because associated with the use of turf there are certain storage difficulties or because they have installed boilers and equipment in which turf cannot be economically used.  I know that Bord na Móna had in contemplation the provision of services for such industries under which they would be advised as to the methods by which their existing equipment could be altered so as to facilitate the consumption of turf and, even in some cases, the possibility of capital advances where that was necessary to enable them to do so.</P>
    <P>One of the aspects of industrial policy upon which there is general agreement is the desire to encourage the spread of industry throughout the country.  That, I think, will be <Col N="998" /> facilitated if that condition is made known and if we can, through the mechanisation and organisation of turf production, make it more economical to locate certain industries in the towns adjacent to the bog areas rather than at the ports through which coal can be most cheaply imported.  Furthermore, there is a great deal to be done in expanding the market for turf for domestic purposes. There is no point in blinding ourselves to the fact that in cities and towns outside the bog areas a considerable prejudice against turf was created during the emergency by the bad quality of some of the turf which reached these centres under the county councils' turf production scheme.  That prejudice has, to some extent, disappeared, but not entirely, nor will it entirely disappear until the board is in a position to guarantee a standard quality for all the turf they sell.  The board is very nearly in a position to do that and will be completely in a position to do it if they solve the transport problems to which I refer. That prejudice was also partly due to the fact that in the great majority of our homes the grates and ranges installed are not suitable for turf burning.  They were designed to burn coal and are more efficient when burning coal.</P>
    <P>We are now building a large number of new houses and when this debate is adjourned, we shall return to a discussion of the Housing Bill.  Having regard to the importance to this country of securing the maximum development of our turf resources and the maximum employment in the bog areas, are we justified in giving State grants and other forms of State-aid to people to build houses without insisting that these houses are equipped with ranges and grates that are suitable for the burning of turf and also designed so as to provide facilities for the storage of turf?  I think that if we could get this matter of turf development viewed in a proper light, we would all agree that in so far as the provision of a market is the key to it, the State is justified in going that far, not to the extent of insisting on people using it; but making State aid of any exceptional kind conditional <Col N="999" /> on its recipients not acting in a manner which will discourage the use of turf.  The board has, I know, done a considerable amount of research work upon the design of industrial boilers as well as of domestic ranges and grates for the burning of turf, and I think they are now in a position to give to any manufacturer of ranges designs and other information which will enable him to make available ranges which can be guaranteed to operate efficiently with turf fuel at a lower annual cost than existing ranges operate upon coal.  The bulk of the market for the production of Bord na Móna is virtually guaranteed if we can successfully ensure its industrial use where coal is not essential for manufacturing processes.  The balance of it can be quite readily disposed of provided there is no unnecessary barrier erected to its use by the installation in houses of equipment not suitable for it.  It is still true that the bulk of the turf produced in this country and used in our households is hand-produced.  In fact, the experience of the past year has shown that in many areas hand-produced turf of good quality can be marketed in competition with machine-won turf.</P>
    <P>The board, of course, is concerned only with its own programme and has now, I understand, no responsibility for the encouragement or assistance of hand-turf producers except, perhaps, in the matter of advising other Government Departments concerning grants for bog roads, bog drainage and matters of that kind.  I think, however, recognising that the bulk of the board's production, even when it has reached 2,000,000 tons, is already earmarked and that even at that stage there will be a substantial market for hand-won turf, we should consider what we can do to assist those who are engaged in its production and to encourage its use.</P>
    <P>I have already made it clear that experience has taught us over two separate periods, one a period of peace and the other a period of war, that compulsory methods will not be beneficial if they operate to guarantee a <Col N="1000" /> market for all the hand-won turf produced. While a number of the individual producers and the co-operative societies strove valiantly to meet the requirements of Government aid in the past and produced only turf of a good quality, that cannot be said of all and any restoration of conditions in which the demand through Government action will exceed the supply will almost certainly result in the reappearance of low-grade turf on the market. That we do not want.  Therefore, Government aid to the development of hand-won turf must be largely directed towards improving the facilities for its production as well as towards creating the conditions which will enable the good producer to get a certain market.</P>
    <P>The conditions that will ensure that are similar to those to which I have referred as necessary to complete Bord na Móna's plans: the use of turf wherever it is practicable to use it in public institutions of local authorities, in schools and hospitals as well as for domestic purposes.  In all these cases the Government can help by exercising its authority where it has it to ensure the installation of equipment which will use turf; by using its influence where it has it to the same end; perhaps by giving financial assistance where it is required to enable existing equipment to be replaced; and by general propaganda methods to convince everybody, if he needs convincing, that we have in our bogs a vast source of national wealth which, if it existed anywhere else would have been exploited long ago and which has not been exploited here only because for centuries we were under the domination of a great coal-exporting nation, and on which we must concentrate our attention because by doing so we can not only restore the balance of employment between the cities and rural areas, but check emigration from the parts of the country where it is and always has been most acute.  I do not know whether I am in order in referring to hand-won turf on this Bill, but I do not think that any comment on plans for turf development would be complete without referring to it.</P>
    <P>There is one further thing I want to <Col N="1001" /> say.  The idea of allowing Bord na Móna to build houses for its own workers is thoroughly sound.  I know that originally the board hoped to get local authorities to plan their housing schemes so as to fit in with its own schemes.  Local authorities were reluctant to do so, first because the location of the board's works did not necessarily conform to the housing problems of their own areas, and secondly, because the work upon an individual bog was necessarily limited in point of time and the county councils had a natural objection to building cottages which they hoped would last and be occupied for 50 years adjacent to a works scheme that might terminate in 25.</P>
    <P>In any event, there are advantages to the board in owning the cottages occupied by their own workers.  It will enable them to provide them with certain facilities and recreational opportunities which they might not otherwise enjoy and it will help to remove what is in fact one of the main difficulties of all employers of the present time because there is practically no industry in this country capable of taking on additional workers which has not frequently been faced with the problem that it can get workers provided it can get houses for them.  That must be particularly true with regard to work in the areas where the bogs which the board is developing are located.  I take it, however, that only roughly half the total number that will be employed in the course of the year by the board will be permanent workers and therefore resident in those cottages and that for the workers who are employed on a seasonal basis some hostel arrangement will still be necessary.  I hope, however, that the board will get, under the provisions outlined by the Minister, the same measure of financial assistance from the State as a building society or local authority would get so that they will be able, without loss to themselves, without imposing any cost on the turf produced by them, to rent these cottages to their workers at the same rate as local authorities can do.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to delay the Bill. As far as I am concerned, the Minister <Col N="1002" /> can have it right away, and my only regret is that he did not ask us to give it to him long ago.</P>

      <P>As on every occasion that I get an opportunity in this House I like to advocate greater turf production, I welcome this rather belated Bill.  I cannot understand the reason why it was delayed by about 12 months since it was first introduced.  Further, I cannot understand why the Minister did not make some effort to bring this Bill before the House a few months ago when encouragement would be offered to the workers to get into peat production.  The Minister is aware that on a few occasions I pointed out various reasons why turf workers were not prepared to travel to very far distant bogs.  Time and again, I pointed out to the Minister that certain bogs in my constituency which were being developed by Bord na Móna a few years ago had been closed down and that there was no reason why these bogs should not be reopened.  We have in County Galway a very big market for turf and an effort should be made to supply that market.  It was very peculiar that, in that county, where turf is used at least as extensively as in any other county, if it is not more <Col N="1003" /> extensively used, every one of the peat schemes we had there was stopped until pressure was brought to bear on the Minister some time ago to reopen one or two of them.</P>
      <P>So far as turf workers are concerned, there has not been much inducement to them to continue at that work, because there has been no guarantee of employment.  The Galway County Council lent gangers to Bord na Móna and these men were guaranteed fulltime employment by the county council before being handed over.  They were subsequently laid off by Bord na Móna and some of them have not found employment since.  Efforts have been made by some of us to get the council to re-employ them, but that is no encouragement to people to go into turf production.  I am glad that this Bill may do something to remedy that state of affairs.  I should like to see these workers, and these gangers particularly, getting some guarantee of employment.</P>
      <P>I want to urge the Minister to impress on Bord na Móna the importance of reopening some of the bogs in my constituency which they closed.  As I pointed out to the Minister before, he will not have to look for turf workers, if he opens up these bogs&mdash;he will find them available overnight.  We had crossfire a few times here as to the type of worker who works on the bog.  I do not intend to go into that now, because I made the position quite clear before, and I guarantee that the Minister will have no difficulty in finding turf workers overnight.</P>
      <P>A greater effort should be made by the Minister to encourage hand-won turf again.  Although I suppose it does not directly arise on this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the early stages of and prior to the emergency, we had peat societies which did an enormous amount of very valuable work, and these societies should be encouraged again, because there are institutions all over the country which were run on turf to the extent of 90 per cent. and which still can be run on turf to <Col N="1004" /> the same extent.  I know that the tactics of the present Government have not been very helpful in the matter of encouraging them to resume their activities, but there would not be much difficulty in getting them moving and they can still do useful work, because hand-won turf is by no means the failure which people on the opposite side suggest and some of the speakers who tried to condemn it know that what I am saying is perfectly true.</P>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister pay a tribute to Bord na Móna and its activities, and I hope the country will realise that all the wild statements made in days gone by were merely foolish tactics and that the people who made them were in no way sincere. They realise now that the peat industry is very valuable, and, as the Minister said, can give an enormous amount of employment, if seriously taken in hand. I hope that turf workers will realise that there is employment for them in the industry and a little effort by Bord na Móna in the way of guaranteeing stability will be better than all the asking and begging of people to go to work in the industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome this measure, and I want to say on behalf of the people I represent that they appreciate the importance of this new organisation which is to be built up throughout the country.  I should like to ask the Minister once again to consider the point I previously put to him with regard to a generating station in South Kerry.  We had Bord na Móna operating down in Portmagee, but I submit that that was no fair test of the district.  The conditions were not favourable, because a considerable amount of drainage and other work had to be undertaken, and, if that, as was done before, is to be used as a way out of saying that nothing can be done for the district, I claim that it is not right.  There are thousands of acres of excellent turbary in that district and a great case for the erection of a generating station there can be made. If the Government are sincere in their statements about catering for the poor districts of the Gaeltacht, they certainly should consider such districts as Ballinskelligs and Portmagee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1005" /> We appreciate development in every district and county, but we want to know why millions should be spent in areas adjacent to large cities and other important points, while such places as Ballinskelligs and Portmagee are neglected.  I claim that, from the economic point of view, a case can be made for it.  We have no Electricity Supply Board system on that side of the county and I should like to know why the Electricity Supply Board and Bord na Móna should not consider the problem.  I suggest it would cater for half of that county.  It would employ hundreds of men and it would have an inexhaustible supply of peat for its development.  I again make that plea to the Minister.  I am not at all satisfied with his answers to me in the past and neither was I satisfied with the answers I received from the previous Minister with regard to these isolated areas, as they are called.  There is no change of heart in any of the Ministers, so far as I can see, in regard to these Gaeltacht districts.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy Lemass in his suggestion about the hand-won turf, that the development under this measure, which the whole country will appreciate, could be so arranged that areas where hand-won turf is produced could find a market, side by side with the market which can be made available for machine-won turf. I think that that is only a matter of adjustment.  That would be a sound, business-like way of dealing with it. We had a competition recently in Kerry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to join the Deputies who have already spoken in expressing approval of this Bill. There is just one matter to which I <Col N="1006" /> would like to draw the Minister's attention.  The Minister states that Bord na Móna have carried out experiments as to how agricultural purposes may be served by the development of peat.  There is a factory in Kilberry that produces peat moss litter.  I was very glad to hear the Minister stating that last year there was a very good export market in America for that product.  I would like to impress upon the Minister the importance of extending the peat moss industry and of popularising the use of peat moss in this country.  In my young days peat moss or bog stuff was used extensively in the areas adjoining the bogs for the purpose of putting humus into the land.  It was not available to a very large extent but, where it was available, farmers used it for tillage, and it was very beneficial to the land.  That practice died out. I suggest to the Minister that he should contact the Department of Agriculture on this matter because there is a great deal of land that is deficient in humus.  I may appear to be wandering from the Bill, but I hope to prove that I am not.  One way to put humus back into the land is with straw.</P>
      <P>There are industries in this country that require straw.  I understand that straw is a very essential raw material for the wallboard factory in Athy. With the decline in corn growing and wheat growing, there may be a scarcity of that material.  If peat moss were made available so that farmers would be induced to use it instead of straw for manuring the land, it might be a great advantage.</P>
      <P>I notice in the shops in my town little packets produced by Bord na Móna labelled &ldquo;Peat Moss for Horticultural Purposes&rdquo;.  It would be far more important to extend the use of peat moss for land fertilisation.  It would be good for agriculture and would help to develop the peat moss industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as hand-won turf is concerned, some inducement should be given to people to continue producing hand-won turf.  In Kildare it was the practice of small farmers to cut a certain amount of hand-won turf every <Col N="1007" /> year.  In the past few years that practice has declined, as farmers were uncertain about the market.  The result is that we have not sufficient hand-won turf locally to supply local needs.  We recognise that, eventually, machine-won turf will replace hand-won turf, out some inducement should be given to the people who produce hand-won turf to continue that production while a market exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indebted to the House for the manner in which it has received this Bill and I am particularly indebted to Deputy Lemass for his approach to it.  I find myself almost entirely in agreement with most of what he said.  I can assure the House that as far as I am concerned it is my desire that turf, native fuel, should be used to the greatest possible extent and any encouragement that can be given in that direction will be very readily and very freely given.  However, when Deputies talk about the market for hand-won turf disappearing they ought to remember that there always have been and will be, certainly for our time, comparatively speaking, immense quantities of turf produced and used in this country.  Deputies ought to remember that such figures as we have indicate that approximately 3,500,000 tons of hand-won turf, on an average, are produced and used in this country every year.  When the first and second developments outlined in this Bill are in full operation and giving 2,000,000 tons of machine-won turf per annum, 900,000 tons of that will be used for the generating of electricity; 1,100,000 tons will be used for domestic or industrial purposes, that is, only about one-third of the average production of hand-won turf.  While saying that, I would like again to say what I said before, because I do not think we are going to help in the develop ment of the use of native fuel by ignoring facts or blinding ourselves to what the actual position is and is likely to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said here before and I want to say again that, generally speaking, hand-won turf in this or any other country is not a commercial proposition. Hand-won turf is at the moment, and <Col N="1008" /> will continue to be, produced in the bogs for sale in the immediate local areas where it is an economic proposition to sell it on the spot.  That is true not merely of this country but of any other country where turf is produced and put on sale&mdash;and I think we utilise hand-won turf in this country to a greater extent than any other turf-burning country that I know of.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point made by Deputy Lemass as to the methods of distribution and sale of turf under this Bill, he will be glad to know, as I was glad to be informed by the board, that they cannot produce the turf in sufficient quantities at the moment to meet the demand.  All the turf is sold at the bog and removed from the bog in the purchasers' own vehicles.  That demand, with the production, is growing and the board informs me that they have no doubt whatever that they will be able to get demand for the expanding production of their turf under the first and second developments and that they do not anticipate that they will have any difficulty there. However, if any difficulty should arise, it can and, I think, will be met.</P>
    <P>I do not want to reopen the whole thing again, but I would say, with regard to the point made by Deputy Killilea and Deputy J. Flynn, that the whole trouble, as far as we are concerned in relation either to the permanent schemes of Bord na Móna or to the special schemes which Bord na Móna are being asked to operate&mdash;and which were formerly operated by the county councils&mdash;is that we cannot get men to work them.  I want to assure Deputy Killilea and Deputy Flynn that neither in Galway nor in Kerry can we get all the men we require to work the bogs under the special schemes.  As a matter of fact, two of the bogs which were earmarked this year under the special schemes in Kerry had to be closed down because we could not get enough men to work on them.  Out of approximately 25 bogs, there were four on which we could not get enough men even to work them in some sort of an economic way.  Of the remaining 21 bogs, I doubt if there are more than four of them on which we have the full number of men required to produce the turf that should be produced on them. <Col N="1009" /> I have said that the one black spot in relation to this whole scheme which I am putting before the House in connection with the development of our own resources to-day is that we are looking for 1,000 men and cannot get them.</P>
    <P>This year we started on a very special recruiting campaign.  We went only to labour exchanges that were located near bog areas.  We tried to recruit only single men.  The instructions were that only single men with a knowledge of turf work were to be asked to accept employment.  Of 2,700 single men so interviewed and considered suitable to work those permanent schemes, I am sorry to say that only 340 of them were prepared to take up the jobs.  The fact is that, as a result of being 1,000 men short, the work even this year is being slowed up.  The men who should now be employed on bog development and bog drainage&mdash;which, as Deputies know as well as I do, can only be done during the summer months and the dry weather&mdash;have had to be taken off the development and drainage work and put on the production of turf. Deputies may talk and say that it is not fair to ask a man to go to Kildare, Tipperary or somewhere else and take up work there on the bog.  I suggest that there is not very much in that argument when, in the next breath, I am told men are being forced to go to work in the mines of Great Britain because there is no work available for them at home.  I do not think there is any tremendous hardship at all in asking an able-bodied single man who has a knowledge of turf work to accept work here in Ireland in preference to going into the bowels of the earth and working in the coal mines of Great Britain.  I make an appeal here and now and I ask every member of this House to try and help us to get the additional men we require.  It is deplorable to have to say that we have jobs for 1,000 men, but that we cannot get the men.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which this Bill has been received.  May I say that one of the reasons for part of the delay in bringing this Bill before <Col N="1010" /> the House was the recasting of the whole scheme in connection with the housing.  We thought it more desirable to build them in groups or villages and to provide water and sewerage rather than go on the other way.  I think that Deputies will agree that whatever delay was occasioned by the recasting of these plans was justified.</P>

      <P>The Housing Bill, which the Minister introduced this evening, is a modest measure, and I am sure the Minister himself would not <Col N="1012" /> describe is as more than a useful little Bill.  It contains nothing spectacular, nothing revolutionary, and nothing that might be described as more than questionable. It is the sort of a Bill, tidying up a few odds and ends, which might be introduced pending the introduction of a more comprehensive and a better-considered measure.  In that sense we are prepared to accept the Bill and to give it a Second Reading. We do, of course, reserve the right to put down amendments to deal with other deficiencies in the existing codes of legislation which could as readily be dealt with, we believe, in the measure as the specific matters with which it deals.</P>
      <P>We hope, however, that the Bill now before the House is not intended to indicate the lines upon which the Government propose to tackle the housing problem in the future.  On a Bill of such limited scope as this it would scarcely, I agree, be appropriate to open a general discussion on so complex and difficult a problem as that of housing.  Apart from this, however, the schedule of business which the Dáil has adopted for the concluding stages of the session would probably preclude one from opening such a discussion at any length.  To do so would obviously be contrary to the spirit of the agreement and would encroach unfairly on the time of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, one or two broad aspects of the matter which, perhaps, I might touch, upon now.  The first of these is that over the years our attack on this problem has consisted very largely of improvisations and variations upon, as musicians might say, two themes, the Labourers Act of 1883 and the Housing of the Working Classes Act of 1890.  These Acts have been the joint foundations of our housing codes.  Past housing measures have been based upon them, and the provisions of these codes have been extended and adapted to give a solution of sorts to the pressing housing problems of the day.  The consequence, I think, now is that the very important provisions of principal Acts have been so strained that the whole statutory structure is in danger of collapsing.  I regret, therefore, to <Col N="1013" /> note that the Minister would seem to suggest in his memorandum that nothing is likely to be done before 31st December, 1955, to review in its broad principles and in its general structure the legislation upon which the execution of our future housing programmes is going to depend.</P>
    <P>The next development to which serious attention will have to be given is the fact that the financial burden imposed by our housing programmes has already attained proportions which were undreamed of when the basic measures to which I have referred were first enacted.  Indeed, we have now come, I think, to the stage at which we may well ask ourselves, can the community continue to carry this burden in the proportions in which it has been allocated hitherto among the various interests involved? The local authorities are already crying out that they and the ratepayers whom they act for cannot continue to accept their present share of it, at least on the present scale.  In the majority of cases, the tenants of new houses are proclaiming that they are in the same position, and the very fact that this year the Government find themselves unable to meet their obligations for housing grants out of the ordinary revenue of the year, is in itself a confession that the annual burden is becoming too much, even for the Government.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances, surely it is urgent that the whole matter of tackling the housing question should be considered afresh, that legislative procedure, finances and methods of construction should be examined to see whether housing costs cannot be brought down?  The central authority is giving very generous grants, and the local authorities are supplementing them, in some cases by direct subventions from the rates and in other cases indirectly by remissions of rates, yet I, for one, am very doubtful whether the full value, or anything approaching the full value of the grants in aid, either to the purchasers where the houses are built for private individuals, or to the tenants of new houses where they are built for local authorities, accrues to the members of the community who, as <Col N="1014" /> ratepayers and taxpayers, are providing them in such generous measure.</P>
    <P>In my view it is time that this whole question was faced up to and closely investigated.  It has been the fashion in this House for members of the Labour Party to attack Irish manufacturers and to stigmatise them, not merely as profiteers, but as criminals. The Tánaiste himself has given the lead in this matter, but I have not heard any member of the Labour Party, Tánaiste or otherwise, criticise the profits made by certain firms of builders' providers, and yet those profits appear to be colossal, certainly colossal if the standard taken be the rate of profit allowable in our manufacturing industries.</P>
    <P>Another question mark that has been before my mind for a long time is as to whether the local authorities are the best instruments to employ for the solution of the housing problem, whether, indeed, the widespread dispersal of responsibility among so many bodies of dissimilar capacity and resources does not militate against the economic and expeditious solution of the problem.  Beyond any question, I think it will have to be admitted that it certainly creates serious administrative difficulties arising out of the wide discrepancies in the rents charged in contiguous areas and of the different standards of maintenance and repair which obtain in them, as well as the almost insoluble financial difficulties arising out of the very great difficulty of shouldering the monetary burdens of housing programmes.</P>
    <P>In saying what I have said on this matter, I must also emphasise that it must not be forgotten either that we were striving to improvise in the fashion I have suggested by the desperate need of our people for houses.  After generations of neglect we found ourselves with a slum problem and a housing problem more acute and more appalling than any in Europe.  Unfortunately, I have to say in justice to the Administration of which I was a member, and in rebuttal of the attacks which were made on that Administration in the course of the debate on the Estimate for Local Government, I have to say that, unfortunately, <Col N="1015" /> that first Administration which took over this part of the country from the British did not evince any great determination to deal with it.  Indeed, their record in dealing with this great social evil can hardly be qualified by any other adjective than despicable.</P>

      <P>I want to show the progress which has been made in dealing with the problem with which this country was faced when it took over from 1922 to 1924.  The problem, therefore, if we keep that figure of the 29,000 houses built in eight years in our minds, a problem which, through centuries of neglect and oppression was reflected in the appalling housing conditions of a very great number of our people, remained to confront the Fianna Fáil Government when the people threw Deputy Dunne's friends out of office in 1932.  How did the last Administration face up to that, to the situation which then confronted them? Not by a puny measure like this.  The first serious Housing Act passed by the Government in this Dáil, passed by an Irish Government, was the monumental Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  It was passed by Fianna Fáil in its first year of office in the teeth, I must say, of the most unscrupulous Opposition that ever sat in this House.</P>
      <P>Under that Act, in the 15 years from 1932 to 1947, no less than 141,000 houses were built, and during six years of that time as I have already reminded Deputy Byrne, active war was being waged in Europe.  Materials for the greater portion of the time were practically unobtainable.  They were considerably restricted if in improved supply, during 1946 and 1947, and only began to be available in really significant quantities in 1948.  Notwithstanding the period from 1941 to 1947 when building materials were practically unprocurable, 141,099 houses were built by Fianna Fáil, most of them in the last six years.  Now let Deputy Dunne &mdash;he is not in the House but someone may take the trouble to refer him to these figures&mdash;compare the 29,000 houses built by Deputy Dunne's friends in the eight years, 1924 to 1932, with the 120,000 houses built by Fianna Fáil over six years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dunne's indictment of the Fianna Fáil Administration in relation to County Dublin housing was entirely misdirected.  It is quite true that the <Col N="1017" /> progress in providing houses over the period 1933 to 1941 was most disappointing in County Dublin.  But during that period Deputy Dunne's Fine Gael friends had a majority on the Dublin County Council.  They controlled it and they blocked every endeavour to make progress with housing in their efforts to embarrass the Fianna Fáil Government.  They were not only dilatory in availing of the generous grants which the 1932 Act made available, but they actually connived at a campaign to prevent the due payment of rates by landowners within their administrative area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going on to say that the county council were not only dilatory in preparing schemes and availing of the generous provisions of the Housing Act of 1932, but they actually connived at a campaign to prevent the due payment of rates by landowners within their administration area.  In that way the finances of the council were completely disorganised and eventually the accumulated arrears of rates due and not collected amounted to over £200,000 or approximately 50 per cent. of the rate collectable.  Thus, Deputy Dunne's friends had reduced the Dublin County Council to a condition in which it had neither the inclination nor the finances to embark upon a housing scheme commensurate with its people's needs.  That was the position when my patience as a democrat became exhausted and I dissolved the Dublin County Council and replaced its <Col N="1018" /> members by a commissioner administering its affairs.</P>
      <P>Now, in the course of the debate on the Vote for Local Government, Deputy Dunne took occasion to attack the administration of these commissioners. The first task of these commissioners, in order that they might be allowed to get on with housing, was to reorganise the finances of the county council and restore its solvency.  In addition, their attention was largely demanded by measures for the protection of the people and for ensuring a continuance of their food supplies which the war in Europe made necessary.  The finances of the county council, however, having been reorganised, and the rates having been brought down from their previous unjustifiable level, the commissioners were able&mdash;at my instance a succession of them&mdash;to devote their attention to the planning of a comprehensive housing scheme to meet the needs of Dublin County.  This they did with the utmost expedition.  One thousand prospective sites were earmarked.  The statutory inquiries were held.  The sites were cleared and plans were prepared for 500 houses and let out to tender.</P>
      <P>While this was being done, Deputy Dunne was neither in Dáil Éireann nor in the Dublin County Council.  He had no hand, act or part, nor had any of his friends, in the preparation of the plans or in their execution.  Only he would have the brazen audacity now to claim credit for them.  I trust that, after this exposure, we shall hear no more of his empty bragging in this House in regard to this matter.  I do not wish to take up any more time. I have merely to add that the individual members of this Party have certain suggestions to make for improving this Bill.  Most of them, I believe, will involve only very simple amendments which can be readily drafted for inclusion in the Bill when it comes again before us on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust the Minister will see his way, when winding up this debate, to indicate that he is prepared to accept these proposals in principle and to introduce amendments on the Committee Stage for the purpose of <Col N="1019" /> embodying them in the Bill.  One suggestion to which I should like to direct his particular attention is that made by Deputy Lemass in the discussion on the Turf Development Bill. The suggestion is that housing grants should be made conditional, where feasible, on the beneficiaries installing turf-burning ranges and stoves in their houses.  That is an excellent suggestion which I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce would like to see implemented, and I trust the Minister for Local Government will himself consider it favourably.</P>

      <P>Unlike Deputy MacEntee, I intervene purely for the purpose of saying that I heartily welcome this measure.  I believe it to be constructive and progressive.  It is one upon which the Minister deserves congratulation, and it is one which will have the support of the vast majority of the people inside the House and outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy MacEntee, I am disappointed that the <Col N="1020" /> scope of this Bill is not much wider. I welcome the Bill, and I concede that it is a step in the right direction, but I think that larger steps will have to be taken in the very near future to solve the housing problem in Dublin. The problem in Dublin is by far the biggest problem in the country.  The Minister must realise that when this Bill becomes law Dublin Corporation's need of finance will be even greater than it is at present.  He knows that at the moment Dublin Corporation is in process of seeking another loan. The money which we raised has practically run out.  It will last until the end of this year.  The commitments of the Corporation at the moment for contracts in progress are over a quarter of a million per month.  That is the first matter to which I would draw the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>The first question to which I would like a reply is, has he, in consultation with the Government and the Minister for Finance, come to any decision as regards the raising of moneys for the continued progress of the housing programme of the Dublin Corporation? This Bill will throw an additional burden on the corporation. There are thousands of applicants at the moment under the Small Dwellings Act, and there will be many more thousands when this Bill becomes law. At the moment we are allocating under three heads.  We are allocating 65 per cent. to the houses built for ordinary slum clearance and we are getting two-thirds in subsidy; we are allocating 25 per cent. to people who are living in non-slum areas but in overcrowded conditions; for them we only get one-third subsidy.  The Minister must know that there are many thousands in Dublin living in single rooms in non-tenement areas. In some instances, there are as many as seven people in one room.  Only 25 per cent. of the applications that are in can be dealt with in any building year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next question is in relation to the newly-weds.  For houses built for the newly-weds we only receive from the Government a sum of £250.  The whole broad policy of finance in relation to housing must be tackled.  I <Col N="1021" /> would like to bring the Minister back to his own method of tackling it.  I think it is Deputy Captain Cowan's method, too, and I have come round to the belief myself that it is the right method.  I think the time has come when housing must be made a national charge because the Dublin ratepayers certainly will not be in a position much longer to go ahead with the housing programme envisaged by the corporation and by the Minister.  We cannot find the money.  We cannot put any more on to the rates than they are bearing at present.  When the Minister was a Deputy in this House he had his name to a motion, together with the late Deputy Tadhg Murphy and Deputy Martin O'Sullivan.  It was No. 12 on the Order Paper.  The motion asked that a national corporation be set up to deal with this housing problem and to make advances for the purposes of the corporation at a rate of interest not exceeding 1¼ per cent. per annum, including the provision for capital redemption.  Our last loan in the corporation was raised at 3½ per cent.  In other words, we have to refund at more than double the rate that we had to refund the previous loan.  We have to lend that money to applicants under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act for a term of 35 years, and with the new legislation now there will be a bigger rush and we will need more money.  I know what the reply is&mdash;the market may be different in 15 years, we do not know whether the rates of interest will rise or fall&mdash;but the point for the Dublin Corporation is that, every year for the next ten to 15 years, they will have to look for a sum of money in the neighbourhood of £5,000,000 for housing purposes.</P>
    <P>I want a categorical answer from the Minister as to whether any specific arrangement has been or will be made to raise money at a low rate of interest.  The Minister, when he was a Deputy, was very fond of striking that particular note.  He thought we should get money at 1¼ per cent. per annum. I want to know if he finds that still a practicable proposition; and, if not, why not?</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make Section 6 retrospective.  Quite a <Col N="1022" /> number of people bought houses and did not get the benefit of the grant of £275.  They also had to pay duty, which was approximately another £100. I would ask the Minister to make this retrospective, to bring in those who bought houses from November 1st, 1947.  I take it one would have to go back to that date.  They would not be a very big number.  It is only justice to those who have bought houses to whom the grant did not apply and who were the first occupiers and are still in occupation.  It may be contended that it will be difficult to prove that they were the first occupiers. I put it to the Minister that in the case of those who bought the houses under the Small Dwellings Act there is no difficulty.  As he knows, they must reside in them for three years and the houses were under inspection by the corporation or local authority inspectors from the time they were started.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to do that.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cost of houses, only too often the builders have been held up to opprobrium.  There is, however, a regular racket in this city by landowners.  They will not sell the land outright&mdash;land that was good for nothing but grazing or a sports field at a nominal yearly rent.  They charge a fine of £150 for each site.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>£200.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting the particular instance I know of.  They also stipulate to the builder, before they allow him to build, what the ground rent is to be and in the case I am citing it is to be £15 per annum.  Now £150, taking eight houses to the acre is £1,200; the ground rent at £15, capitalised at 20 years' purchase, for eight houses to the acre, is £2,400; making a total of £3,600 that those people are taking out of it.  That is something the Minister must tackle.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will be an easy matter to deal with.  I was about to suggest to the Minister that for State houses no such fine should <Col N="1023" /> exist and that the price of land should be a certain figure, but I know that in certain areas it must vary.  The Minister might say that the ground rents to be charged for any grant houses, for the best grant house, should not exceed £10; but what I might suggest as a maximum might be taken as a minimum, so there would have to be a graded scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Mr. M.J. O'Higgins Mr. M.J. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>They would preclude grant houses as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>These are things that are putting up the cost of building. They put a few hundred pounds on to the cost of the house.  I know it for a fact that small builders have practically nothing in the long run.  They are only getting a living, with very little profit, while the land sharks are getting it all.  The Minister must evolve some means of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>Finally, I would ask him to come to grips with the corporation on the finance question.  Twice last year when we were to meet the Minister and the Minister for Finance, on each occasion that appointment to meet the deputation was cancelled at the last moment. I do not think it was nice treatment. Deputy Alderman Peadar Doyle and myself turned up here at 4 o'clock, the time of the appointment, and were told only at that moment that the appointment had been cancelled.</P>
      <P>On the previous occasion, the same thing happened.  I got notice in the morning&mdash;having put off business for the afternoon&mdash;that the deputation was not to go to the Minister.  Bear it in mind that the corporation cannot possibly proceed with the programme which they envisage if proper State aid is not forthcoming.  I think the Minister will agree that as Dublin is a clearing-house for the whole country it is entitled to terms better than elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinOSullivan" hpid="Mr. M. O'Sullivan Mr. M. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will, of necessity, be very brief.  First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister on the forthright way in which he has introduced this Bill.  It is obvious that there is widespread approval for it <Col N="1024" /> throughout the country.  There are certain aspects of it about which I think the Minister should be warned in advance.  The failure of the 1948 Bill may be very largely ascribed to two or three causes.  The first is the form of the grant, the second the question of sites and the third the question of the deposit which an individual has to pay.  Provision is being made in this Bill for a rectification of that position. In Section 16, provision is made for the necessary acquisition of sites and in Section 27 the necessary rectification is being made with regard to valuations.</P>
      <P>Might I point out the interesting experience we have had in Dublin in connection with the question of sites as indicating the necessity for the change which the Minister is making? The Dublin Corporation advertised a number of sites which were at their disposal and for these there were no fewer than 1,300 applicants, while it was only possible to allocate something between 300 and 400.  The remainder of the applicants had to be disappointed because the sites which the corporation had were only just the tail-ends of their own schemes.  That, as I say, is being altered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want particularly to direct the Minister's attention to Section 27, because it is quite possible that he may be creating a sea of trouble for himself. The present Bill proposes a 5 per cent deposit.  The average cost of the houses purchased in the city for the past two years runs to about £1,800. Five per cent. in that case would call for a deposit of £90.  Actually, the experience we have had is that the deposits do not run below £250.  They went, as a matter of fact, over £350, and the individual borrowing that deposit, it should be remembered, has to furnish his new house.  That arose from the fact that the valuation was linked with the terms of the Small Dwellings Act of 1899 which related to the question of market value and market value, as prescribed by the valuers employed by the local authorities, differs very widely from the actual cost of building a house.  Under Section 27 the Minister proposes to alter that.  I would, however, warn him in advance that there may be trouble because of the words he is using in that <Col N="1025" /> section.  He uses the words &ldquo;reasonable cost&rdquo;.  I think my legal friends will agree that there is no word in the English language so fruitful of litigation as the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. People will be under the impression that the deposit is 5 per cent. on something very close to the cost of the house, and if they have to pay anything beyond that there will be disappointment. Who is to declare what is a reasonable price?  The builder will charge one price and the purchaser, because he wants a house, will probably be prepared to pay something in advance of what might be a reasonable price and he will be the type of individual, the white collar worker, for which this Bill is largely introduced. The valuers acting under the Small Dwellings Act were people who were not connected with the local authorities. They were outside people and they conscientiously interpreted the words of the 1899 Act, with the result that the valuations which they placed on the houses were £100 lower than the price which the purchaser had to pay. The result was that the deposits ran from £250 to £400.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to tackle the machinery under which he is going to give effect to the new valuations.  Perhaps he will take a suggestion from me so far as the city is concerned. Probably the best means of approaching the matter would be to allow the building surveyors of the Dublin Corporation, who are the servants of the local authority, who are conversant with the actual operations in connection with the erection of houses from the foundation up, who have technical knowledge and, possibly, knowledge of building costs, to be associated with the operation of Section 27.  If outside valuers are brought in, they will fix what they deem to be a reasonable price, but it may be very much lower than the price the potential purchaser thinks it should be.  In that way, you will have a repetition of the evils which flowed from the operation of the Small Dwellings Act of 1899.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCann referred to a racket under the heading of finance.  That is perfectly true.  We have had abundant evidence in Dublin of fines on individual <Col N="1026" /> sites running from £200 down.  There is another section of the people who may also come very closely within that category.  My general experience of solicitors and architects is that, in the main, they are people who are reasonable and who are prepared to treat with their clients on a basis that is generally acceptable.  But, frankly, there have been departures from that code which are by no means of an isolated character.  I think the purchasers, since they are being taken under the wing of the Minister to such a large degree, might be taken completely under his wing, because after the deposit which will be paid under the Bill and after we have ironed out the difficulties with regard to valuation, the purchaser will still be faced with the question of legal costs.  He will not be faced with the question of architects' costs in the same way, because now that the grant is being given to the first purchaser of a house, he can buy his house from an ordinary private builder and the question of an architect does not arise.</P>
    <P>I want to give a sample of what is taking place so far as legal costs are concerned.  I am sure the case is within the knowledge of Deputy O'Grady, as it is now common knowledge.  It is the case of a borrower under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, who made an application to the Ennis Urban Council and submitted a bill of costs as follows: Urban council solicitor for negotiation of his lease under the Small Dwellings Act, £44 13s. 10d., plus £4 6s. 0d., making a total outlay of £48 19s. 10d.  I should say that in the case of a number of local authorities, their legal men are paid on a different basis from that in operation under the Dublin Corporation.  The average cost of a loan under the Dublin Corporation is £7 7s. 0d. Here is a man charged £48 19s. 10d.</P>
    <P>Then there were the private solicitor's costs&mdash;that is, presumably, of his own solicitor&mdash;of £42 and there were costs payable to the firm's solicitor in connection with the preparation of the lease of £35 7s. 1d.  So the total legal costs in that particular instance amounted to £129 6s. 11d., paid in <Col N="1027" /> effect for the borrowing of a certain amount of money which he will have to repay at a fairly high rate of interest for the rest of his life.  In order to get legal possession, to get the keys of his house, he had to pay these solicitors who, it would appear, muscled in on the transaction, a total sum of £129 6s. 11d.  I have the details of four other cases before me in which the legal costs to the individuals concerned amounted to £50, £50, £50 and £30. I suggest that in so far as the Minister proposes to take power under this Bill to include in the cost of the house reasonable legal expenses he should direct the attention of his officers to what is apparently taking place when certain members of the legal profession are employed and I would suggest to him that people, who can least afford to be taxed in this way, should be protected.</P>
    <P>May I make one more observation and I shall conclude on it?  So far as this question of costs in reference to housing is concerned, it has struck me that the provision of houses for people in the urban areas and cities is the counterpart of the scheme that placed the farmers of our country in possession of their holdings.  Now the Land Commission has been severely criticised all down the years, but there is one thing that can be said to its credit: its legal procedure appears to have been a model of simplicity and the title which it gives, complete and absolute, is disclosed in what is known as the land certificate.  What is wrong with a procedure of that kind being employed to ensure that unfortunate people who are seeking houses will not be mulcted in the way I have described?</P>

That is, in the main, what it does; and, so far as it goes, we all welcome it.  Certain defects developed in the working of the 1948 Act which are now being corrected in this Bill.  If I understood Deputy O'Sullivan correctly&mdash;unfortunately I could not hear him too well owing to his hoarseness&mdash;I think he referred to the failure of the 1948 Act. Unfortunately I have not with me the figures that were given here recently, but if my memory serves me right, in Dublin, at any rate, of the total number of houses that were built, half of them, or nearly half of them, were built by individuals and public utility societies.</P>

      <P>The big thing that strikes any Deputy examining this Bill is that if progress is to be made under it, as we all hope under the new conditions progress will be made, there must be some specific arrangement about finance.  We have had the position in the last 12 months, although the number of houses built was not at all satisfactory, that the corporation was driven to extremes to find the money and then they had to find it on most uneconomic terms both for the building of houses erected directly by them and for the financing of loans for grant houses, as they are called. There was a position at one time last <Col N="1029" /> year when a number of people with whom I happened to be in touch did not know where they stood as regards the commitments they had taken on themselves for the building of houses. There was a period when the corporation announced that they had only a certain amount left to operate the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act and that only a certain number of loans could be given.  I know that certain people were very apprehensive because of the commitments into which they had entered and they did not know how they were going to complete the job which they had taken in hand.</P>
      <P>Again, a rate of interest of 4 per cent. on the amount borrowed spread over a period of five years is enough to daunt any young man starting out to set up a home.  He will have to pay a heavy sum for the rest of his life to keep a roof over his head.  Much of that could be avoided, if interest rates were more reasonable.  The Minister should remember that before this Government came into office, the corporation was able to get money at 2½ per cent.  We have never had a satisfactory explanation as to why interest rates jumped by ¾ per cent. immediately the Government came into office.  I would suggest that the Minister should make inquiries along the lines suggested by Deputy MacEntee as regards the price of building materials and builders' profits.  There is probably some room for a reduction in these figures.  If houses could be purchased at a reasonable figure, the efforts of ordinary private individuals would help materially in solving the enormous problem we have before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The housing position in Dublin is undoubtedly a desperate problem and to my mind it has grown worse during the last ten years since the beginning of the war.  A class of people outside slum dwellers has been driven into conditions that in some cases are actually unchristian and in respectable areas new slumdoms have been created. There are cases to my own knowledge of father, mother and ten children living in a room ten foot square and, until very recently, they could not be housed by Dublin Corporation because they were not in tenement houses.  Deputy <Col N="1030" /> McCann has said that 25 per cent. of the houses will be allotted to such people, but put that way it will be a long time before some of them are housed.</P>
    <P>One good thing that I did read into the Bill was that some of those people, if they can save 5 per cent. of the money, will possibly be able to get a house, or alternatively, which would suit better some of the people I have in mind&mdash;because, owing to conditions and the rents they are paying, they will never be able to save that sum&mdash; it will be possible for the corporation to resume building of tenant-purchase houses.  I think that up to this the Minister's policy has been not to sanction tenant-purchase houses.  I think I am correct in saying that some time ago the corporation intended to build tenant-purchase houses on Dolan's land, Philipsburg Avenue, Fairview.  It was arranged but the Minister withdrew his sanction.  I think that was a mistake.  I have pleaded for this on every occasion I got since I came into this House.  The class of people catered for by the tenant-purchase houses have had no provision made for them over a long number of years.  I am a Dublin man and I know more about it than a lot of people who talk about it and the classes who have been driven into such conditions as were never known before due to the war situation, the hold up of ordinary building and the unfortunate fact that they are not able to find a deposit and pay big money, have had no provision made for them.  The tenant-purchase schemes which were carried out some years ago are a proof of the efficiency of that system.  I think that the Minister in his statement mentioned that such schemes would not be a charge on the rates.  As far as I know the rent payable by these people covers all the outgoings including principal and interest on the loan.</P>
    <P>As Deputy McCann mentioned rents are becoming such that there is a tremendous complaint about them. There is 3/2 on the rates in Dublin for the Housing Act this year to make up the deficit on housing, and I know people who are paying that 3/2 on the rates who are a lot worse off than some of the people who are getting <Col N="1031" /> subsidised houses.  I have met them personally, people who happened to have been left a little cottage by their father or grandfather, and whose conditions are such that they can get nowhere else.  The Minister should certainly give us some information if he can as to what is being done about finance, because this Bill will be just so many pious hopes if the financial question is not tackled, not just for the next few months, but for a long time ahead.  If it is to be a success it will be necessary to carry on for a long number of years before the housing problem is dealt with, as far as Dublin is concerned at any rate, and I seriously suggest to him that we should have an answer.</P>
    <P>There are a few points in the Bill on which I should like some clarification. Section 6, sub-section (1) (a) lines 37 and 38, states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;And is occupied for the first time on or after the date of completion of the purchase.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I want to know if that will create any conflict with the position that obtains at the moment in Dublin, where people who borrow under the Small Dwellings Act on a grant house, must actually be in possession of the house before they can get payment.  They generally have to get in on a caretaker's agreement to achieve that, as they are not in a position to finish the purchase of the house before that. If there is conflict I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to look into it, so that we will not have legal bothers in the future.</P>
    <P>Then there is the question of market value in Section 27.  We have heard a good deal to-night about site buying and I agree with what has been said, but the fact is that people getting grant houses have to face that.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the amount of the site fine a man might have to pay for the purpose of building his house would be included in the &ldquo;other expenses&rdquo;.  What is the meaning of the last phrase:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not including any fine, premium or other consideration for the acquisition of or leasehold interest in such tenement.&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> Does it mean that his site fine is ruled out?  If so, if people have to continue paying £150 or £200 which we all know is the average or perhaps even more in some cases, it will mean that a number of people will not be able to take advantage of the Bill.  Either something must be done about the question of site fines or they must be included in the amount calculated as market value.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of trade union labour mentioned in Section 12, naturally our objection is not to the principle of the section, but I would like to know if it could be held to operate against a group of young men who might get together, as has happened already, to build their own houses?  In the case of men in various occupations who might come together to work with each other, is it possible that the clause as worded would be held to rule them out?  I do not think any of us wants to stop people from helping themselves and I should like the clause to be examined from that point of view.</P>
    <P>We all agree with some of the other changes which the Bill makes.  The increase in floor space, now that materials are more plentiful than they were when the other Act was passed, will allow better and more valuable houses to be planned in future.  The prescribed 1,250 square feet area turned out to be an awkward area in planning, I understand.</P>
    <P>I should like to support the plea made by Deputy MacEntee that it should be made essential that the ranges and grates to be fixed in grant houses should be capable of burning turf to ensure that, when supplies become available for everybody, it will be possible to use turf in these ranges and grates.  I think that a very good national policy from every point of view.  I have tried to support that policy up to the present, even though some of the grates in my own house are not very suitable for this purpose. Some of them are and some of them are not, and I think it would be wise if such a clause were incorporated, so that it would not be possible for people in these houses in future to say: &ldquo;My grate will not burn turf&rdquo;, and so that <Col N="1033" /> they will not have that excuse for not using it.  On the whole, the Bill, if it can be put into operation, should prove useful.  The big essential will be finance and I suggest that steps should be taken to make finance available and we ought to be informed what steps are being taken to ensure that it will be available.</P>

      <P>I rise only because of a statement made by my colleague, Deputy McCann, concerning the price of sites in Dublin, and to direct the Minister's attention to a similar situation in the town of Ennis.  I am sure that a similar situation obtains in other towns, but I am particularly familiar with the situation in Ennis.  There sites are being sold to prospective house builders at £125 each, and, as there are eight houses sited on each acre, it works at £1,000 per acre for a start.  On top of that, there is a ground rent of £8 per plot.  The landlord gets £1,000 in cash and an income for 999 years of £64 per acre. Something ought to be done to bring down these costs, because, on top of that also, in Ennis, there is the racket to which Deputy Martin O'Sullivan referred of legal expenses.</P>

Unfortunately, <Col N="1034" /> laws are drafted by lawyers and they will scarcely penalise themselves too much.  Nobody will grudge them a reasonable fee, but they ought to consider the poor people who have to pay.  Legal fees in respect of these loans in Ennis&mdash;and the same obtains elsewhere to a lesser extent&mdash;run to about £130 and they are one of the principal reasons why building costs are so high, plus the costs of another class who enter into the building of houses, the builders' suppliers, who, Deputy MacEntee told us, are also reaping a rich harvest.  The Minister ought to look into it and help so far as possible to reduce the cost of building to enable these people who are so badly in need of houses, particularly in the provincial towns and in the City of Dublin, to be provided with suitable accommodation at a fairly reasonable figure.</P>

      <P>The Minister has something to be proud of in this measure, and it is a measure of which this inter-Party Government may well be proud. There is one further observation I want to make, as I appreciate the time is limited.  It is again with reference to Deputy MacEntee's speech.  I gathered from him that he was very much afraid of the financial implications of this measure, very much afraid that this country would not be able to afford the amount of money which will be involved in the housing programme and that this Government would not be able to find the amount of money involved.  I could not understand that coming from Deputy MacEntee particularly, who, if my memory serves me aright, and I believe it does in this instance, last year or the year before upbraided the members of Clann na Poblachta and censured them for not having the enthusiasm, the drive and the energy which he said he expected from them in the light of their preelection showing.  So far as the Clann na.  Poblachta Party is concerned, money is not going to stand in the way of providing the people of this country with decent housing.  I say that, knowing that I am speaking for the Party and speaking the Party's mind.  The Minister for External Affairs, the Leader of the Party, has said it and it is right to say that the Taoiseach has said it, that the Minister for Local Government has said it, and I <Col N="1036" /> believe the Minister for Finance has said that he is not going to let pounds, shillings and pence stand in the way of the provision of decent housing for the people of this country.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I, on behalf of this Party, congratulate the Minister for Local Government on introducing this measure.  I wish him all luck in its passage through this House and in its implementation when it becomes law.</P>

      <P>There has been some reference to what are called legal costs.  I attempted to deal with this matter yesterday, but I found I was out of order on the Estimate.  I wanted to deal with it in more detail, but it has been dealt with to-day in sufficient detail.  Legal costs are a big item for those persons for whom this Bill seeks to create additional facilities to acquire their own little houses.  Apart from the legal costs, which I think the Minister will look into, I do not know that this Bill goes far enough in making it possible for the type of person the Minister has in mind to acquire his own house.  I want to say quite openly and frankly that I believe the Minister is trying quite sincerely to improve existing legislation.  I say that without any hesitation or reservation.  I want to point out, however, that the Minister <Col N="1038" /> will find disillusion and disappointment because of technical difficulties of which, probably, he has not been made aware.</P>
      <P>We are reducing the deposit to be demanded of a person who is to be given a house but, if the Minister will examine the position, he will find that the income of the applicant will be the main consideration by the local authority as to his ability to meet his commitments. I have knowledge of this situation.  The corporation or a local authority will rent a house to an individual whose income, say, is £5 10s. per week.  That person will not be able to buy a house even though the commitments would not be in excess of the 25/- a week rent.  It may be that the authority has in mind that if he falls into arrears with his rent, they can evict him.  I have knowledge of particular cases where a person had an income of £7 or £8 a week but who, on account of his private expenditure, was not as good a risk for the local authority as the man with £5 10s. a week.  The man with £5 10s. or £6 a week may be a non-smoker, non-drinker, non-gambler. His wife may save money by sewing for the children but, because that person's income, on the face of it, is not sufficient, from the point of view of the local authority, to be regarded as a good risk, he is denied a house while another individual, who may have £1 a week more, but who may smoke 40 cigarettes a day and drink three or four pints a day, and have other methods of spending his money, is regarded as a good risk.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister seriously to consider how that person may be met who, from the point of view of his character, from the point of view of constant employment and from the point of view of his private behaviour, is a worthy person to be considered and to be helped in the acquisition of his own home.  I do not want to develop that too far but, if the Minister will make inquiries, he will find that what I have said is correct and that I have not exaggerated.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I put down the following question for answer to-day:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state (a) the number of men who were dismissed from the Board of Works in the week preceding Christmas, 1949; (b) the number of those men who were since re-employed; (c) the average period of employment, prior to dismissal, of those who were re-employed; (d) the average period of employment, prior to dismissal, of those who were not re-employed; and (e) whether some men were refused re-employment who were members of the I.R.A. and had not National Army discharge papers.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put down that question for answer principally to find out what was the position of men who served in the Republican Army from 1916-1949 as regards employment in Government or semi-Government institutions.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his reply, as far as I am concerned, made it perfectly clear that the only people who get preferential treatment are men who have had certain service in the Defence Forces and men with military service in the period 1916-1923.  Consequently, I am entitled to assume, as far as the present Government is concerned, that men who took up arms in 1916, who helped to proclaim the Republic in 1916, who accepted and swore allegiance in 1919 to the first Dáil which was elected by the people, who remained loyal to the Republic and their oath of allegiance throughout the years that followed right up to 1949, when all Parties in the Twenty-Six Counties accepted the position and the political principles that those men stood for&mdash;that, in the Republic which is now generally accepted by all Parties in this country and all Governments outside the country&mdash;whose loyalty and steadfast determination was responsible throughout those years for maintaining a republican position, are to be deprived of earning their livelihood in what is generally accepted now as the Republic of Ireland.  I am not <Col N="1040" /> satisfied with that.  I believe that the people who were responsible for maintaining that position should at least get the same recognition as the men who served from 1916 to 1923.</P>
    <P>In the first instance, I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not raising this matter on the Adjournment because I have any objection at all to men who served in the Defence Forces in any period being offered and accepting special treatment or getting employment in the Republic of Ireland. I have no objection to the men who are described in the answer to-day as men who served from 1916 to 1923, who have military service medals or who are getting pensions or employment in this country.  I would point out, however, that in every country of Europe &mdash;with the possible exception of Ireland&mdash;the people who were steadfast to an ideal and who lived to see that ideal coming to be accepted were not pushed aside.  My complaint to-day was that certain men who were employed in the Board of Works for a number of years lost that employment. I had in mind one case in particular of which the Parliamentary Secretary is well aware&mdash;that of a man named Kirwan who was never a member of the Regular Army in this country.  All his life, from the time he left school, he was a member of the Republican Army.  As a member of that army, he served terms of imprisonment in England for what he believed was the best method of bringing home to the British Government the knowledge that while Ireland was unfree she would never be at rest.  When he returned to this country he found himself again arrested and interned under a native Government in a native prison camp. On release from prison he applied for and secured employment in the Board of Works.  He was there, I understand, for a period of one and a half years.  Last Christmas, with a number of other men&mdash;some of whom were in a similar position to himself&mdash;he was dismissed.  The Parliamentary Secretary does not accept the word &ldquo;dismissed&rdquo;; he said he was &ldquo;let go&rdquo; because of redundancy.  It was all the same to Mr. Kirwan and those other men who found themselves idle on <Col N="1041" /> Christmas Eve, whether they were &ldquo;dismissed&rdquo; or &ldquo;let go&rdquo;.  I cannot see any difference in it.  To them there was no difference.  The fact of the matter was that on Christmas Eve they had no jobs.  In the ordinary course of my duties as a public representative I made representations in writing to the Parliamentary Secretary in connection with some of these men. One of them possessed some of the qualifications that were specified by this Government or the previous Government in respect of 1916 to 1923 service. I understand that he was re-employed about six months later. The other man, in whom I am particularly interested, was sent for last February and told to report to the labour exchange for work.  When he went there he was asked for his discharge papers.  He explained that the only discharge papers he had were discharge papers from Brixton Prison and the Curragh.  He was told there was no employment for him.  It was not pointed out to him that if he had a military service medal in respect of the period 1916 to 1923 he might be considered.</P>
    <P>I want the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what the actual attitude of the present Government is towards men who continued loyally in the Republican Army and towards men who possibly dropped out of the Republican Army and took no part in any political organisation outside that during the years 1916 to 1950. Some of them&mdash;in fact, quite a number of them&mdash;have no medals and no pensions.  They did not apply for them.  They volunteered and gave service to Ireland when it was needed. They are satisfied that a genuine attempt is made in the Twenty-Six Counties to establish the republican position, having broken the last link which bound this part of the country to Britain.  The men who remained on and who still remain on in the Republican Army are not asking for any special favours.  They do not want pensions or medals, but they feel, and I feel, that they are entitled to the ordinary privilege which every Irishman should be entitled to, namely, the right to secure employment in his own country, wherever employment is offered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> One field of employment which is sometimes temporary, but which very often becomes permanent, is through the Board of Works, a Department that comes under the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Secretary.  In this Department, as I have already pointed out, some of these people secured employment.  During a period of 18 months it is only reasonable to expect that if there was not some vendetta against them they might have been appointed to permanent positions.  As my information would tend to indicate, other people who went into the Department afterwards were appointed to permanent positions.  If it is the policy of the Government that these men should be accepted on the same terms as other Irishmen, then, when opportunities of permanent employment in the Board of Works present themselves, it is only reasonable to expect that they would have been pushed forward for that employment.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries into this matter and I have challenged the Parliamentary Secretary to make inquiries also as to their suitability as workmen, their character, and their ability to carry out all the duties that were imposed on them during their period of employment there.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary will have to admit that the foremen or supervisors, or whoever would be over those men, have no complaint, good, bad or indifferent, to offer in regard to them.</P>
    <P>The position is that we who were colleagues of theirs through that quarter of a century feel that a great advance was made here when all Parties accepted the republican position. We did not want to shout or boast, as we might have, that we won, because naturally, while we were defeated in arms in 1923, those of us who survived to keep the fight going on and who saw the republican position accepted by everyone in 1949, could honestly say: &ldquo;Well, we have won that round, even though we know there is another one yet to come.&rdquo;  But, in winning that round, we feel that we have created a position in which all the forces of the Twenty-Six Counties can be and should be directed together for the purpose of completing the job that was taken in hand in 1916.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1043" /> It is, however, a deplorable position to see that, far from that, the men who created, through their steadfast loyalty to the republican position, the enmity of their political opponents during those years, should now be deprived of the ordinary privilege of securing work, especially work that is offered in Government or semi-Government institutions.</P>
    <P>So far as I am personally concerned, I am taking this opportunity to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and the House to this position. I want the Parliamentary Secretary to convey my views to the Government, that I believe this vendetta is unjust.  I am not quite sure whether it is this Government, the previous Government or the Government before, that was responsible for making this regulation, but in answer to a supplementary question to-day the Parliamentary Secretary said that this was a Government regulation.  I put it to him, is the present Government responsible for making this regulation, and I want him to tell the present Government that if that is so, and that if this regulation continues to deprive the men who fought for the Republic throughout the last quarter of a century from getting ordinary employment in that Republic, I will seriously have to consider what loyalty I can continue to give to the Government while that regulation remains on their books.</P>

      <P>I rise in connection with the answer of the Parliamentary Secretary to-day to the question which has been referred to now, because I do not think that I quite understood it or that members of the House are quite clear on it.  I understand that in 1946 a circular was issued to all Departments of State with regard to employment, whether direct Government employment or where the Government could, if you like, make recommendations that there should be certain priorities (a) priority to members of the 1916 forces; (b) priority to persons who served from 1917 to 1923, irrespective of the side they were on in the civil war, and (c) priority for those who served in the forces during the emergency occasioned by the last <Col N="1044" /> war.  The Parliamentary Secretary's answer gave me to understand that priority was now going to apply only to those who served from 1916 or 1917 up to 1923.</P>

      <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to answer this question if he has the time: is it not a fact that where contractors are given contracts by the Board of Works every employee has to go through the Parliamentary Secretary's office; in other words, they are sent from the labour exchange and that the vetting is done in the Parliamentary Secretary's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to make clear is that the contractor himself has not full responsibility, as in ordinary cases.  I have yet to know a contractor who, having had a man in his employment for a considerable period and having to lay him off for lack of work, would then employ for another scheme a completely new person, leaving aside the person who had previously worked for him, unless there was some direction given to him.  This is rather an important matter, and I feel that the Parliamentary Secretary should answer my query about the regulation of 1946 &mdash;if it is still in existence and is being adhered to.  I am not going to say I go all the way with the Deputy with regard to what he states now as to members of an existing republican force outside of State forces.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy <Col N="1045" /> Fitzpatrick will not mind if I take Deputy Briscoe's questions first.  I said to-day plainly, in reply to the question&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Briscoe should not have got mixed up about it&mdash;that preference in employment is given to men who had certain service in the Defence Forces and men with military service in the period 1916-1923 who had been granted active or general service medals.</P>

      <P>I want to tell the House and Deputy Fitzpatrick that I know his case fairly well.  He has named a certain individual, a man named Kirwan.  I never met him in my lifetime, but surely he should examine his conscience, when he himself has admitted that on one occasion he was set on after he had been left off, not dismissed, as Deputy Fitzpatrick says, because work ceased at Christmas.  He was one of four at that time.</P>
      <P>The House will agree that, as far as I am concerned, I was not to be blamed, as apparently I recommended him again, and when he went to the job he was not accepted.  I want to make it plain that I have not the employment of men.  When certain positions are vacant.  I have the recommendation of men to the Department of Social Welfare, to the local labour exchange.  If there are five vacancies, I nominate five men.  If they are not suitable, within the regulations&mdash;that is to say, unemployed and within this certain Government regulation that I am about to speak of&mdash;they are not set on. Then I have to nominate five more, or five more again, until such time as they will qualify according to the regulations, and then they are set on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1046" /> On the 28th December, 1946, there was a Government regulation, as I stated here to-day&mdash;I stated the truth to the Deputy and surely the Deputy does not blame me for telling the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. Fitzpatrick Mr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary, but I blame whoever is responsible for making that regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulation was made on the 28th December, 1946. Surely I did not make it.  I may have my own views about it being right or wrong, as the case may be.  All I can say to the Deputy and to the House is that I will bring the views expressed here to-night before the Government&mdash; the Deputy's views especially&mdash;and it is a matter for the Government to decide.  As for this House to hold me responsible for men who are employed or not employed, I am not responsible for certain regulations at the moment, for the regulation of December 28th, 1946.  It is a Government regulation that has to be complied with.  As regards service from 1916 to 1923 and again service in the Defence Forces, they get preference, provided they are registered unemployed men.  That is the regulation.  Some people may agree with that and some may disagree.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned myself, there is one class of man that, if ever they do come to me&mdash;they have to, I regret to say it&mdash;I would do anything I could for, that is, the 1916 men.  As far as I can, they get first preference, whether I am to be blamed for that or not.  I would make it plain that there are always certain people that&mdash;I do not know why; probably there is a good reason for it&mdash;when they come along to me at the present time, I always see that their names go forward, and probably I do give some preference in that direction, but it is the only preference I do give.  The House may blame me for that or not. I will bring before the Government the views expressed by Deputy Fitzpatrick, but I would say to him that if anyone is to be blamed I think I am one who should not be blamed.</P>
