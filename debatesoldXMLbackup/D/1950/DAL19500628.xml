    <Title>Trade Union Bill, 1950&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Cosgrave)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Trade Union Act of 1941 made it unlawful for any body of persons, with certain specific exceptions, to carry on negotiations for the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment without a negotiation licence issued under the Act.  For the first time, trade unions engaging in such negotiations were required to make and maintain large deposits with the High Court.  This is a condition of the grant of a negotiation licence and the amount of the deposits depends on the numerical strength of the trade union concerned. The scale of deposits is laid down in the Schedule to the Act.  Where the number of members does not exceed 500 the amount prescribed is £1,000; the appropriate sum for a trade union having 1,000 members is £1,400 and the scale gradually ascends to a maximum of £10,000 for the largest organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was foreseen in 1941, that, on account of the prevailing abnormal conditions, some of the Irish trade unions would be unable to make the full deposit specified by the Schedule to the Act and it was, therefore, deemed necessary to make provision <Col N="150" /> for a variation of the requirements in favour of such cases.  Accordingly, Section 8 of the Act conferred the necessary power to grant temporary relief to trade unions registered in this State where it was established in any particular case that, on account of abnormal conditions referable to the war, undue hardship would ensue if the trade union were compelled to make and keep with the High Court the full deposit.  This relief extended to a maximum of 75 per cent. of the sum mentioned in the Schedule but the power to grant it was exercisable only while the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, was in force.</P>
    <P>Reduction Orders in pursuance of the provisions of this section had been made in several cases.  These Orders, however, would have expired on the 2nd September, 1947, and the trade unions concerned would then have been required, under the Act of 1941, to raise their deposits to the appropriate sum mentioned in the Schedule.  Moreover, since the repeal of the Emergency Powers Act, any trade union applying for a negotiation licence would have been required to make and maintain the full deposit whatever its circumstances might be.</P>
    <P>After discussions with the representatives of the trade unions organisations, it was decided that the circumstances which necessitated the relieving provisions in the Act of 1941 had not materially changed, and that the withdrawal of the concession, at any time, would impose hardship and in some cases might have the effect of disqualifying trade unions from holding negotiation licences already granted. Accordingly, the Trade Union Act, 1947, was introduced and enacted.  It repealed Section 8 of the Act of 1941 and re-enacted its main provisions for a period of 12 months as from 9th July, 1947.  The Trade Union Act, 1948, extended these provisions for a further period of 12 months as from the 9th July, 1948.</P>
    <P>As the circumstances which necessitated these relieving provisions still existed in 1949, the Trade Union Act, 1949, was enacted in order to continue these reliefs up to 8th July, 1950.  It is now considered desirable to continue <Col N="151" /> to meet the difficulties of the Irish trade unions, of which 25 have received reduction Orders, and I am satisfied that there is a case for the extension of this concession.  The Bill, accordingly, continues the relieving provisions for a further 12 months, that is, to the 8th July, 1951.  The question of a further extension after that date will be closely examined in the light of the circumstances and conditions then obtaining.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The power taken in the Trade Union Act to permit by ministerial Order a reduction in the deposit required by trade unions was related to the circumstances prevailing at the time the Act was passed, circumstances which caused disorganisation in various trades and reduced the revenues of some unions or caused unnecessary charges on their funds.  These circumstances have passed; they passed with the ending of the emergency. If there are, however, other circumstances affecting some of the smaller unions which appear to require that the power should be retained permanently or that the main provisions of the Trade Union Act should be modified, then I think the Government should consider making these changes by permanent legislation rather than by an annual Bill of this kind.</P>
      <P>I agree, however, that it is probably not desirable to introduce permanent legislation at this stage.  We are aware from announcements which have appeared in the Press that discussions may take place between the trade union congresses which may result in proposals for the reorganisation of the trade union movement, a reorganisation apart altogether from the current issue of British versus Irish unions.  If any proposals for reorganisation are likely to emerge from these discussions, then it is probably desirable to leave the existing law relating to trade unions unchanged until it can be reconsidered in the light of these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The device of requiring a union to make a deposit with the High Court for the purpose of getting a negotiating licence was, of course, designed to restrict if not prevent the unnecessary duplication of trade unions or the formation <Col N="152" /> of what are called splinter unions.  In so far as that is the main purpose of the device, the amount of the deposit is not of very great importance and, in fact, it would be possible to consider other methods of getting the same results apart from this device of a High Court deposit.</P>
    <P>I think it would be desirable if the Parliamentary Secretary were to intimate now, in view of these probable discussions, the willingness of the Government to consider the introduction here of any legislation which might be required to implement the agreed proposals for trade union reorganisation which most responsible trade union leaders recognise to be necessary and which from the viewpoint of the Government and the Dáil would be a considerable improvement in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is among some trade unionists a reluctance to contemplate legislative restrictions of any kind upon trade union development but I think that it is now generally recognised that if any scheme agreed among the leaders of trade unions is to be made fully operative, some legal backing may be necessary for it and it might help towards the successful outcome of these discussions if the Parliamentary Secretary intimated generally his willingness to submit here any legislative proposals which were required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The matters to which the Deputy refers were considered when this legislation was being drafted and, in fact, legislation for a longer period was originally contemplated, not exactly a permanent measure but one which would have extended the period for longer than a year.  The discussions to which the Deputy has referred then appeared likely and an announcement was made that these discussions would take place and it was considered in those circumstances more desirable to continue the existing legislation for a period of one year and to consider in the light of the possible outcome of these discussions any legislation which might be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I can give the House an assurance that if the trade unions make representations to the Government <Col N="153" /> those representations will be considered fully and that in the light of whatever arrangements may result from these discussions legislation would be drafted, but I think it is premature at this stage to indicate any type of legislation until the discussions have concluded.  In the circumstances, I think it is desirable that the reductions which have been granted should be continued for a further 12 months. It is, of course, quite likely, if discussions between the Trade Union Congress and the Congress of Irish Unions result in agreement that many of these trade union Orders will no longer be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I was dealing with various aspects of this Estimate and we arrived at the potatoes and oats question.  Now we come to milk.  It is rather dangerous for any one of us who is not supposed to know anything about it to appear in this discussion, but when one finds that the experts differ as to the costings of milk production I think that Deputies like ourselves might with advantage enter into the discussion. Personally, I never thought for one moment that anything approaching the <Col N="154" /> costings of any article produced by the farmer could be arrived at.  Such different sets of circumstances pertain all over the country that, notwithstanding what the experts say, it would be impossible to arrive at anything like a proper estimate of the costs incurred by the farmer in the production of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the sets of circumstances are so different all over the country that in my opinion and in my experience it would be impossible to estimate the costs so far as the production of milk is concerned.  The one thing I can go by is that nowithstanding all the mournful speeches that came from the far side of the House, about the prices paid for milk delivered to the creamery especially, the rather interesting fact still remains that more milk is being delivered to the creameries now than ever was before.  If that is not a sign that milk must be paying the farmers, I do not know what it is. Farmers are not fools and they do not work for nothing.  If they are in a position to deliver more milk to the creameries and thereby increase butter production, it is clear that they are not keeping their dairy herds at a loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry gave the figures compiled by a certain professor in Cork University.  Might I remark that most Deputies on the other side seem to spend much of their time in reading extracts from speeches or statements made by other people?  I should like them to give the results of their own personal experience and to look at the situation as it exists, and on that basis we should congratulate all concerned that more milk than ever before is being produced.  Deputy Corry referred to the cost of labour and so on, and it is peculiar that one of the first items always mentioned is the few shillings given to the agricultural labourer. Deputy Corry wants an increase in the price of every article in his economy before he can give the few shillings to the agricultural labourer.  He wants an increase in the price of wheat and in the price of barley, and considering all these circumstances the milk position is satisfactory.  Production has <Col N="155" /> gone up almost by 30 per cent. and butter production has increased <i>pro rata.</i></P>
    <P>I come now to another item in our agricultural economy, tomatoes.  Here again Deputies should use their own discretion.  This is more or less a new industry, which is doing very well, but the Minister, having the responsibility, must take certain steps in regard to the price paid for tomatoes.  It is very hard to please everybody.  The Minister, on the one hand, is criticised for allowing the cost of living to rise, and on the other, if he takes steps to keep it steady or to reduce it, he is also criticised. What is he to do?  Everybody knows that we do not produce sufficient tomatoes to meet the requirements of the people, and, that being so, it is necessary at times to import tomatoes.  The case against these imports is that they reduce the price of the home-grown tomato.  As I understand it, they have a preference of 2d. to 3d. a lb. and there will be general agreement that, for flavour, the people prefer the home-produced article and are prepared to pay a few pence more for it.  They are not prepared, however, to pay 1/- to 2/- per lb. more and that is where the crux arises.</P>
    <P>If, in order that these tomatoes may command that price, a prohibition against imports is imposed, it means that the working-class and the poor people, whose incomes are such that they cannot afford to pay the high price for Irish tomatoes, are deprived of the fruits which nature sends in abundance in other countries.  That is one of the things we must get into our heads&mdash;that we can produce many things but that there are many things we cannot produce at an economic price.  For instance, we could grow oranges in hothouses, but we cannot grow them on the sides of the ditches and in the open as in other countries. We can grow grapes in hothouses, but not as they grow them in France, Germany and other countries, whose climate is particularly suited to the growing of such fruits.  If our people are to enjoy these fruits, they must be allowed in here and sold at a price the people can pay.  We can sympathise with the people engaged in this industry, <Col N="156" /> but I am sure no Deputy will admit that there should be such a difference in the prices of Irish and foreign-grown tomatoes.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the situation which seems to have escaped the attention of Deputies.  If we go through the City of Dublin and look at all the big shops and at the corporation fruit markets, we will find that 90 per cent. of the articles in their windows is foreign produced.  If all these things were cut out, look at the unemployment that would be involved for the people employed in these places not only in the cities and towns but in every village in the country.  Deputies who spoke on this matter of tomatoes all point to the employment which is given, but what would happen if the people engaged in the fruit trade were not sure of supplies of fruit of every description the whole year round?  We saw the situation during the six years of the war when the shops were half empty.  That is a point which seems to have escaped the attention of many Deputies.</P>
    <P>There are possibly two opinions about the mechanisation of farming, but farmers are not compelled to use machinery, if they do not wish to do so.  They can keep their horses, and on small farms I suppose it will be necessary to keep horses for ploughing the land, but if there are farmers, as there are many, who wish to adopt mechanical methods instead of the old methods, they are quite entitled to do so.  We must bear in mind that times are moving.  Many years ago, we had the old billhook and scythe.  Then came the reaper and so on&mdash;all these periods brought different changes.  We cannot go back to these days and it is up to the farmers themselves to decide what class of machinery they will use in the working of their farms.</P>
    <P>We are not living in normal times. The situation as regards agriculture and industry is changing every day. You cannot deal with agriculture by means of figures on a blackboard. There will be ups and downs, no matter what precautions are taken by a Minister for Agriculture or by any Government. It is impossible to guarantee a price to the farmer for everything he produces.  We might as well admit that and not try to deceive ourselves <Col N="157" /> and people down the country.  Certain risks must be taken in everything.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the farmer knows his business best and he is being given a free hand.  He can grow as much wheat as he likes, according to the nature of his land, and he can grow as much oats as he likes.  He can grow as much barley and raise what he likes because he is his own boss.  When all is said and done the farmer is the best judge of these things.  The Minister has said that over and over again not only in the House, but in speeches throughout the country.  Instead of being opposed to a tillage policy he has urged the farmers to go in for more tillage, more cattle, sheep and poultry.  That is the aim of the Department of Agriculture in these matters and that should also be our aim.  Although there may be some things that could be, and ought to be, criticised we should take the long view of income from agriculture and we will find that income in the past two or three years has been greater than in any of the years previous to the coming into office of the present Government.  Therefore, I think that, in view of the fact that there is so much at stake and that so much money is to be expended in the improvement of agriculture, if that money is to be expended wisely and well it will require the co-operation of all the farmers in the country as well as the Deputies on the opposite benches.  Instead, therefore, of criticising the whole system the Deputies on the Opposition Benches, and partiticularly Deputy Smith, should go out into the country and encourage the farmers to engage in, and participate in, the schemes which are going on and which will have beneficial results for the farmers of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the debate on this Estimate, to the criticisms of it, and to the stream of praise from the Government Benches by Deputies behind the Minister I think it would have to be agreed that that whole stream of praise boils down to the one question of the price which the Minister has got for cattle.  We in the West of Ireland are not concerned so very much with ranching and the <Col N="158" /> supply of beef to England.  We are more interested in mixed farming, which is the basis of the farmers' economy in the West of Ireland.  The price of beef may very well be a big matter for the ranchers of Meath and Westmeath, but the small farmers of the West of Ireland are very much more concerned with the prices they get for milk, butter, eggs, potatoes, oats, barley and to a small extent wheat.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>The average number of calves in the West of Ireland would not be more than three and that does not affect the economy of the farmers there.  All the Deputies sitting behind the Minister wound up their speeches with great praise for the Minister and the price which he got for cattle.  Even Deputy Dunne when advocating increased wages for agricultural workers could only point to the great price for cattle in support of his arguments.  In the long run we have to ask ourselves whether it is sound policy to turn this country into a large ranch for the supply of beef to England?  Is it a sound policy to do away with the small farmers and to turn the whole country into ranches, because that is the policy which is being pursued at the present time.  I maintain that that is not the wisest policy for this country.  It is all very well for Deputy Coburn to shout about the amount of money that is going into the farmer's pocket for cattle and about the amount of money being spent on land development and the making of large ranches.  It was not for that that men went out to fight, but to place the land of the country in a position where it was most suited for those who lived on it and to put as big a number of people as possible on to the land.  They fought to do away with the system of ranching that obtained in this country for generations and which had been the curse of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the price being paid for milk I would ask the Minister what justification there is for asking the farmer to take a lesser price for milk than he was getting for the last few years. What other commodity has gone down in price?  Can the Minister or any <Col N="159" /> Deputy in this House name one commodity, for which the farmer has to pay, which has gone down in price? Why then should the farmer be the first person to be asked to take a reduced price for milk?  If the Minister can give any justification for that situation I would be glad to hear it, but I maintain that there is no justification whatever for it at least until such time as everything else goes down in price as well.  The farmer should not be the first to be asked to accept reductions in prices.</P>
    <P>It has been admitted by the Minister himself that the economic price of butter at the present time is 3/6 a lb. and the insinuation has been made that the farmer is getting a subsidy on butter.  The farmer is getting no subsidy whatever.  If it costs 3/6 to produce a lb. of butter then it is obvious that the consumer is getting a subsidy and not the farmer but yet the farmer is being asked to produce butter at less than the economic price.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to eggs.  For a number of years the farmers were getting 2/6 a dozen and the Minister is now asking them to produce eggs for 2/- a dozen for five or seven months of the year and 3/6 a dozen for the five remaining months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has found the month that Deputy Ormonde lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneGilbride" hpid="Mr. Gilbride Mr. Gilbride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilbride</NameTxt>
      <P>We will give you a present of that one, and perhaps you may make it up for the difference in the loss of price.  I wonder what the Labour Party thinks of this situation. We are asked to supply eggs during the plentiful months at 2/- a dozen and when there are no eggs in the country we will be paid 3/6 a dozen for them. What results will that have for the labouring men of the country?  What chance will they have during the last five months to buy eggs when there will be no eggs available in the country?  I think the much wiser course would be to have the same price obtaining in the country the whole year round and thus enable the poor men to get the eggs just as well as the people in England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coburn mentioned machinery versus horses.  If I were a young man <Col N="160" /> I suppose there would be no one more anxious than I would be to get a tractor and to do away with horses for ploughing my land but I wonder is it a wise course.  I wonder is this country suited for that type of work.  In my opinion, the horse is the most suited to the country.  As everyone here knows, our land is damp and our climate is damp.  My experience is that heavy tractors simply steam-roll the land into weeds.  In case of emergency, where would the tractors come from, where would the rubber and the oil for those tractors come from?  It is a most unwise course to do away with the horse.  We would be far better off by depending on our own horses and machinery rather than by doing away with the horse and turning the country into ranches again.</P>
    <P>Under the land rehabilitation scheme, £150,000 has been spent on the purchase of huge machinery from the United States of America.  Would the Minister not think that it would be far wiser to spend that £150,000 in giving employment on the land to men who are forced to emigrate from the West of Ireland and to leave these big machines where they are?  Would it not be wiser policy to let the men work on these drainage schemes and the land rehabilitation scheme than to spend that £150,000 on it?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the question of importing huge machines, we pay away this £150,000 for huge machinery while at the same time we export the best youth of our country.  I know men who spent the best years of their lives in England and America to earn far less than the amount we spent on huge tractors and who are glad to come home and buy the little despised farms that we hear so much about and spend the remainer of their lives in Ireland on those farms.  Would it not be much wiser to give these men a chance of earning that money here?  Is it a wise policy to spend money in America and England on huge machinery and to export young men to go into the mines and factories in New York and other places to produce them?  I say it is not.  This business of going in for big <Col N="162" /> machinery is all a cod and is not suited to the country.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to flour.  A very interesting White Paper was issued by the Minister.  Deputy Coburn accuses us of not reading it.  I read a little of it.  I see in one column where we are compelled, as a result of our acceptance of Marshall Aid Funds, to buy white flour from America.  Does the Minister deny that?</P>

      <P>The Minister promised maize at 20/- a cwt.  It is now in every shop in the country at 32/-. According to page four of the White Paper the millers are protected.  I will read it for the Minister for fear he might forget what he had printed:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="163" />&ldquo;...Increases in the wholesale and retail prices of maize and maize products were prohibited until after the latter date.  Special arrangements were made whereby rebates would be granted to millers who had to use maize costing £26 per ton to meet customers' normal requirements during the period 30th March to 27th April, 1950.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder are these the same millers, the friends of Fianna Fáil, who lined their pockets for the last number of years, in respect of whom the Minister was so anxious to ensure that they would not suffer anything by selling maize at less than £26 per ton.  It is wonderful how people change.  I would not be surprised at any change.  I even heard the Minister, in his opening statement, thanking God that the British market was gone.</P>

      <P>I would not be surprised to hear him singing the <i>Soldier's Song.</i>  We were promised cheaper manures.  That never materialised. Deputy Coburn said that the Irish farmer was prepared to produce the food if he got a lead.  I agree with that.  The Irish farmer will always come up to the mark if he gets a lead but, in my opinion, the man who gives the Irish farmer a lead in agriculture must be sincere in that.  I do not believe that the Minister could be sincere because, at all times, the Minister made no secret of the fact that he did not believe in producing wheat or beet or <Col N="164" /> any of these things in this country. He said on one occasion that he thought the best thing for this country would be to maintain about 1,000,000 of a population and that it was the ideal thing to rear 20 of a family and to export 19.  A man who believes that could not be expected to be sincere in asking the people of this country to produce food in order to keep the people at home.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister because I think he believes that sincerely but the people who knew that and who placed him in charge of the agricultural policy are, in my opinion, the people who are responsible.  It is no good for Deputies to criticise the present agricultural policy or to say that something was not done that will have to be done.  There is no use in getting up and saying it.  As Deputy Coburn said, if the people get a lead, they will do it.  The lead the people got was that the growing of wheat and the growing of beet was all cod.  On the 12th June, a Parliamentary Secretary of this Government spoke down the country and advised the people to grow wheat.  On the 12th June!  If that is the time to give people a lead in so far as the growing of wheat is concerned, I must say that it is something I have never heard of before.  It is rather a strange time of the year to give that lead.  We may be a bit backward in the West but we generally sow our wheat before 12th June.  If the people get a lead they will do these things but the man who will give that lead must be sincere himself in regard to what he is about.  The Minister is not sincere when he asks the people of this country to produce these things, because he does not believe in them.  I believe that this Estimate should be referred back because we have received no statement as to our future policy. We do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to give a fair price for milk and we do not know whether it is the intention of the Government to do away with the two prices for butter, tea and flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard the Minister say in this House yesterday, in answer to some Deputy, that more wheat was sown in <Col N="165" /> the country this year than ever before. I hope that is so but I must say the Minister's statement struck me as being very peculiar because the tillage return has not been taken at all yet around my part of the country.  I do not know in what other way the Minister gets his information except from tillage returns.  I am sorry that I cannot agree with him in regard to his statement that more wheat has been sown this year in this country than ever before because, from what I have seen in my travels in the West of Ireland and in the Midlands, not nearly the same amount has been sown this year as was sown in other years.  As I say, I hope I am wrong.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity of hearing very much of this debate for one reason or another over the past few days, but such time as I have spent in the House this morning and what I have been able to read of the statements made by the members of the Opposition gives me to think that it is time they got some sort of agreement amongst themselves in regard to agricultural policy in this country.  I think it is a very bad thing that criticism on an Estimate like this should be based upon what appears, to me at any rate, to be personal dislike of the Minister. I think it is a very bad principle.  The present Minister for Agriculture, while his personality may not appeal to everybody, has done one thing with agriculture, in my view, and that is, he has brought into it a degree of vigour and imagination and virility which we had not noticed before being employed by any previous Minister, and that in itself is a good thing. It is a stirring of life, and every stirring of life that we see must necessarily be good, even though all its results may not eventuate in the end which is desired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to address myself to one or two aspects of the agricultural policy of the Minister which affect myself and my constituency particularly.  The first one, to which I have adverted here on many an occasion, is the question of agricultural wages.  In this House we have heard, and we hear daily, of the hardships and the woes of the farmers.  I suppose that is only <Col N="169" /> natural, because of the preponderance of representation there is in the House of the farming community.  I do not think there is enough care or thought or consideration given to the lot of the agricultural worker.  I think that lack of care is attributable to the fact that, as a political factor, from the numerical point of view, agricultural workers are in the minority as compared with the farmer owners of land. The fact that they are in a minority numerically should not prompt the Minister or Deputies to give them less consideration than they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The Minister, on taking over office, indicated that he was proposing to bring the wages of agricultural workers to £3 a week, and that was done.  I do not think the Minister, or any person who has any knowledge of the difficulties of life in rural Ireland or the cost of living difficulties of the farm labourer, will contend that £3 a week in this day and age is sufficient to enable a man to live in decency and comfort.  In 1939, before the war, and before the cost of living sky-rocketed under the Fianna Fáil Administration, £3 a week might have been a wage on which a man could possibly get by, but it is far and away from being an adequate wage nowadays for any man to live on, much less a man carrying the responsibility of a family.</P>
    <P>There has not been any increase for agricultural workers during the present year.  When you contrast that with what was announced by the Minister when he was introducing his Estimate, of the improvement in the position so far as the farmers are concerned, the improvement in certain agricultural prices and the increase in the agricultural income of the farmers, it is very difficult to reconcile it with the continuing low wage of the agricultural worker.  The Minister should take some initiative in this matter and he should bring to the notice of the Agricultural Wages Board the desirability of having something done immediately in connection with agricultural wages.  In my constituency the minimum agricultural wage laid down by the Agricultural Wages Board is £3 10s. a week&mdash;that is, in the County Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="170" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I am happy to relate that there are many farmers in my constituency who pay more.  Unfortunately, I do not think that enlightened view extends very far outside the borders of County Dublin among the farmers, but it does extend to some limited extent in this county.  Some farmers will admit, in my constituency at any rate, that they are able to and do pay more.  I do not think anybody will argue that a farmer living and working in North County Dublin, which is the most productive agricultural area in the country, the richest area from the point of view of the production of vegetables, an area which is right beside the greatest market in the land, the City of Dublin, cannot pay at least £4 a week to the men he employs.  It can be done, and it is being done in some cases, but it is not accepted as a general rule.  I think the Minister should give a lead, not alone so far as County Dublin is concerned, but so far as the whole country is concerned.  The day when £3 a week would be regarded as an adequate wage for the agricultural worker has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appreciates, as I do, that while it is described as a minimum, nevertheless it acts as the maximum in most parts of the country.  Farmers will be found to pay more, but they are the exception and are far from being the rule. I believe that if the Agricultural Wages Board had increased the minimum this year, farmers would have paid it or would be prepared to pay it now without any great protest.  I think the present machinery for dealing with this question is outworn.  Indeed, it does not operate as efficiently as it might.</P>

    <P>I have been informed that the representative of the Government&mdash;I think it was the Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;when abroad recently at a conference discussing questions relating to wages, stated that the machinery which exists in this country for the regulation of relations as between farmer and worker is something which might be copied by other <Col N="171" /> countries.  Anybody who would make a statement of that kind cannot have much knowledge of the manner in which this machinery operates.  The Agricultural Wages Board is composed at the top of four representatives of the employers and four representatives of the workers, with a number of people who are euphemistically described as neutral.  It is rather a coincidence that the neutral people, when it comes to a question of voting, invariably cast their votes against the interests of the agricultural worker. The fact I want to bring to the Minister's notice is that something should be done by him now, when there is the prosperity which he announced when introducing his Estimate, to ensure that a portion at any rate of that prosperity will be passed on to the agricultural labourer.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is just sufficient that Deputies should come to this House and advocate high prices for all kinds of agricultural produce and, at the same time, try to evade the question of the labourer and the worthiness to his hire.  Deputy Corry is quite an old hand at that.  He is an adept at trying to play off the desirability, or the need, for a fair wage for the agricultural worker with higher prices for all kinds of agricultural produce.  I do not think that is fair at all.  I think it is taking advantage of, and is exploiting, the agricultural workers of the country to come here and talk about the need there is for higher wages, and to say that these higher wages can only be paid if prices are increased.  I think that, even with things as they are, wages could be very considerably increased for agricultural workers. They will not be increased unless some kind of a lead is given by the Minister.  I suggest to him that he should give that lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> I mentioned that it was difficult for anybody listening to the speeches of the Opposition Deputies to find out what is their exact line so far as agricultural policy is concerned.  Certainly, the long effort of Deputy Smith last week was in no way helpful or illuminating as far as that is concerned. On the one hand, we have Fianna Fáil Deputies stating that the future of this country may be safely left to the Irish farmer, and that, no matter what happens, he will always do the right thing.  If that is the case, why should there be compulsory tillage or why should not everything be left to the absolute free will of the tenant farmers?  We had Deputy O'Grady complimenting the Minister on the land project.  To-day, Deputy Gilbride said that project was wholly unsuitable for the West of Ireland.  In view of these conflicting statements from Opposition Deputies, it is about time, I think, that there was some kind of an agreed line on Fianna Fáil policy, so that we shall know exactly what they are talking about.  There is no doubt so far as the Minister's policy is concerned.  He does not leave anyone in the dark, whether they agree with him or not.</P>
    <P>The question of tomatoes has been raised on this Estimate.  It is one that affects my constituency and one which I desire to refer to.  I think this question of tomatoes has not been properly tackled or handled.  The Minister, on various occasions, has referred to the fact that the tomato growers during the years of the emergency extracted very high prices for their produce from the people.  We have had in very recent years a situation wherein tomato growers, far from getting high prices, were getting very low prices, prices which, from their point of view, were uneconomic.  That kind of situation is undesirable at both ends, prices being too high, on the one hand, and then at other periods being too low, due to lack of adequate control of the market in so far as tomatoes are concerned.</P>
    <P>I do not at all subscribe to the view that the price of tomatoes, which in this country are becoming part of the diet of the ordinary working people, should be left to the vagaries of supply <Col N="173" /> and demand.  I do not think it should be left to the fluctuations of the city market.  There should be some regulation whereby, on the one hand, the producer of the tomatoes will be guaranteed a fair price, not an exorbitant price, and not a price that is going to rob the people, but a fair price, one which will leave him a reasonable profit, and to ensure on the other hand that these tomatoes will be sold to consumers at a price that they will be able to pay.  In a situation such as that this native industry could be protected, and the commodity which the producers had to sell would not become a luxury or a rare and scarce one.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I think, should consider the fixation of a price in the matter of tomatoes, at all price levels. If we are to continue as we are doing, to import Dutch tomatoes at periods when there is supposed to be a shortage of Irish tomatoes on the market, the market will become glutted with outside tomatoes.  Prices will be jumping one day and falling the next day, and so unstable conditions will always exist.  I think that is a bad situation. It certainly does not lead to any encouragement for a native industry of this kind.  There are more tomatoes produced in my constituency than in any constituency in Ireland.  North County Dublin is, I think, the main source of supply for the Dublin market. A considerable volume of employment is given, not of hired labour but to the members of families who work themselves on the production of this commodity. I would ask the Minister to consider that particular aspect of the question so as to ensure that we will not have a recurrence of a situation wherein either the producer on the one hand, or the consumer on the other, will be wrongly done by.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister, when he is replying, will tell us what has happened to the Agricultural Workers (Holidays) Bill.  Is it still in existence? It is a long time since we have heard of it.  I had thought and had hoped that this Bill would be law by the present time.  It has been looked forward to by agricultural workers up and down the country, but so far it has not materialised.  The introduction <Col N="174" /> of that Bill was, in my opinion, one of the most progressive steps taken by the Minister, and it is most unfortunate that we have not had the opportunity of passing it into law.  I am sure that all Deputies, regardless of Party, would be very glad to ensure that it got a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>References have been made during the course of this debate to the mechanisation of agriculture.  Mechanisation, in the minds of some Deputies, would seem to have become associated with ranching.  That, to my mind, is a totally erroneous view of it.  In my constituency, particularly in the area around Rush, where there is more intensive cultivation perhaps than there is in any part of Europe, there is a great degree of mechanisation of the average farm despite the fact that the average farm there is very much smaller than the average farm in the West of Ireland.  In area it would not be more than two to three acres. Despite the fact that it is so minute, the farmers, being progressive and hard-working men, have developed mechanisation to a considerable extent. One will find very few of them without a tractor and they are anxious to go even further in mechanising their work.  I think it is a wrong conception of the problem to suggest, as Deputy Gilbride suggested this morning, that mechanisation must lead to large-scale ranching.  We have had two extreme views on this matter, and there must be a happy medium somewhere.</P>
    <P>A little over 100 years ago we had 8,000,000 people living on the land and, as we know, a great number of them were wiped out by a famine.  Many people would seem to think that was a desirable situation but most of that 8,000,000 must have been living on very small plots.  The standard of living must have been very low when one considers the kind of diet they had.  I do not think we shall ever revert to that situation.  I do not think it is desirable that we should.  Some people seem to think that the number who can live on the land is unlimited.  That is quite wrong.  No matter how good agricultural policy may be or how effective it <Col N="175" /> is we cannot have complete prosperity for the rural community without rural industries as well.  Mechanisation must bring good results.  It must reduce farmers' costs.  With efficient development it must in the long run win more from the land because it must bring the land which is not now in production into production.</P>

      <P>While criticism of mechanisation may be sincere it is certainly not well informed.  I want to deal now with a matter with which the Minister is very familiar because I have discussed it with him on many occasions.  I refer to the treatment of the workers at Johnstown Castle.  It is not a good thing to have so much dissatisfaction on a State farm which should be a model farm from the point of view of employment and working conditions.  Some kind of remedy must be found for the present situation and I appeal to the Minister again to reexamine the matter in an effort to see if some kind of accommodation cannot be found for the workers.</P>
      <P>Finally, I sympathise with the Minister for all that he has endured over the past week and I trust that his gethsemane will come to a conclusion to-day.  When replying I think he should indicate to the House whether or not he will give a lead to the country generally on this question of agricultural wages as he did a couple of years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a good part of this debate.  My first impression is that the Minister will never secure the support of all the farmers for those aspects of his policy of which everyone can approve until he and his colleagues stop trying to pretend that the whole of the Fianna Fáil policy was disastrous, and stop trying to use figures for production in 1946 and 1947 as a basis for comparative propaganda, knowing full well that those two years were disastrous from the point of view of weather following upon a long period of war, during which there had been a shortage of <Col N="176" /> fertilisers, machinery and other farming essentials.  The Minister is fond of using the word &ldquo;fraudulent.&rdquo;  He will not blame me if I now hit back and say that the use of the 1946 and 1947 figures for production as a basis for comparative propaganda is completely and utterly fraudulent.  It merely causes resentment amongst farmers, all of whom are looking for a lead, and most of whom would like to see an agricultural policy carried out here on a non-political basis.  We shall never achieve a net increase in production of 25 per cent., 30 per cent. or 50 per cent. so long as the main aspects of our policy are the subject of bitter and acrimonious dispute.  There should no longer be any need for that.  There should be a keen and controversial debate on the administration of the Department, on the details of policy, on the way things are being done, on whether one aspect of production is being considered to too great a degree at the expense of another aspect.  The fact is that we still have Deputies getting up here and talking as if the whole Fianna Fáil policy during the past 16 years was related to normal economic conditions.</P>
      <P>We had Deputy Rooney yesterday offering a slavish loyalty and admiration to the Minister, a thing I certainly never gave to any Fianna Fáil Minister in my ten years.  We had him going back to the time of the economic war, and using figures for the purpose of his argument, not one set of figures but two sets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>He, first of all, referred to 1946 and 1947, two disastrous years, and then he went back to the economic war and spoke of our first six years in office.  He failed to mention the fact that the exports of all agricultural produce showed a decline in value from the beginning of the world depression and that that was a factor we had to face on coming into office.  He did not mention the fact that the dairy industry in 1931 was virtually in a state of collapse.  He did not mention the fact that Fianna Fáil policy for 15 years was not alone <Col N="177" /> not related to normal conditions but to two completely abnormal states of affairs.  We deliberately entered into the economic dispute with Great Britain knowing the responsibility attaching thereto, knowing the inevitable results if the British Government should impose upon us penalties in regard to the importation of our produce. We asked the people to support us during that period.  As soon as the economic war was over we had one year's breathing space and after that we immediately entered upon a world war.  Our policy, therefore, had to be aligned to war conditions.  Fifty years hence historians will say that the miracle was we were able to maintain the volume of production roughly at the same level at which it was when we came into office and that we did not show rather a tremendous reduction having regard to these two conditions of affairs, the economic war and the world war.  As I have said, the whole of this debate has been conducted in a sort of lurid atmosphere of pretence; if conditions had been normal during our period of office we would nevertheless have involved the country in the same sort of difficulties in which it was involved because, as I have said, agricultural policy at that time was directed partly by political considerations.</P>
      <P>It is well to remember that Fianna Fáil policy was partly permanent in character and partly designed to overcome special difficulties.  The permanent character of the policy was related to the preservation of the home market for farmers and the exclusion of foreign produce in so far as it could be done.  It related to the provision of alternative employment for the agricultural community if they were unable to obtain employment on farms.  It was related to the inauguration of new agricultural schemes, such as the land improvement scheme, the farm buildings scheme, and the offering of increased grants for practically every type of scheme carried out by agricultural committees.  Then, of course, there were special considerations, such as the high rate of compulsory tillage during the war, special measures to ensure the maximum growing of home feeding stuffs, and so forth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Rooney suggested in his <Col N="178" /> speech that the recovery from the economic war came only at the end of the economic war.  In fact, all the figures show that the recovery began about the end of 1935 and proceeded continuously from that time onwards. It is interesting to note the fact that we conducted this struggle and, as a result, we were able to ensure a stable Constitution, decided by the people of this country.  Deputy Rooney, who is to be found amongst the new republicans, seems to be unable to grant us any credit for preparing the ground-work in regard to that matter.  The actual fact was that we were lucky to preserve our total volume of production. We were lucky to leave the land in such a condition that when we had two successive years of good weather and more fertilisers there was an immediate rebound in the yield of crops.</P>
    <P>The Minister, I believe, is a religious man and I do think that he should stop allowing the members of his Party to give him the entire credit for the crop yields of the two last years, when he should know that it lay very considerably in the hands of Divine Providence Who gave us marvellous weather, and it was also due to the fact that we were able to put in considerable quantities of fertilisers to renourish the land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Government Party seem to give the Minister credit for all the schemes left him by the Fianna Fáil Government, such as the farm building grants scheme, the egg and poultry scheme, the farm improvements scheme as it then was, increased grants to committees of agriculture for practically every aspect of agriculture, the beginning of the soil <Col N="179" /> survey, the beginnings of the arterial drainage scheme, the guaranteed price for wheat.  I hope members will recall that these schemes were largely Fianna Fáil in origin.  I understand that a considerable part of the veterinary scheme was in the course of preparation when the Government left office. It was put into operation by the present Minister, but it was being planned at that time.</P>
      <P>I have never given exclusive credit to any Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture for anything good that came out of the Fianna Fáil policy.  I never gave exclusive credit to any Minister for Agriculture because farmers during the war, in spite of their difficulties, were better off, on account of the increased prices.  I never gave exclusive credit to Deputy Seán Lemass, then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who made it possible for industries to start here, or exclusive credit for building up every industry. We shall never get any unity on agricultural policy so long as that kind of fulsome admiration and praise takes place.  The position at the moment is that conditions were never more suitable for a Minister for Agriculture to do well for this country and assist the farmers to do their own job.  It is the first time in the whole history of the country that we have no abnormal political conditions in the Twenty-Six Counties.  It has never happened before.  First of all, we had the first world war, we then had the struggle for independence, then the civil war; we were then plunged into the world depression, then we had the economic war, then the second world war.</P>

      <P>There has never been a year since 1912 in which there were no unstable political conditions on the one hand and on the other hand in which, for once in history, the British Government were not able to write cheques in any currency they wished. They were in the position that they would no longer have to prohibit by tariff the import of Chinese glass that had to be decontaminated and purified by antiseptics when it arrived.  They could no longer write cheques in any <Col N="180" /> currency for all the foodstuffs they wished to purchase, produced at the lowest cost in some country under inferior labour conditions.  They could buy only a limited quantity in the dollar market, and were down to a ration of meat of 1/3 a week and bound to pay high prices for our produce.  It is up to the Minister for Agriculture to get the best long-term price he can.  To give credit to the Minister for Agriculture for the enormous increase in the value of cattle exports is ridiculous under the circumstances.  If any credit is to be given to him, it is if he is able to make a good bargain, having regard to conditions there are already present.</P>
      <P>As I have said, fertilisers are now freely available.  American money can be borrowed with reasonable freedom so that, while we find the British constrained to buy beef and mutton at high prices in this country, we for a limited period are able to borrow American money for land reclamation and other purposes.  If the members of the Government Party were honest, they would go back to 1938-39 for their basic figure, the one year in which we had a breathing space, in which we completed a certain constitutional struggle upon which the Constitution of this country is now based, in which for a brief 12 months the adverse effects of the economic war were over. If those figures are taken, the fact is revealed immediately that we are only just back to the volume of agricultural production of that year, that the number of pigs has not yet reached the 1938-39 level, and so forth and so on. In actual fact, I would not blame the Minister if he took 1912 for his basic figure, for although we were under British occupation there had been a good many years of comparatively normal internal economic conditions then.  I would not consider the Minister unreasonable if he went back to 1912 for his basic figure, as there was no normal period since that date until this year, and start going back to give a long list of statistics to go to prove that he is the perfect Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I would like agriculture to be taken out of the political arena, with the exception of details in administration.  It should be possible to do that, but it will never be possible so long as the Minister&mdash;having talked against wheat, peat and beet during the last two years of the last Government; in fact, during the whole period&mdash;tries to align his policy now in a manner to show how tremendously different it is from Fianna Fáil, whilst at the same time being compelled by circumstances to adopt a great deal of the policy we advocated. That is the position.  The farmers know it and the farmers who supported the Government for 16 years who, in most cases preserved the same number of seats for the Government as in the general election before the last, will not follow any definite line of policy unless they can be assured that these prejudices are forgotten, that the Minister starts off on a new line and stops trying to show how different his policy is from Fianna Fáil and trying to pretend that all that happened during our régime was due, not to abnormal circumstances but to what he has always considered in his speeches to be a normal policy with normal results.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the present agricultural position, we have the fact that over 50,000 persons have left the land in the last 18 months or so, equivalent to the number that left the land during the whole of the period of office of Fianna Fáil.  That means that there is a larger income from a smaller number of people, but it is not what you might call developing agriculture intensively. It is not a good symptom, so far as the future of the country is concerned. Unless we have a more agreed agricultural policy, it is likely that that flight from the land will continue.</P>

It is good for the country that it should expand, so long as it is not at the expense of other forms of production and so long as it does not militate against our national security. I do think it right, however, to remind members of the Government that statements were made not long ago that they would try to hit the British in their pride, their pocket and their prestige, as a consequence of the recent Act carried through the British Parliament in relation to Northern Ireland. I think it well to remind the country also that the Minister for External Affairs, in reporting to the E.C.A. Commission on Europe, said that in fact we were running into debt to the United States, that our dollar debt was increasing, that we were saving the British Government millions of dollars by the export of greater numbers of cattle whereas, in fact, he reported, we should be growing more wheat.

I should add, in that connection, that I quite appreciate that, having regard to the <Col N="183" /> European character of the reconstruction efforts that are now being made, with the help of American loans and grants, if we had been in office, in consultation with all the other member States, we might have had to agree to a form of agricultural production for a period which might have the practical effect of involving us in great dollar commitments and in saving the British Government dollars but, if we had, we would do it with our eyes open and we would not say at the same time that we intended to hit the British in their pride, their pocket and their prestige.</P>
      <P>I do not need even to refer to the statements of the Minister for External Affairs.  I can ask the Minister whether in any of his policy, he is carrying out the suggestion made at the time of the general discussion on the Partition question that we would hit the British in their pride, their pocket and their prestige.  He might indicate whether he is taking part in that campaign and in that policy which must be approved by the extreme Republicans, so-called, in the Government Parties.</P>

Of course it is a good thing the slaughter of calves stopped but members of the Government tend to talk about the number of calves slaughtered as if it ran into millions.  The actual fact is that in the last three years of office of the previous Government, even when times were totally abnormal, the number of calves slaughtered every year was 56,000 and there were round about 850,000 cattle, all under one year, in the country at the same time, showing that the slaughter of calves, although numerically of some importance, could hardly be regarded as a national disaster.</P>

      <P>Consumers will be glad to hear it, because, having been promised a reduction in the cost of living, and having seen the cost of living rise in regard to a number of commodities in the last few weeks&mdash;an increase of 2 per cent. in the official figure and a real increase of much more&mdash;any little effort on the part of the Minister to bring down the cost of living will be greatly appreciated by those who expected that the promises in regard to reduction in the cost of living would be honoured.  In fact, no promise is being honoured whatever.  In regard to the question of the pig industry, I hope the Minister will be able to find a proper solution to the problem of exporting bacon to Great Britain without having to charge the taxpayers with a subsidy. It should be possible for him to do so.  At the end of the economic war there was a total of 930,000 pigs of all kinds in the country.  After six years of the economic war and economic war strain, in 1949 there were 647,000 pigs in the country.  If, after six years of economic war we could have nearly 1,000,000 pigs in the country, I hope the Minister will be able to find a solution whereby we can export our bacon profitably.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that, because there was an economic dispute arising out of constitutional matters, and the Minister was at the time entirely opposed to the views of the Government of the day.  Getting down to the question of cereals, I notice that the total production in tons of wheat, oats and barley was 1,054,000 in 1947 and 1,079,000 in 1949.  A higher yield came from a lower acreage.  I notice that the tilled area in the country under those two crops declined in the same period from 1,550,000 acres to 1,200,000-odd acres. There is no need for me to repeat again all that has been said about the mishandling in the marketing of those crops and the misunderstandings, as far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned.  He cannot evade the issue by accusing Fianna Fáil of using propaganda to reduce the price of cereals on the market.</P>
      <P>The fact remains that the Minister started out with a gross prejudice against the growing of wheat, and that he revealed it in every speech he made during his first year of office.  Gradually he had to amend his view, but at the same time he never gave the country a clear lead with regard to the growing of wheat, but the farmers have discovered that wheat is the only cash crop on which they can rely, and if there is an increase in the wheat yield it is because they now know that Fianna Fáil were right after all with regard to the value of wheat as a cash crop.  We have been told that the yield from 30,000 acres would give us bread for some 18 or 20 days, and to that extent it is a valuable contribution rather than borrowing money from the American Government.  But if the Minister forgets all that he has said about wheat in past days he might find it possible to have a more stable tillage policy.  Prices have rocketed up and down too violently, and we need stability with regard to those two crops, a stable policy and an understanding with the Government.</P>

      <P>The total tillage area was 16 per cent. in 1949.  The Minister had a report from Mr. Holmes, the New Zealand grass expert, who took the view that many of us hold that it is good to have tillage because it produces better grass and better grass produces better tillage.</P>

      <P>In his report he said that there were 7,500,000 acres of grass lands that needed cultivation in this country.  If we continue with a total tillage acreage, including all root, green and cereal crops, of 16 per cent., we shall never come near more than a quarter of the area in the suggestion he made when he said that almost 7,500,000 acres of grass land needed ploughing up, and we shall never increase our tillage acreage until the farmers know where they are with regard to tillage matters.</P>
      <P>My own belief is that the Minister will have to go even further than we went with regard to tillage.  Now that conditions are favourable in the world markets, it is not beyond him to devise a method whereby a considerable amount of every crop can be guaranteed and with present supplies of feeding stuffs to estimate in advance what the farmer can grow.  Most elaborate estimates of that kind are made in Great Britain, and God forbid that we should ever have the rationing of feeding stuffs which is the British farmers' unhappy lot.  It would be possible to increase the maximum of wheat, oats and potatoes and to foretell to the farmers reasonably how much they can safely grow and necessarily stock a small surplus.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is uncertainty for the future with regard to egg production. If the Minister wants to maintain and increase that valuable form of production he should give more information to the House as to what future prospects really are and with regard to what form of feeding stuffs is likely to be available in the future. He should tell us if he is always going to wait to buy maize until the market <Col N="188" /> seems to him most propitious with the result that certain farmers find themselves without feeding stuffs.  The Minister's policy of growing all the feeding stuffs for poultry on the farm is an excellent one but it is a difficult one, as many farmers have long accepted that they must buy feeding stuffs.  As Deputies from the West have already said, the poultry business in the West is not a business for which farmers in our time even before the world war had sufficient feeding stuffs on the farm.  They normally bought feeding stuffs of one kind or another. There should be some stability and certainty.  The Minister knows the view which farmers of every political viewpoint retain about feeding stuffs. He knows the problem by heart already.</P>
      <P>The question of the provision of imported feeding stuffs affects the whole of the market.  We were informed by the Minister for Finance that we had a total of 29,000,000 dollar exports of one kind or another, and that wheat, maize, petrol and tobacco would account for 47,000,000 dollars.  That is a huge deficit, and it is entirely wrong that we should go on borrowing money from the American Government to pay for our daily bread.  We should like to hear from the Minister more about sterling wheat.  We would like him to tell us what proportion of our total imports of wheat and maize he anticipates will come normally from sterling sources.  Has he any idea for the future with regard to that?  For how long will we be compelled to borrow money from America for essential materials of life and essential feeding stuffs, and how long will it be before we reach the position where we shall only have to borrow for capital goods, machinery and such like commodities?</P>

      <P>I should like to have the Minister's admission that, if he really believes that it is possible to increase the output of agriculture per acre by various schemes of improvement, it should be possible for us to grow a greater quantity of wheat without interfering with the general livestock production programme.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  If he claims that agricultural output per acre would increase by 25 to 50 per cent., there should be ample acreage available in these circumstances for growing more wheat and for making ourselves less dependent on imports of wheat and maintaining the national security.  I should like to have his admission at long last that we can anticipate a very great increase in the acreage of wheat without altering or interfering with the production of live stock&mdash;pigs, sheep, cattle or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to hear the Minister make a confession about the growing of wheat.  I think that practically every Minister of the previous <Col N="190" /> Government made a confession at one time or another on different aspects of policy and admitted that he had been wrong, that perhaps he had overstated the case.  Certainly the former Taoiseach was capable of doing that, as were other Ministers.  Maybe the moment has arrived when the Minister for Agriculture ought to make a reasonable confession to the country in regard to the growing of wheat, the statement he made in 1947 that he would not be seen dead in a field of wheat and that the growing of wheat was a rotten fraud, designed to fill the pockets of profiteering millers.  I think it is time he was big enough to make a statement of that kind to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, why is it that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce have recently been going around the country asking people to grow more wheat?  Isolated advertisements have appeared, issued by the Minister, encouraging the growing of wheat, sandwiched in between appeals to grow barley, oats and potatoes. Why, in that case, does the Minister allow a certain amount of propaganda to be carried on for the growing of wheat if he still believes it is a rotten fraud?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was not referring to the compulsory growing of wheat, but to the general growing of wheat, and he went on to say, after that, that he hoped that, after wheat and peat, beet would go up the spout. He said that in 1947.  He suggested that the sooner beet production ended the better for the country, and we are still importing sugar when we should be producing beet to cover the whole sugar requirements of the country.  I should like to ask the Minister to make a statement to the country <Col N="191" /> about his present views in regard to the growing of sugar beet and whether he hopes it will go up the spout, as he hoped peat and wheat would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Next I come to the question of milk and butter.  The question of dairying is one of very great importance, because, as the Minister has observed, the greatest level of continuous employment is given in the dairying area.  All that we have been told is that there is going to be difficulty about exporting butter, and the suggestion has been made that the price of milk should be reduced over a long-term period.  I do not believe the Minister has ever yet faced the realities about dairying. During our time conditions were abnormal and it was impossible to make any final long-term decision, but it is quite obvious that, if we are not to depend entirely on cattle exports in the matter of our foreign trade, we should do something to stimulate the export of butter without taxing our people in order to do so.</P>
      <P>I believe that the Minister for Agriculture of the day will have to do something more about increasing milk yields and about breeding.  I do not believe that the Minister has done anything final or decisive in regard to that matter.  I know farmers in the dairying area who have improved their grass lands, who have managed to increase enormously the amount of nourishment they can get out of an acre of grass by modern farming methods.  I know farmers in the dairying area who are able to make far greater profit than other farmers.  My own belief is that some temporary step will have to be taken to preserve the dairying industry and there will have to be a long-term improvement programme, so that it will be possible for the average dairy farmer to produce a great deal more milk per acre on his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no easy or quick way out of the difficulty.  It is impossible to make a change, any noticeable change, in a period of five years; it must be a long-term <Col N="192" /> policy.  I admit&mdash;this is my own personal view&mdash;that if we produce the maximum amount of feeding stuffs for the country and if we are not running into debt for the purpose of buying wheat and if we have a full programme of tillage designed to safeguard our national security, I have not got the same objection as some Deputies have to continuing the subsidies for butter exports if, at the same time, a long-term programme of improvement of pasture and of improving the yield of milk is put into operation.  I believe it can be done and I believe that it is easier to do it now when conditions are favourable than it was at any time during our period of office.  I do not see why we should tax our people to export butter to Great Britain, if what the Minister for External Affairs says is true, that we are running into debt to the American Government and saving the English Government millions of dollars.  If we can get out of that position, so that at least we are feeding ourselves and not unduly assisting other countries at our expense, I see no reason why we should not recommend a continuance of the subsidy while we are waiting for milk yields to improve, and for the total amount of feeding stuffs available in the dairying area to improve, through drainage, reclamation and more modern methods.</P>
    <P>Dealing with some of the fundamental problems attending agricultural production, I think the Minister makes the mistake of talking too dramatically to the people.  The farmers have been through so many difficulties since the beginning of this century that they are not very easily going to make a change in their methods.  I do not believe it is effective to make dramatic speeches calling on farmers to abolish horse ploughs, to use a different type of plough and to make all sorts of changes in their economy.  I think it merely disturbs the minds of a great many exceedingly conservative farmers who have suffered too many changes in marketing policy to be willing to make quick changes in their methods.  The fact that some 50,000 people left the land last year indicates that, with all the inducements given to them by the Minister in the way of the land <Col N="193" /> reclamation scheme and the land rehabilitation scheme, they apparently prefer to leave more land in the hands of fewer people.  That was their way of achieving a better way of life.</P>
    <P>It is going to be awfully difficult to change that principle.  So long as only one person can inherit a farm, so long as farms are not divided&mdash;and they never will be in this country&mdash;and so long as emigration to the towns or to England is easy, it will be a long time before farmers can be persuaded to invest working capital in their farms with a view to securing what, in their lifetime, would be only a very modest increase in output.  We need to have a very long-term quiet programme of activity.  There is no good in trying to bull-doze the farmer into making radical changes in a few months. What is needed is a long-term programme, and I think that until the Minister clarifies his policy a great deal he will not get the full co-operation that he should have from the farmers so that they can take advantage of the conditions that are now so favourable. My own belief is that all the boasting that is being done about prices for cattle and for this, that or the other thing, whether it comes from the former Government or the present Government, is probably in the long run very ill-advised.</P>
    <P>Unless there is a world war we are going to face very stiff competition in the next ten years, and ultimately price comparisons are going to be of far less importance.  In all countries throughout the world vast reclamation schemes are being undertaken. Methods of production are being improved. There have been some improvements here, but the system of offering farmers price inducements without giving them warning of what may happen, unless there is a world war, is false policy.  As I have stated it is going to be very hard to persuade farmers that the price they get for cattle, pigs and eggs will not be as important as a greater production of these things per acre of land.  Already we notice that the British Government are making comparisons between Danish and Irish prices to our disadvantage. Denmark is a country <Col N="194" /> where the whole problem is simpler than it is here, because the land of that country is of the same kind almost throughout the country.  Again the Danish people have had their land settlement problem over since the beginning of the 19th century, and they have developed a system suitable to themselves and to meet their markets.  It is going to be hard for us to compete with the Danes because our situation and circumstances are entirely different.  As I have stated I do not believe there is any advantage in engaging in a long term programme of importance unless there is a policy instituted by the Government, and more or less agreed on by both of the principal political Parties in this House.  Fulminating against Fianna Fáil is not the way to get the farmers to co-operate.  There are many farmers who are as good as any others, and who supported Fianna Fáil over a number of years, and we lost very few seats in the past 16 years through them.</P>
    <P>On the question of land rehabilitation it is in my view essential to use machinery in certain circumstances for land rehabilitation, and I would like to repeat here, what has been stated before, that we have not tried to sabotage that scheme.  I am well aware that there are from 3,000,000 to 5,000,000 acres of land in this country that need drastic improvement and drainage, and if we are able to make use of the American Counterpart Fund for drainage I believe every farmer in the country should apply under that scheme and should take advantage of any services which might be useful to him.</P>
    <P>I feel that in a good many cases the farmers find that these schemes are not suitable to their lands, and I think in such cases they should get the committee of agriculture to look into these matters and the committee, in turn, should inform the Minister as to the suitability or otherwise of the schemes in these cases.  If anybody has a complaint to make against the scheme they should band themselves together and get the correct information and criticise the scheme from the constructive point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> I would also like to ask the Minister whether it is intended to go in for hillside reclamation.  That is being done in Great Britain and in parts of Wales, where the land is similar to our own.  There are many areas here where you have a substratum rock and reclamation could not be successfully carried on, but there are other areas where the soil is free from rock and stone and where hillside reclamation could be carried out.  So far as I know, that has been done with great success in Great Britain under the direction of Sir George Stapleton, and also with success in parts of Wales, where the conditions are similar to those of this country.  There has been some talk of such schemes being carried out here, but I would like to hear more about it from the Minister.  I doubt very much if it could be carried out here on an individual basis, but rather would it have to be done on a basis of some sort of employment scheme in most areas.  There is no question about it that feeding stuffs suitable for store cattle could be increased by the improvement of land of that type and in certain cases crops such as rye could be sown on them.  I would like to have the Minister's views on that matter.</P>
    <P>So far as the general use of machinery is concerned it is obvious that machinery on the farm has come to stay and more and more farmers will use it.  It is on the other hand quite obvious that the farmers will have to have horses for certain purposes. I do not think the Minister will dispute that the tractor is increasing in use and I think he should consult with his colleague the Minister for Defence in having some storage provided for fuel oil so that they could store up at least sufficient supplies for about one year's use.  The position in this country at the moment is that we have no stock pile.  We are the only country with a buoyant economy and no stock pile of any single commodity, whether it be food, machinery or oil for machinery.  We should be able to create such stock piles and provide for the future and any emergency that might arise.  It is ludicrous to suggest that we should go over to tractors until <Col N="196" /> such times as we have created a stock pile of suitable oils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to listen to a speech from the Deputy who has just sat down and who has no experience of gaining a livelihood from the land.  Deputy Childers has tried to give us an agricultural policy and to listen to him bolstering up the Fianna Fáil policy yet was amusing.  I wonder if Deputies are aware that Lord Oranmore and Browne in 1944 and 1945 allowed large quantities of wheat to rot just because he had grown the wheat on his estate as a food for snipe and other game birds for the amusement of the people who would visit his estate.  Those are the types of people with whom Deputy Childers associates when he leaves his own constituency.</P>
      <P>One would think that compulsory tillage and a tillage policy generally was something which Fianna Fáil had in mind for all time.  We know perfectly well that there was not a word of compulsory tillage until it became absolutely necessary to produce wheat and the other essential commodities for our daily food.</P>
      <P>We know perfectly well that if Fianna Fáil had remained in office for one more year, compulsory tillage would have been abolished because the rancher element in the country, who have such loyal and devoted friends in the Fianna Fáil Party, dislike to see their fields uprooted.  They hate the sight of the virgin earth upturned. They prefer green fields and herds of cattle and droves of bullocks.  It entails less employment and there is less need to worry about the much despised agricultural worker or his wages.  Therefore, even though Fianna Fáil might have the idea, or might pretend to have the idea, of continuing compulsory tillage, the big cheque books of their aristocratic rancher friends would force their hands and compulsory tillage would not be continued.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in introducing his Estimate, made it quite clear that facts speak for themselves. The increased production of eggs, butter, bacon, cattle and all the other agricultural products we have for export is in itself definite proof that the agricultural policy of this Government is putting agriculture forward. No farmer will produce unless it is made a good paying proposition for him to produce.  The industrialist will not start an industry or produce an article unless it is a paying proposition. There is an old-established tradition in agriculture that farmers will not engage in a particular type of production unless it brings a handsome profit and pays them for their labour.  The profit they derive from hard work will benefit the nation as a whole.  Increased production is proof of the fact that the agricultural industry is <Col N="198" /> prospering as it has not prospered for many years.</P>
      <P>I shall not throw the bouquets entirely at the present Minister for Agriculture because the world, for a number of years past, has been hungry and the fact of the world war would tend to increase the value of foodstuffs. However, we must appreciate that the Minister and his colleagues are making a very fine effort to make the most of this boom in agriculture. We may listen to the multitude of excuses that will be given as to why agriculture was not more prosperous in past years, but I still maintain, as an agriculturist, that agriculture over a long number of years received very little encouragement.  There was no such thing as an effort being made to guarantee markets or to guarantee or to secure firm prices.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately for the Minister and the agricultural community as a whole, sometimes an effort is made to get prices which cannot possibly be got, but if a Minister does his best, as this Minister is doing, with regard to guaranteed markets and prices, even if he were a Fianna Fáil Minister, and even if I were in opposition, I would certainly never blame him for doing the very best he could and yet failing to satisfy the agricultural community as a whole.  The increase in the many branches of agriculture are proof that the farming community and the agricultural industry are prosperous at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister, having lived most of his life west of the Shannon, believes in the policy of mixed farming and may be inclined to devote most of his attention to that policy which tries to encourage the middle-class farmer to put in more tillage, to produce on his own land all that is necessary to feed his live stock and, as he told us time and again, to walk it off the land to a ready market, which is available at the present time.  That is the type of industry that has been carried on in the small farms west of the Shannon for the past 150 years. That is the type of industry which, I daresay, will be carried on as long as farming is carried on in that area. You cannot break tradition.  If the <Col N="199" /> Minister thinks that that is the best system of agriculture for this country, while it may not be to the liking of people who are dairy producers or grazing farmers or ranchers, in the Midlands, as far as farmers west of the Shannon are concerned, we must admit that we have experienced, as a result of his efforts, a boom of prosperity which we have been long awaiting and we have a feeling of security that, if there is another world depression, in which the present prices may not be able to be maintained, we will have, for at least a year or so in advance, some idea of the way in which our economy must be balanced on our small farms so as to be able to meet the crash which, I suppose, will come some time or other.</P>
    <P>When the world decides that it is fit to feed itself again, we, who must always rely on our next door neighbour, England, for a market, will find that they will try, as they are trying at the moment, to get food at cheaper prices.  They will try to reduce our prices.  It is the real test of any Minister for Agriculture or any Government, if they have the confidence of the agricultural community.  The best way to have the confidence of the agricultural community is to drum into the minds of the people of this country the fact that the middle class farmer is the back-bone of any country.  If one line of production crashes on him during a certain year, he can turn his hand, without having to alter his whole agricultural outlook, to something else, and thereby fit himself to take the rebound of economic depression.  The Minister for Agriculture is trying to do that.  If he continues on his present line we, west of the Shannon, can only give him every encouragement and help.</P>
    <P>I admit the failure with regard to the price of eggs.  The Minister assured us that 2/6 a dozen would be available for eggs, and that the more eggs available for export the better the price would be for them.  Candidly, from the outset, I never believed anything of the kind.  If you produce an article or a commodity to the extent that it causes an over-flooding of the market for it, you will find that there <Col N="200" /> will be a reduction in its price.  The Minister has caused a certain amount of disappointment to the poultry producers, even though he has made an arrangement that during the winter season there will be an increased price for eggs while, in the laying months, when it is less costly to produce them, there will be a decrease in the price. The poultry producers must, therefore, try and balance their production of eggs, and if possible ensure that they will have more eggs to sell during the months when the price will be high, as the Minister has advised them to do, and less eggs for sale when the price is low.  I do not think, at the same time, that there was any great necessity to give farmers advice of that kind.</P>
    <P>Farmers have a hard battle to fight, and they must be shrewd if they are to survive.  A bad season or the loss of live stock could ruin a farmer in less than six months.  There is no insurance and nothing that he can call upon.  If he loses his health and has to go out of the management of his farm he has nothing to call to his assistance.  There is no system of paying him a salary or anything of that kind to keep him going.  He cannot afford to permit of any waste or overlapping.  He knows that if he does it will not be long until he experiences the ill-effects of it.  The people know well what to do.  However, it is no harm to have a good honest-to-God practical talk delivered by the Minister for Agriculture: &ldquo;Well, it is your own funeral.  This is a free country.  Do this and you will get more money.  Do not do this and you will get less money.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is not now in the House to hear what I have to say in regard to the letting of land on the 11 months' grazing system. Every farmer, and particularly the small farmer, realises what a crime it is to let land on that system.  The position at the moment is that if it is only a matter of ten acres of land in a congested area which are to be let on the 11 months' grazing system it is not the poor farmer who is in a position to rent that land but the man with money in his pocket.  You have the chain rancher.  You have the man <Col N="201" /> with ten acres in one end of a congested village and maybe five acres in another village and so on, who can outbid any small farmer who is endeavouring to secure for himself a share in the benefits which are to be had now from land&mdash;for instance, the live-stock boom, such as it is.  The Minister mentioned the letting of land on that system on the 7th May, 1949, to the Meath Committee of Agriculture. He pointed out that if people were content to let their land on the 11 months' grazing system he was not going to stand over it or allow it.  He described them as miners of the land and said that if they were not willing to work their own land there were plenty of people who would be only too willing to work and till it and produce from it.  He later mentioned the same matter in this House on the 27th April, 1950, as reported in column 1370 of the Official Report, Volume 120:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...we recognise that the duties of the landholder are of a solemn kind, and that, without any qualification of the right to own land, we declare that a man may do with his land anything except rent it, but that if a man acquires wide acres and then proceeds to derive an income from it by setting it to those who work it, the State will step in and purchase the land from the landholder and transfer its ownership to those who are working it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There again, a year later he reechoed the statement he made to the Meath Committee of Agriculture. When introducing this Estimate the Minister stated&mdash;column 1791, Volume 121 of the Official Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have constantly maintained that that system of agriculture has the additional advantage that it employs more of our people on the land;...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That, I may say, is the system of agriculture which he described as &ldquo;one more cow, one more sow and one more acre under the plough&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;...that that system of agriculture tends to multiply on our land farmer proprietors; that that is what this <Col N="202" /> Government wants to see&mdash;not quasilandlords or 11-month tenants, but people owning and working their own land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If I find myself in disagreement with the Minister on anything it is that over the past two years nothing on God's earth has been done about this 11 months' grazing system.</P>

      <P>We have a Minister for Agriculture who is aware, as he must be aware because of the area in which he has spent all his life, of the conditions and who has mentioned to a committee of agriculture and twice in this House that land let on the 11 months' grazing system is nothing but robbery as far as the State is concerned and plundering as far as depriving the people who would work these lands themselves is concerned.  Yet he sat down with his colleagues in the Government and has not put a stop to the system nor has he taken any step in that respect.  If I criticise any part of the Minister's policy I criticise him on that point more than on anything else. However, if the 11 months' system of letting is allowed to go on much longer and if some notice is not taken of it by some responsible Department&mdash; either the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Lands, which is so very closely allied to it&mdash;my criticism and the criticism of other Deputies on the back benches will very soon make them take plenty of notice.  I realise that we cannot do everything at once. We cannot give the people everything they ask for immediately.  However, nothing like sufficient attention is being given to the problem of the 11 months' letting system which was first referred to by the Minister himself some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing that I would like to mention and that is with regard to the land rehabilitation scheme.  In County Mayo we were the very lucky ones, if you like, because we happened to be the first county in which this land rehabilitation scheme went into operation. During the time it has been in operation, the amount of work done <Col N="203" /> there has been very satisfactory and successful.  There is no doubt that wherever the scheme has been completed it has definitely been a very good job.</P>
    <P>I am faced with the constant problem of a very large number of small and middle-class farmers who are anxious to do this work by their own labour but who cannot obtain permission from the Department to go ahead with the work.  I have known many cases where people on small holdings must do their own planning.  They plan economically as regards the amount of work they can do.  They make plans to rehabilitate one, two or three acres in such an area and then they apply to the Department to get permission to go ahead.  They have their own family labour to rely on and they are ready to go ahead with the scheme, but then they find that the whole thing must be allowed to collapse because they do not get the Department's permission.</P>
    <P>That is unfair.  On a small farm, where people are anxious to carry out rehabilitation, to bring into fertility an acre or two, they should receive every assistance from the Department.  To these people the one or two acres would be as valuable as 20, 30 or 40 acres on the larger farms.  If the Minister were to increase the staff on this land rehabilitation project so far as the congested counties are concerned, and, when an application is sent to the office, to try to get the place inspected in time to allow the applicant to go ahead according to plan, he would be doing a very wise and useful thing.</P>
    <P>Every year that slips by means a loss to the small farmer.  He is not permitted, when he is anxious to rehabilitate his few acres, to improve his land.  Every year that goes by means the loss of an acre that could, with rehabilitation, produce two or three times, and in some cases ten times, as much.  If portions of those small holdings cannot be rehabilitated for three or four years, the small farmers will lose accordingly.</P>
    <P>Now that we are on the move in agriculture we should ride the high tide as much as possible, and something should be done to facilitate <Col N="204" /> those people to whom I referred.  The Minister gave me a very genuine excuse, the excuse that he wishes to see as much as possible of the money spent on the land of Ireland, and as little as possible spent on the officials concerned with the administration of this scheme.  There I am in full agreement with him, but a special concession should be made in the case of applicants for small plots, the applicants who want to improve one or two or three acres.  That area may seem very small so far as land rehabilitation is concerned, but it means a good deal to the man with only ten or 15 acres.  Something should be done immediately to meet those people. Anything that is done will be repaid one hundredfold.  The Minister is capable of evolving some scheme to do what I suggest, to meet those people in the demands they are justly entitled to make.</P>
    <P>I speak for a western county, like Deputy Gilbride of the Fianna Fáil Party, who has just spoken.  We do not talk of the dairying industry or of the huge ranches or big farms.  We talk of the policy relating to store cattle, the production of forward stores and pigs.  The pigs are in small numbers on individual farms, but over a parish they multiply very considerably. The production of poultry is on the same scale.  In the constituency I represent production is confined to the area of land on which each farmer can work, and where we have so many small farmers production is somewhat limited.  Farmers try to get the most out of every animal and out of every article of agricultural produce that they have to sell.</P>
    <P>When we speak about our different little industries, we have amongst them the production of forward store cattle.  That is one of our valuable assets; it is a very valuable sideline. The small farmer who can produce four, five or six forward stores in the year cannot do it unless he grows his own foodstuffs.  He cannot do much in the summer.  The policy is to do as much tillage as possible, and then treat the cattle as stall-feds in the winter months or treat them in the open yard and have them ready to sell in the spring.  Their rations must be <Col N="205" /> supplemented by what is got from imported sources, such as maize and other imported animal feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>The home-produced feeding stuffs are a very important factor.  I am in full agreement with the Minister in this, that he is a foolish farmer who will buy maize when he can produce something on the land to feed live stock which is just as good or almost as good as what he would buy across the shop counter. The war taught people a lesson that no Minister or Government could teach them.  We had no maize or other feeding stuffs from abroad and we had to rely on what was grown at home.  Still, the country kept going.  The farmers west of the Shannon kept up the production of store cattle and poultry and the other little sidelines they had out of what they produced on their holdings.</P>
    <P>So far as farms are concerned, we are faced with this situation.  We have 60,624 farms of one acre and under. Those with one acre and under could not properly be described as farmers. I dare say they would come into the category of agricultural labourers or county council workers who have houses built for them and are given one acre plots.  We have 20,003 farms of one to five acres.  It is doubtful if they could be described as farmers.  In the constituency that I come from, there is a good number, particularly in the eastern and western sections, of people who derive a livelihood in other ways than directly from the farm.  The farm is only an address they call back to because they are mostly migratory labourers who travel to England for a livelihood&mdash;that is their means of existence.</P>
    <P>We have 32,029 persons with ten to 15 acres.  Those are the people who perhaps should get a definite type of attention.  They are the people who struggle on the land and who make a meagre existence out of it, but they are determined that it will be cultivated, worked to the last perch and every single ounce of produce that can be got out of it will be got out of it. We have 89,311 people with 15 to 30-acre farms and 62,786 people with 30 to 50-acre farms.  The over 30-acre farmer is all right; he has a fair <Col N="206" /> amount of ground to manoeuvre on. With his family labour, he can find profitable employment on the farm.</P>
    <P>The people who have from ten acres to 30 acres are the most valuable that there can be among the farming community because they are anxious to produce so much from their farms. They have not all the ground they would like to till and produce from and, therefore, they find themselves in the class known as nobody's children, nobody's babies.  They are the people for whom I speak chiefly.  When an individual finds in almost 90 per cent. of his constituency a certain type of farmer, he must naturally be most interested in that particular type.</P>
    <P>We have again the slow-moving activities of the Land Commission in regard to middle-class or small farmers. These activities are proceeding at such a pace that I doubt if even the seventh generation of the one that is living at present will see a settlement reached of the problems which concern that type of smallholders.  In the meantime, they have to exist and produce as best they can on their little holdings.  It may be argued that the man with 200 or 300 acres of land, by using mass production methods for the production of pigs, poultry and cattle and who employs a good deal of labour, may be more valuable to the country than the small man.  I venture to suggest that if you were to take a parish in the Midlands and a parish in County Mayo, both of equal size, and if a check were made on the cattle, poultry and pigs produced in each of these parishes, it would be found in nine cases out of ten that the thickly populated and congested parish in the West of Ireland was beating the one in the Midlands all ends up, that it was producing more for export and for the general good of the people at home.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, as he has told us, is very interested in the mechanisation of farming.  Farming, as I have said, is a trade.  The farmer has a good many problems to contend against.  One is the weather.  There is a good deal of drudgery and hard work attached to farming as we have known it over a long period of years. The farmer, with a few acres of hay to cut and save had, under the old <Col N="207" /> system, to go out with his fork and his rake and try to get the hay into ship-shape.  That meant a good deal of hard work.</P>
    <P>The same applied to the production of potatoes.  There was a good deal of drudgery, as many of our people learned when they had to go and work in Great Britain, involved in the digging of potatoes.  Men might be employed on that work day after day and week after week, their backs bent digging out the potatoes.  That was drudgery of the most horrible kind.  It was work of that kind that was responsible more than anything else for the flight from the land.  The young people of to-day do not want that type of work.  We are moving to-day in a speedier and a faster age.  We are producing more and, under modern conditions, there is less slavery, less of that tough, hard manual labour which was associated with work on the land in the past.  The introduction of the mechanisation of farming is going to do away with a lot of that drudgery. The horse is not going to be completely exterminated, because both on the large farm as well as on the small farm there is still certain work which the horse will have to be employed to do.</P>
    <P>We all know that the man with the tractor plough can now do almost ten times the amount of work that he could do with a team of horses, and that when he comes off the tractor in the evening he is almost as fresh himself as when he started out in the morning.  The man who has a tractor has two advantages over the man who has not one.  In the first place, it enables him to do more work and, secondly, it leaves him a fresher man, so that he is enabled to devote more time to other aspects of his farm work, such as fencing and work in the farm-yard. When he has his land operations completed, he has more free time for this other work.</P>
    <P>The man who invented the hydraulic system in connection with mechanised farming did more, in my opinion, for the agricultural community than all the Ministers for Agriculture in the world put together.  I am not sure who is <Col N="208" /> the inventor of it, but its benefits will be a millionfold for agricultural producers. The old type of tractor, trailing the agricultural implements behind it, could not properly do farm work on headlands.  There was a difficulty when it met with any sort of obstruction.  The hydraulic system which is now being worked on most tractors has entirely altered that situation.  The operator of the presentday tractor, if he smashes any implement in the course of his work, would do the same if he were working with a team of horses.</P>
    <P>I see a great future for mechanised farming.  The Minister for Agriculture has said that if a man has not the means to buy one of these expensive machines there is a way of overcoming that difficulty.  There are very few small or middle-class farmers who could afford to pay £375 for a tractor, £50 for a plough to work with it, £80 to £90 for a mower, almost £50 for a harrow, £70 for any kind of disc harrow and maybe £50 for a trailer.  In fact, it would take almost £1,000 for a man to purchase that amount of machinery.  I am glad to say, however, that a scheme has been introduced to enable farmers to overcome that difficulty.  You will get, in most areas, young enterprising men who are prepared to invest money in that type of machinery and to hire it out at a reasonable charge to their neighbours.  I have experience of that myself.  That system can bring mechanised farming into the smallest holdings and into the smallest fields at a reasonable cost to the farmer who employs it and at a profit to himself. He has the assurance that the work is well and swiftly done.  There is no objection from the people who hire out these tractors and machinery to do this mechanised farming.  They could never hope to purchase it themselves.  That system is working quite well.  Deputy Dunne has quite rightly pointed out that there is no cause for anxiety in relation to unemployment as a result of mechanisation.  If people are laid off agricultural work it will not be because of mechanisation.  A machine is the servant of the worker rather than his boss and mechanisation of agriculture must bring lasting benefits to the country as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardCommons" hpid="Mr. Commons Mr. Commons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Commons</NameTxt>
      <P>It may reduce the number of horses.  Let me point out in that connection that a horse deprives a farmer of as much food as would feed two fat cattle or two milch cows.  It is much more profitable for the farmer to feed something that he can turn into cash at the end of the year.  In most cases a small farmer with ten, 15 or 20 acres of land will only use his horse for two or three months in the year.  I made inquiries in my parish and I find that in it and an adjoining parish over 28 tractors have been brought in in the past 12 months.  The possibility is that that number will increase in the coming year.  I think mechanisation will eventually oust the horse even on the small farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted that there has been a drop in the beet acreage west of the Shannon.  That is unfortunate, particularly when one remembers that beet is a cash crop for which the farmer has a guaranteed market at a fixed price.  It is an important crop from the point of view of rotation, because it is one root crop which goes down deep into the soil and leaves the land as fertile after harvesting as it was before the crop went in.  One of the difficulties with regard to the harvesting of beet is the fact that the farmer must have it ready on a specific date. Whether the weather be good or bad, the beet must be ready for the lorry on the day on which the lorry comes to collect it.  Every farmer in the particular area must be ready.  The beet must be pulled, crowned and piled on the roadway irrespective of whether the weather is good or bad.  In order to have it ready, the farmer may be compelled to work day after day for perhaps a fortnight in pouring rain.  It is not so many years since I worked at beet harvesting for as long as 14 days at a stretch in pouring wet weather, and, in order to have the crop ready, it was usual for the farmers to join together in a kind of co-operative society for the purpose of assisting each other in the harvesting of the <Col N="210" /> beet.  I know that it is not the fault of the factory.  The beet must be collected systematically.  If that were not done there would be dislocation in the industry.  I am merely pointing out some of the drawbacks at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The smallest farmer can grow an acre or two of beet.  It is a crop which will bring him in as much as or more than any other acre he tills.  I know that we have produced very good beet in the west with a high sugar content. The farmer's only grievance is the time of the year at which it must be harvested. It does seem rather strange that with a guaranteed market we cannot produce enough even for our own needs.  One must remember, however, that it is very difficult to get labour, and has been for some time past. Mechanisation is coming to the rescue. The root cappers on the market do a very good job of work, and they have taken a lot of the drudgery away.  The weather is the problem all the time; we have no control over that.</P>
    <P>The farm improvement scheme was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government. The scheme was postponed, but it is now in operation, and has been very successful.  I, think some effort should be made to have a planned system of out-offices.  Houses erected over the past 30 years have been erected according to plan.  The same is not true of our farm buildings. They are flung together, here, there and everywhere.  I understand that the Department is now giving some attention to that particular aspect of farm improvements, and some effort is being made to have a proper plan. I think that is a good thing.  They are not paying the grants as soon as they should, but there may be reasons for that.  A farmer who intends to build out-offices within six months may find he has not completed them, and may apply for permission, directly to the Department or through his local representative, asking for another six months to complete the building.  That upsets the routine of the Department, and up to a certain extent we cannot blame them for slowness in paying all grants.  However, when a report is sent by the inspector that a building has been completed definitely and <Col N="211" /> finally sanctioned, payment should be made quickly.  I understand an effort will be made to do that.</P>
    <P>The present policy pursued by the Minister is a good one.  I like to see an increase in every phase of agricultural output and the Minister's figures show that increase.  I want to see some security for the farmers.  I am sorry the Minister is not in the House at the moment, as I would like to ask him to live up to his statement regarding the 11-months' system and if it is not meeting with his satisfaction, as he has admitted, it is his duty to do something about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been largely, as it should be, on the basis of technical or semi-technical discussion on agricultural policy or on the general basis of normal economics.  On neither of these bases do I feel competent to enter into this discussion but there is one aspect which has not been adequately covered, the aspect of the repercussion of the Minister's policy on the community as a whole, with particular reference to the present-day situation.  The very fact that agriculture is regarded as the dominant feature of our community life tends to have it treated in a certain isolation, as one thing by itself because of its very importance.  It is nevertheless tied up with other essential features of the community's life.  The farmer and the agricultural labourer primarily concerned in this Estimate, as well as others in towns and elsewhere, can be catered for adequately only by taking all these elements into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There exists a particular situation at present and there are questions that arise in it for our people, one of which is the feeding of the people in time of emergency.  There is another aspect, not related to that, which can be treated either on an emergency or a peace-time basis.  It is the consumers' end, the impact of agriculture on the cost of living through the price or the availability of foodstuffs produced at home.  I do not intend to enter into that now as there are difficult problems of balance involved and exhaustively or fairly to deal with them would be <Col N="212" /> beyond my capabilities or my information at the moment.</P>
    <P>Very few people are satisfied that we are going infallibly into an era of peace or that it is justifiable to work only on the hypothesis of peace and to discuss our economics&mdash;and particularly the economics of agricultural production&mdash;purely on the basis that we are entering a period of peace something similar to what obtained in the interval between the two last wars.  When people talk about markets, production and other matters frequently introduced into these debates, there seems to be impliedly behind it the assumption that people are working on a hypothesis of peace.  The Taoiseach himself has accepted that hypothesis&mdash;and consequently that they are either consciously or unconsciously coloured by the experiences of these particular days and they interpret the lessons of these days in a particular way and seek to prophesy for the future.  That may be all very well but before you are justified in doing that you have to ask yourself what is the justification for working on that hypothesis.  As far away as two years ago there were people in this House and outside it, a minority at first, who raised a question mark whether it was justifiable in agriculture or elsewhere to base oneself completely on the hypothesis that we were going into a peaceful era and that the ordinary normal&mdash;whatever they may be&mdash;commercial laws will operate without the shadow of force or conflict over them.  As the years have gone on confidence in that approach has been lessening instead of increasing.  The events of the last two years warrant a less optimistic view but I want to be very careful, particularly in view of the news at the moment, not to suggest a scare or in any way magnify the dangers of the present situation.  I want to proceed purely on the basis that the situation is such that we cannot ignore the possibility of an emergency comparable to the last one, in which we were very fortunate, or even worse.  We must make allowance for an emergency.</P>
    <P>How proximate it is, how probable it is, how little or how great the danger is are matters upon which many will come to a different conclusion.  All of <Col N="213" /> us must agree that there is some probability.  I would urge that we cannot ignore the dangers and that the prudent and proper thing for us would be to prepare for such an emergency.</P>
    <P>A fundamental and basic factor in that preparation is the production of food and the organisation of our food resources so that our people can live through and survive a crisis.  That, in turn, is a question of agriculture since it is from the land and those who work the land that that food must come.</P>
    <P>Consequently, in what I might call the general defence problem, which we have in company with practically every country in the world, the question of food production is basic and of first priority.  It is of first priority even from the point of view of surviving as a community, whether we are involved in war or not.  Whether we are actually involved, whether we are positively isolated or whether merely isolated through difficulties of communication, difficulties of supply or anything else, the question of adequate food supplies is of importance in order to enable our people to survive as a political unit.  Secondly, the provision of adequate food supplies, quite apart from the desirability of safeguarding our people from famine, is one of the big things that we can do to secure for ourselves some freedom of choice if a crisis should come.  It is obviously desirable, no matter how sympathies may lie, that a people such as we, a small people, should be in a position to exercise some freedom of choice, that the Government of the day, representing such a people, should be in a position to take decisions in which the interests of the people will be adequately taken into account.  In order that the Government should be in such a position, the first essential is that they should have no worries about the food supply of the people.  We all know that the quickest and most effective way to dictate to anybody is to starve him.  Certainly the most effective way in which you can dictate the course of action that any man or people will take is through starvation.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the question of famine, the question of adequate food <Col N="214" /> supplies, therefore, is important from the point of view of enabling the Government of the day to be in a position to make reasonable decisions without fear of the terror or dictation that an impending famine may hold for them. That is the second important reason why we should consider this matter in relation to this Estimate.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is this important point which has not been adverted to and which perhaps I might be permitted to mention now.  Many people have voiced various views as to the course we should take in such a contingency, just as in the last emergency people voiced different views as to what course should be taken, but the fundamental thing is that for our own well-being here it is important that we have adequate food supplies if such a contingency should arise.  From the point of view of people who are not friendly to you, the fact that you have adequate food supplies is a deterrent to them from attempting to interfere with you or from interfering with such supplies as you may have.  From the point of view of your friends also, it is important that you yourself have such food supplies and are so organised in that essential sense that you are not going to be a liability.  No matter what approach you have to the problem&mdash;the only way we should approach it is from our own point of view because, of course, charity begins at home&mdash;from the point of view of our people considered by themselves, and from the point of view of the repercussions on people who might be hostile to you, it is important for you to be in an independent position.  Again, from the point of view of people who might be friendly to you it is equally important that these supplies should be available.</P>
    <P>These are rather lengthy preliminaries, but a reasonable approach to this matter is important.  Supposing such a situation should come, let us visualise what we have to face.  I am not going to suggest that it will inevitably come; it may come within five years or at any time.  If it does come, we have the lessons of the last emergency. Adequate stocks and adequate supplies of cereals strike one as being the first problem which the Minister may have to face in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="215" /> During the last war, some preparation was made towards developing an agricultural economy here that would be favourable for the production of cereals under emergency conditions.  I frankly admit that most of the development that went on in that regard&mdash;wheat, beet and all the things that the Minister condemned at that time&mdash;was not brought about in those days, prior to the war, primarily with a view to the emergency that was to come.  I recognise that that policy was embarked upon because it was felt by the people in power as being the best policy for the country.  That policy the present Minister opposed violently.  The point I want to make is that when the emergency did come, that policy had its beneficial results for the community but even then, when it was found necessary under emergency conditions to increase the production of cereals, certain difficulties arose, for instance, from the fact that there was some decrease in root crop production at the same time.  That brings one to consider the necessity of arranging for the production under such conditions of both root crops and cereals, not only for feeding humans but for feeding animals.  I am not going into the technical details of that because, if I were to do so, I would certainly walk into a line of country with which I am not at all familiar but merely as the man in the street I should like to ask this question.  Supposing we have to face an emergency within a particular time&mdash;I am not asking the Minister's opinion as to whether one is going to come or not; I think he voiced his opinion some time ago that there probably would not be one, but I want him to reply now on the basis that I, for one, think it is necessary to make some provision for one&mdash;if an emergency should come within any foreseeable time, are we in a position to organise the production of the cereals and the root crops that will at least leave us in the position we were in during the last emergency?  That question has to be examined in relation to the possibility that the same supplies from overseas may not be as readily available as before.</P>
    <P>If it was decided to increase the <Col N="216" /> number of acres under cereals, if such a thing was found to be desirable, the results would not show themselves until the harvest of 1951.  That brings up the question of storage, and how much storage we have in hand at any particular time.  I think that during the last war the storage for grain and other commodities was deficient.  We should at least learn that lesson, and see that it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>The next criticism I have to make, and I mean it in all sobriety, is that the Minister's policy&mdash;I would be glad if he would correct me if I am wrong in the matter&mdash;has been based, during the last two years, on the old Fine Gael policy of the cattle trade; that if all goes well with regard to the cattle trade then he is quite satisfied. Everybody will admit that, particularly in a time when prices are favourable, there is something to be said for such a policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Then that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, the Minister will find that I am approaching this matter from a particular angle I am not talking about agriculture generally in the strict normal sense, because I do not feel that I am competent to do so, but I am talking about it from the point of view of an emergency.  The difficulty I see about simply concentrating on the live-stock aspect of agriculture is that if you do not balance it on the other side to the extent at any rate where you can feed your people and your animals, you are not only completely dependent on one market for your live stock, that is the £ s.d. side, but you also become critically dependent on outside sources for essential supplies of food for your people and your animals.  That is a situation which is extremely dangerous in any condition of emergency.  It is dangerous from the point of view of your people's food supply, and a greater danger still from the point of view of your whole economy if you are <Col N="217" /> completely at the mercy of an outside agency or in a position of being dictated to in regard to food supplies.</P>
      <P>In the past that was the justified criticism of the old Fine Gael policy in that regard and one feels that the present Minister is following on that policy.  It seems to me from my limited knowledge that it is a dangerous policy.  There is sufficient uncertainty in the present situation of the world to warrant a balanced economy with a bias towards producing such foodstuffs as we can at home and we should balance our economy, even at a cost, in that particular way. There is sufficient urgency to warrant us in attending to our storage position and in seeing that a situation such as occurred in the last emergency will not occur again where we might not get the same satisfactory opportunities as we got in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of other matters. One is the question of fertilisers.  I do not know how far the Minister will have responsibility in that matter.  I know what he has announced in that regard, but the point I want to make is that we are completely dependent on outside supplies for fertilisers.  At least we should see that we have adequate reserve stocks for an emergency and I think we would be justified in creating them.  I had occasion elsewhere to examine the statistics in that regard and I found that in phosphates a certain tonnage came in before the last war.  The figure, 80,000, sticks in my mind, but I am not certain what tonnage was imported. Just before the war that fertiliser import was pushed up and rose before the war, obviously in anticipation by the Department concerned of the war, and the desire to get supplies.  But, then, in 1942 there was a sudden drop of imports to zero and I understand that a cargo was lost.  It was anticipated North African supplies would be cut out and there were substantial purchases in the American market at prohibitive prices.  The imports rose after 1942, but they did not reach normality until 1947 or 1948.  In the meantime, there were phosphates available in County Clare, but which, <Col N="218" /> notwithstanding the efforts of the Government, and a private producer, were never sufficient to balance the loss caused by the inability to get supplies from outside.  There is a lesson to be learned there.  The lesson is simply (a) to have reasonable stocks in hand as long as there is a threat, and (b) to make provision for production at home of such fertilisers that might be needed in emergency conditions.</P>
    <P>I have urged in another debate that this industry should be set up to manufacture fertilisers, but I do not want to go into that further.  In addition to providing for stocks, we should at least have the plans ready to deal with that problem if and when the occasion arises.  The question of nitrogenous fertilisers is also important, and again I do not know how far the Minister is responsible in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the land a good place in which to store phosphates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to quarrel with the Minister on that at all.  There is indeed a very strong case for building up the land.  I am not joining issue with the Minister on that, but what I say is, if we had a position where we were isolated, it would be desirable that we should not be caught in the position in which we were the last time because the last time was a position from which we barely got through.  What I suggest now is that we should never allow the position to arise in which we will be so caught again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to nitrogenous manures, again, there are possibilities.  Just as we have certain phosphate supplies in this country&mdash;I am not going into the technical suitability at the moment; there has been a bit of a controversy about it&mdash;the raw material would be available in time of emergency.  I have urged on the Minister for Industry and Commerce the need for setting up a basic industry here, namely, the production of the basic chemicals like nitrate and sulphate ammonia.  That is a process that could be worked here if you had electric power and plant. Whatever the case which I have <Col N="219" /> already made for that industry in normal peacetime, from the point of view of an emergency situation, it is of great importance.</P>
    <P>Even if it cannot be prosecuted and developed in a pre-emergency stage, at least we should be in a position to get going with it and to achieve production in that regard should an emergency break and that, too, means planning&mdash;ensuring that essential items of equipment and plant which you will need for that project will be available in the country before emergency breaks so that your plans will not break down for lack of them.  I mention these for their intrinsic importance from this point of view and also perhaps as part of a suggestion that I have already been trying to bring to bear on other Ministers&mdash;the desirability of such an industry which would be a nucleus for a limited chemical industry here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">

      <P>I am neither a technical agriculturist nor a farmer and I will say frankly that I do not know very much about the subject, if I can claim to know anything about it, but the case I am trying to make goes further.  I understand from the last emergency that such natural methods of dealing with the soil were not enough.  Consequently, no matter what resources you have in the beginning, artificial manures generally are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Commons is not now in the House because I must confess that I was rather interested in his remarks on mechanisation in agriculture. Again, I am not going to go into that vexed question.  Perhaps I should say that I am one of those who are rather inclined to favour mechanisation wherever it can be effectively <Col N="220" /> applied but that is not the aspect of the story to which I want to come. It is this: that it is quite true and it is an impressive point to one listening to it as I was earlier to say, as the Deputy said, that if you have a tractor working as against horses it is leaving the feeding of these horses available for the feeding of other animals.</P>
    <P>In other words, instead of using some of your land and some of your effort for your motive power on the farm you have it all for its primary purpose and the argument that the tractor has advantages in that regard in times of unlimited supplies of fuel would go very far with me, anyway.  On the other hand, we have to consider what, if the figures given by that Deputy are correct, is going to be an important problem to the Minister for Agriculture, namely, the question of fuel oil storage. Deputy Commons gave figures of 28 tractors in two parishes within a year, I think.  The Minister will know how far mechanisation is becoming an important feature in agriculture.  I think it is inevitable that it probably will. But if it is, it raises two further problems for the Minister in regard to a possible emergency situation&mdash;the provision of implements and spare parts.  During the last emergency, as unmechanised as we were before it and during it, the problem of agricultural implements was one that assumed importance as the war wore on.  In proportion as you mechanise the industry and rely on the products of the factory, steelworks and so forth, in that proportion will that problem magnify. Therefore, the Minister in considering this possible emergency situation has the question of spare parts, the replacement of implements and all these kindred problems to consider.  That I must also commend to him and it will be one of the very many complex problems he will have to deal with in that regard.  Again, for the first time probably in regard to agriculture, the problem of fuel oil&mdash;I have mentioned it already&mdash;will assume a great importance. The Minister for Agriculture must then be satisfied that this power problem in agriculture is adequately provided for if a time of scarcity should come as it came in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> These are only a few of the points. One could practically multiply a lot of them by going into sub-details and even getting new points to deal with. The net is this.  What is the Minister's Department, in conjunction with other Departments&mdash;because it is a question of co-ordination, largely, as well as individual activity in Departments&mdash;doing to prepare us for a possible emergency, whether we are involved or not?</P>
    <P>If a serious world crisis broke out, anything in the nature of hostilities involving the western hemisphere, an emergency situation will be here whether we are involved or not.  We, at least, have this fortunate factor in our favour, that our approach to the basic problems involved in that situation will be the same for us whether we are involved or not.  On any approach our people will have to be fed; we will have to be organised; our agriculture must be organised to keep life going and enable us to survive as a community.  It is also desirable that we should look to it from the point of view of putting the Government in the position of taking a decision with some freedom of choice open to them.  That is the net point I want to make.</P>
    <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether he has considered what Switzerland has done recently.  It is a rather ominous thing to find the Swiss making provision about food rationing and laying in stocks of food. I am sure the Minister is aware of that.  If the situation is serious enough for Switzerland it may be serious enough for us to consider what we should do.</P>
    <P>Leaving that aspect of the subject, there is one matter which has been brought to my notice and which I prefer to put to the Minister in the form of a question.  As my information is meagre, I would be glad if he would give us some information.  It has been mentioned to me that the Minister has employed in his Department or has engaged in his Department some person or persons in the nature either of organisers or efficiency experts or something of that nature.  Perhaps the Minister will give us details if there are any such persons employed.  It has <Col N="222" /> been suggested that such persons have complete access to any information or any activity in the Minister's Department from top to bottom.  It has also been suggested that the particular person in question&mdash;person or persons &mdash;is not an Irish national.  I am not in the position to know, and perhaps the Minister will tell us what is the position in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister may very well feel that he would be entitled to have the affairs of his Department examined and get to the maximum pitch of organisation and efficiency.  With such a desire few people can quarrel.  On the other hand, it is said that the persons concerned are not nationals of this country, and, if they are not, and if they have the wide powers of securing information and the wide access that it is alleged they have in this country, it means there are certain non-nationals who have access to information which even elected Deputies have not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that would be the only reason I should raise the matter at all, because I do think it is serious that if there are any persons, efficiency experts or other persons, particularly if they are nonnationals, who have access to all files and documents, secret or confidential or otherwise in the Department, the Minister might well reconsider that, or inform the House of the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister to deal with that point when he is replying, if he can remember it amongst the various things about which he has been asked.  The Minister asked, when Deputy Childers was speaking, about some figures and, as I understood Deputy Childers, the figures which were referred to are these.  On 15th February, 1950, the Parliamentary Secretary answered Deputy Allen.  It is in Volume 119 of the Parliamentary Debates, the unrevised edition.  There are figures there showing the total number of males employed in agriculture. The question related to male agricultural workers, but the answer related to the total number of males employed in agriculture for a number of years up to 1948.  On 2nd May last the number was given at 452,000 odd. It is in column 1418.  The net result of these figures which, I think, Deputy Childers was referring to, was that in 1947 the total number of males employed on the land was 507,000; in 1948, the number was 499,000 and in 1949 the number of 452,000.  If you do some subtraction there you get the figure Deputy Childers referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of matters which the Minister's Department would be involved in and I am tempted to refer to them now, by reason of the fact that the Minister for External Affairs is at the moment sitting beside the Minister for Agriculture.  People in the City of Dublin have been worried about the cost of living in so far as foodstuffs are concerned, and the Minister for External Affairs has recently, practically at the same time as the Government Information Bureau issued a statement on the cost of living, come out with some remarks on the subject.  I realise there are problems of balance there, and I am tempted to go into it, now that the two Ministers are together.  I ask them: &ldquo;Can you get of one mind and <Col N="224" /> do something?&rdquo; and I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>We have to balance our agricultural economy.  We will have to go back somewhat, I think, to the production of foodstuffs, apart from the production of live stock, so as to ensure adequate supplies for humans and animals.  That balanced economy has been justified in peace and in emergency conditions in the past.  There appears to be none other open to us. Time is slipping, and we will have to tackle this problem a little bit more urgently than we have been doing. There is a lot of talk about compulsion and no compulsion.  It seems to me that is not a matter in issue at the moment.  It is more a question of governmental encouragement and it is a question of what are the results that are flowing from Government policy.</P>
    <P>Rightly or wrongly, one feels that much of the country is uncertain and that some of the depressing features in the present picture are due to uncertainly, to the feeling that one Minister is pressing or saying one thing in a half-hearted way while another Minister is saying something else, and the feeling that the Government is not as energetic along any particular line as it might be, and the feeling also that we are just drifting where time is being lost and that the time has come now&mdash;it came some time ago&mdash; when energetic action along some definite positive line is necessary.  As far as this debate is concerned, I think I will leave it at that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to say very much on this Estimate which has been so long under discussion.  I do feel depressed at hearing all that has been said about the farmers and their helplessness, with all the appeals that were made to the Minister for Agriculture to do things for them.  There is one appeal that I would make to the farmers, and it is that they should make more use of the co-operative movement.  I believe that the future belongs to the Party or Government which fully embraces the principle of co-operation.  I feel that the farming community is not making as much use of the co-operative movement as it <Col N="225" /> should.  We talk about the cost of living, which is undoubtedly a very serious matter at the moment, but, in regard to the masses of our people, I also feel that they are not fully conscious of the exploitation that is taking place amongst them by middlemen.  I have heard a good deal said here about the amount of money spent on farms and on what the farmers are getting for their produce and on what they are getting from the State.  I always feel that if there is any section of the people which deserves consideration it is that section which produces food for the nation.</P>
      <P>I heard the Minister say some time ago that milk production had increased, and that we had a surplus of it.  Can the Minister tell me what is the consumption of milk per head of the population?  I also heard him say some time ago that people were not buying their ration of butter&mdash;eight ounces.  I suggest to him, from the knowledge that I have, that the reason why the masses of the people are not buying the ration is because they have not the means to do so.  If there is anything necessary in this country at the moment it is, in my opinion, a more equitable distribution of the income of the nation.  When I think of the 50,000 or 55,000 unemployed who are living on from 9/- to 16/- a week for single men, and of 27/6 for a man and his wife, I ask myself, how can anyone seriously suggest that people in that position can buy eight ounces of butter, which is the amount of the ration, or how can they buy eggs or anything else for themselves and their families since they are solely dependent on unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  Take the old age pensioner with 17/6 a week.  What purchasing power has that sum nowadays? What I suggest to both sides of the House is that what they should concentrate their minds upon is bringing down the cost of living, and the cost of every article that is produced and manufactured here.</P>

    <P>The Minister looks at me in surprise. Could the Minister tell me what percentage is taken on farm products from the time the farmer produces them until they reach the consumer's table? <Col N="226" /> What percentage is taken by the middlemen who handle them?  Has the Minister any evidence to show us what is the cost of distribution of what we produce?</P>

      <P>The cost of bacon has not come down.  I have heard those in my own household complain recently about the cost of living.  I think they have very good reason for the complaint they make.  I should like to devote a little time to the question of the consumption of milk in this country.  I noticed recently that the production of milk on farms in England and Wales last March amounted to 143,000,000 gallons.  I am glad to know that milk production has increased here, but I am not satisfied that the consumption of milk amongst our people is what it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of the people of the country as a whole.  Are they, on the average, consuming three-quarters of a pint of milk each per day?  I believe they are not.  If we were to pay £1,000,000 to subsidise the consumption of this most valuable food I think it would be a good investment. It surely would be a good thing to provide milk for our children so that they would grow up healthy and strong, as well as for the people generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a reference to the wages paid to agricultural workers. We talk about keeping the people on the land.  What is the use of talking about that unless we give them a better status than they have at the moment?  The fact is that the agricultural <Col N="227" /> worker, who is engaged in producing the food of the nation, cannot to-day receive more than 63/- per week for a 56-hour week.  The Minister will probably say to me: &ldquo;That is not my affair&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is the minimum wage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>When we are dealing with agriculture and talking about land we cannot separate one from the other.  If we want to keep people on the land we must make that occupation more attractive than it is.  Let me say that I am not one bit alarmed about what the farmers are getting or are likely to get, when I read in a Sunday paper of a lady going into a fashionable shop in Dublin and buying a hat for 40 guineas to attend a race meeting.  I ask myself, where is she going to get the 40 guineas for that hat?  Where is that money to come from to add to the glare and glitter of life in the City of Dublin and of other places?  I am satisfied that the money was not found on a racecourse or in any of the first-class hotels in Dublin. It could only be found from the people who are working in fields and in factories or in mines to give those people a luxurious life.  Therefore, if the Minister is to set himself to deal effectively with the consumption of milk and butter, he will have to advocate a more equitable distribution of the wealth of the country and of the national income.  I am satisfied that the masses of our people are not able to purchase the milk, the butter or the eggs which are being produced, because of their lack of purchasing power.  I do not think it is necessary to stress that further.  Undoubtedly I think it is a shame and hardly fair to the people that so much valuable time should have been wasted here during the past few weeks by bringing in irrelevant matters on an Estimate for what is the most important industry in the country.</P>

Surely we are not going to adopt the standards of long ago as proper for our agricultural community to-day.  The bacon producers and consumers will have to be protected. Those who control the market will have to be dealt with more effectively than they have been dealt with so far by the present Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture is the most important Vote coming before this House.  I am particularly interested in one matter which concerns the people of the Gaeltacht and the congested areas.  I am interested in the glasshouse scheme for the growing of tomatoes and other produce.  That scheme was inaugurated by Fianna Fáil a few years ago.  The people in Donegal and in County Galway are not satisfied with the interest the present Minister has so far displayed in that scheme and with the assistance he has seen fit to give the scheme.  The Minister knows the Donegal and Galway Gaeltacht very well.  He must know how difficult it is to establish industries there for the benefit of the people.  Men with capital do not want to establish factories in the backward areas of Donegal, Galway and the West generally.  They will not build factories there so long as they are permitted to build them in and around Dublin and the other large centres of population.  We have very few industries in the congested areas. For centuries past the eyes of the people in these areas have turned to Glasgow, Liverpool, London and the other big industrial cities across the water rather than to our own principal cities and towns.  The exodus from the Gaeltacht will continue so long as the present position obtains.  The glasshouse scheme was designed to keep the young people at home and to give them a way of living so that they might be able to maintain themselves in some degree of comfort in their own homeland. It is very desirable that that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had debate after debate on the Gaeltacht, the language, Gaelic culture and so on.  Unless some concreate <Col N="229" /> steps are taken the Gaeltacht, as has been said so often here, is doomed. People cannot survive without employment. They must have the wherewithal to carry on their homes.  Unless industries are developed with the assistance of a native Government the outlook is a very poor one.  The glasshouse scheme was not an exotic scheme.  Private individuals have successfully carried on glasshouse cultivation for many years.  I think that if this scheme had the backing of the Minister and his Department it would be a success. It could be developed and expanded. It has been proved that an acre of land under glass will yield 40 tons of produce.  The same area in the open, because of the adverse weather conditions to which we are accustomed, will only yield something in the neighbourhood of two or three tons.  If the Minister accepts that, here then is a scheme designed to increase production in an area where production has always been very low.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have referred to the high price demanded by the Irish growers for tomatoes.  If the Irish grower is given a reasonable measure of protection, such as is accorded to other Irish industries, he will not be difficult to please so far as price is concerned.  He will be satisfied with a reasonable price if he is assured of a market.  Nobody objects to the Minister allowing the importation of tomatoes at a time when our own growers are unable to meet the demand.  When our own growers can meet the demand the importation of foreign tomatoes should be prohibited. That is not an unreasonable request. It is one that is made by the biggest industrialists here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one that should meet with the sympathy and approval of the Minister.  The Minister may be very anxious to give the poor of Dublin cheap tomatoes.  Carrying that argument to its logical conclusion, one can equally well argue that if we import shirts from Japan we can give the people the best of shirts at 1/11 <Col N="230" /> or 2/- each; we can give them cheap boots and shoes from Czecho-Slovakia and cheap clothing from other parts of the world.  I make the case that this industry established in the Gaeltacht, where we have so few, deserves the consideration and sympathy of the Government just as much as the boot and shoe industry, the clothing industry or any other industry established under the aegis of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not any complaint, have they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="Mr. Breslin Mr. Breslin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Breslin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am coming to the complaint.  As far as I can ascertain, last year the average price paid for tomatoes in Donegal was 3½d. per lb. I think that is a scandalous price to pay for such a very fine commodity.  I maintain that there is no comparison between the homegrown tomato and the imported tomato.  If the Minister and the Government are anxious to give cheap tomatoes to the people of Dublin and elsewhere, they should take into consideration the quality of the fruit.  One lb. of Irish tomatoes is equal to 7 lb. of the stuff that is imported in such very bad condition and sold at ¼ and ? per lb.  The livelihood of those who were driven away on to the West coast of Ireland is at stake.  Their future is at stake unless industries, such as the tomato-growing industry, are developed and helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the condition of affairs that has obtained now for some years in the Gaeltacht and the congested areas is allowed to continue, it will be only a matter of years until there will be no necessity to raise the question of the Gaeltacht here at all because there will be no Gaeltacht left.  The growers there ask that measure of protection from the Minister.  They say that they are working under bigger difficulties than those who have been in this business for hundreds of years.  It is a young industry, so far as they are concerned and it should be helped.  As the Minister is aware, in the Donegal Gaeltacht, the growers have to haul water over long distances and until a proper water supply is made available, as probably it will be, it is impossible to offer <Col N="231" /> tomatoes at a very low price.  I do not want to labour this question, but I would again ask the Minister to give it his personal attention, sympathy and co-operation.  I can assure him that the people of the Gaeltacht will do the rest.  This is a scheme that will help production there, help to keep our people at home in comfort and to raise their standard of living, a scheme that can be expanded over the various congested areas if we find it is a success. Surely that request coming to the Minister for Agriculture in an Irish Government should not fall on deaf ears.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief. I appreciate the work carried out under the schemes initiated by the Minister and the Government, but there are some difficulties associated with portion of these schemes to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  So far as the land rehabilitation scheme is concerned, as it operates in our district, the inspectors concerned are not at all co-operating as they should with the small farmers. The farmers there are of opinion that the scheme as it is advertised and operated to suit other counties should be adjusted to fit in with their economy and with local conditions.  It is not working out too well at present, and I have certain complaints to make about it.  I should like the Minister to examine the matter and, if necessary, instruct these inspectors to facilitate the people in the area I represent. For instance, the small farmers require a certain type of development, and to avail of a section of this scheme, but to do so would entail the carrying through of the scheme in its entirety, and the inspectors concerned insist on these small farmers going on with the whole scheme.  I, on their behalf, would like the Minister to examine that aspect of the matter.  It would be a serious matter for us if the scheme is not carried out as the Minister and the Government would like to see it carried out.  At the moment it is not being carried out as originally intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question that arises under the heading of the land rehabilitation scheme is that of water supplies to <Col N="232" /> farmers.  I, as a member of a local authority, would like the Minister to consider the question of co-operation with local authorities in that regard. Money is being provided up to a maximum of £100 in each case for farmers who will avail of that scheme.  In some of these areas, the local authority would, in the normal course, be interested in carrying through these schemes, and I have been asked to see if the Minister would consider the advisability of co-operation with the local authorities in that regard.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I have been asked to bring to the attention of the Minister is that merchants in my district have applied on various occasions for licences to enable them to import root and vegetable seeds. They have been informed that, under an Emergency Powers Order put through in 1943, only certain people in this country can import these seeds. I think it is not right to deprive local merchants of an opportunity to import root and vegetable seeds.  It seems to me that four or five firms have a monopoly of that end of the business. I think it is time that the position should be reviewed and some action taken in regard to it.</P>
    <P>I should also like to bring to the notice of the Minister the position of men in charge of rural improvement schemes and other schemes.  They have been employed in that capacity for a number of years, and I am informed that they are denied proper travelling expenses and also that they are still employed in a temporary capacity. They have, on the average, been in the employment of the Department for ten years, and even though they have applied on various occasions, through their organisation and other channels, they have been denied rights enjoyed by their colleagues engaged on other work carried out by the same Department. I think that there is a case there for immediate consideration by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Another point which I should like to put to the Minister is that the Agricultural Credit Corporation, so far as I can see in any case, is not of very much assistance to farmers.  I have <Col N="233" /> had experience in the past 12 months of cases where the Agricultural Credit Corporation refused bona fide applications. I could never understand why they have refused facilities to the farmers I have in mind.  I would go so far as to suggest that if it is said that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is an autonomous body over which we have no control, it should, by legislation, be made amenable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state in <Col N="237" /> relation to both married and single men at each exchange (a) the number of unemployed who since February 28th, 1950, have been offered employment in Counties Kildare and Offaly by the Dungloe, Dunfanaghy and Killybegs employment exchanges; (b) the number who accepted the offer, and (c) the number who as a result of their inability to accept this employment have been deprived of their unemployment assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question refers to vacancies for turf workers notified to my Department by Bord na Móna in connection with their hostel schemes in Kildare and Offaly.  Vacancies on these schemes are not offered to married men, but only to suitable single men on the unemployed register who are without dependents.  The number of such men to whom the employment was offered by the Dungloe, Dunfanaghy and Killybegs local offices of my Department since the date in question, is 863, 327 and 252, respectively.  The number at each of those offices who accepted the offer of work is seven, one and one respectively.  None of these applicants has been deprived of unemployment assistance as a result of inability to accept the employment.  The numbers of them whose applications have been disallowed in accordance with the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts on the ground that they were unable to obtain suitable employment were 623, 219 and 203 respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Between 700 and 1,000 reports by medical officers on school premises are transmitted annually to my Department by the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>It is the practice to examine these reports on receipt, and to give attention to those cases in which schools are stated to be unsuitable or in which very serious defects are mentioned. Because of the large number of reports involved, and difficulties as regards making available the staff required to deal with the matter, it would be virtually impossible to obtain from the official records the information asked for by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured, however, that, as I mentioned above, action is at all times taken on reports the nature of which calls for serious attention.  In a considerable number of cases where schools were reported in the last ten years as unsuitable the old buildings have been replaced, or are in course of replacement, by new schools, and in the other cases the fabrics have been found to be capable of being reconstructed and improved. In the remaining cases concerned, action is proceeding with the object of either replacing the unsuitable building or rendering it suitable by way of reconstruction or improvement.</P>

In that plan special provision has been made for the Dublin milk supply area; an officer has been placed at the disposal of the Dublin Milk Board to advise farmers in the production area on the care and management of their pastures and dairy stock; a publicity scheme designed to secure an increased consumption of milk in Dublin has also been launched.  Schemes have been formulated for the effective control of <Col N="245" /> certain cattle diseases and arrange-ments have been made to establish, at a very early date, an artificial insemination centre for the benefit of the farmers in the Dublin milk production area.  It is also intended, as soon as certain practical difficulties can be overcome, to provide for the pasteurising of all milk, other than highest grade milk, supplied in the Dublin area.  As a result of the steps already taken the position in regard to milk supplies in Dublin has been vastly improved since the tribunal made its report and, generally speaking, the area is now self-sufficient and independent of outside supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave (for the Minister for Finance)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is of high importance to our foreign exchange position to prevent the irregular introduction of any currency which is subject to import restrictions.  During the last few months there have been several cases which gave rise to grave suspicion that tourists arriving at Cobh from America have passed prohibited currency to friends who have put out from Cobh by tender to greet them on arrival, with the hope that such friends can, on the return journey from the liner, bring in the currency without difficulty.  Clearly if this practice is continued, all persons disembarking from the tender, not merely tourists but also their Irish friends, would have to be subjected to <Col N="246" /> customs examination, thus increasing clearance difficulties.  To avoid this efforts were made to have the amount of currency carried by persons visiting liners marked on their shore passes. This was found unsatisfactory and an attempt has now been made to ensure that such persons will deposit their currency in safe keeping before embarking on the tender.  Some form of control is clearly necessary and the Revenue Commissioners are investigating the matter to see if any alternative and better scheme can be found. It may be found necessary to insist on restricting facilities for visitors to liners, but efforts will be made to avoid such restriction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did pay specific attention to the reply.  The Minister will, perhaps, tell me on whose information does he rely.  Is he aware that I have <Col N="254" /> seen trawlers fishing within the three-mile limit where there was no official of the State, either a Civic Guard or military personnel, to notice it and, when the Guards are sent for, the trawler has disappeared by the time they arrive? In that case I take it the Minister would say he has no official intimation of such a happening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no official information as to the Deputy's vision, but I have official information as to the adequacy of the machinery, with known vision, that is and was dealing with this matter, long before my time as Minister.  There is quite comprehensive and adequate machinery for reporting vessels inside territorial waters.  The ordinary layman who attempts to estimate what is the measure of territorial waters and what is not, makes very grave errors.  I have numbers of cases where people requisitioned the authorities in a panicky way, stating there were vessels inside our territorial waters.  The naval vessels came along and those other ships were miles outside our territorial waters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJosephOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not.  The local fishermen would always claim that a vessel then miles out is inside territorial waters, and that is very well known to Governments from the beginning of time.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that there are far more Irish vessels on fishing protection duty at the moment than ever before and that they are vigilant and alert and anxious to prevent poaching.  The suggestion in the supplementary question is a grave indictment of the naval officers and others concerned.  I have trust and confidence in them and I am increasing the number of such vessels.

The council included two sites in the village in the Compulsory Purchase Order of 1947 but the larger of the sites had to be excluded from the confirming Order owing to legal difficulties. Another site was acquired under that Order but the erection of the four cottages now proposed for the site cannot be proceeded with pending the demolition of a condemned house standing on the plot and the rehousing of the existing tenant.  A further site for four houses has been acquired by agreement by the council and I understand that plans for a scheme thereon will be submitted for approval within a week or so, and that work will commence at an early date.

I understand that, in compliance with the county medical officer's recommendations, warning notices have been posted at certain wells to the effect that the water should not be used for human consumption and that an engineer is to visit the islands shortly to examine the questions of the repair of the wells and the improvement of the supplies.</P>

        <Col N="267" /> The mobile mass radiography unit, operated by Cork County Council, commenced the chest X-ray examination of persons in Cork City and County on the 6th April, 1949.  During the period to 31st December of that year a total of 7,928 miniature films were taken by the unit.

      <P>I would inform the Deputy that in my anxiety to improve the X-ray facilities in Cork County Borough, I informed the city health authorities, as far back as the 27th July, 1948, that I would be prepared to make a substantial grant for the purchase of a high-power X-ray apparatus. This offer has not yet been availed of.</P>
      <P>The existing tuberculosis clinic at the city hall is inadequate to house the high-power apparatus and suitable accommodation for it is unlikely to be available until a new health clinic for the area is provided by the local authorities concerned (Cork Corporation, Cork County Council and the South Cork Board of Public Assistance). Despite repeated efforts on my part to have this project proceeded with and thereby to improve the health services for the people in the Cork area I have been unable to prevail on these bodies to make any effective progress with the provision of the clinic towards the approved cost of which I am prepared to allocate a two-thirds grant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The numbers of X-ray examinations carried out at the mass radiography centre, Lord Edward Street, Dublin, in the years 1947 and 1948 were 14,305 (including 5,380 large films) and 15,196 (including 7,183 large films) respectively.  The numbers of active cases of tuberculosis diagnosed in those years were 164 and 175 respectively.  68,917 X-ray examinations were carried out at the centre from June, 1946 to 18th June, 1950, of which 10,902 were carried out in the period 1st January, 1950, to 18th June, 1950.</P>
      <P>I have ascertained that in an English city, containing approximately the same population as Dublin, a single unit carried out 40,000 miniature X-ray examinations in a year.  A comparison between that figure and the figures I have quoted above in respect of the Lord Edward Street unit for periods earlier than this year is not fully valid as up to about a year ago the unit was doing X-ray examinations, by large plate film, of patients attending the corporation's tuberculosis dispensaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, satisfied that the unit could be used to much greater effect, and in December last my Department wrote to the health authority suggesting a substantial increase in the number of weekly sessions for the general public.  They were also informed that the unit, with adequate <Col N="270" /> staff and efficient organisation, should be capable of reaching and maintaining a rate of 100 miniature films per session.</P>
    <P>A recent investigation which I caused to be made of the present activities of the unit disclosed that this valuable diagnostic service is not being made available to the general public to the extent to which it should be made available.  The matter is again being taken up with the health authority, this time as portion of a comprehensive review of local authority radiological services in Dublin, with a view to the provision of a better service for the citizens.</P>

      <P>As I stated on a previous occasion, the Taoiseach has a lot to answer for because he was responsible for putting into the position he now occupies the present Minister. Occupying as he does the all-important position of Minister for Agriculture, agriculture being our chief industry, and making, as he is, a continuation of the mess, discouraging tillage and discouraging dairying, surely it is not surprising when we say that the Taoiseach has a lot to answer for. Indeed, it would take a lot to pardon the people of Monaghan, to start with, because they know full well that the Minister's policy is to reverse the Sinn Féin policy of 1918; and when he has succeeded in doing that, when he has succeeded in making this country again a ranch to feed John Bull, regardless of whether our own people are fed or not, then the present Minister will have achieved his life's ambition.  The Minister's reputation for veracity is not too high.  I think I stated on a few occasions that sometimes he handles the truth rather carelessly.</P>

      <P>On yesterday, the Minister stated that there was no Iraq barley in this country.  At the same time he knew perfectly well, or should know, that 8,000 tons, the largest consignment ever, were being discharged at the Port of Cork.  This, Sir, is from the <i>Cork Examiner</i> of June 28th, 1950:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Cargo of Barley&mdash;Large Shipment discharged at Cork.</P>
      <P>One of the biggest cargoes ever to be shipped to Cork is at present being discharged.  The s.s. <i>Albistan</i> berthed at the south jetties yesterday afternoon with 8,000 tons of barley from Basrah, Iraq.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister should apologise to the House and to the country for the misleading information that he attempted to give the House last night.  The Minister has charged me with sabotage. That is a very serious charge.  If the Minister thought for a moment that he was justified in doing that, his duty was to see that any person guilty of sabotaging, or attempting to sabotage, the agricultural policy of this nation should be locked up.  Personally, I have often regretted that I had not charge of the keys when the Minister made many statements sabotaging, or attempting to sabotage, this nation.  If I had, he would be in Mountjoy.  He would be there still, and there for many a year to come.  I can assure you that on many occasions he tried to sabotage this country.  I should like to remind the House and the country of how much regard they should have for the Minister's statements.  I have gone through them in the past.

      <P>The production of wheat is connected with this Vote.  Again I think, with respect, that it is imperative that I should warn the country against the Minister's continued attempt to put this country into a position <Col N="272" /> where we would have no effective arguments in case of war.  The Minister knows perfectly well that the danger of war is there but, just as he forecast in 1937, 1938 and 1939 that we were going to have no war, he would nearly tell you now that we had not a war in 1940.  He would nearly believe it himself, he has made so many queer statements in his time.  As I said, he charged me with sabotaging his agricultural policy.  You cannot take the trousers off a highlander because he has none, and you cannot sabotage the Minister's agricultural policy for the very same reason.  The Minister did not tell the House or the country the real reason why he took exception to the statement I made some time ago. He had promised the farmers of this country a remunerative price for oats. He had promised them a fixed sum of £10 13s. 6d. a ton for potatoes but of course when the time came when the farmer wanted to dispose of his oats&mdash; it is a cash crop with most of our farmers&mdash;and his potatoes he found that the Minister was not prepared to carry out his promise.</P>

      <P>I advised the farmers in Tipperary to dispose of their oats and potatoes because it was obvious to me that the people who held on, and who would continue to hold on, would be doing nothing more than continuing to give a balanced diet to the rats of this country.  That is where most of the oats and most of the potatoes went. They went where the Minister was going to put the beet and the wheat&mdash; up the spout.  I did advise the farmers and the Minister took exception to it. The Minister is a very proud man.  He took exception not alone to that but also to my statement when I referred to him then, as I refer to him now, as &ldquo;Jimmy the Jinks, Minister for Agriculture.&rdquo; That is what is annoying <Col N="273" /> him, that is what is upsetting him and that is what has brought him on my house ever since.  He is very welcome. There is a céad míle fáilte awaiting him always.</P>
      <P>I advised the farmers to sell if they could but many failed to sell at all even at very low prices.  The highest price they could get was £1 8s. a barrel for their oats although in the previous year they got as high as 49/6 a barrel and in some exceptional cases as high as 53/- and 54/- a barrel.  I do not mind the Minister's berserk attack on me.  I told the farmers to band themselves together and to demand better prices for milk; to carry on the tillage policy and to strive for the Republic that will keep our young people at home.  I wonder then does the Minister consider that that was sabotage but I suppose it is according to his standards.  That is the Republic that we want and that is the Republic for which we fought. I wonder does the Minister take exception to all these things.  If he does he should have the moral courage to retrace his steps in many of these matters.  If we are going to have a successful tillage policy in the future the Minister must retrace his steps and admit that he was wrong in the past when he advised the farmers not to grow wheat.  There is no use in the Minister trying to extricate himself from the present position for which he himself is responsible and in which we find a reduced acreage of wheat. The Minister said at column 2040, Volume 106 of the Official Reports, June 18th, 1947:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would not be seen dead in a field of wheat on my land in this country because I know that the whole rotten fraud in fact was invoked to permit the Rank interest and the other milling interests in this country to charge our people 30/- a cwt. for flour when they were selling it in Liverpool for 19/-.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Statements of that kind have been damaging and they are going to continue to be damaging unless the Minister has the moral courage to come out and contradict these unfortunate statements of his.  That was the sabotage of the nation at that time.  The Minister <Col N="274" /> said again, at column 2042, Volume 106 of the Official Reports, June 18th, 1947, in reply to Major de Valera:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Deputy very courageously invites me to be more expeditious than the circumstances of my observations will permit.  But, if he will be patient, he will be very much wiser when I have finished talking than he was when I began.  Some day I am convinced that beet will go up the spout after peat and wheat.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well thank God that the Minister's statement did not come to pass and God forbid that it ever should or that we should ever again be left at the mercy of any foreign power to provide our wheat for us.  I have several statements here made by the Minister in regard to wheat.  He said, for instance:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Before you ate it you had to hold it up in your hand, squeeze the water out of it, then tease it and make up your mind whether you had boot polish or bread.  If you had boot polish you put it on your boots and shoes but if you had bread you tried to masticate it if you thought fit.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a nice recommendation for the Minister for Irish wheat.  I am only sorry that one person did not have enough of it so that he could choke himself. That would have saved the nation a lot of trouble and have been for its benefit.</P>
    <P>The Minister in the past few months attempted to reduce the price of milk. I believe he went to Tipperary where he met some of his friends and suggested that they should feel the pulse of the farmers in this matter.  Mind you, when the farmers heard what the scheme was all about the pulse went up very rapidly and I say it was a lucky thing for the Minister that day that they did not meet him.  But the Minister, not for the first time, tried to have the milk prices reduced.  He had not, however, the courage to go ahead with his plan apparently and I hope that he will be sensible enough not to try to reduce the price of milk.  If he tries it again I can assure him he will get a very bad reception from the farmers.  He is not very popular with them at the moment but when he is <Col N="275" /> finished I can assure him that any popularity he has with the farming community will have waned very much.</P>
    <P>Speaking at Volume 106, column 2048 of the Official Report, 18th June, 1947, the present Minister who was then Deputy James Dillon said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At the moment?  That is quite another problem.  The burden of my question is, is this policy of granting £2,000,000 per annum as a subsidy to the price of butter a permanent feature, because that permits the payment of only ½ per gallon for milk.  Deputy Heskin says that anything less than 1/5 is uneconomic. Well, £2,000,000 a year permits the payment of ½ with a retail selling price of 2/6 per lb. for butter.  If the Minister says this is merely to provide butter during the emergency when butter is not available from other sources of supply, that is another story.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We are subsidising butter production to the tune of £2,000,000 per annum.  How long will that go on?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that in 1947.  Then he continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Do we expect butter to get dearer in the markets of the world? Do we expect a time in the early future when the price of milk will become so adjusted that it will be possible to suspend this subsidy or do we intend to continue producing milk for conversion into butter in creameries at an annual cost to the taxpayer of £2,000,000 per annum? I want it to go on record most emphatically that I think such a policy is sheer insanity and is purely pursued for the purpose of maintaining the prestige of incompetents in the offices of the Minister for Agriculture since Fianna Fáil came into power. If butter cannot be produced for manufacture in creameries and sale to the public at a price which will not involve the community in a cost of 2/6 per lb. and the Exchequer in an annual grant of £2,000,000 the sooner we get out of producing butter through the medium of creameries for sale to the consumer the better <Col N="276" /> it will be for the consumer and the men on whose lands the milk to make that butter is produced.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Therefore, I take it that the policy of the Minister then&mdash;and let us have an assurance of what it is now&mdash;was to do away with all the creameries in this country.  I do not know what exactly he was trying to aim at.  If the Minister does away with the creameries a reduction in dairying is bound to result. The Minister surely knows that unless you have a cow you cannot have a calf. Therefore, his own policy of &ldquo;live stock,&rdquo; as he calls it, would meet with a very ready fate were he to continue to think along the same lines in regard to the dairying industry now and in the future as he thought on the 18th June, 1947.  The country deserves an assurance from the Minister even now as to what he intends to do with regard to the dairying industry while he remains Minister for Agriculture.  Is he going to carry out the threat he made in 1947?  Does he seriously think that the farmers of this country can produce milk at a lower price that ? per gallon?  If it were only the cost of the ass's hames or the jennet's shoes it has increased.</P>
    <P>Everything has increased since the time Fianna Fáil fixed ½ a gallon for milk.  The Minister surely will admit that.  Therefore, it would be insanity on his part&mdash;and it would result in great dangers to this State&mdash;if he were to dare to reduce the cost still further. As a matter of fact, the Minister did promise that he would increase by 2d. a gallon the price of milk to the creamery. He did not carry out that promise. Take the position of people who have been getting into cows in the past few years.  It is not easy to create a herd of cows.  You cannot do it overnight. No farmer will dare to try to do that. It can be done only as a result of hard thinking and sound judgment&mdash;and perhaps even then, in the matter of selecting a dairy cow, it does not always go so well.</P>
    <P>I have heard some people insinuate that the farmers are more or less too well off.  That is not so.  They have to contend with very grave difficulties.  I will mention two of them with which <Col N="277" /> everybody is familiar&mdash;mortality in cattle and depreciation in dairy herds. Mortality as a rule is high.  Certainly it is very high in the areas where the farmers are almost entirely dependent on the dairy cow for a livelihood&mdash;the mountainous areas.  In those areas the land is unsuitable even for the growing of a large potato crop.  There is scarcely even a small crop of oats to be seen.  Wheat is out of the question and, to a great extent, beet is out of the question.  Therefore, a mountain farmer who deserves so much from this State&mdash;we can never repay the mountain farmer for what he has done in the past for this State&mdash;has a very difficult struggle.  He is fighting against the hills, so to speak, from early morning till dark at night.  That man has had many an anxious hour and day and week and month since this talk of reducing the price of milk first began. As a rule, such farmers have large families to keep.</P>
    <P>We all know that the cost of living has gone up.  I did not know that it had gone up so much that the cost of a hat is now as much as 40 guineas until Deputy Hickey enlightened me to-day. I can assure the House that no farmer living in a mountainous area or in any other area that I know of can afford to pay 40 guineas for a hat for his wife. I hope that statement by Deputy Hickey was an exaggeration and if it was not it certainly cannot be applied to any farmer whom I know.  When the Minister is replying he should give an assurance to the dairy farmers that not alone is he not going to reduce the price of milk but, on the contrary, that he will increase the price of milk by at least the 2d. a gallon he promised them and raised their hopes about some time ago.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very machine-minded. He told us a few weeks ago that there will not be a plough in this country except as a stopgap in a few years' time.  We are all going to have tractors. I should like if the Minister would come down out of the clouds and fancy himself in the home of an eight acre or a ten acre or a 20-acre farmer in this country and ask himself how that farmer is going to get the money to purchase a tractor, even if he found <Col N="278" /> it desirable.  If that farmer had such an ambition he would say that many of the tractors purchased for tillage purposes during the war are now lying idle and many of them rusting&mdash;again owing, as I said a while ago, to the Minister's lack of policy in regard to tillage and to his many disparaging and discouraging statements in regard to the growing of wheat.  Can anybody imagine a small farmer with a few acres of tillage&mdash;perhaps he is able to keep only one horse and has to pool a second horse with a neighbour&mdash;purchasing a tractor?  What a foolish thought.  The Minister should come down out of the clouds and imagine for a moment that he is standing in a 30-acre or a 40-acre farm.  Remember, the small farmers of this country are the backbone of the nation.  Deputies here may sneer at them but there is a difference and a great difference between farmers and foreigners.  We find that whenever the nation needed immediate action the small farmers were always there.  I assure you that the fellows who farmed from the long distance did not worry very much with regard to what happened in this country.  The Minister will, as he is bound to do, defend the policy of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>

      <P>The Minister introduced John Brown, and I can tell you he came out second best.  If the Minister looks for trouble, he will get it; I would be sorry to deprive him of it.  We have one consolation, and that is, that many of the statements made by the Minister are now being accepted as the outpourings of an unbalanced mind.  There are farmers and there will be farmers deserving of credit in this country and no proper provision has been made for them as yet.  If the Minister desires to do something practical to help those who have not, perhaps, met with the best of luck for some years past, now is the time to issue to them small loans at a reasonable rate of interest.  That would meet a situation that has long been calling for a remedy.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a vain man and perhaps he will find it difficult to retrace his steps.  He will find it difficult to go back on many of the statements he made in the past.  But a man must have moral courage; that is all he requires, the moral courage to tell the people that when he did say certain disparaging things he was not quite serious.  The people know he was not serious, anyhow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Wheat is one of the things that this country must have.  War is imminent. There is hardly a doubt that this year, or within a few years, the world will again be invoved in a holocaust.  If <Col N="280" /> the Minister or anybody else considers that other nations will come to our aid with food, they might do so, but it will be at a price.  That price might be too great to ask this nation to pay.  We have had enough blood baths in this country, extending over 700 years, and no right-thinking man considers that we should be in another.  If we are to have effective arguments with any nation that desires or tries to compel us to go into war, we must have food because, without food, we will be weak and subjective and without an effective argument.  The old policy of Sinn Féin must be adhered to.  A self-supporting policy will ensure for our people a remunerative price for what they produce. It will assure them that for everything they produce a market will be found here.  That was Sinn Féin and it was the policy of the men who stood up in other days and whose motto was: &ldquo;Justice, though the heavens fall.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I know the Minister does not like that, but he will have to swallow it hook, line and sinker some day because, through one circumstance or another, eventually we will be driven to adopt that policy.  If you remain in power long enough you will be driven back to the policy of Sinn Féin, to allow to be produced here and to encourage the production here of the necessaries of life for our people.  I hope that instead of boasting of how many cattle we are able to put into the tummies of another nation, some day we can truthfully say that we have filled the stomachs of our own people.  Remember, there are many thousands in this country under the system we are operating who do not, unfortunately, know what the taste of meat is from one Christmas Day to the following Christmas Day.</P>

      <P>You would be surprised. I am not here to argue with the Deputy but it is true.  Every Deputy knows it is perfectly true. When I see the type of Republic that we have, I want to say that the Republic that I fought for was a Republic that would see to it that our own people would be able to live here in frugal comfort rather than be sending out bullocks to feed other nations.</P>
      <P>The Minister might like to know what the feelings of the farmers are with regard to his rehabilitation scheme.  I want to tell him that he has to an extent put the car before the horse, and that one of the first things he should have done was to carry out arterial drainage.  He had the power and the machinery to do so.  Surely, we have the man power too, because they are still leaving the country.  If the Minister had gone on with greater speed with an arterial drainage scheme, a scheme that in our life time would enable us to see the larger rivers of the country drained, then his rehabilitation of certain lands would be desirable. There is very little use in people spending money on streams which leave their lands and enter the larger tributaries thereby causing flooding. As a result of the backwash, that land will be just as bad in a year or two as it was before it was reclaimed.  An arterial drainage scheme on a large and speedier scale should be the Minister's model if he desires to see certain land of the country made into better pasture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to contradict again the statement of the Minister a few days ago that it was he who fixed the price of wheat.  That is not so.  It was fixed at 62/6 a barrel in October, 1947.  The Minister contradicted Deputy Walsh when he stated that it was Fianna Fáil who had fixed the price.  He said the Deputy was talking nonsense when the Deputy had stated that Fianna Fáil wisely fixed the price of wheat.  I think the Minister ought to have the decency to apologise to the Deputy concerned <Col N="282" /> because he knows perfectly well now that he was wrong, if he did not know it then.</P>

      <P>I definitely deny that I started it.  The Minister is much more in the habit of starting hares of that kind than I am, whether deliberately or not I do not know.  I certainly say that he knows more about that sort of thing than he does about agriculture. If he would learn a little about agriculture and less about slandering people he would be doing a good day's work for himself.  I must pay a tribute to Deputy P.D. Lehane, that public-spirited Deputy, who flatly contradicted the Minister a couple of days ago as to whose shoulders should bear the responsibility for any shortage in oats and potatoes that there has been.  The Minister had no doubt in the world about it that the responsibility was either Deputy Blaney's or mine.  It is a good omen, I think, for the country that we still have public spirited men like him who are not going to stand for statements of that kind from a Minister, who knew perfectly well, of course, that the statements were not true.  I do not need to defend my character against the Minister's in that matter because the farmers know perfectly that it was the Minister and not I who had been sabotaging the agricultural policy of this country for a number of years.

They do not want to be promised a price when they are sowing and ultimately fail to get that price when they are harvesting. That is what has happened and that is responsible for the shortage of oats and potatoes.  If the Minister had kept his word the farmers would have continued to grow oats and potatoes.

      <P>I have been in this House for 17 years.  I am a farmer. Never in my 17 years have I heard anything like the speech made by Deputy Davern just now.  Does he represent a farming constituency?  The speeches to which I have listened in the last six or seven days from farmer Deputies are a disgrace and a shame.  If Fianna Fáil had been in opposition from 1934 to 1938 they would have kept us here for months.  The farmers are not that badly off.  Everybody here is shouting about the oats and the barley.  One would think the farmers' lives depended on oats and barley.  They are only a sideline, as any common-sense farmer knows.  County Dublin Deputy Burke complained that the farmers in Dublin could not sell their barley.  Why could they not sell it?  They have the best market in the country at their <Col N="286" /> doors for everything else.  Why should they bother with barley.  If we in Westmeath had a market like Dublin on our doorstep we would not grow barley.  We would be glad to get barley in Westmeath for our fowl and our stock if we could get it.  We had a surplus of oats and potatoes two years ago, thanks be to Providence in the first instance, and our thanks to the Fianna Fáil policy, too, that had left the country without any storage for our surplus agricultural crops.  Would it not be sound agricultural policy to have granaries all over the country? There are granaries in Dublin which were packed full of stuff, the smell of which I defy anybody to stand.  That stuff had to be sold eventually at an knockdown price.  The farmers are not badly off.  Every Wednesday in my life I am in the Dublin Cattle Market. I attend the local fairs.  I have never seen a Deputy at either.  The Deputies do not know what is happening.  Let them come up to the Dublin market and see the thousands and thousands of pounds that are flowing into the pockets of the farmers to-day.  It is sound agricultural policy to grow oats and barley where there is a market for them.</P>
      <P>There has been much debate on wheat.  Is not the Minister's wheat policy a good one?  If there is an emergency give a good price to the farmers and they will grow wheat on good land.  Had we not more wheat per acre last year under the policy of the present Minister than we ever had under Fianna Fáil?  It is a waste of money to throw away good seed and good food by compulsory tillage.  No one wants compulsory tillage except the man who wants some other farmer's land for nothing.  I heard Deputy Killilea talking about compulsory tillage on some farm outside Tuam; so many acres were tilled during the emergency and yet that farmer had to go into Tuam and buy potatoes in competition with all the other buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was compulsory tillage at the time that farmer was going into Tuam to buy potatoes.  He set his land. That type of farmer is no good on the land.  The man who wants compulsory tillage is no good.  Nothing ever thrives under compulsion.  Any good hardworking <Col N="287" /> farmer will till if it is to his advantage to till.  We, in Westmeath, till a certain amount and we do not worry if we cannot get a market here. If we can get a market, well and good, but two years ago when we had a surplus of oats we had a crisis.  We hear talk from the opposite benches that last year we had not enough potatoes while the year before we had too much. No wonder you had not enough potatoes last year, because a curse came down on you for saying the previous year that there was too much. Every farmer of common-sense knows very well that one year you will have a surplus of a particular crop and the next year you may have a shortage and if you have a sound agricultural policy you will make some provision to retain portion of the surplus to make up the deficiency when there is a shortage.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil policy, as revealed in this debate, was centred in a personal attack on the Minister.  The previous Minister for Agriculture took six hours to make a personal attack on the Minister because he is jealous of him. I can say that we, the farmers, are proud of the Minister for Agriculture. He has provided us with plenty of stock on our farms.  He has given us medicine to treat our cattle and told us how to abolish some of the diseases in a way that Fianna Fáil never thought of.  The cattle of the country were rotten with mastitis but this Minister of common-sense has asked the farmers, not compelled them, to treat their heifers and to prevent mastitis and that policy is having very good results.  Yet we are listening to this constant moaning from the opposite benches.  The last speaker had to go up to the hills to see if he could find a poor farmer.  The farmers, I say, are reasonably well off and they recognise that they have to thank the Minister for quite a lot.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen made a reference to the question of root seeds.  I am very glad that the root seed scheme in operation during the time of the last Government was done away with.  We had a scheme to grow our own seeds, but what kind of seeds did we get?  In the case of turnips you had a bunch of leaves but no turnips, yet we had to pay 4/- to 5/-a <Col N="288" /> lb. and there was no proper competition amongst the merchants.  The Minister tells you that you can grow seeds without compulsion.  Why condemn that and give a monopoly to two or three firms at the expense of the farmers of the country?  We hear Opposition Deputies bewailing the Minister's policy in regard to eggs but they forget that the English Government, when our poultry industry had fallen to a very low level, had to arrange with the Fianna Fáil Government to subsidise our poultry industry. They gave them a couple of million in subsidies.  Because that couple of million is now exhausted and we are trying to live on our own resources we hear a lot about the price of eggs.  So far as barley is concerned, I do not know where barley can be got at the price Deputies opposite mentioned.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a brief reference to the question of water supplies for farms.  The scheme is a very good one, so far as it goes, but I understand that you will not get a grant to enable you to bring water for stock to your farm from an adjoining farm.  I think the grant should be extended so that a farmer could bring water from a neighbouring farm on to his own land for his stock.  That, I think, is even more necessary than bringing water into the farmer's kitchen.  I understand that you will not get a grant unless the water is actually brought into the farmer's house, and I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter so that a grant might be made available to farmers to bring water on to their land from a neighbouring river or a neighbouring farmer's land.</P>
    <P>To Fianna Fáil Deputies who are continually complaining, I would say that they should come up to the Dublin Cattle Market to see what is happening at 4.30 a.m.  Of course, they are too snug in their beds at that time and they do not see what is happening in the markets.  Let them come up there and they will see the amount of money that is changing hands.  I sold six head of cattle recently for a small farmer who has only nine acres at £59 each.  Does that not represent the fruits of a proper policy&mdash;to grow barley and other crops and walk them off the land in the form of live stock at <Col N="289" /> these high prices?  You could not have a sounder agricultural policy than that.</P>

      <P>Much as I dislike speaking in this House, I feel that there is a passage in the Minister's opening statement on this Estimate which I, as a Deputy representing the same constituency which the Minister represents, could not allow to pass unchallenged. The passage to which I refer appears in Volume 121, No. 13, page 1797.  The Minister speaking about oats said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo; In this I am beholden to Deputy Blaney and my distinguished colleague, Deputy Davern.  The acreage of oats was reduced from 880,000 in 1948 to 686,000 in 1949.  The yield fell from 792,000 in 1948 to 559,000 in 1949.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reason I refer to that is the Minister went on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That, I think, provided the text of my distinguished colleague from County Monaghan who delivered a moving speech on the distressing cost of oatmeal.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>By the way, I never mentioned oatmeal. The Minister went on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I hope Deputy Blaney and Deputy Davern listened closely to my distinguished colleague from Monaghan when she spoke so convincingly on the subject of the price of oatmeal.  They wrought well but to the great cost of our people.  I trust that when they next go to the palisades&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I suppose that is to the Amsterdam ditches&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;they will deal with something which is not so costly to the people of our country as the oat crop.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister in all sincerity does he really believe that statement?  Does he not know perfectly well as a Christian gentleman that that is not true?  Surely to goodness, he flatters us when he says that our powers of persuasion are so great that they can convince the farmers of County Monaghan, which I have the honour to represent with the Minister, that they should grow less oats to the extent that they had not sufficient oats <Col N="290" /> the following year?  Surely as Deputy Coburn, who is a very ardent admirer of the Minister says, the farmers of this country know their own business best themselves and they are masters in their own households.  Nobody can tell them what crop they should or should not grow.  They all know to a nicety what is the most profitable crop and that argument falls to the ground.</P>

      <P>The farmer knows his business best and knows what crops suit his system and his lands and he <Col N="291" /> knows what pays for itself and pays him and his family.  I would point out to the Minister that we have now a surplus of butter and yet we cannot get any over and above the ration unless we pay 10d. per lb. extra for it.  I always thought that if we had a surplus of anything that it became cheaper but that does not apply in the case of butter. I certainly refute the Minister's statement, on my own behalf and on behalf of the members of this Party, when he says that these schemes were upset by Fianna Fáil propaganda.</P>
      <P>Another thing I would like the Minister to say something on is the question of poultry.  Some Deputies in the House have criticised others for speaking on this matter of agriculture because they said that they knew nothing about agriculture.  I can assure the Minister that if it is necessary we will go to the country and discuss with the farmers every Department of State, criticising it when necessary and pointing out the advantages or disadvantages of each of the parties.  I have no fears on matters of that kind.  Deputies have stated that people with no working knowledge of the farms should not have the audacity to speak on these matters.  I am one who has never followed a plough but I have the audacity to speak here.  I can assure the Minister that the people of Monaghan, even amongst his own supporters, do not believe his statement that the Fianna Fáil propaganda had upset the oat crop and the sooner the Minister realises that the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the excellent programme which the Minister put forward many women went in for poultry production and spent a lot of money in providing the proper houses in the belief that with feeding stuffs available at the cheap prices, which the Minister said they would be available, they could go into poultry production profitably selling eggs at 2/6 a dozen.  Now that they have spent all that money they find that eggs at 2/6 per dozen do not pay because of the high price of feeding stuffs.  The Minister had promised that imported maize would not cost more than £1 per cwt.  I make no <Col N="292" /> apology for speaking on this Estimate because though I have never followed a plough or tilled the land I know the conditions under which these people live and work and particularly the way the small farmers of County Monaghan live and work.</P>
    <P>The land reclamation scheme is a good scheme and the Minister's allegations that Fianna Fáil propaganda had endeavoured to destroy it was just as untrue as his statement about the oats. It is an excellent scheme and should have every support.  The Minister, however, has carried out a scheme in Carrickmacross and some people who were not Fianna Fáil supporters had pointed out that the good work done was being undone because weeds had been allowed to grow in the drainage scheme.  I would like to ask the Minister, who is responsible for maintaining these drainage schemes after the work has been done?  Is it the duty of the Government to see that they are kept free of weeds and brush or is it the duty of the farmers?  All these things should be looked into at the time the work is being undertaken. Perhaps when the scheme is continued in County Louth the difficulties in the Carrickmacross view would be removed but the Minister should see to all these things before the weeds are allowed to grow and undo the work that has been done.  The land reclamation scheme is an excellent one and I hope the farmers will avail of it.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister saying that he has no reason to complain.  This is one of the most important Departments of State and the Estimate is one that should be very carefully and seriously debated from all aspects and from every angle. <Col N="293" /> I, like Deputy Mrs. Rice and the Deputy who spoke before her, am not a farmer nor have I any knowledge of farming but I am a fairly good judge of whether people are satisfied or dissatisfied and I have no apology to make for rising to express my opinions on these matters.  Speaking as a completely independent member of this House I am concerned with the anxiety that has been caused by Fianna Fáil talk of discontent which they say exists among the farming community to-day.  I can assure the House that 75 per cent. of the Irish farmers are behind the Minister to the last and that 20 per cent. are Fianna Fáil and because of the fact that they are Fianna Fáil they are grumbling and groaning simply because they are opposed to the Minister's political views but they are reaping the same benefits from the Minister's good policy as the other 75 per cent.  The remaining 5 per cent. are useless farmers who will grumble no matter who is in power.  The farmers were never better off than they are to-day. I ask any Deputy whether it be Deputies Friel, Corry, Commons, or Harris that if they stand outside the church will they see farmers arriving in horses and carts, ponies and traps or on bicycles?  They will not.  They will see them in Vauxhalls and Morris Minors and Oxfords.  You will no longer see the farmers going along in horses and carts for they all have their motor cars. Again if you look at the university registers you will find that 90 per cent. of the students are farmers' sons. Farmers are paying for them.</P>

      <P>Sons and daughters. They are sending them to the city and seeing that they get a sound university education.  Is it not also true to say that a large bulk of the clergy of various denominations to-day are the sons of farmers and that doctors, barristers and solicitors are coming from rural Ireland to-day?  Does that not show quite clearly that there is not the poverty and the bewailing in the humble homes of the farmers about which Deputy Davern was telling us to-day?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the past, the farmers were never as well off as they are to-day.  I have yet to meet the unfortunate citizen of whom Deputy Davern was talking who did not get meat from Christmas to Christmas. If Deputy Davern can show us such a citizen I assure that citizen that I will buy him a good beast so that he will have sufficient meat to keep him going for some time.  Furthermore, I am sure that if it is put to the Minister he also will throw in a beast for him, if there is such a man who had not meat for 12 months.</P>
      <P>This disgraceful performance which we have had from the Fianna Fáil Party is certainly damning that Party completely.  Probably it is a good thing for the Government and for the country that they are showing their hand to the extent to which they have shown it to-day.  Every member of that Party who has spoken on this Estimate has made more or less a personal attack on the Minister for Agriculture. I have found fault with the Minister for Agriculture but I say that never in the reign of Fianna Fáil had we a man to equal him and that the only Minister he could be compared with was the late Deputy Patrick Hogan.  I am glad and proud to say that, good and all as the late Deputy Hogan was, Deputy Dillon is equally good to-day, if not better.  We have heard quite a good deal of criticism from Deputy Smith.  The reason Deputy Smith has criticised the Minister for Agriculture is the reason which Deputy Fagan gave a few moments ago &mdash;jealousy.  He sees a man doing the job better than he could do it.  That is the very reason why he stands up in this House and indulges in abusive language towards the Minister and the Government for hours and hours.  Certainly those sorts of tactics will not improve the position of the Fianna Fáil Party but they will, I am very glad to say, strengthen and improve the position of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I desire to take this opportunity of expressing my views as briefly as I possibly can on the circumstances as <Col N="295" /> they exist to-day.  We have at the present moment under consideration&mdash; and, indeed, it has been before the House&mdash;a Bill which provides holidays for every agricultural worker.  That proves that the Minister for Agriculture is concerned not alone with the welfare of the farmer but that he is equally concerned to ensure that the man who stands behind the farmer's plough and ploughs from sunrise to nightfall with skill and industry&mdash;the farm worker&mdash;will receive consideration. Is that not a very fine thing?  It is something for us to be proud of that we are making an attempt to raise the farm worker and make him, in our opinion, as important a man as the farmer himself.  That is what we want to do: that is what we should do and that is exactly what we are doing. Where are Fianna Fáil now, after all the long years they were in office, that they could not give one moment's favourable consideration to the relieving of the farm worker&mdash;or the farm labourer, as he is called&mdash;and to giving him his week's or his fortnight's holidays or his day's holiday?</P>

      <P>A good deal has been said about machinery and a lot of unnecessary criticism has been hurled at the Government and the Department of Agriculture because the farmers have been advised to purchase and use machinery on the land.  It would be an extraordinary state of affairs if in some of our big worsted mills throughout the country we had not the machinery which we now have but, instead, men and women sitting working at spinningwheels. Where would we find ourselves then?  Why does Deputy Davern and those others who criticise the use of <Col N="296" /> machinery on the land not stand up and say: &ldquo;Get rid of the machinery in the factories and in our other large industries and let us go back to the spinning-wheel and its equivalent?&rdquo; Is it not mad to think that at this hour of our lives the farmers should be expected to be the most backward of any section of the community&mdash;that they must have their ploughs and be denied the use of tractors and that we should have criticism because they are advised to buy them?  Why should we want that to be the position while every other section of the community has advanced and while all other branches of industry have been completely modernised by up-to-date machinery?</P>
      <P>On every farm there should be the most up-to-date machinery so as to ease the slavery and drudgery that have been connected with work on the land for so long past.  It would be grand if every farmer, big and small, had his own machinery and if each farm were an independent unit.  It would be grand if he could have his own tractor, reaper and binder, mowing-machine and whatever other machinery is required on the farm.  I will go further.  When the rural electrification scheme is completed I shall be very glad to see that Government assistance will be provided so that every farmer will be able to have milking machines and the other facilities which electricity can bring, in order to make the farm attractive to the young people to remain on the land.  These things are very important and they should not be laughed at by the members of the Opposition.  Instead of being criticised by the Opposition the Minister and the Government should be the recipients of promises of support and co-operation in order to endeavour to help the farmer to modernise agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very sorry that the late Deputy William O'Donnell from Tipperary is not alive to-day and with us.  If he were, I believe there would be no man more proud than he to compliment the Government and the Minister on the water supply scheme.  In 1943 and 1944, when he was a member of this House, Deputy O'Donnell always urged for and longed to see the day when a scheme would be introduced whereby <Col N="297" /> clean water would be made available in the farm homesteads throughout the country.  We now have such a scheme in operation.  I have never heard one word of thanks coming from the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have never heard them say: &ldquo;This is a good scheme.  We will ask the people to avail of it.  We will say that if the Minister has done nothing else he has at least done that.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>A Deputy from the Opposition side of the House has just spoken.  He said that it is quite a ridiculous procedure for a Minister not to plan ahead.  I cannot see for the life of me how the Deputy who has just spoken and made that statement could say that the present Minister for Agriculture has not planned ahead. The farmers were told last year that they would get 62/6 per barrel; that is, 20 stones of the best quality wheat. They are told that this year they will get the same and they will also get the same in 1951 and 1952.  If that is not planning ahead, what is?  There is no use in having wild statements of that character made.  Plans have been made and the farmer who will grow wheat in 1952 knows at this moment that when he grows it, if God spares him, he will get 62/6 per barrel&mdash;if it is up to the required quality.  I think guarantees of that nature go a long way in making farmers secure and sound; in other words, farmers are not buying pigs in pokes.  Before they sow a crop they know what they will get for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard very serious criticisms because we have not compulsory wheat growing.  Fianna Fáil were always the Party very closely connected with compulsion from every angle.  It is with a great sigh of relief that a farmer can say: &ldquo;Thanks be to God I have my land and I can grow on it what I like and when I like and there is no compulsion.&rdquo;  It was a disgraceful state of affairs to have the type <Col N="298" /> of compulsion we experienced.  It would be disgraceful if we were to go back to the days of compulsion, when we had hordes of inspectors going around farmers' homesteads saying: &ldquo;You must sow this, and you must sow that.&rdquo;  The farmer has common sense and he is an intelligent man.  He will sow what will pay him, what he will get the best price for.  Every farmer should strongly curse the day that compulsion would return, and that from an office in Dublin dictation would be sent down to his homestead as to what he should sow or what he should not sow.</P>
    <P>I am one Deputy who represents a farming constituency and I hope I never shall see the day when we will have a return to the compulsory growing of wheat or any other crop.  Leave it to the farmer, help, advise assist him and pay him, and he will not make many mistakes.</P>
    <P>As well as the guaranteed price for wheat, we had 57/6 paid for malting barley.  There is no control on the 1950 crop.  I disagree with this, that whilst we had good quality malting barley at 57/6 a barrel, there were people in the districts of Vicarstown, Clonaslee and Kinnity, in my constituency, who were glad to sell their barley at 18/-and 19/- a barrel.  The details of such transactions were forwarded to the Minister.  Various concerns purchased the barley, which was deliberately left on the farmers' hands until such time as they had to get rid of it.  There are certain types of farmers who cannot afford to keep the barley and very serious consideration should be given to avoid a recurrence of this kind during the coming season.  It was a disgraceful state of affairs that in many parts of my constituency barley which I considered good and about which certain maltsters gave private advice to the farmers&mdash;that their barley was up to a high quality and was suitable for malting&mdash;was not taken at 57/6 and the farmers had to get it off their hands ultimately at 18/- and 19/-.  There should be some machinery in the Department to save the farmers from such dishonest transactions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that under his Department there exists a Local authorities allotment scheme whereby unemployed persons are provided by the local authority with an allotment, seed and manure, so that they can provide themselves with vegetables.  I want the Minister to see that the inspectors will make calls on various local authorities and even on the applicants who are tilling the allotments to see that the seed is of the standard quality, certified seed.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay a tribute to the Minister and to the Department and to the director in charge of the land rehabilitation project.  I am afraid Deputies and farmers are inclined to expect too much from this scheme in too short a time.  For that reason I would like to express an honest opinion, that this time 12 months, when we are here considering the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we will probably hear various complaints as to the administration of the scheme.  I should think that it will be anything from ten to 15 years in any part of the country before we can properly realise the value of this scheme.  For that reason I believe Deputies should not expect too much from the scheme but should give it every help and support and not, as has been done in the past, have the scheme sabotaged by the Opposition. The Fianna Fáil Party seem very sore when they hear this.  They have deliberately spread the doctrine among the farmers that if they avail of the scheme rent, rates and taxes will soar.  At a Fianna Fáil meeting in my constituency the farmers asked advice whether they should avail of the scheme and they were told that if they did avail of it their rates and taxes would go sky high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the returns furnished by the Department are concerned, we can see there has been a wonderful response <Col N="300" /> to the scheme, a response which the Department can barely cope with.  The response has been magnificent, but I maintain that it would have been far greater if there had been even a small measure of support and co-operation coming from the Opposition.  Probably one of the reasons why Deputy Smith is so jealous of the activities of the Minister for Agriculture is because almost 3,000 of his constituents made application and are endeavouring to avail of the scheme.  We can see that Deputy Smith's constituents have expressed approval of the Minister's scheme and desire to avail of it.  Out of the whole Twenty-Six Counties, Cavan comes third.</P>
    <P>I only hope and trust that this scheme, the purpose of which is to drain and make arable 4,500,000 acres, will be successful.  Does the Opposition realise what it will mean in this country if 4,500,000 acres of useless land are made useful?  We can fatten beef on it, using it for grazing purposes, or we can produce food from it.  The Government will considerably increase the wealth of the country, because the real wealth of any country lies in its soil When we have the 4,500,000 acres reclaimed it will result in increased production and increased exports.</P>
    <P>We are all very proud to see that the majority of the farmers have expressed approval of the scheme and desire to partake of its benefits.  I hope every effort will be made by the director and the Minister to see that, as far as possible, through every avenue, the machinery necessary for this scheme will be made available.  As Deputies realise a very large amount of machinery is required for this scheme. I hope that every effort will be made by the Department to see that that machinery is obtained so that this work may go on as speedily as possible.  It is the greatest scheme, in my opinion, that ever was introduced by any government, and the people throughout the country are 100 per cent. behind it.</P>
    <P>The statement has been made that if Fianna Fáil were in power to-day the agricultural industry would be on a better and a sounder footing.  I have yet to hear a Donegal or a Mayo Deputy say that, while during the <Col N="301" /> administration of Fianna Fáil and even up to a few years ago when the price of good quality black-faced wool was 4d. and 6d. a lb., to-day it is 3/6 a lb. I cannot see where things are not looking up for those people and where their conditions have not been improved. How can people grumble to-day?  They are getting 3/6 a lb. for their wool, while they could only get 4d. or 6d. a lb. when Fianna Fáil were in power. If people in those conditions are grumbling, my opinion about them is that they are not worth considering. We should not waste time talking about them in this House.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be well advised to review completely the butter situation.  In May, 1949, the butter ration was fixed at eight ounces.  There has been no increase since.  Quite an amount of butter has been exported. I believe that the butter ration could and should be increased.  I want to say, further, that I am disappointed the Department of Agriculture has not gone to greater rounds in having a &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; campaign started. I believe that for an agricultural country our consumption of milk is very low indeed.  This matter should be more seriously fostered by the Department, because I believe a &ldquo;drink more milk&rdquo; campaign would bring about very good results.  Everyone knows that milk is a source of great nourishment, especially to young people.  I do hope that steps will be taken to see that the drinking of milk will replace the drinking of beer or stout&mdash;difficult as that may be.  I think, however, that steps should be taken to make the drinking of milk more popular not because it is some thing that we can easily produce ourselves but because it must result in building up a sound and a healthy nation.  That is my main reason for advocating the drinking of more milk.</P>
    <P>We are also told that unrationed creamery butter is 3/6 a lb.  I think that is a daft price, and butter at 3/6 a lb. is far too dear.  The rationed butter is 2/8 a lb.  I realise the difficulties, but would it not be possible for the Minister and the Department to arrange that, instead of having unrationed creamery butter at 3/6 a lb. and rationed butter at 2/8, to have all <Col N="302" /> butter sold at 3/- a lb.?  I should like to know if the Department have ever gone into that question.  A difference of 6d. may seem very little, but if a person is buying four pounds of butter in the week, it means a saving of 2/-for the purchase of something else for the home.  The agricultural labourer, the cottage tenant, and the labouring man find that butter at 3/6 a lb. is far too dear.  I hope steps will be taken to see that a reduction is brought about in the price of unrationed creamery butter, and that, from the price point of view, the rationed and unrationed butter will be put on the same level, if possible.</P>
    <P>The people who rear turkeys are very much alarmed every year because of the fact that the Minister does not make a statement until 12 or 14 days before Christmas indicating whether the export of turkeys will be permitted or not.  I think that the people who rear turkeys should be given six or eight months' notice on that matter. We all remember that a few years ago great difficulties arose when the export of turkeys was not permitted.</P>

    <P>I feel very disappointed at the position with regard to beet.  I believe that we could produce more sugar and so would grow more beet if the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce would <Col N="303" /> say that we were going to import less sugar, and if they would see that our home requirements in sugar were provided here.  Recently, in the Dáil Restaurant I have noticed some sort of a dark, brown, sandy commodity placed in the sugar bowls, masquerading as sugar.  I consider it most disgusting. In my opinion it is not sugar.  For that reason, I think that, as far as possible, steps should be taken to increase our acreage under beet.  I might add, in passing, that one of the greatest disasters, as far as the sugar industry is concerned, was the decision of the Fianna Fáil Government to put a factory in an area where beet is not grown.</P>

My constituency is one of the best beet growing areas in the whole country, and the beet grown there has either to go to the Thurles or to the Tuam factory.  The farmers around Tuam will grow anything but beet.  I think steps should be taken to close down the Tuam beet factory.</P>

      <P>If we had a sugar factory in my constituency I have no hesitation in saying that the farmers there would be public-spirited enough to grow nothing else but beet.

That is the type of constituency evidently of which he is so proud and about which he boasts.  I hope the farmers in Tuam will realise that they have a duty to provide our people with sugar and to provide the unemployed <Col N="304" /> with work.  They will have to face up to that serious responsibility.  They will have to take their coats off and do now what they should have done, but did not do, under Fianna Fáil.</P>

I do not know whether they should close down the factory in Tuam.  It seems to be just one more white elephant as a result of the deplorable policy of Fianna Fáil.  If it is proposed to open another sugar factory the Department of Agriculture and the Industrial Development Authority will have to put their heads together and establish that industry in a beet-growing area.</P>
      <P>Criticism has been hurled at the Minister because of the bacon situation. During the administration of Fianna Fáil and for some short time afterwards our people had almost forgotten what bacon was like.  To-day there is plenty of bacon.  There are plenty of pigs going into the factories and plenty of farmers are getting good prices for their pigs.  There is not an Irish family to-day where they cannot have bacon and cabbage any day of the week they want it.  That was not possible in the past because of the mess the last Government made of the pig industry.  We have bacon now for our people.</P>

      <P>It does not matter so much what the price is so long as the bacon is there.  It was not there during the Fianna Fáil administration and for some short time after that. We have bacon now.  Deputy Killilea may fancy some nice back rashers of which the aristocrats are so fond but he must not forget the day when he had not even a pig's crúb.  Any man should be thankful now who has the pig's crúb which was not there during the Fianna Fáil régime.</P>

      <P>I would like to make a suggestion in connection with the veterinary section of the Department of Agriculture.  I understand that is to be shortly reorganised. I suggest that there should be a veterinary service available to the small farmers for their live stock&mdash;something on the same lines as the present dispensary service.  I suggest, too, that the Minister should get in touch with the Department of Social Welfare in order to provide some measure of relief for the farmer who will have to pay the contributions under the social services scheme for his workers and get nothing in return for them.  I think it would be appreciated by the farming community if the small farmers of £12 or £14 valuation were given free hospital treatment for themselves and their families under that scheme.  I do not think there would be any opposition to that scheme because no one would object to this section of our farming community getting some relief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely making a suggestion.  It is not legislation yet. When it is legislation, I hope the farming community will benefit under it. I am in agreement with Deputy Davern's complaint that the Agricultural Credit Corporation is not as generous as one would like it to be in granting loans to the agricultural community.  I know the Minister has no power over that particular body but I think there should be some machinery under which the farmer who needs a certain amount of capital to carry him on from the spring to the harvest could get that capital.  The Minister may tell me that the farmer can get it in the bank if he is any sort of farmer at all; he may suggest that the Deputy might put his name to a bill or go security for a farmer.  I have actually done that.  It may be a foolish thing to do, but it has certainly been appreciated by those for whom I did it.</P>
      <P>Many small farmers find themselves in an awkward position because of lack of capital for a short time.  I think some steps should be taken to accommodate such small farmers.  A man who wants £100 or £150 has his own reasons for not approaching the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Indeed, he will not get the accommodation there because the very first question on the form is: &ldquo;How much money have you in the bank?&rdquo; That seems a very ridiculous question to ask of a man who is actually looking for a loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very glad that so many people are availing themselves of the facilities that have been placed at their disposal for soil testing, and I am glad to know that there has been an increase in the number of inquiries and in the number of samples sent in.  I am glad that our people are taking advantage of the soil testing facilities and I hope that the spirit of co-operation that prevails between organisations like the Young Farmers' Clubs and the Department of Agriculture will continue.  The lectures that have been organised in various parts of rural Ireland have been very helpful and have given very great information to the farming community that they would not have obtained <Col N="307" /> otherwise.  I am also very glad to know that there have been film shows and broadcasts on agricultural subjects. The manner in which farmers avail of the radio talks on agricultural subjects which are given every Wednesday evening for half an hour or quarter of an hour is amazing.  I believe that these talks should be given more frequently, perhaps on two or three evenings a week, and I would respectfully suggest that the Minister should make inquiries with a view to having additional time made available by Radio Eireann for these talks and lectures.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not here as I wanted to make an inquiry as to whether it is the usual procedure when a farmer brings milk to a creamery that the scales on which the milk is weighed are not made available to the farmer for inspection.  I have been told&mdash;I have not checked up on it to ascertain whether it is true or not &mdash;that in a number of creameries the milk is weighed and measured and that the farmer will get a docket but he will not be allowed to witness the transaction between the creamery manager and the creamery staff in regard to the measuring and weighing of the milk.  I consider that a very serious state of affairs.  I have every reason to believe that the representations which have been made to me are true because I have been given an assurance by a number of farmers who bring milk to a particular creamery that information as to the amount of milk and the weight of the milk is not made available to them in person at the creamery but that they are notified afterwards.  When a protest was made they were told that they could bring their milk elsewhere if they were not satisfied with the manner in which it was received.  I hope that inquiries will be made into that and, since the Minister is not in the House at present, that the officials of the Department will take note of it and see to it that the farmers will be informed with the least possible delay of the amount and weight of the milk so that they can see if it is correct.  In conclusion, may I say that we are very pleased to find that the farming community are so contented to-day.  We hope that the <Col N="308" /> Minister will live long to see the results of the policy which he is now operating and that he will be able to surmount the difficulties placed before him by the narrow-minded jealousy that exists in the ranks of the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to many of the speeches in this debate from both sides of the House.  I was not here all the time when the Minister made his opening statement but I read it in the Official Report.  The speakers from the Government side took great pride in the prosperity that exists in agriculture to-day and the Minister credits himself with it.  We are told that agriculture has enjoyed that prosperity only since the change of Government in 1948 and that it is due to the policy of the present Minister. The Minister in his statement referred to the late Paddy Hogan and repeated a phrase that we heard in the old days. He said that his policy could be epitomised in the phrase.  &ldquo;One more cow, one more sow and another acre under the plough.&rdquo;  I understood from the Minister that his idea is to stick closely to the agricultural policy pursued during the late Mr. Hogan's period of office from 1922 until 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not give this Minister credit for such prosperity as agriculture enjoys, and I would say that it is not as much as agriculture should have or might have.  I would further say that the Minister is not taking advantage of this prosperous period to put agriculture on a sound, permanent basis, to put it into a position in which we should be able to meet any depression which may come.  Deputy Commons, speaking here to-day, whilst prepared to give the Minister all credit for the price of agricultural produce to-day, fears that this is only just a temporary phase and that it will not last.  He said the crash will come some day.  The Minister stands for the same policy that was operated here from 1922 to 1932.  He happens to be in office at a period when there is a scarcity of agricultural produce and prices are very high.  I do not give him the credit nor is he entitled to the credit that the supporters of the Government claim for him because the prices of agricultural <Col N="309" /> products are so high.  If we go back and examine the effects of this policy during the period from 1922 to 1932 we will find that agricultural prices were declining the world over and the British farmer was in as bad a position as we are here to-day.  Agricultural produce, butter, bacon, eggs, frozen meat and lamb from New Zealand and the world over were being dumped into the British market.  The late Mr. Hogan's policy at that time was the policy which the present Minister pursues now.  I do not blame Mr. Hogan because he was carrying out a policy that could not at the time bring prosperity to our people here.</P>
    <P>He gave the same advice as the present Minister for Agriculture has given now when he advised the farmers who were then only getting 10/- a barrel for their oats to walk them off the lands on the hoof.  We know what the position was of the milk-producing industry at that time; that the price of milk went down from 9d. or 10d. a gallon to 3d. a gallon.  The policy was the same at that time as that which our present Minister for Agriculture is now pursuing. Mr. Hogan was unlucky in his period of office.</P>
    <P>We did not have a Minister for Agriculture previous to 1922 but in the years prior to 1922, as a result of the 1914-18 war, even though our relations with England were not good, the farmers at that time were enjoying an era of prosperity.  You found then, as Deputy Flanagan says is the case to-day, that they also had their motor cars, but when the collapse in prices came along the motor cars disappeared very quickly and in that period I remember we had in my own and in every other county agricultural workers organised. During the prosperity era prior to 1922 the workers, through their organisation, got improved conditions and bettered their position.  We had trade union branches in every town and village, and I am not opposed to organisation of the workers.  The trade union leaders came down from the City of Dublin and told those workers that they would get them their demands and they found no difficulty in getting their demands met because of the fact that the farmers were enjoying a period of agricultural prosperity.  But, as I said, the collapse came and the motor cars <Col N="310" /> disappeared, the trade union organisations melted away because the workers were unemployed and the wages of agricultural workers collapsed completely.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil came into power in 1932 the first thing that that Government did was to stabilise the price of butter and to keep the milk producers in the dairying areas in business.  Wheat growing was advocated then, as was the development of the home market, and its importance was stressed on all occasions by Fianna Fáil.  This was followed by a campaign against the growing of wheat based on the allegation that the land of the country was not suited to wheat growing.  That campaign was carried on all over the country to such an extent that many farmers thought that wheat growing was injurious to their soil and would impoverish their land.  They were encouraged in every possible way in that belief.  That was in the early years of the wheat scheme which, we were told, was a very foolish scheme.</P>
    <P>I am not going to repeat here the statements made in this House and outside of it by the present Minister for Agriculture on the growing of wheat. When the world war came along there were many farmers who were prejudiced against the growing of wheat and I think there is not any member on the present Government Benches who could take a greater responsibility for that attitude on the part of the farmers than the present Minister for Agriculture. If it had not been for that campaign I believe that compulsory wheat growing and even perhaps compulsory tillage, might never have been necessary. There is not, I believe, anyone on this side of the House or indeed any part of the House who would be anxious to interfere with anybody in the manner in which they conduct their business.  We in Fianna Fáil had no wish to interfere with the farmer believing that the farmer knew best what to do with his own land.  Unfortunately, however, there was a considerable section of landowners in this country who did not consider the interests of the nation in the way they ran their land. At that particular time it became necessary to introduce compulsory <Col N="311" /> wheat growing and indicate the lands on which it was to be grown.  That step was rendered necessary by the campaign of the present Minister for Agriculture.  In fact at that time advertisements were put in the papers by people letting land on the conacre system and they made the stipulation that wheat was not to be grown on it by the person who purchased it at the action.  The Government of Fianna Fáil at the time had then to counteract that position.  They had to make an Order and to give authority to the Department to go in and select land suitable for wheat growing.  In the circumstances, in the interests of the country and the community, they could do nothing else.</P>
    <P>I admit that the prices for agricultural produce have increased recently. Store and fat cattle were never bringing better prices than at the present time, but I think that the Minister is not taking advantage of the present situation to do what could be done for agriculture.  In going through the country I notice that a lot of our pasture land is poor and not producing to the maximum.  In many cases our tillage crops could give a better yield. I am, however, referring particularly to pasture and meadow lands.  I, like all others, got a little map from the Minister dealing with the rehabilitation scheme and I notice the force with which he stresses that where there are weeds he will take them away and put the land in good condition.  On a farm of 50 or 60 acres, according to the Minister, that 50 or 60 acres of land which is arable land is not producing anything like its maximum.  I know what sensible farmers would like to do &mdash;and most farmers are intelligent and sensible&mdash;if they could get the money from the Minister in that case.  He will provide them with, maybe, £100 or £150, or whatever it may be, towards the reclamation of those ten or 12 acres and it may be added on to the annuity.  Deputy Flanagan stated that he has not too much confidence in that scheme either.  He heard the farmers talk about it down the country.  He heard them say that it would be a number of years before they would get <Col N="312" /> anything out of it, if at all, in many cases.  Deputy Flanagan is in close touch with the farmers and he has heard something.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the Minister wants to get results he should reduce the price of artificial manures so that all the land that is not producing up to its maximum could be given a good dressing of manure.  We do not need all this analysis and soil testing to know that the land of this country is deficient in phosphates, potash and nitrogen.  The farmer considers that the price of artificial manures is too high.  He buys them and applies them to his land, as he is advised to do by the Department of Agriculture, but he gets very little extra profit on the cost of these manures and he is not inclined to use as much of them as would be good for the land.  If the Minister would reduce the price of artificial manures the farmers would be encouraged to apply them to the arable land that is not up to its maximum production capacity and we would in that way get better results quicker. We would have a big improvement in our live stock and they would mature earlier.  There would not be such a demand for lettings under the 11-month system, to which Deputy Commons referred. Less land would be required to carry the farmers' stock and in that way more land would be available for tillage.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about and comparisons made between the years 1946 and 1947 and the years 1948 and 1949.  We all know that in 1946 we had a desperately bad harvest and that it was very difficult to save it. The people from the towns and cities had to go out to the farmers' assistance. They realised then how much their country depended on agriculture. In 1947, after the bad year of 1946, the yields were low.  The yields of hay and oats and fodder of all descriptions for cattle were very low.  A very severe winter came and a large number of the young stock in the country died.  I saw through the country wheaten straw that was left over in the ricks become as valuable as first-class ryegrass would be in an ordinary year, to keep the life in the cattle.  Last year many farmers in this country <Col N="313" /> were perturbed because they were not in a position to face a severe winter. The stocks of hay in the haggards were very low and we had no oats, and the potato crop was a failure.  If it had not been for the mild winter large numbers of our live stock would have died.  They survived because it was a mild winter and not because of anything the Minister for Agriculture did. If you go to the fairs in the country this year you can still see the results in the cattle.  They are poor, thin and not as advanced as well-wintered cattle would be.  It will probably take them a year or more to reach maturity and that is not good for our farmers.</P>
    <P>We have also heard complaints in this House to the effect that our meadows are very light and that there will be a scarcity of hay this year.  That scarcity can be attributed to the fact that the farmers were not able to keep their meadows&mdash;that they had to let the cattle out on them so that they could exist.  I say that in order to try to convince the Minister of the importance of this matter.  I am not asking him to drop his land project but I would say that the one thing which he could do for agriculture, and which would be a far better project at the moment, would be to enable the farmers to secure artificial manures at a cheap rate.  It would give him something to start off with and we would see the results in a year or two.  It would pay the nation well to provide that type of manure at a cheap rate.  We would see the results in earlier maturity in our cattle.  People would then realise that they have land available for tillage&mdash; that they would not need all the land for the bullocks to roam over, as is the case at present.  Many people who have been dependent on foreign supplies would then realise that we can carry more cattle on less land and that we have more land available for tillage.</P>
    <P>I also suggest that it would be well for the Minister, if he has American money available, to give cheaper grass seeds to the farmers.  Some of the old pastures require to be renewed.  If the Minister were to follow a policy of that kind the time would come when all our land would be producing to its maximum capacity.  It would then be <Col N="314" /> all right to drain that bit of bad land that the Minister is going after now and it would then be an advantage.  The Minister should do something to make amends for the statements he made in the past in regard to beet and wheat. Slowly but surely the farmers are beginning to realise that he was wrong and that he set them astray in regard to these matters.  Immediately after the change of Government took place, the farmers in my constituency dropped the growing of wheat and turned to oats.  They had a big surplus of oats the following year and they were not able to get a market.  Last year people who stuck on to oats found that oats failed where wheat succeeded.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that, despite the Minister's views about wheat, the farmers in Kildare have come round to the growing of it.  We have heard a lot about four or five barrels from land that is not suitable for wheat.  Every good farmer can grow wheat.  The man who keeps good cattle and looks after them well is the type of man who will grow wheat properly.  We hear about the good yield of wheat from a smaller acreage.  When a man is asked to do anything against his will, he will not do it well.  I have known cases in my constituency where, under the compulsory tillage Order, landowners who had very good land sowed wheat anyway they could and did not pay attention to it.  Instead of converting the straw into manure, when they had it threshed, they put a match to it and burned it.  That is not good farming.</P>
    <P>We still have the same policy; we are back to the policy that was here before the British were put out of the country ; we are back to the policy that was in operation from 1922 till 1932, as far as the Minister can take the country back to it.  I believe the people are coming to realise that the policy of Fianna Fáil to provide for our own people and to rely on themselves is the best policy.  Of course, we are not opposed to taking advantage of the British market.  Sell as much as you can to the British.  Store cattle and fat cattle are now the most saleable things we have on the British market. The Minister did not go much out of his way to help the farmers to produce butter, store or fat cattle <Col N="315" /> He tells the farmers to keep one more sow and one more cow and till one more acre.  I see some farmers with a lot of calves.  Almost every farmer is now gone mad on rearing calves and that applies particularly to the butter-making areas.  There is no market for the butter.  The Minister took away the subsidy from the home-produced butter and the industry collapsed.  I am told that in parts of the country it is selling at 1/6 per lb.  Many farmers ask: &ldquo;Why should we bother about making butter if that is the price?&rdquo; It would be better to give the milk to calves.  They will go to the fairs and give £9 or £10 for calves.</P>

It is uneconomic at the moment, but they have to do it; there is no other way out of it.  The Minister could do a lot for agriculture.  It is not enough for him to sit there and beam and smile and put out his chest when he hears the praise he gets for the present prosperity of the farmers.</P>

      <P>I am just beginning to wonder if people, and particularly Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side of the House, are not underestimating the farmer's intelligence.  Do Deputies on the far side of the House not realise that the farmer is at least as intelligent an individual as any other section of the community?  Do they not realise at this hour of the day that there is very little necessity, absolutely no need, I might say, to prod and push and advise and coerce and compel the farmer to do things he does not want to do? That type of thing was carried on by Fianna Fáil during the emergency years.  I seriously objected, and still object, to anything in the nature of compulsion.  It was never helpful, especially as regards tillage, as it was carried on during the emergency.  I believe the Irishman has certain characteristics and these are more apparent day after day.  It is an old saying and a true one, that you can lead an Irishman but you cannot drive <Col N="316" /> him.  If you attempt to drive him, to tell him what to do, you make little of his intelligence.</P>
      <P>I think our present Minister has adopted the right approach to agricultural economy.  I think by persuasion and inducement and sound advice he will get the farmers to engage in their pursuits with more enthusiasm.  If facts mean anything to us, if figures can prove anything, then there can be no doubt that the agricultural industry has been revived.  The Minister has produced to us a list of figures showing the comparative prices of agricultural produce over a number of years.</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBernieJnr" hpid="Mr. Beirne Mr. Beirne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beirne</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the tactics adopted by our present Minister. By inducement, encouragement and advice he has led the farmers in the proper direction.  Farming is a difficult occupation.  The agricultural industry is open to various adverse considerations, such as climatic conditions and market fluctuations.  So far as our rates are concerned, we cannot be masters of our own affairs.  We are out to export as much surplus produce as we can afford at the best prices we can get.  We are not in the happy and enviable position of being the only country that can supply agricultural produce to other countries.  We have to meet world competition and unless we have good surplus produce we need not look for markets.</P>
      <P>Some people may criticise the Minister and ask why he did not get this or that for our surplus produce.  The Minister has done very well.  He has to compete against rivals in the British market and to get an equitable price for our produce.  He had not the ball at his feet, when he could demand what he liked and say: &ldquo;I will not sell if I do get so and so.&rdquo;  He had to screw from Great Britain the best price he could.  A great amount of credit is due to him for securing the good prices that he did secure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agricultural industry has many phases.  You have the dairying industry and the industries which are complementary to it, such as poultry and pig rearing.  As regards the Minister's <Col N="317" /> statement, if you examine it you will find in those spheres of agriculture such as dairying and poultry and pig feeding, that production has shown a great increase.  Egg exports for the first three months of 1947 were worth £750,000.  In the first three months of 1950 our exports amounted to £2,500,000.  Somebody must have been responsible for that big increase.  I suggest it was due to the encouragement given by the Minister for Agriculture to our poultry rearers that that colossal figure of £2,500,000 was reached.  In the first three months of 1947 our cattle exports were in the neighbourhood of £3,000,000, while in the first three months of this year their value was £5,725,000.  I say that the Minister for Agriculture has been wholly responsible for that welcome change.  Butter production has gone up in a very marked degree.  In the first three months of 1947, the figure was 36,000 cwts., while in the first three months of this year it was 90,000 cwts.  If facts and figures mean anything, then surely those figure must convince any intelligent member of the House that the agricultural industry is improving day by day.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a prejudice on the opposite side of the House against the sending of cattle to Britain.  If we are able to meet our own requirements, I do not see what else we can do with our surplus stock except to send it to Britain.  It is the most convenient and best market that we have.  I think it is a wise thing to do.  During the economic war, an attempt was made here to carry on a trade with other countries.  I remember we sent a consignment of meat to Spain and in return for it we got oranges, about 50 per cent. of which could not be used. They were rotten.  That was a bad commercial proposition.</P>
    <P>It has been said here that the Minister is hostile to the growing of wheat and to tillage.  As far as I know, he has never compelled anyone to till and has never objected to anyone who wants to go in for tillage.  In fact, he has encouraged people to do so.  I remember during the 1948 election seeing a poster&mdash;I rather admired it&mdash; which stated &ldquo;less tillage and more food&rdquo;.  I quite agree with that.  When <Col N="318" /> we were compelled to till three-eighths of our arable land during the emergency, we were not able to cope with it.  As a matter of fact, the tillage was done in a rough-shod and happygo-lucky way.  If, instead, we had been compelled to till only one-eighth I believe much more food would have been produced.  As regards imported versus home produced foods, I stand for the home produced food, as far as we can possibly do that, but I would say that if we are to make a success of our agricultural industry a little of the imported stuff is necessary.  There is no feeding stuff that we can raise or that will give better results than maize.  At the moment, we have no control over its import.  Due to devalution and to the closing down of exports from the Argentine there is only the one market in which we can get it, and that is the United States.  We are confined to the one market for it and have to pay the price, and there is no more about it.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy referred to home-made butter.  He said there was a market for it and that it should be subsidised. Now, I want to say that I am convinced that the day for the sale of it is at an end, and has been for a considerable time.  I am sorry to have to say that.  Personally, I would prefer it to creamery butter, but I think if inquiries were made it would be found that I am one in a thousand.  The people have gone away from home-made butter and will not buy it at any price.  I come from a rural area and I know what is happening.  I handled it in my time in business, and I know that home-made butter will not be purchased in the shops at any price.</P>

      <P>Even in Wexford.  The people have gone away from home-made butter and will purchase the creamery butter in preference to it.  In these circumstances I do not think it would be right to compel people to buy it and use it.  With regard to suggestions for credit facilities for farmers, made in the course of this debate, I am of opinion that they should receive favourable consideration from the Minister. There are farmers who through <Col N="319" /> no fault of their own meet with losses in stock and in their crops, due to weather conditions or other causes, and who, as a result, find themselves in straitened circumstances at certain times.  I know the difficulties that are often raised by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in regard to granting loans to such farmers.  The banks have closed down in the granting of loans to farmers.  In that situation, there should be some co-operation between the Minister's Department and the Agricultural Credit Corporation under which loans would be granted in genuine cases where an investigation showed that the farmer's position was brought about through no fault of his own, but through a loss of stock or crops.</P>
      <P>The use of machinery versus the horse has been talked of a good deal here.  The Minister favours the use of machinery, but he has not advised anyone to shoot his horse.  The farmers of the country are free men, and they can do just as they like in their farming operations, and use machinery or a horse.  There is no compulsion.  The Minister's slant for the use of machinery means that it would be more adaptable on large farms, but as regards the small uneconomic holdings in the West of Ireland the horse will, I think, always be used for farming operations.  I do not think the Minister has ever suggested that tractors should be used on a ten-acre holding.  The horse is bound to survive, and the Minister is not hostile to any farmer keeping a horse for his tillage operations or other purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the rehabilitation scheme, I think it is a very desirable and a very good scheme.  If it is the Minister's intention to reclaim and put into production 4,500,000 acres of land, then I wish him all the success in the world.  The scheme is a tremendous one and its effects will be very far-reaching.  In my county we only came within the scope of the scheme last January.  Naturally, we have had no results yet.  I think some steps should be taken to expedite it.  There are people who made application for inspection last January but so far no inspection has been carried out.  The <Col N="320" /> delay is causing a certain amount of uneasiness.  At the present time some drainage could be done very easily because the people are between seasons, the turf season and the hay season.  I admire the method in which the Minister is implementing the scheme.  Rotation in application means that there is no overlapping of officials. Had the Minister applied the scheme in all counties simultaneously, an enormous increase in staff would have been necessary and money would have been eaten up in administration.</P>
    <P>I suggest there should be some co-operation between the Department of Agriculture, the Board of Works section of the Department of Finance, the Department of Local Government and the Department of Education.  Collaboration is necessary to make a success of our agricultural policy.  The Minister should keep in close touch with the Board of Works section of the Department of Finance.  More attention should be paid to the repair of roads leading to isolated farm-houses. At the present time it is impossible to bring machinery into these farmhouses.  Small drainage works carried out now would help to make the land reclamation project a success.</P>
    <P>A very important piece of legislation was passed here last year.  I refer to the Local Authority (Works) Act. There are certain provisions of that which could be utilised to the advantage of the agricultural industry. Indeed, this Act might be said to be complementary to agriculture as a whole.  The Minister should get in touch with the Department of Local Government in the implementation of this Act in order to carry out its prosions to the best advantage as regards the drainage of land.</P>
    <P>As far as education is concerned, I think the text books in the primary schools in rural areas should have a distinct agricultural bias in order to give the children some kind of agricultural foundation in the career the majority of them will subsequently follow.  They could be given some preliminary education on agricultural matters such as seeds, fertilisers and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan referred to the price of wool.  In my constituency I <Col N="321" /> sold wool recently for 4/2 per lb. Deputy Flanagan mentioned a figure of 3/6.  Never before in the history of this country did wool reach anything like 4/2 per lb.  The same is true of poultry, pigs, cattle and agricultural produce generally.  Sucking calves, a month old, are fetching £15 and £16 apiece.  Live stock at the present time has increased by 50 per cent. in valuation. over and above what it was in 1947.  Surely that is concrete evidence that the agricultural industry is a profitable one at the present time.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Minister and his Department.  The Minister, to satisfy Deputy Lahiffe, sent an inspector down to Galway to find out what the position was with regard to barley.  The Minister is quite prepared to do that for any Deputy.  The Minister is accessible at all times.  He invites criticism; he invites correspondence; he invites people to his office and he invites Deputies to give him the facts.  He is most accommodating.  The same is true of his staff.  Unless we are people who are perpetually grousing, there is no reason why we should have a word to say against the Minister at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder was anybody listening to Deputy Flanagan fooled for one moment by the line he took.  This House is used to irresponsible statements by Deputy Flanagan.  Listening to his praise of the Minister and his vilification of Deputy Smith this afternoon, one would almost be inclined to forget that Deputy Flanagan is the &ldquo;kept&rdquo; Deputy of the Minister for Agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan accused Deputy Smith of being a disappointed man and of attacking the Minister because of his disappointment, but he carefully refrained from telling the House that he had a card to play in this debate. He carefully refrained from telling the House that, if anyone supported the Minister, he and he alone should uphold him because during the last three weeks the Minister for Agriculture has tried to uphold Deputy Flanagan by having him appointed as a Parliamentary Secretary; and, only for the intervention of the Minister for External Affairs.  the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="322" /> would have got away with it.  Why should not Deputy Flanagan extol the virtues of the Minister for Agriculture from the housetops?  Deputy Flanagan wil reap his reward in due course.  I think his statement in this matter, particularly in regard to agricultural policy, should be judged by some of the fantastic similes he gave to the House this afternoon.  I wonder how many farmer Deputies, including the Deputy who spoke last, will agree with Deputy Flanagan's statement that farmers are rolling up to the churches in their Vauxhalls, their Cadillacs and their Rolls Royce cars?  I wonder is that a true picture of farmers' conditions, particularly in the West of Ireland?  I think if the rest of Deputy Flanagan's argument as regards the position of the farmers is of equal value, the House and the country will be able to judge whether Deputy Flanagan's approach to this matter is real or whether he is more intent on currying favour with his political patron, the Minister for Agriculture.</P>

      <P>I was saying that this picture of the agricultural community driving around in expensive cars is a typical indication of the value we should place on Deputy Flanagan's estimate of the rural community and their economic position at the present time.  Everybody knows, particularly every member of the farming community, that the official policy, since the present Minister became Minister, has turned this country into a large grazing ranch for the purpose of producing cheaper food for our neighbours across in England.  Everybody knows that the Minister deliberately set himself out to foist that policy on the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that <Col N="323" /> as a result of that policy, the small farmers have suffered very grievously since the present Minister got control. There is no comparison between the position some years ago of the small farmer in the west, who was relying on cash crops and on the other sidelines in which he was traditionally interested, and his position now.  The Minister starting with his trade agreement in 1948 deliberately set out to cater for the rancher of this country. The Minister has continued, without abating his zeal in any way, in that particular line.  Every official indication that the country has got from the Minister is that he intends to proceed further along that line.  I think the disastrous results of that policy will be forcibly brought home to the farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country, particularly if this country is faced with a war, in the near future.  We all know what the Minister thinks of tillage and what he thinks of prices as an indication of what the farmer produces.  The Minister does not believe in increasing prices for farmers.  He never believed in raising prices of agricultural produce as an inducement for the farmer to produce more.  The Minister has so often referred in this House and throughout the country to that matter that by this time nobody should have any illusions as to his views.  He does not believe in giving more for beet in order that we might produce more sugar.  He prefers to go to Formosa for it.  He does not believe in giving more for wheat to encourage the farmer to produce more wheat.  He prefers to get it elsewhere.  He does not believe in increasing prices for any of the essential commodities that comprise the vital necessities of this community. It was not to-day or yesterday that he adopted that policy because he went on the records of this House away back in June, 1947, as reported in column 2052 of the Official Debates of that date, as saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;However, I want to say particularly to Deputies on the Farmers' benches: Do not become obsessed with price; price does not matter a row of pins.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> Even the present Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Donnellan, could not swallow that because in those days, before he swam into the Coalition, he had something to say about the farming community.  Deputy Donnellan stated at that time:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Oh, bedad, it does.  Of all the mistatements you ever made that is the biggest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The report goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Dillon: Is it not funny that you cannot get that into the farmers' heads&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Donnellan: That is the limit. We will give them the stuff for nothing.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon: Is it not humiliating to have a group who profess to represent the farmers of this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Mr. Donnellan: I wish they were listening to you.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon:&mdash;&mdash; who cannot see that and who have led them from one folly to another?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that everywhere the present Minister has presumed to lay down his policy in this country; even in the teeth of the opposition of Clann na Talmhan in this House, he has insisted that prices of any particular commodity do not matter one row of pins.  He is following the very same lines to-day.  The Minister much prefers to buy oats at three times the price from the Argentinian or anybody else, than to give an inducement by way of an increase in price to the farmers here at home to produce oats.  I suggest to the Minister that he should throw his personal prejudices against tillage overboard and interest himself in the Irish nation so that we shall get back at least some of the tillage that we had before the Minister's disastrous advent to the control of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>There are a few matters which I should like to bring to the notice of the Department which I think are deserving of some attention from him. I shall refer very briefly to a few matters which are agitating the minds of the small rural communities that I represent here.  Recently in the West <Col N="325" /> of Ireland the valuations of lime kilns belonging to farmers have been increased. A valuation of £25 was put on some of these lime kilns.  I have personal knowledge of the case of one man whose holding is valued for exactly 50s.  He erected a lime kiln for the purpose of producing lime and he now finds that the Commissioners of Valuation have imposed a valuation of £25 on that lime kiln.  Of course, the only thing left for that man to do is to pull down the lime kiln.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moran</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to infringe the rules of debate in any way but we shall put it in this way, that if the Minister is sincere in his efforts to get farmers to produce lime some special scheme will have to be devised rather than asking the small tenant farmer to produce lime under present conditions. It would be disastrous at the present time for the small farmers to attempt produce lime on their own lands.  I say that, for whatever reason there may be, the Minister should take a hand in this case and should do something to stop the absurd position we have at the present time so far as lime is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement was very chary about giving information to the House as to how far he had gone with the agreement with Britain.  The Minister has informed the House that he was very hopeful about the future of the bacon industry and pig production and that the factories <Col N="326" /> in this country and the ships operating between this country and Great Britain would not be able to take all the bacon that is to be produced.  I assume the Minister has some basis for that statement and that it has been based on whatever negotiations have been going on between his Department and its opposite number in Great Britain.  I think, however, the Minister might go a little bit further and inform the House how far he has got with the agreement and what are his reasons for making these, I do not want to say flamboyant statements, but certainly statements which the people of the country will be very chary in accepting.</P>
    <P>There may be reasons why we are not prepared to accept the Minister's word on these matters.  We had the Minister's announcements on the price of maize; that it would not pass £1 per cwt., and the people who fell for that yarn are now finding that they have to pay as much as 29/- a cwt.  Therefore, when I read these pronouncements of the Minister in connection with the bacon industry and the allegations that Irish ships will be so overloaded with bacon and bacon products that they will not be able to carry them all, I am inclined to be very chary and the country is inclined to be doubtful.  I would like the Minister to give the House and the country some indication as to what he bases his prophecies on in this matter because we do not want to be in the same position in accepting these statements on bacon as we were in the case of maize.</P>
    <P>Another matter of great interest to the people concerned throughout the country and indeed to the poultry producers and egg producers is what is going to be the future of Eggsports, Ltd.  We know that points rationing came to an end in Great Britain and presumably the people in this country and Britain will be free to trade as between trader and trader.  People are asking then what is going to be the function of Eggsports, Ltd., and if it is going to be wiped out.  During the period of rationing Eggsports dealt with its counterpart in Britain, the Ministry of Food, in the handling of bulk exports of eggs.  That period now seems to have passed and we expect <Col N="327" /> some official announcement to be made about the position of Eggsports.  It would appear that the Minister, so far as this organisation is concerned, is not prepared to give much information to the House and the country in this matter.  At all events the people, and particularly the traders of the country, feel that when points rationing is abolished there is no further use for an organisation of this type and that the quicker it is removed the better so that the people can resume again the traditional trade that went on between the two countries.</P>
    <P>The Minister no doubt will be able, or at least will attempt, to justify the recent position in the matter of eggs. He made a good attempt at convincing the Irish countrywoman that 2/6 a dozen was a better price for eggs than 3/- a dozen no doubt he will make just as successful an attempt to convince her that 2/- a dozen is a better price than 2/6 a dozen.  I have no doubt whatever that the Minister will try to put that over on the people notwithstanding the fact that the price of feeding stuffs has increased by 50 per cent. in the meantime.  I believe that the Minister will, by fixing these prices, cripple egg production in this country so far, particularly, as the smaller farmers throughout the West of Ireland are concerned.</P>
    <P>If there is any one thing more than another that will put any farmer out of a particular line of business or production it is the fact that he has been &ldquo;had&rdquo;.  When a farmer feels that he has been tricked and has left a particular line of production for that reason it will always be very difficult to get him back on to that line of production again.  We had the farmers and the producers of eggs guaranteed a market and prices for eggs.  It was published, and promised, that the more eggs they produced the greater the price would be.  We had the rush from 3/- to 2/6, and now it is from 2/6 to 2/-. How does the Minister expect that the farmers will fall for that?  Does he not realise that, after all this guarantees, the farmers will be disgusted with the official policy?  Does the Minister not know that if he wants to increase egg production, particularly in view of the <Col N="328" /> increase in the price of feeding stuffs, which are essential to successful egg and poultry production, he must obtain an economic price and that the producers will not be prepared to produce at an uneconomic price?  I am afraid that the Minister is now committed&mdash;as a matter of fact, I am sure of it&mdash;to this price and is tied solely to the one market in respect of eggs; there is, therefore, no way out for the small egg producer, especially in the West of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if it is true&mdash;it certainly is common gossip in the trade and it was remoured within the past fortnight&mdash;that there was an inquiry within the past 12 days from the Contient in regard to export of eggs at approximately 6d. a dozen more than the Minister's bargain and that the price would be paid in hard currency. That story has been circulated throughout the trade in Dublin&mdash;many of them the Minister's friends.  I wonder if it is true.  If it is, it shows the foolishness of the Minister's policy of putting every Irish egg into the one British basket. There is no way out now under the Minister's agreement, irrespective of what price we might get for them and irrespective of the currency in which we might be paid.  The Minister should be long enough in the tooth by now to know that his old friends and good neighbour, the people he is always praising&mdash;the British&mdash;will always buy in the cheapest market.  They do not take Irish produce because they like Ireland or because they have a particular regard for Irish produce.  If they could get the same produce for a farthing in the £ less in any other country in the world they would jump at it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's policy has been directed&mdash;as I suggest it has&mdash;towards selling all our eggs in the British market, there by putting us in the position that we could not get any other market for them and that we are tied to their economy, he can rest assured that he will reap the whirlwind.  The moment the British are in a position to get a better offer than ours elsewhere the Minister will be left sitting flat&mdash;or any Minister who may succeed.</P>
    <P>I do not know on what the Minister has based his very optimistic estimate <Col N="329" /> of the bacon position for the coming year.  I do not know what negotiations have been in progress or how far the Minister may have got in them.  All I have to say is that the position of exporting bacon to Britain, subsidised out of this fund, is, to use a favourite expression with the Minister, codology. That fund comes from the Irish pig producer and the Minister knows it. However much the Minister may try to cloak that fact, that is where that fund is coming from.  If that fund were used as it could well be used by the Minister to endeavour to provide, through county committees of agriculture, cheaper sows or to encourage pig production or pig breeding in some other way, I could quite understand it. However, I do not believe in exporting cheaper bacon to Britain when thousands of people in this country could not and cannot get bacon.  I suggest that when the Minister makes these statements about there being tons available at, I think the Minister said, 1/2 a lb. &mdash;Deputy Flanagan went one better and said it was available at 1/- a lb.&mdash; these statements are only so much eyewash. Any housewife or any shopkeeper who goes through the City of Dublin in search of bacon at the price quoted by the Minister or by Deputy Flanagan will come home again without having got it, and the same applies virtually to every town throughout this State.  There may be something in what the Minister said that he did not mind if back rashers or the better cuts of bacon went to 5/- or 6/- a lb. so long as the pig's head was left.  We all know that there were never more sows being slaughtered in the factories of this country than have been slaughtered in the past six months.</P>
    <P>The Minister's figures for sow services, issued by his Department, are not, I understand, correct.  I understand that some mistake has been made in connection with them.  However, so far as they go, they do not indicate that there is going to be any production. The fact that tillage has been virtually wiped out in this country and that the price of maize has increased by 50 per cent. in this country will ensure that pigs will not be reared in this country because the prices would not <Col N="330" /> be economic.  I should like to see a new price being paid for pigs.</P>
    <P>However, if we have one policy to-day and another policy to-morrow it will be completely impossible to keep the industry in any way static as far as prices are concerned.  It is obvious that if, for instance, you control the price of bacon and bring it down, the bacon curers will have to bring down the price of the raw commodity.  The price of the pig to the farmer will be reduced and if it is brought below a certain level, taking into consideration the present cost of feeding stuffs, the farmer would automatically go out of production and nobody could blame him.  The position is most serious.  It is time we had some official fixed policy on this matter&mdash;a policy which can be accepted and believed in without having complete and absolute changes day in and day out so that no farmer nor anybody in the industry knows what is going to be the policy in 24 hours' time.  That is not the way to deal with this industry or, in fact, with any industry.  Unless the Minister sets about getting some planned policy and some type of stability in the industry we might as well throw our hats at the poultry industry, the egg industry and the bacon industry.</P>
    <P>I want now to deal very briefly with a particular problem that arises in my own country&mdash;it may not affect other counties.  It is in connection with the cattle breeding scheme.  We have been appealing to the Minister and his Department for a number of years because the percentage of Shorthorns shoved over in County Mayo under the cattle breeding scheme is too great and because, due to the type of land there &mdash;the mountains and the kind of reclaimed bog on which our farmers produce their cattle&mdash;a different type of breed, particularly the Aberdeen Angus, is more suitable.  Speaking from memory, I think we have to accept one-third double dairy Shorthorns. As a matter of fact, I think the figure for Shorthorns is greater.  We find every year that the number of applications for Aberdeen Angus premium bulls in our county is far and away greater than what the county committee of agriculture can deal with <Col N="331" /> and no matter how we subsidise the double dairy stock there, we cannot get the farmers of Mayo to take them.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he could relax that rule in my county. There has been a tradition in the west that they have always bought calves from Limerick and the South of Ireland. There is a ready market in Mayo for these calves.  Many people from the dairying counties in the south come with lorry loads to Mayo and they find a ready market for them there.</P>
    <P>This question of keeping a foundation of Shorthorn stock in the West, particularly so far as Mayo is concerned, is met by the importation of these calves and the Minister could, without any qualms of conscience, relax that particular rule and allow the people to get the type of premium bull that they want, and that is, an Aberdeen Angus or a Hereford, but mainly an Aberdeen Angus.  They are particularly suitable for that part of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fagan told us that agriculture was never better and farmers were never more prosperous.  It is significant to note that Deputy Fagan is not what one would call a small or mixed farmer, that he is typical of that class.  Deputy Fagan, of course, is more concerned with cattle salesmanship in the Dublin market than with the ordinary ups and downs of a small farmer's life.  It is all right for him and any of those other rancher Deputies representing rancher interests to eulogise the Minister when he talks about cattle for England and about turning the country into a ranch for England.  There are people, particularly in the West of Ireland, with whom that does not go down, people who realise that the Minister's policy is deliberately ruining dairying economy and has been ruining it since the Minister took up office.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the increase in milk supplies in the dairying districts and around Dublin.  Do any Deputies from the West, even those behind the Minister, concur with that view, irrespective of the statistics the Minister may quote?  We all know from practical experience that there is not a town in the West where milk is <Col N="332" /> not rationed by the suppliers.  I say that milk production in the country has gone down very seriously.  I assert that and I am sure the Minister's colleagues who are sitting behind him and who come, as I do, from the West, know that just as well as I do.</P>
    <P>In any western town at the present time it is conferring a favour on you if the milkman will give you three pints instead of the two quarts you require.  That position has come about during the past three or four years. The dairy farmers in the West&mdash;I am not talking about creamery areas but of the ordinary country areas where there is no creamery&mdash;have gone out of production for one reason, and that is, because they did not find it economic. The Minister does not give a row of pins about the prices of agricultural produce, but the ordinary farmer whose livelihood depends on it does give a row of pins about the price of agricultural produce.  If he finds that running a dairy farm does not pay, he will get out of it, or if he finds any other commodity does not pay him, he will get out of it.  He produces commodities for the money he will get out of them and nobody can blame him, irrespective of what the Minister's policy may be in the matter of prices.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to forget the bias he has against tillage of all kinds, particularly in view of the very serious situation that is facing the world.  If we have another emergency and if we have this Minister in office, how can we face the serious situation that will confront us and how are we to prepare?  The Minister has a definite responsibility to the Irish people; he must ensure that our people will have a normal food supply.  He has killed that prospect by reason of his bias. I appeal to him to change his mind from the rancher outlook in which he has been steeped and adopt a policy more suited to the needs of our people.</P>

      <P>The few remarks I propose to make are largely prompted by the speech we have just heard.  I do not think it has been the misfortune of Deputies for some time <Col N="333" /> now to listen to a speech more prompted by malice and spite than was the speech delivered just now by Deputy Moran.  He has had the temerity to come here and state things that, he must know, vary from the truth.  As I understood him, he tried to raise the old Fianna Fáil story that this Government and this Minister for Agriculture were influenced by the rancher outlook and that they were in some way opposed to the small farmers, and particularly to the mixed farmers.  That is very reminiscent of the Fianna Fáil propaganda when they were trying to convince the farmer who had a few head of cattle to sell that he had something he should not bother about and, if he got ten shillings for his calf, he should be very pleased.  It is very reminiscent of the Fianna Fáil propaganda of some 12 or 14 years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to barely, I to say that at a show held in my constituency in the town of Rathdowney, in July, 1948, the Minister was able to announce the removal of obstacles restricting the price of barley and, as a result, the price of barley in the following year rose to 57/6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are two important tillage products. In both cases an increased price was given by a Minister who has been described here as a Minister opposed to tillage and anxious to have reduced prices.  I think it is fair comment to make on the Minister's policy compared with the Fianna Fáil policy, that Fianna Fáil believed in, and even still advocate&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Briscoe is in a position to deal with it now or not&mdash;a policy of compelling the farmers of the country, particularly <Col N="335" /> the small farmers, to till their land and produce wheat crops at a lower price than this Minister gives, to produce barley at a lower price than this Minister gives, and to engage in tillage generally at the prices obtaining under the Fianna Fáil Administration which were lower than the prices now obtaining.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the farmers of the country to decide themselves what their view is with regard to those two policies. This Government's policy as put into operation by the Minister for Agriculture, is to remove in normal times any compulsion with regard to tillage and to enable the farmer to judge&mdash;we hold that he himself is the best judge&mdash;the way in which he wants to work his land, and to encourage him, by more attractive prices, to till and to produce from suitable land the crops which Fianna Fáil did not get by compulsion.  I think it was the Minister himself who said, in introducing the Estimate, that the best proof of a policy are facts and the record of that policy in operation.  I think it is noteworthy that the yield from barley in the last 12 months was a record yield. It was higher than ever we had under compulsion and under the nonsense that Fianna Fáil called a policy in agriculture.  The yield from a smaller acreage of wheat was a record yield, clearly showing that the best and most suitable land was put into producing wheat, and that the farmers who sowed the wheat were not intimidated into doing so by the fear of a writ, but rather had been attracted to do so by the price given for the crop by the present Minister and the present Government. These are the facts and they can be checked by Deputy Briscoe in his new found love for agriculture.</P>

      <P>I think that matters of this kind should be referred to here, because it is true to say with regard to agriculture and other aspects of Government activity, that there is a concentration of Opposition propaganda directed to proving that black is white and that white is black, and directed to disproving, as far as they can, the facts of the present situation. They are past masters at repeating the inaccurate story and things which they know to be untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an example of that in this debate.  Deputy Corry came in like a dove of peace.  He started a long oration by appealing to Deputies not to allow the odour of politics to enter into their consideration of the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture.  The Deputy, having done that, proceeded to delve into the bogmire of politics to a greater extent than he had ever done before, and, obviously, did his utmost to outlive in oratory Deputy Smith who spoke for a little short of six hours. Having listened to speeches such as we heard from Deputy Corry and others representing the Fianna Fáil Opposition here, I think it was driven home to those who attend debates in this House that, with regard to agriculture, the Opposition have no policy good, bad or indifferent.  Their contributions to this debate consisted in nothing more than a personal attack on the present occupant of the ministerial post of agriculture.  That became more and more manifest as each Deputy on the Opposition Benches spoke.  Deputy Smith led the attack.  He apparently bears a personal grudge against the present Minister for succeeding him.  Deputy Corry, in every one of his contributions here on agriculture <Col N="337" /> since the change of Government took place, has evidenced a complete personal antipathy to the present Minister for Agriculture.  I think it is true to say the same with regard to many of the other speakers we heard on the Opposition Benches.</P>
    <P>I know it has been difficult, but I have listened to this debate for close on a fortnight.  I was anxious, as I think any person interested in the affairs of the country would be anxious, to ascertain what is the Fianna Fáil policy with regard to agriculture, if they have a policy.  I was anxious to find out what it was.  So far as I could gather from their leader in agriculture, Deputy Smith, and others, the only thing they have to say is that &ldquo;everything is wrong but we are not going to tell you what we would do if we were in your place.&rdquo;  We must assume, therefore, that, in so far as they have a policy, it is the policy they operated when in office of compelling the small farmer, the man with bad land, to till his land at the point of a bayonet and to pay him prices which were less than profitable and which were less than the prices at present obtaining.  That is a glorious policy, according to Fianna Fáil theorists.  If that policy were tested by the facts, we would find that, from the very moment they put it into operation in 1939, agricultural production consistently declined year by year, to such an extent that it is only now that we are getting back to pre-war production.  People can test those two policies and examine the facts.  If they do, they will find that the balance is very much in favour of the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter that I would like to refer to.  It was mentioned by Deputy Corry and I think by Deputy T. Walsh.  It concerns the question of beet and of sugar production. I think there is no Deputy who does not appreciate the importance, particularly in a mixed farming constituency such as my own and in other parts of Leinster, of the sugar production industry.  That is an industry which should have the support not merely of the Government but of the Opposition and of the people generally. <Col N="338" /> Deputy Corry, in referring to sugar production, suggested that the present Minister was apparently determined to kill both the beet growing and the sugar industry here.  I find it very hard to be patient when I hear Deputy Corry make statements of that kind because he is a member of a Party which, when the idea of beet growing and sugar production was first mooted, did its very utmost to scoff at the suggestion.</P>

      <P>Only for the sugar production scheme put into operation before Fianna Fáil came into office, the people would have had no sugar during the emergency just as they would have had no light had not the Shannon scheme been developed. Deputy Corry has, apparently, the belated approval now of Deputy Briscoe in his utterances on sugar production. Deputy Corry would be far better employed if he went back to the farmers in his constituency and elsewhere and got them to give their wholehearted support to beet production.  He would be far better employed in that way rather than in making it a political plaything here and in using it as another stick to beat a Minister, who will never be beaten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to be patient with Deputies like Deputy Moran and his colleagues who state time and time again things which are not in accordance with fact; who state time and time again that the prices now available <Col N="339" /> for tillage produce are lower than those which obtained under Fianna Fáil.  I think the farmers, big and small, have now got a sympathetic and capable Minister in charge of their affairs, a Minister who has announced that it is his aim to make the country a nation of working farmers so far as agriculture is concerned.  I think that aim is appreciated up and down the country.  The farm workers realise that they are sharing in the expansion of agriculture as partners in that industry. Everybody feels that progress is being made and everybody wants that progress to continue.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to clear up one matter which was the subject of cross-talk earlier between the Minister and some Deputies on this side.  It is a matter in relation to which Deputy O'Higgins has just repeated an incorrect statement.  The present price of wheat 62/6 per barrel, was announced over the radio on 14th October, 1947. I actually heard the announcement myself.  It was announced that that was the price that would be paid for all wheat delivered to the mills in 1948. What this Government has done is merely to extend the guarantee for a period of five years.  Not alone was that announcement made upon the radio on the 14th October, 1947, but it also appeared in the newspapers at the same time.  That can be verified.  That may be news to Deputy O'Higgins.  It is nevertheless correct.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer first of all to the Minister's handling of the dairying problem.  The dairy industry is an important one in the constituency I represent.  Some months ago, the Minister made a gallant attempt to try to get the dairy farmers to accept a reduction for the milk they supplied to the creameries. He went to Waterford and made a statement to the county committee of agriculture there.  As an advocate of this reduction, he behaved like a cooing dove.  He told them what the advantages would be and how much better 1/- per gallon would be in the summer months and 1/2 in the winter months than the 1/2 and the 1/4 which have been in operation since 1st April, 1947. The Minister's little effort was not successful. Some few creamery societies fell for the Minister's cooing, but the vast majority of them rejected his suggestion with scorn.  Anyone who knows the situation in the dairying areas realises how outrageous the suggestion was.  Instead of suggesting a reduction, the possibility of an increase should have been under consideration.  We have not heard much about this from the Deputies sitting behind the Minister who purport to represent the farmers.  I wonder what would have happened had that proposal emanated from a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture. <Col N="341" /> I can imagine the outcry there would be.  I can imagine how the welkin would ring with the cries of the representatives and some of the selfappointed spokesmen of the dairy farmers against any such suggestion from a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture. The next blow the Minister delivered to the creamery suppliers was when he decided to provide the off-theration butter.  He says that he is faced with a big surplus of butter and that he does not know what to do with it.  I shall deal with the surplus later.  At the moment, I want to lodge a protest on behalf of the creamery suppliers at the treatment meted out to them in regard to this matter.</P>
      <P>Mind you, he was in a very reasonable frame of mind when it was a question of trying to get the dairy farmers to accept a low price for the milk supplied to the creameries.  He consulted them and took them into his confidence, but when it was a question of depriving them of a privilege they had during all the years of the emergency in regard to the 12-oz. ration of butter, there was no such consultation.  He just imposed his will on the creamery suppliers of this country.  I want to protest against that.  I did not hear any protest coming from the so-called protagonists of the farmers in regard to that matter when they spoke during this Vote.  Perhaps some of them did protest but I did not hear any of them nor did I see any protest in the reports of the debates that I read.  I can imagine what would have been the outcry and how the welkin would have rung if a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture was responsible for that ukase. Evidently, those farmer Deputies who sit on the Government Benches were, as the Minister described the Labour Party some time ago, as mute as mice.</P>

      <P>I am sorry if I hurt Deputy Hickey but I am stating the facts.  If they do not suit I cannot help that.  I want to protest against the deprivation of this privilage that creamery suppliers had down all the years.  It was wrong and an injustice. If the consumers of this country had to pay an economic price for butter at the moment they would be paying at least 3/5 a lb.  They are getting the rationed portion of 2/8 and the creamery suppliers are getting their ration at the same price.  The position now is that the money is being provided in this Vote for dairy produce subsidies and, as a result of what the Minister has done, the dairy farmers are paying an additional portion of that subsidy to the amount of 10d. a lb. on the unrationed portion of the butter more than they would have been paying if the right which they had all along had not been taken away from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter with which I want to deal is the question of poultry production. The Minister gave us some figures in regard to egg exports for the first quarter for each of the last four years.  In regard to these figures I notice a rather unusual thing in view of the Minister's boast.  I notice that egg exports up to the 30th April this year were 165,000 great hundreds less than last year.  I wonder is that reduction accidental or, is it an indication of a downward trend in the production of eggs?  Perhaps some of the Deputies sitting behind the Minister who have contacts with poultry producers in this country have told him how much the poultry producers of this country are attached to him and how much they think of him, particularly when he is trying to persuade them that 2/6 a dozen is much better than 3/- a dozen or when he is going to try to persuade them some time in the near future that 2/- a dozen will be better than the 2/6 a dozen they are getting now, having regard to the present cost of feeding stuffs.  I wonder is there any <Col N="343" /> connection between that reduction in exports in the first quarter of this year &mdash;165,000 great hundreds value about £300,000&mdash;and the trend in the price of feeding stuffs?  I remember reading a speech the Minister delivered at, I think, Portumna Show some time last September.  He was talking about the price of maize and the price of fertilisers. He told us in that speech that he was our Minister for maize.  &ldquo;As your Minister for maize,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can assure you that there will be no increase in the price of maize within the foreseeable future.&rdquo;  I do not know what the Minister meant by &ldquo;the foreseeable future&rdquo; but the meaning people normally apply to that phrase is that we would be very much older at any rate before anything would happen in regard to maize.  What happened? Some months later the price of maize went up very considerably indeed.  Of course that was a most outrageously foolish statement for the Minister to make in view of the devaluation of the £ which had happened a few days before, but it is only in consonance with many more statements this Minister has made since he became Minister.</P>

He can be described as the Minister for contradictions, the Minister for inconsistencies, the Minister for somersaults as well as the amazing Minister for maize and the Minister for fertilisers.  He also told us that he could see no prospect of any increase in the price of fertilisers in the foreseeable future.  Goodness knows, fertilisers are dear enough or have been dear enough in recent years without having any increase.</P>

      <P>Part of his livelihood or part of his activities.  In any case the prognostications of the amazing Minister for maize did not work out.  The price of maize has increased very considerably within the past three or four months.  That would have justified an increase in the price of poultry, eggs and pigs which are produced on imported maize.  The Minister has had a disappointment on that question as he had in regard to many other questions.  I hope that this reduction here in egg exports, to which I have been referring, in the first quarter of this year, will not be the start of another serious disappointment for the Minister.  I hope that this sea of raw eggs in which he was to drown the British will not turn out to be a small pond.</P>

      <P>The Minister was also very cocksure of himself a few years ago when he was talking about the agreement which he made with the British with regard to the purchase from us of our agricultural produce.  He told us then that there was an unlimited market for all our agricultural produce at remunerative prices.  We did not hear very much from the Minister recently about the negotiations that were going on in regard to agricultural produce, pigs, bacon and so on, that we will have to export.  Perhaps these talks are continuing yet and it might be unreasonable to ask the Minister to make a statement about them but we have been exporting some bacon recently to England and in order to export it in that way we had to pay a subsidy so as to give the producers here a reasonable price.  That was because of the bad price which the British were prepared to give us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="345" /> When the Minister went across to England recently to meet the British Minister of Food he told the newspapers shortly after he returned on one occasion that he did not have any talk with the British about butter purchases because he thought it was useless to talk about butter there when you could not get the price which was necessary to give the producers in this country a remunerative return for their labour.</P>

      <P>Well, I believe that with the trend of things and with the way they are going at the moment we would need all the agricultural produce we have for ourselves, and the Minister should be very careful about supplying this &ldquo;glorious market&rdquo; that we have at our door and of supplying &ldquo;the old and valued customer&rdquo; we heard so much about some time ago in case our own people who need these products might be left without them.</P>

Has the experience which he has had since 1948 in dealing with these people not changed him in that belief? I do not think that there is any change whatever in the attitude of these people towards the Irish producers. They have always got us or tried to get us to give them the best of our products at the lowest possible price.

      <P>As I was saying, that Lord Lieutenant made a statement that the future destiny of this country was to be &ldquo;the fruitful mother of flocks and herds&rdquo;.  He was replying to a statement made by a famous Tipperary man, Charles Joseph Kickham. No matter what the Minister may say or what discussions he may have with the British, that is the attitude of the British still to our country and to the products which we have to sell to them. That has always been their attitude in the past and that still remains their attitude.  If the Minister thinks that by taking up that attitude that he can sell to them cheaper because they were our &ldquo;old and valued customer&rdquo;, he is barking up the wrong tree and is adopting the wrong attitude in not demanding of these people a better deal for the country and for the farmers of this country.  He should take a strong line in regard to all these things and withdraw all his past gyrations in the matter of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very hard to know what the general policy of the Minister is.  His policy is, apparently, not that of the whole Government.  He is evidently supreme in his own.  Department and will not take any dictation from any of the splinter Parties making up the Government or even from the main Party on which the Government is based.  He is a lone bird and he has no authority from the Irish people for the things he is doing.  He is a bird alone and has been ever since he was thrown out of the Fine Gael Party and he has no authority for any of the somersaults and inconsistencies which masquerade as an agricultural policy.  Is the Minister's policy one of bullocks and permanent pasture?  Is he a believer in the old dictum of that Lord Lieuteanant who said that the future destiny of <Col N="347" /> Ireland should be that of &ldquo;a fruitful mother to flocks and herds&rdquo;?  We heard from the Taoiseach shortly after he was elected that they hoped to carry on the agricultural policy of the late Mr. Hogan, who was Minister for Agriculture for Cumann na nGaedheal&mdash;go ndeanaid Dia Trócaire ar a anam.  I want to tell the Minister and Fine Gael and all the splinter Parties comprising this Coalition Government that that policy was emphatically rejected by the electorate in 1932 and was never given a mandate since.  The Fine Gael Party held on to it down through the years and they kept dwindling and dwindling until the day they found that they had only 31 members in a House of 147. That policy was rejected by the people at election after election.</P>
    <P>They talk about another cow, another sow and another acre under the plough but they will not say that there was a tail to that statement which had a sting in it.  That statement was made in Hospital, County Limerick, when the late Minister, Mr. Hogan, urged the farmers to keep another sow, another cow, another acre under the plough and added that they should &ldquo;tighten their belts and stick it&rdquo;.  We do not want to see any more tightening of belts.  Our policy should be the Sinn Féin policy of self-reliance, producing from the land what we need for our people here, and do not let us go, as the Minister is going, to nations outside. He is going to Iraq for barley, the Argentine for oats and to other places for maize and other things which we could produce here from our own land and for which we could find a market at home.</P>
    <P>I think we cannot get back to the system in operation here prior to 1931 by which time the price of milk had fallen to the level of 4.47d. per gallon. It went up during the intervening period of 16 years so often referred to here and the average was 1/2¾ or 1/3 for the year round 1947.  We cannot go back to the system of <i>laissez faire</i> as far as agriculture is concerned.  The best policy here is the Sinn Féin policy of relying on the land of this country to produce our requirements.</P>

I am subject to correction in regard to those figures.  The Minister can give us the figures in respect of production and consumption.  I think the production figure is correct. It was given in reply to a Parliamentary Question in this House.  If that is so, where is the necessity for the eight ounces at all: where is the necessity for the ration?  Why not do away with it?  It is a disgrace to continue the rationing of butter when production is at the level at which it is at the moment; when there has been an increase in the number of cows and when the cows are milking better, thus pertar <Col N="349" /> mitting of an increased supply of milk to the creameries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I was thrown off my line a small bit but it did not make any difference.  I think I got on better as a result.  I was asking what was the Minister's policy.  I suggested that the best policy for this country would be to produce what we require from the land of Ireland and to let our own people have first preference in purchasing the produce. If there is a surplus in any line we will have to dispose of that surplus as best we can, realising the limitations which there are.  There has been a good deal of talk about increasing our agricultural production.  There is room for an increase and a substantial increase, in some respects.  There is room for an increase in bacon until we meet all our own requirements&mdash;and when there is a surplus, well then, God help us because unless we have a better purchaser than the British we are going to be treated as we have always been treated: we are not going to get the price which will give our producers the cost of production, particularly in present conditions and even, as the <Col N="350" /> Minister says, if they walked the pigs out of the houses.  There is room, particularly, for an increase in tillage crops&mdash;wheat, oats, barley, potatoes, roots and so forth.  There is room for an increase in the production of crops, such as vegetables, tomatoes.  The Minister is very fond of tomatoes and he has shown it especially as far as the Gaeltacht glasshouse scheme is concerned. However, there is not so much room for increases production in butter, bacon and eggs because as the position is beginning to show itself now, we are going to get burned.  If there has to be an export market, the farmers and their workers should not always be expected to provide at sacrifice prices the exports required in order to enable us to purchase those goods which we cannot produce here.  Every section of the community should take a share in bearing that burden.</P>

      <P>What, then, is all the talk about in connection with exports and remunerative prices and so forth?&mdash;more of the ballyhoo that we are sick of listening to.  Will the Minister shut up about it and, instead, implement a rational agricultural policy, seeing that he occupies the position he does occupy and which he obtained by backstairs barganing.  We want no more somersaults, ballyhoo and blather. We want a rational policy which will give security to our people on the land and, so far as it is possible, to know what kind of a future they are facing in this uncertain world.  If he can get a policy of that kind on which we can all more or less agree, in principle at any rate, whatever about the details, then we shall be doing a good day's work and, in future, avoid a lot of the interchanges that takes place in these debates every year in regard to agricultural policy in this Minister's period and when other Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Government were in his place.</P>

      <P>It might be well at the outset to call attention to the fact that probably we would have a better debate on agriculture if some nonfarming Deputies in their contributions would use language other than that of which I have taken down examples <Col N="351" /> here.  I do not think it tends to improve the tone of agricultural debates when certain people who know nothing at all about agriculture come in and accuse the Fianna Fáil Party of having done certain things&mdash;of having told inaccurate and untrue stories, and so forth.  They talked about the quagmire of agriculture.  There are a few Deputies in this House who are noted for stirring up quagmires.  It would be much better for agriculture if these Deputies would stick to their own lasts and leave the subject of agriculture to be hammered out by the farmers Deputies.  We have heard appeals to the farmers of the country, to the members of the Opposition and to others to co-operate with this Department and these appeals would be given a better hearing if certain Deputies would remain silent.  However, the statement was made that there are 70 per cent. of the farmers behind the policy of the present Minister.  It might be all the better if we could get away from the practice of using percentages and estimates in certain directions.  I challenge that statement and I do so on the basis of having listened to this debate and other debates here and what I have heard from various sections, not alone from the Opposition but from supporters of the inter-Party Government, various criticisms and suggestions to the present Minister about the policy concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been arguing here whether there was a surplus of barley, oats and potatoes in the past few years.  I am in this position, I happen to be a farmer, and two years ago I had a surplus of potatoes.  That was in 1948. I had them in sacks for the buyer; I used to deliver several tons at a time. The merchant I was to sell them to could not buy, and there they were actually growing out of the sacks, and eventually I had to sell them for pig feeding.  I had a surplus for feeding my own animals.  I suggest that instead of arguing and trying to put on the Opposition that we are out for propaganda, it would be much better to face up to the actual position.  We are in fairly normal times but, unfortunately, we are entering on very abnormal times again and the Irish <Col N="352" /> wheat that is growing to-day will have to feed our people until 1951, supposing you cannot get foreign supplies.  On that basis I would suggest to all and sundry, to people who get up here and who are not farmers, who get up here only to score points, that it would be better for all of us even to encourage and back up the Minister to give a price incentive for the production of a greater quantity of wheat.</P>
    <P>There are many people parting to-day about wheat and what the Fianna Fáil policy was.  They were very glad to eat the wheat produced here when we could not get wheat elsewhere, and even then it was necessary to mix in barley and other cereals to keep up our bread supply.  I think the Minister will get full co-operation there.  We are told of the success of the presentday policy and figures are compared, particularly in regard to cattle and crops.  I want to know whether, as regards cattle and crops, it is fair to compare the 1947 season with other seasons.  Do we not know that cattle died then in the winter and spring because of the bad class of fodder and the severe weather?  It was one of the severest periods in memory.  Do we not all know the difficulties the farmers had with the bad quality of the grain after the harvest?  They were confronted with great difficulties, due to conditions over which they had no control.  We ought to thank God that last year gave us good crops.  There was a period when the farmers were perturbed until the rains came, and then things turned for the better.</P>
    <P>I do not see any use in all the talk about growing as much wheat on a smaller acreage.  It is true, and why not?  If the farmers in 1945, 1946 and 1947 had access to manures for their land, conditions would be very different.  I heard several speakers refer to the land.  I come from a mixed tillage area.  Mixed tillage is no new things to us.  The word was bandied about by some people who do not know what it means.  I come from an old tillage area and I know well that the majority of the farmers are doing their job fairly well.  If they had manure from 1946 to 1948, as they had it during the past couple of years, free access to <Col N="353" /> manure, they could have as good crops as they had last year and the year before.  That is only common sense.</P>
    <P>I give every credit to the Minister and his Department for what they are doing to improve the soil.  But let us not give all the credit to the Minister. There must be fair play and it must be admitted that the Fianna Fáil Party started the work at Johnstown Castle, in Wexford.  There is splended work going on there and I was glad to hear the Minister giving us an invitation.  As a matter of fact, I am going there on the invitation of the young farmers of the district.  It will be well worth while.</P>
    <P>I would like to nail the lie that Fianna Fáil will not co-operate for the common good.  That is wrong.  Some of the juvenile speakers here took up that line, but it is wrong.  Fianna Fáil will co-operate where necessary for the common good.  That sort of talk will not get us anywhere.  We have all this talk about the farmers never being better off.  I would like to know how many successive good years farmers have had&mdash;and by good years I mean years in which average prices would leave the farmers with a reasonable margin over the cost of production. The point is, will one good year make up the difference to a farmer who is hard hit?  Will it put him on his feet again?  Can anyone say that in recent times the farmers are so well off as some Deputies have suggested here?</P>
    <P>My colleagues in my constituency have talked about farmers having motors cars outside churches on Sundays. Are they not as well entitled to have them as the other sections of the community, no matter who they are?  As against that, perhaps there was no motor car except the priest's car there ten years ago, but if there are seven or eight cars to-day I would be glad to see them there, and I would be glad to see 40 there.  I would not talk in a derogatory way about it.</P>

      <P>As regards the price of wheat, I would ask the Minister to be fair about it.  Before we have any more crossfire in the House I would like to ask if it is not a fact that there <Col N="354" /> was an announcement made by the Minister for Agriculture in October, 1947, as a guide to farmers for the 1948 crop, that the prices would be 62/6?  It came from the Minister's mouth and we were glad to hear it.  He announced that price early in the spring, and he added that it would hold for five years. That was a step in the right direction. I put it to the Minister now that from the time he took office many changes have occurred in farming.  Have the farmers' costs not gone up?  Are the farmers' costs to-day not going up? Has the cost of machinery to-day, due to the recent devaluation, not gone up?  Is the farmer not paying more now for agricultural machinery than he was paying two years ago?  Should there not be some set-off against, that?</P>
      <P>People talk about average farmers. What does an acre of wheat or barley or any cereal mean in the economy, in the income, of a small farmer? How much net income will he have after all his labour in producing any of those crops?  That is a point some people should examine into and they might be less vocal then.  They think because the farmers had a good yield and got 62/6 a barrel that he should now be a millionaire.  That is contrary to the fact.  The same applies to butter.  I am sorry the Minister agreed to stop giving a subsidy to the farmers in those areas where there are no creameries and where there was a surplus summer production of butter.  I agree there was a certain quantity of butter put on the market that could not be considered of first quality.  In the interests of Irish agriculture the less said about that the better.</P>

      <P>It is not my business to go around parting about how my neighbour does his work.  If my neighbour does something that I do not like, that is his business.  If we want to sell our producer abroad.  I advice the Minister that it would have been better, instead of removing the subsidy at that time, to have sent one of his inspector to stand by in the local towns or get the butter buyers from Cork or wherever they come from to <Col N="355" /> refuse to buy the butter if it was not up to a certain standard.  In the year when the subsidy was on, on every Tuesday morning for a number of weeks in the peak period I delivered butter for my wife in the town of Mountmellick.</P>
      <P>The butter buyer called attention to the fact that he would like to get more butter well washed and cleanly handled.  I agree that if there is an appeal made to segregate the different qualities of butter and to tell people who bring in butter that is not up to quality to go about their business and bring it home, in the same way as our Minister in our time had to tell people to bring home dirty eggs, the situation would be better.  We could then leave the good farmers who produce well-made and good-quality butter to get the 2/11.</P>
      <P>I say that the recent Government decision proves home to the hilt what I said when you can buy non-subsidised butter at 3/5.  I say that the farmers who were producing during the peak period of production were entitled to a price above 3/- for their butter.  We have heard some Deputies say that if the butter were brought into Mullingar a better price could have been obtained.  How many people could get a fair price for their butter?  Do Deputies think that a woman would have the time to go hawking her butter around the town to see what she could get from a few customers?  Would it not be better that she should dispose of it in bulk and so have it handled properly?</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he could establish creameries in suitable areas to take up the peak supply of milk and have it manufactured into butter, it would have the result of increasing the gross production of butter all over the country.  That would be a good thing at a time when farmers who cannot afford to pay £7 or £8 for suck calves are at their wits' end as to how they will dispose of their milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of beetgrowing, <Col N="356" /> I think the Minister would be well advised by the Dáil&mdash;I think Deputies, no matter in what part of the House they sit, should forget their prejudices and give the Minister this advice&mdash;to consider that now is the time for him to prepare a new and a bold policy for the next season. Whether the ploughs that are employed in the work of sowing next season's crop are horse-drawn or tractor-drawn is immaterial.  The crops that will be harvested in 1951 will be sown next spring.  We see dark clouds hovering around the world.  I think the Dáil would be well justified in giving the Minister full support if he were to prepare a bold and a vigorous tillage policy for 1951.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot of talk about Fianna Fáil compulsion.  I heard one young Deputy say that Fianna Fáil imposed compulsion in 1939.  It did no such thing.  I think it was Deputy Fagan who referred to certain selfish farmers who would not do their duty.  If it were not for the fact that men who had good land and who could afford to do the tillage which the nation needed failed in their duty, Fianna Fáil would never have imposed compulsion.  It was a case of dire necessity when compulsion was introduced.</P>
      <P>The same thing happened in the case of the Minister for Supplies.  He was criticised afterwards for the provision that he made in having supplies of fuel available.  I refer to this because the handling of fuel is considered agricultural work.  I am simply making a passing reference to that.  But we all remember the talk there was here about the Minister's madness in piling up supplies of fuel in the Phoenix Park.  I think that if the Minister for Agriculture were to start now piling up supplies of wheat, oats, barley and beet to ensure the nation's supplies in the next two or three years, every every Deputy should stand behind him, no matter what amount of subsidy he might need to give a fair deal to the farmer and the agricultural worker in producing these supplies.  If the Minister were to do that he should not be criticised un fairly for it.</P>

      <P>There were some references made to the Tuam beet factory. Some Deputies expressed the hope that it should be closed and taken elsewhere. I think it would be far more sensible to advice the farmers in the western parts of the country, those within a radius of 30 or 40 miles of Tuam, to grow the best which the factory requires.  I think every encouragement should be given to them to do that so as to keep the factory in full production and so that the farmers in the midlands would not have to send their beet to the Tuam factory.  I think that would be more practical advice to give at the present time than to have this talk of closing down the Tuam factory or of transferring it elsewhere.  If that transfer were to be made it could hardly become effective for a year or two.  I think the sort of talk that we heard here about the Tuam factory is not calculated to do any good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to press home in the Department that part of the policy which he inherited from his predecessor in relation to farm buildings. Now that buildings materials are becoming more freely available, farmers should be encouraged to avail of those grants and progressively to put up storage for their own grain so that they may be able to earmark a certain quantity of it for the feeding of their own live stock.  The question arises, whether the granting of a large number of such applications would interfere with the house building that is going on privately and under the Department of Local Government.  I am anxious to know whether in such circumstances there would be sufficient supplies of cement to go all round.  I have heard of builders down the country who are doing work for local authorities and when asked by farmers for estimates for the building of cowbyres and lofts for the storage of corn, replied that they had to let men go at a certain time because they could not get supplies of cement.  If we could get an assurance that supplies of cement would be available, I think it would be good policy to encourage <Col N="358" /> farmers to avail of those building grants.</P>

      <P>No.  I am glad the Minister reminded me of that because it was stated by some Deputies who sit on the benches behind the Minister&mdash; they must have been referring to me or to some of my colleagues&mdash;that at a Fianna Fáil meeting we advised farmers against participating in the farm improvements scheme and the farm buildings scheme.  Speaking for myself, I want to say that I never did any such thing.  If that statement is attributed to me by any of the spokesmen at the other side of the House, I want to say that it is not true.  I am not responsible for what other people may say</P>
      <P>This evening a Deputy at the other side said I was scribbling madly and taking notes.  I want to say, in reply, that I am entitled to take notes of anything that is said in this House.  I have often heard the Minister upholding the privileges of members and I make no apology to anyone for making notes during any debate.  If that is the sort of thing that is going to be put across, then, whether it is good for debate or bad for debate, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of providing storage for native grain credit must be given to the Fianna Fáil Government for having deliberately had silos erected in our major cities and towns to act as the nation's granaries.  I suggest to the Minister that he should erect more granaries at certain strategic points.  For instance, one would be very useful in Athlone to take the midland corn.  That would be on the direct supply route to the West, where the farmers are not in a position to produce enough grain for their own needs.  I remember a few years back when grain was selling at a very unsatisfactory price.  I remember having a chat with a certain Deputy here, and telling him how unsatisfactory the price was in the Mountmellick area.  We discussed the possibility of transferring the grain from the midlands, where it was in <Col N="359" /> abundance, to the western counties where it was in short supply.  This Deputy came from County Mayo.  We wanted to transfer it at a fair price to the midland farmer.  He agreed to make inquiries, and the following week he came back and said that he could place three or four wagon loads to commence with.  He told me the price. I compared the price with the home price and it was better than the price we were getting at the time.  But when I went to the railway station to inquire the cost of carrying the grain from the midlands to the west it knocked the bottom completely out of the whole idea.  I suggest there is room for improvement in respect to the cost of transport and, if necessary, the Minister should subsidise the railway to enable it to transfer grain to those areas where it is needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister must agreed that he did make a mistake with regard to maize prices.  I do not blame him for that. Anyone can make a mistake.  He certainly promised us Indian meal at £1 per cwt.  Taking into consideration the cereal acreage this year, I think this is a matter which should be examined if we are to continue our poultry and pig production.  The distribution of grain produced here and its removal at the right time calls for careful examination and consideration of the position.  In my opinion the right time at which to take grain off the farmers' hands is when it is in sacks having come back from the mill except, of course, in the case of those farmers who are lucky enough to have adequate storage accommodation. Last year in Tullamore I know that the farmers who had oats to sell could not sell them to the local merchants because there was not sufficient storage. I was standing by when an arrangement was reached between two farmers, one a big grass farmer and the other a small tillage farmer. The man with the grass farm agreed to take the oats at £1 per barrel from his neighbour.  I do not think anyone could approved of that arrangement. I think the Minister would be well advised to strike a fair price and to make arrangements through the medium of some State-sponsored <Col N="360" /> scheme to buy up all the barley, oats and wheat at harvest time, and to make arrangements for its storage. That should not be impossible, and I think it would be very advisable in view of the fact that we appear to be approaching yet another emergency.</P>
    <P>The Minister did state that extra storage accommodation will be provided. That is a step in the right direction.  It is essential that that accommodation should be provided in the right places.  In that respect the Minister should pay particular attention to those counties which have a reputation for mixed tillage and where, no matter from what quarter the wind blows, the soil does not become run out.  These are the counties with the tillage tradition, and the farmers in them will stick to tillage.</P>
    <P>I know a little about the Department and I have had very close association down the years with its officials and instructors.  I know a bit about what goes on in Glasnevin.  It is not next November or December we should consider this matter.  Now is the time to do that.  I can assure the Minister that I know several farmers who brought their corn in to the merchants in the normal way and the merchants could not take it off their hands.  They had to store the corn in the town.</P>

      <P>I do not want any dialogue across the floor of the Houses. I do not interrupt other Deputies.  I could never understand why the Department, under the direction of the Minister, had to close down the farm improvements scheme for a whole year. I could never understand why that scheme could not have been carried on during that period and then slipped in as part of the land reclamation project. I asked the Minister on one occasion&mdash; I think it was a fair question&mdash;if he would be prepared in cases where his officials could certify that a farmer had <Col N="362" /> done a certain amount of reclamation work, such as he intends doing himself or getting the farmer to do under the land rehabilitation scheme in order to clear land, to make available to those farmers certain manures and lime.  I cannot see why a farmer who cleared certain fields under the guidance of the Minister's predecessor in 1947 and 1948 should be debarred from getting the same benefits from that part of the Minister's programme in relation to lime and manures as the farmers are getting who actually carry out the same work under his particular project.  I would advise the Minister not to spend as much as one shilling on certain land unless he is sure that that land will be subsequently maintained.  I know old farmers in my constituency who remember certain reclamation work being done.  There is an example of it in the Wolfhill area.  Deputy Davin knows that area very well.  Drainage work was done there; the land was not subsequently maintained and after four or five years it went back to the derelict condition in which it was in the first instance.  I think the Minister could improve on his programme if he went out after the second-class land first and put it into good heart.  There is a tail of land on practically every farm overgrown with bushes and furze.  I think that type of land should be dealt with first.  I think it would bring about a better increase in production.</P>
      <P>I have recommended and do recommend all farmers to avail of the schemes outlined.  I think better improvement work can be done by the farmer and his employees than by an outside interest.  There are areas, perhaps, where a Government scheme might be necessary.  That is the difficulty. There are areas where there is a scarcity of agricultural workers already.</P>

      <P>I do not want to carry on this debate any further.  I certainly suggest to the Minister that he should not follow the bad example of some of his supporters who have spoken.  I think we would have a higher tone in the debate if certain things to which I have been listening were left unsaid.  In that way we would face up to a debate of such importance, in the way it should be faced up to.</P>

      <P>Since this debate started, one thing that I have noticed flung across to this side of the House from Government Deputies is the allegation that we in Fianna Fáil have deliberately gone out to sabotage the land rehabilitation scheme.  I heard my colleague, Deputy Madden, make that accusation against us.  Speaking in this debate when introducing the Vote, the Minister as reported in Volume 121, column 1810, said when dealing with the land rehabilitation scheme:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Open confession is good for the soul.  I ran into a bottleneck.  I took a gamble.  I believed that the land project would not develop faster than I could locate pipes.  In a sense, I am glad and happy to say that it did, but I do not deny that I experienced a couple of weeks' embarrassment because I had drains opened and could not gets pipes to put in them.  But where there is a will there is a way.  We got them in Derry, Holland, Crumlin, Athlone. We got them wherever we could get them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He asked for the co-operation of all Deputies in this House to help him out of his difficulty as regards the procuring of pipes.  I am glad to inform the Minister that I took him at his word.  Further on in the same <Col N="364" /> column the Minister said when speaking about the unsuitability of concrete pipes:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Provided the land has not an acid reaction generally (he was speaking in reply to an interjection by Deputy Smith), then the Deputy will have observed that in that category of land we are using clay pipes.  These are the ones that we had to get in Derry and anywhere else that we could put our hands on them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have welcome news for the Minister. I became interested, and I shall read here a letter I received from a farmer in West Limerick, and I am sure if the Minister was serious in the statement he made here on 15th June that he will take due notice of this letter. It reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Re yours of yesterday, which I regret I could not answer by return, as I was away from home, the greater portion of my home holding of 200 acres is of clay deposit, the same as that which the brick was made out of years ago.  It is about half a mile from the surrounding bogs.  This clay deposit is also in many of the adjoining farms.  The brick works in Clounleharde were started by Colonel Dixon in the year 1812 and continued successfully until Mr. Sheldrake (Colonel Dixon's steward) retired through illness, when the work fell through.  A sample of the clay deposit here was sent to the geological section, Hume Street, and was considered by them as the best of its kind in Eire. There were a great many houses built of the brick&mdash;even a number of houses in Limerick City.  It is about 130 years since the houses were built in this area and they are in perfect condition.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further in a postscript he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The clay (drainage) pipes made from the clay deposit here are still to be seen through the lands in this locality.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am very glad to have this information for the Minister, as I think that it is proof that the accusation which <Col N="365" /> has been made against us in Fianna Fáil, that we set out deliberately to sabotage the land rehabilitation scheme, is untrue.  As a Deputy representing Western Limerick, I can say that the farmers there have availed more of the land project scheme than the farmers in any other district in Ireland.  I resent the accusation made against us by Deputy Madden that we went out deliberately to sabotage this scheme.</P>
    <P>It was also said that we told the farmers that if they availed of the schemes their land would be revalued. That is not so and the proof of our genuine desire to help in anything that is for the general good is contained in that letter.  I would ask the Minister and his officials to look into this matter and if they are anxious to start this industry in Clounleharde they can get clay pipes manufactured there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be delighted to help.  We on this side are at all times willing to co-operate in anything to promote the general interest, but we shall not relinquish our right to stand up here or outside to criticise anything with which we do not agree.  That is our right and our privilege.  Dealing with the land rehabilitation scheme, there is one factor operating in my part of the country which is not really suitable or acceptable to the small farming community.  The fact that in bog land or heavy land they have to bring in heavy machinery is in itself a kind of deterrent to the farmers concerned. I think that Deputy Ben Maguire mentioned in the course of his speech that it would be much better if the farm improvements scheme had been continued so that that particular type of farmer could avail of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmer need not bring in machines on his holdings.  He can do it himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>He can do it himself but there is one matter I should like to bring to the Minister's notice as regards County Kerry and County Limerick where the inspectors are operating these schemes.  I think that Deputy Smith explained the matter <Col N="366" /> already.  Inspectors go out, pay their visits and come back again with a map of your holding.  I know of one particular instance in which they came back and told the farmer:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You will have to make 120 perches of drain to the acre, so many main and so many minor, as the case may be.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Many of the farmers in that district were satisfied that 80 perches to the acre would be just as effective as under the farm improvements scheme. Again there is too much delay.  I have evidence that when the scheme started In County Limerick on 1st November a good many people applied for application forms, filled them up and sent them to Dublin.  These people have got no directions from the inspectors or the supervisors as to when they are to start work.  The Minister can state otherwise if he likes but I am telling him what the actual position is.  There is no headway being made with that scheme whereas under the farm improvements scheme if it was expanded to meet the case of the people I have in mind you would have three times the amount of work done in the last six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And I am telling the Minister what I know and trying to show him that there is some negligence or undue delay on the part of the inspectors carrying out the scheme. I received a letter this morning from a man on this matter.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. Collins will you kindly ask Mr. Dillon a few questions? I sent in a form in February to have work done and completed by April 18th. The work was completed on that date, but up to the 3rd of April I was still waiting on the manure.  It has so far not arrived and has held up the whole crop.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> If this Department which is charged with the responsibility of administering the land project scheme is administering it in the way that Mr. Leahy of a certain town in Limerick says it is being administered, I am sure it would be a matter that the Minister would take up.</P>

      <P>Leaving the question of the land rehabilitation scheme I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to what I consider to be the very unfair rate of pay that is given to the farm improvements inspectors as against the rates paid to the supervisors employed in the land rehabilitation scheme.  Is the Minister aware that the majority of the farm buildings inspectors have ten farm experience and some of them have up to 15 years, experience?</P>

      <P>The value of sea sand as a manure is of very great importance to the farmers in whom I am interested.  I do not know what the Minister thinks about it, but I do know that it is valuable and was being used extensively.  The Minister may be surprised to hear that this particular sand from the foreshore of Ballybunion contains 65 per cent. of lime and potash and other salt deposits in surprisingly high percentages.  Apart from its manurial qualities and value, it has a physical value on the land which is of great importance to tillage. We have in Limerick loamy soil, and the physical value of this sand to the soil is very important.  It prizes up the land for dressing and tillage.  I am sure the Minister is aware that quite <Col N="369" /> recently, as a result of a regulation made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, farmers in the area are precluded from taking this sand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I am aware that the Deputy's colleague, Deputy Lemass, made a regulation to that effect which was substantially relaxed by the present Minister and which was designed to exclude contractors from taking this sand away for gravel for assistant county surveyors in another part of the county.</P>

The Minister should arrange with the Minister for Industry and Commerce that the right of the farmers of that area from time immemorial should be given back to them and that any recent restrictions or rearrangements of the regulations under the Foreshore Act should not preclude the farmers of that area from drawing sea sand for their own use,</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It never caused us a bit of trouble.  Under that Act a certain mark was laid down in the foreshore and we had a right to take what sand we required within that mark. It is only within the past few months that a committee in Ballybunion used its influence with the Minister for Industry and Commerce to prevent us from taking what sand we required. There is no use in blaming Fianna Fáil for the Act of 1933.  They brought in that Act&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;in order to protect cliff bound coasts, but they were wise enough to realise the value of the sand to the farmers of West Limerick and North Kerry and to give us the right to draw all the sand we required.  Now we are cut off and we are not allowed to draw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the price of milk.  The price of milk was last fixed in 1947 by Deputy Smith when he was Minister for Agriculture.  Surely the present Minister does not contend that the price fixed in 1947 is justified to-day in view of the increase in costs of production and so forth?  The Minister's offer to the creameries of a five-year plan of 1/- a gallon was, I believe, mainly influenced by the defeat of the motion in the names of Deputy Cogan and Deputy P. O'Reilly in this House on the 8th March last.  When that motion was defeated I believe the Minister realised he had a backing and that he could with all confidence issue this ultimatum to the farmers.  The farming Deputies who supported the rejection of that motion were, I believe, responsible for driving our farmers into a defensive position in respect of the ultimatum issued by the Minister.  I am glad that Deputy Halliden is here now and listening to me.  I read an account of proceedings at a meeting which was held in North Cork at which he was to some little extent brought to task for voting against that motion. The excuse he gave was that it was Fianna Fáil inspired.  Can any reasonable person or body of men imagine that Deputy Cogan or Deputy P. O'Reilly would be inspired to do anything for or by the Fianna Fáil organisation or the Fianna Páil Party?  The <Col N="371" /> present Minister immediately issued his ultimatum to our farmers to accept 1/- a gallon on a five-year plan.  That was rejected.  I think the circular was sent to about 100 creameries and that only three agreed: that means that 97 threw it back.  It is regrettable that those of us on all sides of the House who are interested in the dairying industry should now find ourselves in a defensive position&mdash;trying to defend and hold on to the price of 1/2 a gallon when we should be making strong representations to the Minister to increase the price of milk.  The Minister told us that he would never interfere with the dairying industry without the full consent and approval of the industry itself.  I am sorry that he is now leaving the House.  I had a few interesting things which I should have liked him to have heard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall read an article from the <i>Irish Times</i>, dated the 12th May, 1950.  Mind you, the <i>Irish Times</i> is not a Fianna Fáil paper.  I am sure it never had much love or regard for or interest in the Fianna Fáil movement.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The statement in yesterday's <i>Irish Times</i> that the Minister for Agriculture intends to dispose of surplus creamery butter at 3/6 per lb. off the ration was officially confirmed last night; and the butter&mdash; which may be bought in unlimited quantities&mdash;will be wrapped in a distinctive wrapper.</P>
      <P>The <i>Irish Times</i> also learnt from official sources that there is no intention to alter the price of milk at the creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers supplying milk to creameries have been receiving a family butter ration of 12 ozs. for each person; this will be reduced to 8 ozs. for each person and will result in a saving to the Exchequer in sub&mdash;sidy of some £120,000 a year.  The <Col N="372" /> butter subsidy for the present year is estimated at £2,639,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Note this and note it well.  By reducing the family butter ration of 12 ozs. per person to 8 ozs. the Minister has filched £120,000 from our dairy farmers and driven them into his black market to buy the extra amount at an increased cost of another £120,000, which two figures, added together, total £240,000&mdash;almost £250,000.  The figures are there to be contradicted if the Minister is able to do so.  That is really what happened.  Then we hear a lot of talk about non-interference with the dairying industry and that unless the people concerned give willing authority, so to speak to the Minister, he will not interfere.  I think the interference with the butter ration was an interference that should not have been made by any Minister. Imagine almost £250,000 being taken overnight from the dairying industry!</P>
    <P>I listened on Thursday night last to my very distinguished colleague, Deputy Madden, of Limerick, defending the Minister and making a <i>prima facie</i> case for the Minister in connection with a circular which he sent out to 100 dairying societies to accept 1/- a gallon over a period of five years.  On the 22nd June&mdash;column 2260&mdash;Deputy Madden is reported as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The dairying industry, it is admitted, is the basis of our whole economy and it is to this point I would like to draw the attention of the Minister for Agriculture&mdash;I am glad he is here.</P>
    <P>Perhaps there was good and sufficient reason for the Minister to leave to the farmers of the country a few months ago to decide whether to accept 1/- a gallon for a period of five years, but I would draw Deputies' attention to the international position of milk.  In the United States of America £1,000,000,000 sterling of milk has been converted into food and in that same country there has been converted or manufactured into food&mdash; and this is rather staggering&mdash;nine years of the United States egg <Col N="373" /> supply ready if you like to be released on the world market.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister&mdash;I am sorry he is not here&mdash;a very simple question.  I will first point out that quite recently Eggsports received from America a request for Irish eggs which would be paid for in hard currency but, owing to our egg agreement with Britain, they could not accept the American order, much as we in this country require hard currency.  It is, I suppose, a repetition of the old proverb, having all our eggs in the one basket.</P>
    <P>This statement I make publicly in this House, to be checked by the Minister if he so desires, that Eggsports received from America an order for Irish eggs and America would pay for the eggs in hard currency; but we could not supply them with an egg because we were tied up by our egg agreement with Britain.  That offer from America had to be refused.  The Minister told us in the Dáil that 2/- a dozen for eggs sent across the water was a sufficient price, a fairly reasonable price, and he said that during the winter months the price would go up to 3/6.</P>
    <P>We all remember when the Minister came back from England and when he announced the terms of the trade agreement with England as regards eggs and other things that he tried to sell at the time.  He said that the more eggs we supplied to the British market the better the price would be, and he could guarantee a continuity of a good price.  Our people in every part of rural Ireland went full-steam ahead into the poultry industry.</P>
    <P>We have here, as a matter of fact, according to the White Paper issued by the Minister, the amount of public money invested in the creation of poultry stations all over the country. The wives of small farmers made applications to county committees for loans or grants.  What do we find at the moment?  We find that that industry has gone.  There is no use in refusing to face facts.  The egg industry is killed for this reason, that the Minister was prepared to give all the eggs to John Bull at 2/- a dozen. I maintain that he had no right, in the <Col N="374" /> first instance, without the approval of this House, to go to England to make that egg agreement with the British. He had no right to subscribe to any condition or stipulation that the price of Irish eggs would be governed by the price the Danes would supply eggs at to the English market.  He committed our egg industry, by subscribing to that condition, to such an extent that now the egg industry is destroyed.</P>
    <P>He was in a big position to fight and to say to the British: &ldquo;We can supply all the eggs you require at a fixed minimum price over a fixed number of years.&rdquo;  When he came back here he was actually applauded by Deputies on his side of the House when he announced the terms of the agreement, but he never told us that this secret clause was in that agreement, or that the price was to be governed by the price the British were prepared to pay to the Danes, the price the Danes were willing to supply at.  That has put our egg industry in a bad position.</P>
    <P>At the time the egg agreement was made with the British the Minister made a statement to the effect that we could get all the maize required for £1 a cwt.  Possibly, it might not be fair to the Minister to criticise him unduly for making that wild statement.  Possibly, unforseen world conditions made it possible to prove that the Minister should not have made that statement.  Anyhow, the fact remains that the price of maize has soared, with the result that any sensible Deputy who comes from a rural area cannot deny that the people cannot continue putting eggs on the market because there is no reasonable margin of profit if they have to pay the present price for maize.</P>

      <P>I will repeat for the benefit of Deputy Hickey that Eggsports received an order from America for eggs to be paid for in hard currency and they could not supply the eggs.  Is that not very clear?  We have heard an awful lot during this debate about the Dairy <Col N="375" /> Livestock Act of 1926.  All my life I have felt that this Act was of British design and was imposed on this country to suit British interests.  The results have proved that I am right, because to a great extent, notwithstanding all the talk about the dual-purpose cows, dual-purpose bulls, dual-purpose hens and so forth, the operation of the Dairy Livestock Act of 1926 would eventually destroy our dairying industry.  In my opinion, at any rate, you cannot have beef and milk.  I have seen pedigree dairy shorthorn cows mated to pedigree bulls and I saw the second and third generation leaving the milk strain and going into beef.</P>
      <P>The late Deputy Patrick Hogan gave it as his opinion in 1932, when he was speaking here on the Opposition Benches, giving way to Deputy Dr. Ryan who was then Minister for Agriculture&mdash;Deputy Hogan was handing over the Department of Agriculture in 1932&mdash;that you could not have milk and beef.  It is the opinion of the vast majority of our dairy farmers also. Just before the change of Government I understand a conference of the beef and dairy interests was held and for some time there was a discussion about the repeal of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, it was the British who imposed it and, unfortunately, it was readily accepted in 1926.  It is easy to understand why it was accepted then.  I am firmly convinced that the Dairy Livestock Act of 1926 should be repealed.  I know that my pleadings and representations will fall on deaf ears while the present Minister for Agriculture occupies that post.  I firmly believe that in agriculture he has a one-track policy.  His policy in agriculture was, I think, very ably demonstrated here to-day by Deputy Fagan. His policy in agriculture is the policy of the rancher.  I was amazed, and rather surprised, to hear Deputy Fagan say that the present Minister for Agriculture was the best Minister for Agriculture that we ever had in this country, and that he could not see many Fianna Fáil farmer-Deputies at the Dublin cattle market any morning. Well, a lot of them would not have the <Col N="376" /> opportunity of going there and even if they were they would not be in the happy position that Deputy Fagan is in of being a salesmaster.</P>
    <P>The policy that was initiated here and carried on for a long number of years, a policy that was imposed on us in 1926, was specially designed by the British to destroy our dairying industry and to change it over, in the course of time, to the production of beef of the best and finest quality to suit the people at the other side.  It is no wonder that Deputy Fagan should throw bouquets at the Minister and tell us that he is the best Minister for Agriculture we have ever had.  If the agricultural policy of this country as it relates to dairying and its allied branches is simply to be one primarily for the production and development of bullocks here, then the people who imposed that Act on us in 1926 can say: &ldquo;Well, we have scored at last.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I maintain that if the dairying industry, which we recognise is the basis of our agricultural policy, does not get the protection and the help it requires, Deputy Fagan from Meath will have very little to offer for sale some fine day in the Dublin market, because if dairying is not encouraged and maintained you cannot have cattle for export.  Well now, we cannot expect to keep our dairying industry on a safe level unless our dairying farmers are paid a decent price for their milk.  We hear a lot from the Minister about this &ldquo;Drink more milk&rdquo; campaign that he has initiated all over the country, and we hear a lot of complaints and objection about the price of milk to, say, the Dublin consumer or the Dublin housewife. The people who make such complaints never pause for a moment to ask themselves the question, what quantity of milk does it take in, say, the counties of Cork, Limerick or Tipperary to make a pound of butter?  It takes from 2? to 2½ gallons of milk to produce a pound of butter.  That is the position in the Golden Vale.  The farmers are selling their milk at 1/2 a gallon, and so the calculation of what it takes to make a pound of butter is a simple one.  On the other hand, we find that the same quantity of milk which the housewife consumes <Col N="377" /> costs exactly 3¼ times the price.  Is there any Deputy from Dublin, be he a Labour Deputy or a Fine Gael Deputy or a Deputy of any other Party, who will contradict me when I say that butter is the best food that can be made available to any family?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture asked while Deputy Gorry or Deputy Ó Briain was speaking for a solution or a way out of the difficulty.  That is his responsibility.  Deputy Ó Briain advocated the total abolition of butter rationing, and so do I.  Immediately the Minister asked: &ldquo;What will you do between this and between that&rdquo;? That is his responsibility and his job as Minister.  If he is not able to present to this House a solution, that is an admission of failure on his part &mdash;that he has not a solution.  We have a solution which we will put into operation when it is our responsibility to take over agriculture in this country.  The solution will be found, and was found by Deputy Dr. Ryan in 1932, when he brought in the Dairy Stabilisation Act, at a time when milk was as cheap as water.</P>
    <P>I heard comments being made here as regards the price of milk in certain years.  We were told that in 1931 the price of milk per gallon was 4.47d and that in 1932 it was 4.53d.  In 1933-34, when Deputy Dr. Ryan's Dairy Stabilisation Act of 1932 would be coming into operation and giving us in the dairying industry the results we expected, our prices were pegged back to 4.12d and to 4.13d., due to the British tariffs.  As Deputies will remember, we were then in the throes of the economic war when tariffs were imposed. When we go down along the line we find that the price paid for milk in 1945 and 1946 averaged between 11.32d. and 11.45d., while in 1947 the average price was 14.56d.  In 1948, due to the fact that fertilisers had become more plentiful, milk supplies increased and the average price paid was&mdash;I am speaking of butter fat at the moment&mdash; 15.02d.</P>
    <P>I think that even if I had the oratorical gifts of Philpot Curran I would be only wasting my time trying to make any impression on the present Minister.  No matter what representations <Col N="378" /> are made or what case is put up, I believe the Minister has definitely decided to keep the price of milk pegged down.  I know that a certain amount of pressure has been brought to bear on him by the farmer Deputies supporting his Government.  They are no fools and if Mr. Dillon&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="JamesJCollins" hpid="Mr. J.J. Collins Mr. J.J. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.J. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>And if the Minister insists on 1/- per gallon on a five year plan that will spell political suicide for the farmer Deputies supporting the present Government.  The farmer Deputies supporting the Government cannot play fast and loose with the people who sent them here.  They should stand up and openly tell the people through the House that the farmers who are getting 1/2 per gallon are not getting a sufficiently remunerative price.  If they have not the courage to do that, then they should do what some other Deputies did recently in relation to the foreshore sand.</P>
      <P>Deputy Finucane, in the interests of the dairy farmers of North Kerry, had to take a certain line of action when he discovered that 41 farmers from his particular area were fined a total of £700 for taking this sand for manure. The position was fraught with danger for Deputy Finucane.  I understand a solution was found along a certain line of action adopted by Deputy Finucane; that line of action was to issue an ultimatum to the present Government that if the restriction were not relaxed and the regulations amended he and some of his colleagues would withdraw their support.  Naturally, rather than have a split, the Government surrendered. I wonder would the farmer Deputies listening to me now have the same courage as Deputy Finucane had and another Deputy from the Midlands who inspired the move.  Can they not be as courageous as Deputy Finucane was?  It is hardly likely that they will be when one remembers that Deputy Cogan and Deputy O'Reilly brought in a motion to increase the price of milk and were the first to vote against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be proved beyond yea or may that production costs have gone up by at least 25 per cent. since 1947. Would the farmer Deputies not have <Col N="379" /> the courage now to bring in a motion on behalf of the people they represent asking the Minister to fix a minimum price of 1/4 a gallon?  If they have the courage to do that they will be assured of the wholehearted support of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I know that they will not do that because, hitched together as they are, if one thread gave way the whole fabric would be destroyed.  We should be honest with ourselves and with the people who sent us here.  The present price of 1/2 per gallon does not pay any dairy farmer any more than it pays his wife to sell eggs across the water at 2/- per dozen. I am sorry the Minister cleared out because I had some interesting points to make.</P>
    <P>On the 2nd May, 1950, addressing the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society at their annual meeting in Dublin, the Minister is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of Wednesday, 3rd May, 1950, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless they could produce milk during the seven months period of growing grass and convert it into butter for sale over the 12 months the dairy industry had no future.</P>
    <P>Mr. Dillon, replying later to suggestions that the present prices should be maintained, said that he did not pay the subsidies, and nothing could be more attractive for an active politician than to pay a subsidy of £6 instead of £4.</P>
    <P>What good did it do to him to vex every dairy farmer in Ireland, he asked, when he would not be a 1d. poorer if the subsidy was raised?</P>
    <P>He could not, in consequence, recommend to the farmers of this country that they should pay foreigners £4 a cwt. to take our butter away.  He had been criticised for making the London agreement on beef exports without getting a price for butter.  Could they demand from any foreign purchaser a price in excess of that at which the Danes could supply it?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There, the cat is out of the bag with regard to the agreement he negotiated when he went across the water to meet the British Minister of Food.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="380" />&ldquo;Mr. Dillon said that, in spite of the problem in front of them, he was not in the least pessimistic.  He might get trampled underfoot in the process but he would know his resurrection behind the counter from which he came, and it might pay him better than the £1,525 which he was paid as Minister for working 14 hours a day; but if he had not wanted the job, he need not have taken it.  `I was 15 years wanting to be Minister for Agriculture,' he said.  `I got what I wanted, and when I stop wanting I will tell you. I will continue to give my best and if you sack me before I resign there will be no ill-feeling.' &rdquo;</P>
    <P>If part of the Minister's speech could become effective, it would be the best news the farmers could have.  He said he might be trampled underfoot in the process but he would know his resurrection behind the counter from which he came; as far as the dairy industry is concerned it is a pity the Minister did not stay behind the counter.  One extraordinary thing in this debate is the fact that the Minister is singled out, not here in the Dáil but outside, as being responsible for the failure of the agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>Again, the responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture should be the responsibility of the whole Government. Their attitude brings to my mind an expression used in army circles.  They remind me of the round robin.  None of them is prepared to take responsibility and they sign their names in a circle.  They are not prepared to bear the collective responsibility they should bear for the policy of agriculture, as it relates to the country at the moment.  I think that, in the absence of the Minister, I am more or less wasting my sweetness on the desert air.  I have a lot of stuff here, but I do not like to inflict it on the Minister for Defence, who has the responsibility of defending the agricultural policy of the Government in the absence of the Minister.  In conclusion, I would again appeal to the farmer elements who support this Government to see that the policy of the Minister for Agriculture as regards dairying is changed, and changed in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the privilege, as this debate went on so long, of reading the speech the Minister made in introducing the Estimate very carefully.  I was also able to compare his speech with the speeches he made in introducing the 1949 Estimate and the 1948 Estimate.  What was interesting about a comparison of these three speeches is the change we find in the Minister for the couple of years he has occupied that position.  I would describe the speech of 1948 as a most optimistic, a fighting speech, if you like.  In the speech of 1949 he was on his guard, and this year his speech might be described as a defensive speech.  I do not wonder at that, because the Minister was unduly optimistic about his expectations from the agreement made with Great Britain in 1948.  He based his optimism for the future on the benefits that were to accrue from that agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One could read several quotations from the speech the Minister made at that time and on the Estimate for 1948.  As a matter of fact, the Ceann Comhairle might recollect that the Minister was ruled out of order on the Estimates for his impatience in trying to talk about the merits of this agreement with Great Britain.  He actually said: &ldquo;It is my impatience to deal with them and to disclose their advantage which brings them to my mind.&rdquo; Eventually, when the question of order was discussed and when the Ceann Comhairle had agreed that it would be practically impossible to prevent a reference to the agreement in the debate, it was thought that the agreement might be referred to.  The Minister said that the articles of agreement created quite unprecedented advantages for the agricultural industry of this country.  He said it was his job, or part of his job, to give the farmers an opportunity to dispose of the fruits of their labour.  &ldquo;That I have already done,&rdquo; he said in 1948. If the Minister goes back over his speeches and particularly dwells on these few words: &ldquo;That I have already done&rdquo; and if he then runs his mind over the last few years and just dwells on oats, potatoes, flax, bacon, butter, cream, cheese and eggs and the other items, would the Minister now ask <Col N="382" /> himself: &ldquo;Was I unduly optimistic?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the Minister's statement.  If I ever said that my job was to provide an outlet for the fruits of the farmers' labour, that might be my job, but if I were to say then: &ldquo;That I have already done,&rdquo; I think I would be subjected to criticism.  In fact, I would say that it would be very difficult for any Minister for Agriculture that ever appeared in this country or probably will ever appear&mdash;at least unless the world changes very much&mdash;to say: &ldquo;That I have already done.&rdquo;  It is only a man with the optimism of the present Minister that could say a thing like that.  I said here before and I say it again that we on these benches were inclined to believe that the Minister had made a great settlement.  We did question the Minister very much because we felt to make an agreement equal to that described by the Minister was a very difficult matter and we questioned the Minister very closely.  He assumed, of course, that we did not want to see a good agreement, that we were jealous, and he said that he did not wonder at our being rather disturbed about the agreement.  These were the sort of answers he gave us. These are the types of answers which it is customary for him to give but he <Col N="383" /> persisted that everything was right. He said that it was on success or failure of his policy in respect of agriculture in regard to these matters that his whole policy would ultimately fall to be judged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am taking the first one on the list and I presume it is the one which the Minister claims has conferred the greatest benefit on this country.  I do not mind the Minister's interruptions because as long as he interrupts me I know I am doing very well.  If he did not interrupt me then I would know I was not making a good case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be too hard on him but I want to tell him the facts. First of all the agreement so far as cattle is concerned did not make any change whatsoever in the position as regards store cattle.  Under the 1938 Agreement store cattle were allowed into Great Britain free of duty and free of restrictions as regards numbers so that the Minister in his agreement made no change to our advantage in that matter.  He did make a slight change so far as it affected fat cattle shipments to Great Britain.  In the speeches in this House to which I have referred&mdash;both on the Estimate in 1948 and on the agreement in 1948&mdash;and the many speeches made by the Minister down the country, it will be seen that he gave the people a very glowing outline of what it was going to mean to the future of the fat-cattle industry in this country.  I have no doubt that the Minister felt that that agreement was going to improve the fat-cattle trade &mdash;and it did, but not very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, a mere bagatelle! You could put it in a child's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not call it a mere bagatelle, but at the same time it was nothing amazing.  Let us take two years before and after for the sake of comparison.  The number of fat cattle exported in 1946 from this country to Great Britain was 35,000&mdash;I am giving the figures to the nearest thousand.  In 1947 the number was 110,000; in 1948, 66,000; in 1949, 134,000.  If any Deputy wishes to examine these figures I may say that he will not find that between <Col N="388" /> 1947 and 1948 something remarkable occurred to make any enormous difference, because there was not an enormous difference.  To take the two years together, 1946 and 1947, and comparing the total with that for 1948 and 1949, there was an increase in 1948-49 compared with the two other years, but it was nothing very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this agreement, I would say that we must do our best to give the farmer of this country a better market in Great Britain for his produce.  That was the object of the agreement.  It was on that basis that the agreement got all the praise the Minister and the other members of the Government gave it.  Therefore, it is well for us to take note of the total number of cattle exported during the four years.  I have given the House the number of facts already.  However, the total number of cattle exported in 1946 was 462,000; in 1947, 482,000; in 1948, 373,000&mdash;that is 100,000 down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What did we get for them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1949 the number was 467,000.  As my colleague behind me has said, there is very little use in talking to the Minister because he does not listen.  The price of store cattle was in no way related to the agreement made with the present Minister for Agriculture.  Therefore, if he asks me how much we got&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What we got for the cattle would seem relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What we got for the cattle is a very important matter, but I say that the Minister's achievement, as he refers to it here, in negotiating that agreement had nothing to do with the price.  I would remind him that world conditions are an important factor to be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that that is as much as I shall say in regard to cattle. I have a large number of items to go through and if I am to give a few <Col N="389" /> minutes to each I must proceed. Sheep: the number of sheep is small because we are using practically the whole output of this country and what sheep are being exported are getting a good price.  We can dismiss sheep at that.  Pigs: Now, we will have something to say about that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You have nothing to compare with them because there were not any pigs when you were there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if the Minister gets annoyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not a bit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was entitled to take part in this debate.  When the Minister was in opposition and when I was on the Government side of the House, he never lost an opportunity of speaking on this Estimate.  He used to say very hard things but I did not get annoyed because I knew he did not mean them.  I ask him, therefore, to try and control himself while I am going through those few points. Strange to say, when the Minister took over control, although I made what you might describe as a fairly close search of his various statements&mdash;and the Minister speaks very often and volubly &mdash;I could not find any reference to pigs or bacon in the early months when he took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not any.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, speaking at Clones on 18th July, 1948, said that the position was obscure regarding feeding stuffs up to now but that now he is satisfied that we can secure maize and other feeding stuffs at a price which will make pig-feeding profitable.  That statement is fair enough.  It was the first statement he made and it was an indication to the farmers that they should go more into pig production. The next point we note is that which I have already quoted in relation to the trade agreement where he told the farmers that for whatever they might produce&mdash;pigs or anything else&mdash;there would be a certain market at a remunerative price.  That was a very good hint to the farmers to go ahead.  Pig <Col N="390" /> production then increased fairly considerably and we had reached the point where we had enough bacon for ourselves&mdash;and then the Minister began to talk about bacon for export.  In October and November of last year, the Minister, in a number of his statements, complained of the treatment of the farmer by the factories.  He said that they were not paying the farmer a price commensurate with the price they were charging for the bacon.  He made two threats&mdash;(1) that he would licence the export of live pigs and that, if that did not succeed, (2) he would build Government factories.</P>
      <P>In or around that time, about August, 1949, the Minister removed the control on the price of bacon.  Of course, we had an agreement with Great Britain in regard to bacon whereby we would get 225/- per cwt. for what are known as Wiltshire sides. Some of the Deputies sitting behind the Minister are not too well up on these things and I will explain for their benefit that a Wiltshire side is just a side of bacon with a shoulder and a ham on it.  I do not think we exported a whole lot of bacon last year, but when it came to 1st January, 1950, the price was reduced to 217/- and the Minister felt that it was not good enough; in other words, it was not a remunerative price&mdash;we were not getting a remunerative price for all our products.  We were not getting a remunerative price for bacon on 1st January, 1950.</P>
      <P>There was another thing the Minister did.  He condemned me over and over again for paying subsidies on food going over to Great Britain.  I am prepared to turn up 500 quotations from the Minister where he condemned me for paying those subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, emphatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that the Minister found the price was not remunerative and he paid a subsidy in order to get the bacon over to England.  He got the Pigs and Bacon Commission to act for him.  He had not the courage, as I had, to come before the Dáil and put an Estimate before it and say: &ldquo;That is for a subsidy on bacon going to England.&rdquo;  He did it by the backdoor <Col N="391" /> method.  He gave a ring to the officials in the Pigs and Bacon Commission and he said to them: &ldquo;Come over, boys; can you do this in a quiet way?&rdquo; And they did it and the money was paid out of their funds.</P>
      <P>The Pigs and Bacon Commission was condemned up and down by the present Minister when he was a Deputy sitting on the Opposition Bences.  According to him, the members of the Pigs and Bacon Commission were amongst the greatest ruffians and racketeers.  That was when the Minister was in opposition. But the members of the commission are still there, they are still in operation, and now they are useful to the Minister; now they are paying the subsidy on bacon going over to England and in that way the Minister has a remunerative price for bacon going to Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no bacon going to Great Britain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must always remember that there are Deputies sitting behind the Minister who need to be informed on these matters.  The Minister says there is no bacon going to Great Britain, but bacon did go and, according to an answer given in the Dáil, the Pigs and Bacon Commission paid out £18,000 on bacon going to Great Britain by way of subsidy.  But the Minister apparently does not approve of subsidies on our products going to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not pay a subsidy on farmers' butter going to England or on anything else, but he got the Pigs and Bacon Commission to do this little job for him.  The Minister repeated here several times in 1948, by way of accusation against us, that he would never allow the British Minister of Agriculture to regulate things in this country.  None of us would, of course, if he could avoid it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could not avoid it&mdash;that is what I am coming to. The Minister made an arrangement with the British that he would agree to accept what the British gave the Danes.  He was not making any bargain with the British, but he said to the British Minister of Food: &ldquo;So far as I am concerned, you will tell me what price you are to give me.&rdquo;  That is very little removed, mind you, from regulating agriculture here.  He made no bargain, but he said: &ldquo;Do your best with the Danes and whatever you pay the Danes, that will do me.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>When he was introducing this Estimate here the Minister had some very interesting comments to make on bacon.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the whole community has got so stylish and so rich that they will eat nothing but the best rashers, I hope to God they will be made to pay 5/- a lb. for them.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He hoped they would have to pay 5/- a lb. for those rashers.  Then he went on to say that so far as he was concerned, being a very humble man, he was prepared to eat pig's cheek and he recommended everybody else to eat pig's cheek.  I was blue in the face when I was sitting over there where the Minister is now, trying to convince him and other Deputies that pigs do not consist entirely of back rashers and apparently now he is beginning to realise it.  I will not say any more than that about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the debate Deputy <Col N="393" /> McQuillan made an interjection and he spoke of the advisability of keeping some reasonable control on the price of bacon.  The Minister said he hoped that would be done within 48 hours. That is the Minister who in the same debate said he hoped to God people would have to pay 5/- a lb. for rashers and later he said he hoped within 48 hours the price would be regulated.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGrath is raising on the motion for the Adjournment, the subject matter of Question No. 61 on to-day's Order Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day Deputy Dr. Brennan had on the Order Paper the following Question:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Health if he is prepared to sanction the provision of proper X-ray facilities in Cork City, which at present are grossly inadequate and unsatisfactory.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply he got was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I would inform the Deputy that in my anxiety to improve the X-ray facilities in Cork county borough, I informed the city health authorities, as far back as the 27th July, 1948, that I would be prepared to make a substantial grant for the purchase of a high power X-ray apparatus. This offer has not yet been availed of.  The existing tuberculosis clinic at the city hall is inadequate to house the high power apparatus and suitable accommodation for it is unlikely to be available until a new health clinic for the area is provided by the local authorities concerned (Cork Corporation, Cork County Council and South Cork Board of Public Assistance).  Despite repeated efforts on my part to have this project proceeded with and thereby to improve the health services for the people in the Cork area, I have been unable to prevail on these bodies to make any effective progress with the provision of the clinic, towards the approved cost of which I am prepared to allocate a two-thirds grant.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal with that reply which was given by the Minister for External Affairs to-day when acting for <Col N="395" /> the Minister for Health.  I am very curious to know who inspired this and the other questions concerning Cork City to-day.  This attack on the Cork Corporation was evidently premeditated, judging by the reply.  I think that the Cork Corporation and the county authorities have shown very clearly that they are most anxious to co-operate with the Department of Health in every way possible; but we certainly want to be very clear about what we are doing, as it has been the experience of the health authorities in Cork that there is a good deal of chopping and changing of plans by the Department.  In fact, we have come to the conclusion that it is about time some finality was reached with regard to hospitalisation and clinics in Cork City.  With that in view, the Cork Corporation invited the Minister, very early this year, to come to Cork to meet the different bodies concerned and to let us know where we stood as regards hospitalisation and clinics in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The question specifically sets out: &ldquo;The provision of proper X-ray facilities.&rdquo; Of course, the Chair must limit the discussion to the subject matter of the question, because it does not know how far the Deputy wants to extend the question.  The Chair must limit the debate to what is in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should be allowed to deal with the reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair must limit the debate to what is in the question because the Chair has no idea of how far the Deputy wants to go.  The only indication the Chair has is what is in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply states that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The existing tuberculosis clinic at the city hall is inadequate to house the high power apparatus&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> and then it goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite repeated efforts on my part to have this project proceeded with and thereby to improve the health services for the people in the Cork area, I have been unable to prevail on these bodies to make any effective progress with the provision of the clinic, towards the approved cost of which I am prepared to allocate a two-thirds grant.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole thing has a bearing around the clinic, and, with the permission of the Chair, I want to point out the position of Cork as regards this particular Department, and the way that it has been chopping and changing plans.  With a view, as I have said, to having finality in this, we invited the Minister down.  The Corporation instructed their medical officer of health to call the medical staffs of the voluntary and local authority hospitals to a conference to discuss the needs of the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely that has nothing to do with clinics.  It was purely a question of hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>We could not go ahead with the clinic unless we knew what we were going to do, and we had to have some agreement between the city and the county authorities.  These facts have been mentioned in the reply.  Despite the interruptions I will go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not to put the Deputy off that I intervened, but purely to know what is the issue.  Is it that the Minister for Health did not go to Cork to discuss hospitals there, or is it about clinics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The question then is about the clinics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out what our experience has been with this Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be all right on the Estimate for the Department, but not on this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>

      <P>The Chair must have something to guide it as to how far the debate can proceed. The only guide the Chair has is what is in the question, and I must ask the Deputy to confine himself to what is in the question.  Otherwise, the Chair will not know how far the Deputy wants to travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to some of the negotiations that we had with this Department and to some of the alterations that were made later in connection with this clinic and other matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as possible, I will.  The point about it is that we have had two or three plans turned down after paying architects a lot of money.  We had an orthopaedic unit and were told to go ahead with it.  The corporation came along and, at the Minister's request, handed him over the new fever hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we now discussing the fever hospital or the clinic?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not discussing the clinic to-day but the X-ray when the Minister had to bring in the repeated refusals of the Cork authorities to comply with it.  We had the orthopaedic unit and spent hundreds of pounds in fees to architects, and then, when the corporation were good enough to co-operate with the Minister and hand over to him the new fever hospital, they found that the orthopaedic unit was not wanted.  We were asked to put up general laundries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to convey to the Chair why we wanted this conference.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Health if he is prepared to sanction the provision of proper X-ray facilities in Cork City, which at present are grossly inadequate and unsatisfactory.&rdquo;  Now the Deputy wants to deal with laundries and with other arrangements in connection with Cork.  He cannot do that, and I must ask him, finally, to confine himself to what is in the question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is a proper ruling that a person raising a matter on the Adjournment should confine himself to the question, but it has always been the practice, when a question is raised on the Adjournment, to refer to the answer to the question. If the Chair will refer to the answer that was given by the Minister to-day he will see that the Deputy has no alternative but to refer to the answer that was given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Briscoe knows the practice of the House as well as anybody else.  Deputy McGrath gave notice that he would raise the subject matter of Question No. 61 on to-day's Order Paper.  The only indication the Chair has is of what is in the question.  The Chair is not anxious to interrupt Deputy McGrath if he wants to get a definite answer to his question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, and people from Roscommon and Dun Laoghaire should look after their own areas.  The point about it is that there was the insinuation to-day that there was gross neglect on the part of some of the authorities in Cork, because the Minister stated in his reply, &ldquo;Despite repeated efforts on my part&rdquo;.  I am pointing out that the Cork Corporation and the other bodies tried to hold a conference with the Minister to go into all these matters.  They had very good reason for asking for a conference because they had seen a lot of big blunders <Col N="399" /> made in Cork.  We were asked to put up a laundry.  I was in Mallow and I saw one of the most up-to-date laundries in the country there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably you have, Sir.  I want to know why the Minister will not come down to Cork or send someone down there.  The people are quite prepared to go ahead with any clinic.  They have the only mobile X-ray unit in the country and it ill becomes anybody to reflect on the efforts the people are making.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork people are the only people who have provided a mobile X-ray unit.  They have one of the most up-to-date clinics in the whole country.  Have we not in Cork a most competent medical officer of health and tuberculosis officer?  He has not insisted on this.  There has been no pressure of any kind by him and, as far as I am aware, he is quite satisfied with <Col N="400" /> the position.  There is no neglect. There are school inspections and everything else.  As far as helping in the eradication of tuberculosis is concerned, I think Cork is one of the foremost counties in that respect.  It ill becomes those who have never sat on public bodies to put down questions here and to make insinuations against people who spend practically every day of the week at this particular type of work.  I think the reply is unworthy of the Minister.  The Cork people have made every effort to co-operate with him and the fact the clinic is not there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As chairman of the board of assistance responsible for this area, I say in all sincerity that I regret the illness of Dr. Browne, Minister for Health, because I do not believe that, had he been replying to that question, he would have given the answer that was given to-day.  I do not believe that would have been his answer, and nobody can bear that out better than the chairman of the Cork County Sanatorium Committee, Deputy McAuliffe.  We were the pioneers of the mobile X-ray unit. That unit has frequently been lent to the Cork City area.  When the Minister came down to put the unit into operation he complimented us on our initiative in starting it, and it ill becomes representatives of constituencies to criticise when they come in here with a kind of jackass proposal.</P>

Every effort that could be made in regard to these matters has been made.  Any delay that has occurred in regard to this clinic and hospital treatment in Cork generally can be laid at the door of the Minister's Department.

      <P>The subject matter of the question relates to the provision of adequate X-ray facilities in the City of Cork.  That entails the provision of a suitable building wherein suitable X-ray apparatus may be housed.  In reply it was pointed out that steps should be taken to provide a health clinic in Cork City for this purpose. I have nothing but the greatest admiration and respect for the people of Cork, for Deputy McGrath and Deputy Corry, for the members of the Cork County Council and all the various officials.  They may be very good public men, men who have rendered good service to the country. The function of the Department of Health, however, is to ensure that adequate health facilities will be made available in Cork, as well as in Dublin or in any other part of the country. One of the first essentials in dealing with tuberculosis in this country is to ensure that adequate X-ray facilities are made available.  There are no adequate X-ray facilities available in Cork City.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>You have had your fling.  As far back as 1948 the Minister for Health wrote to the Cork Corporation, the Cork County Council and the South Cork Board of Public Assistance suggesting the erection in Cork City of clinic premises in which specialist services (including tuberculosis services) could be provided.  That was on the <Col N="403" /> 29th November, 1948.  What is the sequence of events?  First of all, some queries were raised in December and they were replied to on the 17th December, 1948, by the Department. A conference was held on the 1st February, 1949, in the Department at which the question of these clinics was discussed.  Then there was silence and on the 5th March, 1949, the Department of Health wrote to the Cork Corporation asking them what progress was being made.  On the 23rd March, 1949, a further letter was received from the Cork Corporation&mdash;four months after the matter had first been raised.  The letter is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I am directed by the Lord Mayor and Corporation of Cork to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 29th November last regarding the establishment of health clinics.  They ask me to inquire if the clinics are to be available to all sections of the community irrespective of means.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That was replied to and again we had silence.</P>
      <P>On the 2nd July, 1949, the Department of Health again wrote to the Cork Corporation asking them what progress was being made.  On the 13th August, 1949, the Department of Health wrote again to the Cork Corporation asking them what progress was being made.  Then a reply did come on the 16th August from the corporation, in effect throwing the blame on the county council, of which Deputy Corry is an esteemed member.  Finally, in desperation, the Minister for Health wrote to the Cork County Council on the 7th November, 1949.  Inasmuch as it has been suggested that the reply I gave to the Deputy in the House here to-day was one other than the Minister for Health would have given, let me read to the House what the Minister for Health wrote to the Cork County Council, sending at the same time a copy to the corporation and the board of assistance.  In the beginning of the letter he recites the efforts he made to try to have these clinics established in Cork.  He refers to the correspondence and goes on:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The Minister, with regret, must <Col N="404" /> inform the county council that, as he is deeply conscious of his serious responsibilities to the community generally and particularly to the people of Cork, he regards himself as having fulfilled his full duty to the people, first by initiating the provision of the clinics and by promising a generous grant towards the cost and by furnishing the county council with an outline schedule of accommodation.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Are you afraid to hear what was sent to the Cork County Council?  The letter goes on:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;He feels that he could not, in fairness to himself and his Department, continue to accept any further responsibility, either to the people of Cork or to the Dáil for any additional delay in proceeding with the project.  He has asked me to inform you that unless architects are appointed and detailed schedules of accommodation submitted to the Department at an early date, he can only regretfully conclude that the council has abandoned the proposal to provide these health clinics and the health-giving services to be provided therein and he must reluctantly decide to divert to other members of the community, whose councils appear to have a more acute sense of their responsibilities, the moneys which he had set aside as a grant towards the Cork and Bantry projects.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>What has this to do with the X-ray?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the clinics which will accommodate the X-ray apparatus.  We are discussing the failure of the Cork authorities to provide the clinics which are necessary to ensure the health of the people of Cork.  I should like to suggest to Deputies that, instead of coming here to raise issues out of which they will <Col N="405" /> not come with very much credit, they should divert their attention to making available to the people of Cork adequate X-ray facilities.  The facilities available at present in Cork consist of a fluoroscope, which is not adequate as an X-ray apparatus for detecting tuberculosis.  With all due respect, I think Deputies will agree that the Department of Health and the Minister are best qualified to decide as to what are the necessary facilities.  As regards the question of the Minister visiting the Cork Corporation, which has been mentioned by Deputy McGrath, I want to state that I have gone through the files.  The question of the clinics was never one of the matters raised in that correspondence. It regarded simply the use of Gurranebraher Hospital.</P>

      <P>I have read the letters and if the Deputy is not prepared to take my word, I shall show him the letters.  In addition to that, it was agreed, first of all, that a deputation from the Cork Corporation should come up.  They made an appointment with the Minister to come up and discuss the matter with him but they did not come.  A letter from the Minister was to come up for consideration at the Cork Corporation subsequently but there was no quorum. Subsequently, the Cork Corporation did the wise thing.  They got information locally and, having done so, wrote to the Minister agreeing to the proposals in regard to Gurranebraher.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Tuesday, 4th July, 1950.</P>
