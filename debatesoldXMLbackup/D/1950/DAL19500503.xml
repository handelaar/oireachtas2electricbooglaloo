      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave (for Minister for Agriculture)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the output of balanced poultry foods is limited at present by a scarcity of animal protein supplements.  Licences are being granted freely for the importation of fish meal and in recent months the quantity authorised to be imported is 630 tons.  Importers are, however, experiencing difficulty in securing supplies of fish meal of suitable quality on the world market at reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>As regards meat and bone meal every effort is being made to maximise home production and it is expected that the output will be substantially increased in the near future when it is hoped manufacture will start at two or three centres in Ireland.  The question of the importation of meat and bone meal is being considered but in view of the risk of the introduction of animal disease the greatest care must be exercised in deciding whether the importation of particular consignments of this commodity may be permitted.</P>
      <P>In the coming months the shortage of protein may be met by the use of separated milk, skim milk and buttermilk in the feeding of poultry.</P>

    <P>For the purposes of the scheme maximum and minimum rents have been fixed for (1) houses with water and sewerage services and (2) houses without those services.  The rent which each tenant is required to pay depends on the family income, i.e., the aggregate of the incomes from whatever source of those who ordinarily live in the house.  An exception is made in the case of income from children's allowances and scholarships awarded by the county council which are not reckoned for the purpose of calculating rent.</P>
    <P>(c)  As already indicated family income from whatever source is taken into account.  If family income falls for any reason the rent will be reviewed on notification being sent to the county council.</P>
    <P>(d)  The answer to this part of the question is in the negative.  I understand that the council will, at their meeting on the 8th instant, consider a recommendation from the housing committee that the graded rents scheme should remain in force unchanged for <Col N="1598" /> a further period at the end of which the working of the scheme will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to furnish a comprehensive list of villages in North Kerry where water and sewerage schemes are considered necessary, but the local authority's programme for the next few years makes provision for water schemes at <Col N="1600" /> Annascaul, Fenit, Newtownsandes, Tarbert and Ballyheigue; and for sewerage schemes at Annascaul, Ballyheigue, Ballylongford, Ballybunion and Brosna.  In addition, work is in progress on a sewerage scheme at Castlegregory; work has been authorised on a water supply at Ballybunion; and the preparation of plans and other documents for a water supply scheme at Lixnaw is proceeding.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to say how much of the foregoing programme of works will be completed during the course of the current financial year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the differences between his Department and the Kerry County Council regarding the cost of planning and of erection of the new Caherciveen hospital have yet been settled; and, further, if he will state the latest developments in connection with the erection of this much-delayed project.</P>

      <P>On 29th March, 1950, I informed the House of the latest position regarding this project, namely, that I had informed the local authority that I had determined the amount of the grant from the Hospitals' Trust Fund which would be available for the provision of a hospital at reasonable cost in accordance with suggestions which I had made.  The local authority <Col N="1605" /> were also informed that, if they wished to proceed with a more elaborate structure, I would be reluctantly prepared to agree to their doing so, but only on the basis that they themselves would bear the extra cost involved.</P>
      <P>I have received no communication from the local authority since then.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Briscoe</b> asked the Minister for Health if he will state (a) the total assets of the Hospitals' Trust Fund; (b) the amount invested and the annual income from investments; (c) the amount required to meet the deficits of the voluntary hospitals in the current year, and (d) the amount available for capital expenditure on 31st December, 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest balance sheet in respect of the Hospitals' Trust Fund shows that on 31st December, 1949, the total assets of the fund stood at £9,060,713 16s. 11d.</P>
      <P>The amount invested as at 31st March, 1950, which is the latest date for which a figure is available was £8,140,729.</P>
      <P>The income from the investments held by the fund amounted to £330,520 17s. 11d. for the year 1949. It will be appreciated that the income arising from investments is not a fixed one but varies with the amount invested.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say what the deficits of the voluntary hospitals will amount to in 1950.  The estimated figure for 1949 is £474,000.</P>
      <P>The full amount of the fund is available for capital expenditure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is an undertaking that the deficits of the voluntary hospitals will be made available from the investment fund of Hospitals' Trust moneys and that, therefore, if the full amount of the fund is available for capital expenditure <Col N="1606" /> these deficits will have to come out of taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGrath" hpid="Mr. McGrath Mr. McGrath">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister further aware that, in reply to a question which was put by Deputy Byrne, the Minister told him that all the capital funds were allocated for capital work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Briscoe's supplementary question is intended to convey that the deficits of the voluntary hospitals are in jeopardy, I should like to reassure him and the House that that is not so.  I am sure he will agree that it would be extremely unwise to keep vast sums invested in uncertain conditions instead of utilising them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that the income to the voluntary hospitals to meet the deficits was in jeopardy. As a result of the answer which the Minister has given, would he not agree that at the present time the deficits are met out of income accruing to the investment of Hospitals' Trust money, and that if this money is used up on capital expenditure the deficits will in future have to be met out of taxation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMacBride" hpid="Mr. MacBride Mr. MacBride">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacBride</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it will be agreed that it is unfortunate that a lot of this capital money was not utilised for the purpose of building hospitals some years ago, instead of our having to build them now, because it would have been possible to build then at a much lower figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that an Act was passed by this Parliament specifically making provision for the retention of a certain amount of the money to be invested for the purpose of assisting towards the upkeep of voluntary hospitals and that, since the increases in the hospitals have brought extra increases in their upkeep, it was expected that the previous method of supporting them, namely, voluntary subscription, would disappear?  That Act was passed by this Parliament deliberately to provide for the deficits which would ultimately accrue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan) Patrick McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year, having provided for taxation reliefs of £932,000, I budgeted for a surplus of £35,000, revenue being estimated at £72,916,500, and outlay on Central Fund and Supply Services, after deducting £600,000 for capital expenditure, at £72,881,000.  Additional supply of £9,200,874 was granted during the year, and the Exchequer issues finally totalled £81,211,766, representing an increase of £7,730,766 on the gross Budget figure of £73,481,000. Revenue payments into the Exchequer amounted to £74,025,758, leaving a deficit &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; of £7,186,008.</P>
      <P>By reference to the classification of &ldquo;capital services&rdquo; adopted for 1950-51 this deficit of £7,186,008 may be regarded as being more than offset by issues for such services, which amounted to £7,746,353, including £2,464,000 for capital advances to Córas Iompair Éireann.  When comparing the outturn for the year with the Budget forecast, however, it is more appropriate to deduct only £4,521,000 for capital outlay and, on this basis, last year's deficit becomes £2,665,008.</P>
      <P>The revenue receipts of £74,025,758 show an increase of £1,109,258 on the Budget forecast.  Of this increase tax revenue accounted for £1,040,500.  A noteworthy feature was that, despite the relief given last year, income-tax, including surtax, yielded £17,051,000, or £1,085,000 more than the Budget estimate of £15,966,000, by reason partly of improved collection of arrears and partly of the general increase in incomes.  Estate duties, stamp duties and motor vehicle taxation yielded, respectively, £129,000, £30,000 and £152,000 more than was expected but these increases were offset by a reduced yield of £328,500 from customs and excise duties and of £27,000 from corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P Just="Center">FINANCIAL YEAR, 1950-51.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the current year, expenditure chargeable against revenue is estimated at £75,676,553.  This figure comprises £66,013,553 for the non-capital services detailed in the published volume of Supply Estimates, an additional sum of £600,000 as a provision for Supplementary Estimates during 1950-51, and £9,063,000 to meet Central Fund charges.  The last-mentioned estimate shows an increase of £1,166,000 over actual issues in 1949-50, mainly for the service of public debt, which this year includes an annuity of £655,000 to redeem in full over a 30-year period the £12,113,680 <Col N="1619" /> of voted capital services which are being financed by borrowing.</P>
    <P>The provision of £600,000 for Supplementary Estimates is due to additional expenditure on a number of services, including increases in the pay of secondary teachers and forestry workers, certain defence items, a contribution to a welfare organisation for European relief and a scheme, for which an Estimate of £150,000 will shortly be introduced, to encourage firms and individuals to avail of the valuable technical assistance which is being afforded by the United States Economic Co-operation Administration. The provision will also enable me, after investigations which I intend to make, to give additional grants to university institutions, including for the first time St. Patrick's College, Maynooth.</P>
    <P>The original 1950-51 estimate for voted non-capital services, £66,013,000, represents a net increase of £445,000 on the comparable non-capital outlay in 1949-50.  There is a greatly increased provision for some of these services, which is offset by reductions in others. Roughly £1,140,000 more is being provided for education, £838,000 more for health services, £297,000 more for the Defence Forces, £178,000 more for grants in relief of rates on agricultural land and £260,000 more for postal and telegraph services.  On the other hand, to mention a few of the major reductions, the amount required for tea and sugar subsidies is down by £340,000, the subsidy payable for air services is £420,000 less, and no provision is made under this head for working losses of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <P>The revenue for 1950-51 at existing rates of taxation is estimated in the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure at £75,050,000.  The estimated tax revenue&mdash;£65,930,000&mdash;shows an increase of £833,000 over actual receipts last year, which is evidence of its continued buoyancy.  The non-tax revenue is estimated at £9,120,000&mdash;an increase of £191,000 on last year's receipts.  This, with a contribution of £300,000 from the Road Fund, will bring the total estimated revenue for 1950-51 to £75,350,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1620" /> The difference between the estimated outlay on non-capital services, £75,676,553, and the estimated income from tax and non-tax revenue, £75,350,000, is £326,553.  This deficit will be transformed into a surplus as a consequence of the proposals which I shall now outline.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TOBACCO.</P>
    <P>I expect to obtain an additional revenue of £350,000 this year from tobacco as a result of increased clearances from bond by manufacturers. The supply of cigarettes to the consumer is now primarily determined by the capacity to produce and market them and the control over releases is merely nominal.  It is, however, being retained as a safeguard against the possibility of future difficulty in maintaining stocks of tobacco leaf at the present level.  During 1949 the authorised rate of clearance of leaf from bond was twice raised and a further easement is now proposed. The manufacturers as a whole were unable to avail themselves fully in the past year of the additional releases but the amount of tobacco consumed in 1949-50 was over 1,400,000 lbs. more than in 1948-49.  Supplies of cigarettes are now fairly plentiful and the additional output expected during the current year should remove any shortage that still exists.</P>
    <P>In last year's Finance Act a preferential rate of customs duty was brought in as an inducement to tobacco manufacturers to obtain part of their supplies of leaf from countries outside the dollar area.  Following the conclusion last January of the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with the United States of America it was considered that the retention of the preferential rate would scarcely be in accord with the terms of the Treaty. I propose, therefore, to withdraw the preferential rate with effect from the 31st July next.  This date has been fixed so as to give reasonable notice to the tobacco manufacturers concerned. As a further safeguard for them provision will be made whereby non-dollar leaf purchased before that date will be accorded the benefit of the preferential rate.  The withdrawal of <Col N="1621" /> the preference will probably result in an additional yield of duty of about £25,000 in the current year and £40,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INCOME-TAX, CORPORATION PROFITS TAX AND ESTATE DUTY.</P>
    <P>I propose to have the exemption from income-tax of wound and disability pensions extended so as to include all such pensions granted under the Army Pensions Acts, 1923 to 1949, and all increases in such pensions under those Acts.  In view of the passing of the Army Pensions Act, 1949, and the Army Pensions (Increase) Act, 1949, the extension is necessary in order that all income from wound and disability pensions under the Acts may enjoy the exemption.</P>
    <P>I also propose that the exemption from income-tax given to widows of persons killed in the 1916 Rising should be extended to include the increased allowances granted under the Army Pensions (Increase) Act, 1949.</P>
    <P>This brings me to some cases which I think should receive exceptional treatment.  Representations have been made that allowances payable to relatives of signatories to the Proclamation of Easter Week, 1916, should not be subject to deduction by way of income-tax.  These allowances were exempted from income-tax for the first year.  I understand that one of the reasons for the non-continuance of the exemption in later years was that there had been no exempting provision in the case of the annuity payable under the Griffith Settlement Act, 1923.  I propose to have the allowances to relatives of signatories and the Griffith annuity exempted from income-tax for the future.</P>
    <P>I referred last year to negotiations which were in progress with the United States of America for conventions with a view to the avoidance, as between the two countries, of double taxation on income and on the estates of deceased persons.  These negotiations resulted in the making of two conventions, dealing, respectively, with income-taxes and estate taxes.  The <Col N="1622" /> conventions were signed on 13th September of last year.</P>
    <P>The income-taxes convention covers income-tax, surtax, and corporation profits tax in Ireland and the Federal income-taxes and surtaxes in the United States.  It provides for the reciprocal exemption of certain types of income, such as authors' royalties and interest, and, in regard to other types of income, such as dividends, provides for decreased rates of United States tax or exemption from Irish surtax.  One of its most important provisions is that which relates to relief by means of a &ldquo;credit&rdquo; of the tax of one of the countries against the tax of the other.  An Irish resident receiving, say, United States dividends from which United States tax has been withheld, and who is chargeable to Irish tax in respect of the dividends would, under this provision and subject to the confirming legislation, receive a credit against his Irish tax in respect of the United States tax.  This &ldquo;credit&rdquo; system of relief was one of the solutions of the general problem of double taxation recommended by a group of experts who examined the problem under the aegis of the League of Nations.  It is much in use in modern tax conventions.</P>
    <P>The liability to double taxation as between the two countries on the estates of deceased persons can arise where the deceased person was domiciled in one country at the time of his death and had possessions in the other. It can also arise in the case of a citizen of the United States, irrespective of his domicile.  The estate taxes convention provides for a system of relief by way of credit where there is double taxation of this sort.  It also provides a code for determining the situation of certain classes of property and one effect of this may be to charge to Irish estate duty, subject, of course, to relief from double taxation, some properties which were not previously so chargeable.</P>
    <P>Provisions will be included in the Finance Bill to confirm both conventions and to provide machinery for allowing United States income-taxes as a credit against Irish income-tax, surtax <Col N="1623" /> and corporation profits tax.  As the estate taxes convention may result in charging to estate duty some property not previously chargeable a Financial Resolution is necessary.</P>
    <P>The conventions will not come into force until they are ratified in the United States as well as here and, if ratified in both countries on or before 31st December of this year, the income-taxes convention will begin to have effect as regards Irish income-tax for the current income-tax year and as regards Irish surtax for the year ended 5th April last.  For the purposes of Irish corporation profits tax the material date would be 1st April of this year.  As to the United States taxes on income the convention would have effect for the taxable years beginning on and after 1st January, 1950.  The estate taxes convention would be effective as regards the estates of persons dying on or after the date on which it comes into force but could, on election by the personal representative, be applied also to the estate of a person dying in 1950 prior to that date.</P>
    <P>I propose to continue until 31st December, 1952, the exemption from corporation profits tax which has hitherto been granted to certain companies, including railway companies.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STAMP DUTY.</P>
    <P>Last year I promised to consider in connection with this Budget whether any modifications could be made in the 25 per cent. and 5 per cent. stamp duties on transfers or leases of houses and lands.  As regards the 25 per cent. duty, purchases of property in this country by non-nationals, never very considerable, have fallen away appreciably. While I do not like the principle of a discriminatory duty I do not propose to have the 25 per cent. rate abolished this year.  It still serves a useful purpose in giving an advantage to our own nationals in the acquisition of property and it provides some additional revenue.  It is estimated to produce £50,000 this year.</P>
    <P>As regards the 5 per cent. duty I have considered extending the upper <Col N="1624" /> limit of £1,000 to which a graduated scale now applies but regret that I am unable to propose any alteration in the incidence of the duty this year. The yield of duty at the 5 per cent. rate is estimated at over £600,000.  The matter will be reviewed again before next year's Budget.</P>
    <P>In my Budget Statement last year I referred to legal evasion of taxation. I pointed out that, when people discover gaps in the taxing net and use them for their own purposes, this means that the weight of taxation that has to be borne becomes to that extent unevenly and unfairly distributed.  I pointed out also that such evasions, if not stopped, might in the long run diminish appreciably the flow of revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Since last year a method of avoiding the normal incidence of stamp duty on the transfer of property has come under notice.  It may be explained broadly as follows: Instead of conveying the property on sale the parties arrange to have it transferred by way of lease for a long term at an adequate annual rent.  The lease, however, embodies an option for redemption of the whole or any part of the rent by payment of a sum amounting to, say, £20 for each £ of the rent redeemed. Thus, the lease is chargeable by reference to the rent only.  There is no fine or premium to attract the duty imposed by Section 24 of last year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Shortly after execution of the lease the option is exercised by redemption of, say, 99 per cent. of the rent, and the lease is endorsed accordingly.  The endorsement may be so drawn as not to be liable to stamp duty.  After exercise of the option the lessor assigns his remaining interest in the property &mdash;that is, the rent as reduced&mdash; and conveyance duty is chargeable on the consideration for the assignment. In consequence, that duty becomes chargeable only on a small proportion of the money passing.  I propose to move a Financial Resolution to-day to deal with this method of escaping tax.</P>
    <P>Under Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1947, which increased the stamp duty payable on conveyances <Col N="1625" /> or transfers of land, provision was made for exemption, from the increased rate of £5 per cent., of certain transfers.  The transfers I have in mind are those effected by a local authority under the provisions of the Housing of the Working Classes Acts, 1890 to 1931, or the Labourers Acts, 1883 to 1941, and also transfers by a society registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1936, and made in accordance with a scheme to provide houses for its members. When the Finance Bill, 1949&mdash; which applied the increased rates to premiums on leases&mdash;was being prepared it was believed that a similar exemption was not required.  It has since come to light, however, that in certain cases transfers of the types that were excepted from the increased rate in 1947 are carried out by way of lease.  I intend, therefore, to include in the Finance Bill a section designed to secure retrospectively that last year's legislation applying the increased rate of £5 per cent. to premiums on leases shall not affect leases of this kind.</P>
    <P>It has been represented to me by assurance companies that the law under which policies of industrial life assurance require to be individually stamped should be amended.  In the preparation of policies of industrial assurance the companies use forms which have been already stamped.  It is found in practice that numbers of these forms become spoiled or useless. The companies apply for and are granted&mdash;under statute&mdash;repayment of the duty impressed on the spoiled or useless policies.  The companies request authority to compound for the stamp duty payable in respect of industrial life assurance policies, that is, they wish that the individual policies should not be chargeable with stamp duty.  Instead, the companies would deliver periodical accounts and pay duty on the aggregate of the policies issued during the period.  I have accepted this proposal and the necessary provision will be made in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with the payment of arrears of old age pensions it has been decided to introduce a new corrective <Col N="1626" /> order of £5 denomination.  The corrective order would incorporate a form of receipt and in consequence the question of stamp duty would arise.  I propose to exempt such receipts from stamp duty.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ENTERTAINMENTS DUTY</P>
    <P>An entertainment is exempted from duty where it is shown that the net proceeds are to be devoted to educational, philanthropic or charitable purposes and that the expenses do not exceed 30 per cent. of the takings. Numerous cases which have come under notice indicate that in present conditions it is exceedingly difficult for the promoters of an entertainment to keep their expenses down to 30 per cent. of the takings.  The provision as it stands thus fails fully to achieve its purpose. It is proposed, therefore, to increase the expenses limit to 50 per cent. of the takings.  The cost of the concession in the current year will be about £20,000, or £25,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to extend to displays of amateur wrestling promoted by the Irish Amateur Wrestling Association and its affiliated clubs the exemption enjoyed by numerous other amateur sports such as boxing, fencing, badminton, etc.  The cost will be trifling.</P>
    <P Just="Center">APPRAISER'S LICENCE DUTY.</P>
    <P>It has been brought to notice that, as a result of the enactment of the Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1947, the scope of the long-standing exemption from appraiser's licence duty enjoyed by licensed auctioneers has been curtailed.  Provision will be included in the Finance Bill to restore the pre-1947 position.  The cost of the concession will be inconsiderable.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EFFECT OF BUDGET PROPOSALS</P>
    <P>The effect of the various proposals I have outlined is to convert the deficit of £326,553 into a surplus of £28,447.  This result is all the more satisfactory in that it has been achieved without increasing taxation and after providing £600,000 for Supplementary Estimates.  I regret, of course, that further reliefs in taxation are not possible this year, but it will be appreciated that in existing <Col N="1627" /> economic circumstances, when State investment is being substantially increased on the basis of borrowings, financial wisdom precludes changes that might result in a deficit on the current budget.</P>
    <P Just="Center">OBJECTS OF CURRENT EXPENDITURE OF THE STATE.</P>
    <P>Of the total estimated expenditure of £75.7 million on current services in 1950-51, social services and employment schemes account for roughly £13.7 million, food subsidies for £11.6 million, educational services for £9,000,000, agriculture, forestry and fisheries for £6.8 million, postal and telegraph services and broadcasting for £5.4 million, the service of debt for £6.3 million, Army pay and pensions for £4.8 million, administration of justice for £3.6 million, health services for £3.3 million and other services for the balance of £11,000,000.  It is clear from this broad analysis that, apart from providing for basic administrative services and helping to improve health, education and productive efficiency, the current Budget also has an important function as a means of redistributing incomes in the interests of social justice.</P>
    <P Just="Center">COSTS OF ADMINISTRATION.</P>
    <P>Last year, I estimated the total amount of personnel charges (including superannuation) in the Supply Services at £24.5 million.  The provision in this year's Estimates is £26.4 million, an increase of £1.9 million.  The items in the total are: Civil Service, £12.1 million; national teachers, £5.6 million; secondary teachers, £0.5 million; Defence Forces, £2.5 million; Garda Síochána, £2.9 million; superannuation and pensions, £2.8 million.  These figures include increases of £0.6 million for the Civil Service, due to an increase in numbers and normal progression on the incremental scales and of £0.9 million for national teachers, attributable to the salary award which came into operation at the beginning of the financial year.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service, when superannuation costs are reckoned, is responsible for more than half of the <Col N="1628" /> total personnel charges borne on the Exchequer.  It is disappointing to find that its cost is still rising.  In view, however, of the great expansion in the activities of almost all Departments of State, it is not surprising that it should be so, and I can assure the House that no effort is spared in my Department to ensure that expenditure on the Civil Service is kept to the minimum consistent with efficient administration and fair treatment of the various classes of civil servants.</P>
    <P>A year ago I said that economies in the cost of administration should be obtainable through improvements in organisation and methods of work. Since then it has been decided to appoint in each of the larger Departments a specially-trained officer to survey the work in detail with a view to simplifying procedure, eliminating wastage, and generally speeding up the discharge of public business. Special investigations have also been carried out during the year with a view to weeding out staff redundancies, mechanising routine tasks, simplifying procedures and forms, increasing output through improved layout and equipment and so on.  The results achieved so far have been encouraging, but, of course, large-scale improvements or economies will take some time to achieve.</P>
    <P Just="Center">LOCAL AUTHORITY REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>One of the tables I have circulated shows the growth since 1938-39 in the current outlay of local authorities and the extent to which their expenditure is met by local taxation and by Government grants.  Total current expenditure has risen from £12.3 million in 1938-39 to an estimated £28.4 million this year, but whereas Government grants to local authorities have increased from £4.8 million to £15.2 million, that is by £10.4 million, rates have risen from £6.3 million to £10.9 million, that is by £4.6 million.  The greater part of the current outlay of local bodies is now being met from the Exchequer.  Since 1938-39 rates have gone up by 73 per cent. while Central Government taxation has increased by 154 per cent. These figures should help towards a <Col N="1629" /> better appreciation of the extent to which taxpayers generally have relieved ratepayers of the cost of services administered by local authorities. The Central Government also provides most of the finance required by local authorities for capital expenditure.</P>
    <P Just="Center">II. CAPITAL BUDGET.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE.</P>
    <P>One of the primary responsibilities of a Government is to promote, by an enlightened budgetary and investment policy, the continuous and efficient use of national resources in men and materials.  A sound economic system is an essential condition of progress but, unfortunately, the automatic working of economic forces does not guarantee that available resources will adequately and unfailingly be employed to advance the national interest.  The modern democratic State is, therefore, rightly expected, not only to maintain the essential liberties of its citizens, but to take an active part in securing conditions favourable to their material well-being.  This entails a continuous survey of the economic and social scene and effective intervention, not merely to protect the community against the worst effects of the periodic set-backs to which modern economies are subject, but to ensure that there is adequate capital investment to develop the national economy and to provide ample opportunities for productive employment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEED FOR INCREASED INVESTMENT IN IRELAND.</P>
    <P>The need for further capital development in Ireland is apparent.  Under-investment in our own resources is in part responsible for unemployment and under-employment, for involuntary emigration, impoverished land, industrial under-development, bad housing and other defects in our economic and social structure.  A more intensive long-term programme of capital development calls for greater savings from the community but these would be augmented by the improvement in the incomes, health and efficiency of <Col N="1630" /> the community which wise domestic investment would secure.  The extent to which Irish capital has been invested abroad is sometimes taken as an indication of perverse policy.  It is, of course, incorrect to view Ireland's sterling holdings in this light.  They represent, in the main, the forced savings of two war periods when the general standard of living was compulsorily reduced by shortage of imports.  In normal times no net external investment takes place.  The value of the savings held abroad is that they yield purchasing power over imports, support the exchange value of our currency, and form a reservoir of accumulated resources from which, by the will of the owners and with due regard to the balance of national advantage, the stream of future savings can be augmented in the interests of a progressive policy of domestic investment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRIVATE AND PUBLIC INVESTMENT.</P>
    <P>Private investment is being encouraged in many ways&mdash;by protective tariffs and quotas, by State guarantees, by income-tax concessions, etc.&mdash; and enjoys a degree of security unusual in the world to-day.  There is, however, a wide range of useful capital work which private investors cannot be expected to undertake and which, therefore, must be done on a collective basis by the State.  There is investment which, though expected to be directly remunerative, is beyond the resources of private enterprise to undertake or to finance; power development is an example.  There is investment, such as land reclamation and afforestation, from which the returns may not be immediate or conspicuous enough to stimulate private enterprise.  There is capital outlay, such as on telephone development and the improvement of communications, which can only be undertaken efficiently on a broad scale, and investment in the health and social welfare of the community, through the provision of houses and hospitals, which is unprofitable in a financial sense but confers real benefits and may ultimately lead to an improvement in national productivity.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1631" /> STATE INVESTMENT IN IRELAND</P>
    <P>During the past two years there has been a great increase in State-financed investment in Ireland.  The traditional method of presenting the Budget and the national accounts tended to obscure this development. The so-called &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; issues for capital purposes reveal an increase from £5.5 million in 1947-48 to £9.1 million in 1948-49 and £14.2 million in 1949-50.  In the White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure it is estimated that these &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; issues will amount to £19.6 million in the current financial year.  The expansion in this category of capital outlay by the State is all the more marked when comparison is made with 1938-39, when the comparable outlay was only £1.5 million.  Advances to the Electricity Supply Board in 1950-51 are estimated at £4,750,000 as compared with advances of £802,700 in 1938-39.  Advances to the Local Loans Fund in 1950-51 are expected to reach £9,750,000 as against £450,000 in 1938-39, and advances to meet telephone capital expenditure are estimated at £2,250,000 this year as against actual issues of £240,000 in 1938-39.  Concurrently with this increase in &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; capital issues there has been a tremendous growth during the past year or so in capital expenditure &ldquo;above the line,&rdquo; that is, in voted capital expenditure chargeable against borrowings.  Housing, land rehabilitation, drainage, school buildings, afforestation, harbour works, are amongst the main headings under which this increase has taken place. The amount provided for these capital services in the Volume of Estimates for 1950-51 is £12,113,680, and the importance of this branch of voted expenditure has been marked by the segregation of the capital from the other services included in the Volume of Estimates.  An opportunity is now presented for bringing together the estimates of capital outlay both above and below the line, in other words, for presenting a Capital Budget of the Central Government which will focus attention on the extent and nature of State investment. It is desirable that the public <Col N="1632" /> should know the extent and purposes of the investment which is being undertaken on their behalf, and that there should be adequate consideration of its financial, economic and social aspects.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATE CAPITAL BUDGET, 1950-51.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is already aware of the constituents of the sum of £12,113,680 included for capital services in the Volume of Estimates for the current year.  The White Paper of Receipts and Expenditure itemises the &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; capital issues which are estimated at £19.6 million.  To this estimate of capital outlay of £31.7 million in 1950-51, there should be added the expenditure of the balance of over £1.6 million which remained in the Transition Development Fund at 31st March, 1950, and the proposed reissue from the Local Loans Fund of capital repayments of over £0.7 million accruing in 1950-51.  The total capital budget of the Central Government for 1950-51 may, therefore, be put at £34,000,000.  The purposes to which this sum will be devoted may be classified as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>In addition to this State-financed outlay, capital expenditure on housing of about £3,500,000 will be incurred by Dublin and Cork County Boroughs, bringing the gross public outlay on new houses to over £17,500,000.  Contributions by the State towards housing loan charges of local authorities are not included above; they are estimated to amount this year to £758,000.</P>
    <P>During the year it is intended to take steps to reduce the existing complexity of housing finance.  At present State assistance for local authority housing is provided in four forms: by advances from the Local Loans Fund, by two kinds of annual grant from the Vote for Local Government&mdash;one to meet the statutory contribution towards loan charges and the other to subsidise temporarily the interest charge&mdash;and by lump sum grants from the Transition Development Fund. This fund is being continued until 31st March, 1951, but it will then be wound up, the assistance it now affords being merged in the charges against the Vote for Local Government.  The effect of this variety of devices is that over half the capital cost of local authority housing is borne by the taxpayer, the remainder being borne in varying proportions by local authorities (i.e., by ratepayers) and tenants. There is no doubt that many of the tenants of subsidised houses could afford to pay an economic rent or a rent approaching closer to it than they now pay.  The differential renting system is being encouraged in order to distribute more equitably the heavy burden of housing costs.</P>
    <P>As well as bearing over one-half <Col N="1634" /> the cost of houses built by local authorities, the State is contributing generously towards the cost of houses built by private persons and public utility societies.  During the past year roughly 2,500 such houses were completed with the aid of grants from the Department of Local Government. In the current year it is expected that 4,000 more will be completed.  The total provision for grants is £1,725,000, including £40,000 for special grants for housing in Gaeltacht areas.  Encouraged by this assistance private house building is proceeding at a rate much greater than pre-war as, indeed, is necessary to overtake the arrears of the war years.  In recognition of the present exceptionally high costs to the Exchequer of the capital grants for private housing and of the necessity for a rapid improvement in housing conditions generally, it was decided that the grants for private housing should, for the time being, be met from borrowing, so that there would be no financial impediment to progress with the housing drive and the taxpayers of to-day would not have to carry an unduly heavy financial burden.  The effect of including these grants amongst the Capital Services in the Volume of Estimates is that the cost of financing them will be spread over a period of 30 years, during which the borrowing will be repaid in full out of current revenue.</P>
    <P>The employment afforded by the housing activity of local authorities and private builders is in itself a great social advantage which has indirect benefits in many directions.  On the other hand, the magnitude of the programme inevitably involves certain risks.  The resources of the building industry are at full stretch.  Skilled labour is still short, and our cement industry is unable to meet the unprecedented demand, with the result that large quantities of much dearer cement have to be imported.  In view of the intensive building activity which is being generated by State assistance, building costs require special attention so as to ensure that no section of the community profits unduly from the urgent necessity, on social and health grounds, of improving the housing of the population.</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="1635" /> PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES.</P>
    <P>State assistance for such public health services as the provision of water and sanitary facilities is complementary to State assistance for housing.  It is estimated that this year State finance will be provided for such schemes to the amount of £1.16 million, partly by way of loans from the Local Loans Fund and partly in the form of grants from the Employment Schemes Vote and the Transition Development Fund.</P>
    <P Just="Center">HOSPITALS.</P>
    <P>Advances from the Local Loans Fund for County Homes and Mental Hospitals are estimated at £417,000. A further £2,000,000 may be spent from Hospitals' Trust Fund moneys on the provision and extension of hospitals.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT.</P>
    <P>The drainage which is being done under the land rehabilitation project, under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, and, on the basis of catchment areas, under the Arterial Drainage Act, combined with the liming and fertilising of impoverished land, represents a comprehensive effort to restore millions of acres of land to full productivity and so increase the national wealth.  The provision this year for the land rehabilitation project and water supplies is £3.1 million, for local authority drainage and similar works, £1,750,000, and for arterial drainage, £652,000, making a total of over £5,500,000.  Agricultural recovery should be further aided by the provision of £350,000 for grants for the construction and improvement of farm buildings, of another £350,000 for the promotion of poultry and egg production and of £60,000 for the National Stud.  This total outlay of £6,250,000 is being treated as proper to be met from borrowing, a course suggested by its developmental character but which will, in the end, be justified only if the expected increase in agricultural output is secured and is consolidated by an improvement in competitive efficiency in the export market.</P>
    <P>Within the last few months additional capital of £100,000 was made <Col N="1636" /> available to the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  Ltd., via the American Loan Counterpart Fund.  In many cases where the making of a loan is approved in principle by the corporation the loan cannot, in fact, be issued because the applicant is not registered in the Land Registry as the owner of the farm which is to provide the security for the loan.  Difficulties of a somewhat similar nature which arose soon after the corporation was established in 1927 were resolved by the passing of the Agricultural Credit Act, 1928.  The present difficulties have arisen because the original purchasing tenants under the Land Purchase Act are dead and the legal formalities required for the registration of the present occupiers as owners of the lands have not been completed.  The matter is being examined in the hope of finding a method by which farmers who are otherwise credit-worthy will be enabled to obtain on loan from the corporation the capital necessary for the efficient working of their lands.</P>
    <P Just="Center">ELECTRICITY DEVELOPMENT.</P>
    <P>From the initiation of the Shannon scheme up to 31st March, 1950, the State has provided a gross sum of £25,000,000 for electricity development. Over the next decade further finance on a substantial scale will be required to enable the board to meet the anticipated expansion in demand.  Gross capital expenditure by the board in 1950/51 is estimated at £5.9 million of which £4.75 million will have to be covered during the year by Exchequer advances, the balance being met temporarily by borrowings from depreciation reserves and superannuation funds. The expansion of generating capacity will absorb half the gross outlay, the principal items being the harnessing of the River Erne and the construction of a turf-burning station at Allenwood. During 1949/50 three new generating stations went into operation, the first turf-fired unit at Clonsast and the Leixlip and North Wall stations, capable between them of producing 100,000,000 units a year.  Five new generating stations are under construction and this year the Cliff station on the Erne and the second unit at Clonsast, with a combined output of <Col N="1637" /> about 100,000,000 units in a good year, are expected to be brought into service.</P>
    <P>Considerable progress is being made with rural electrification in spite of the physical difficulties.  The additional number of rural subscribers connected in 1949-50 was 13,688 as compared with 9,262 in 1948/49 and 2,203 in 1947/48.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TURF DEVELOPMENT.</P>
    <P>Closely connected with the programme of electricity development are the plans for utilisation of native fuel resources in the form of turf.  A high proportion of the projected output of machine-won turf by Bord na Móna will be transformed into electric energy at generating stations on the bogs. Clonsast is the first of such stations and a second, at Allenwood, is already under construction.  Legislation has been introduced to provide further advances for Bord na Móna to enable the 1,000,000-ton scheme authorised by the 1946 legislation to be completed. Under a second scheme, total annual output would in time reach 2,000,000 tons.  In anticipation of amending legislation the advances required by Bord na Móna this year are put at £1,500,000, of which £1,275,000 relates to the existing scheme.  Of the £3,750,000 provided for this scheme in 1946, £3,107,557 had already been advanced at the 31st March, 1950, leaving only £642,443 available until the amending legislation is passed.  The original scheme is now estimated to cost a total of £5,520,000.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TELEPHONE DEVELOPMENT.</P>
    <P>The £2,250,000 of new capital for the telephone system this year is required for three main purposes.  About £1,000,000 will be spent on the main cable from Dublin to Cork, with branches to Waterford and Athlone, on which work is in progress.  Extensions of the automatic exchange system will require a further £500,000.  The linking up of some 9,000 new subscribers and various improvements in the system will account for the remainder of the capital outlay.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TRANSPORT.</P>
    <P>Including £26,000 for loans from the Local Loans Fund, capital of £276,000 <Col N="1638" /> for permanent improvements to harbours is being provided from State funds this year.  When to this is added constructional work on airports of £333,000 and advances for roads and bridges of £801,000, the estimate of State-financed capital outlay on transport for the year comes to £1,410,000. This sum is additional to an estimated expenditure of about £5,000,000 by local authorities on the maintenance and improvement of roads, financed partly from the proceeds of motor vehicle taxation and partly from the rates.  Under the Transport Bill the capital requirements of Córas Iompair Éireann will be met by the issue of State-guaranteed debentures.  No subsidy towards the working expenses of Córas Iompair Éireann has been provided for in the Supply Services Estimates for 1950-51.  To ease the company's immediate difficulties, provision is, however, being made for advances of £450,000 to meet debenture interest payments.  It is imperative that, by economies and, if necessary, by increased charges, the company should, as soon as possible, put itself in a position to pay its way without the aid of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATE DEBT.</P>
    <P>The financing of the programme of State investment outlined above will call for borrowing on a considerable scale.  In 1950-51 the sum required will be of the order of £31,000,000, allowing for the reissue of loan repayments received by the Exchequer and the Local Loans Fund and for the balance available at the 31st March, 1950 in the Transition Development Fund.  This borrowing will involve an immediate and corresponding increase in the national debt, although the ultimate increase will be modified by the provision which is being made for redemption of the debt now being incurred. Before considering how the £31,000,000 may be raised a reference to the present state of the public debt is desirable.</P>
    <P>The gross State debt on the 31st March, 1950, stood at £157,000,000 as compared with £116,000,000 on 31st March, 1949.  The gross increase of £41,000,000 is due as to almost <Col N="1639" /> £20,000,000 to dollar borrowings from the Government of the United States. The internal debt increased, therefore, by £21,000,000.  The gross debt at present is equivalent to somewhat more than two years' yield of taxation or over two-fifths of the national income. Many countries are carrying a heavier burden of debt.  The service charges this year are estimated at £6.3 million or about 8 per cent. of current outlay. The national credit stands high and the possession of substantial external assets strengthens our ability to finance schemes of national development.  It is, nevertheless, essential, if the burden on the taxpayer for the service of debt is to be kept within tolerable limits, that the objects for which State debt is incurred should, as far as possible, be productive of an adequate financial return.  The need, on social grounds, to incur heavy outlay, only partially remunerative, in order to remedy the housing shortage makes it all the more desirable that the other objects of State borrowing should be fully productive in the financial sense.  By this I mean that they should produce a revenue sufficient to service the loan charges either by yielding a direct return or by increasing the national income and so augmenting the yield of taxation.  The Government is confident that the schemes of development which are being financed by borrowing will, in general, satisfy this test.</P>

    <P>At this point, it may be useful to cast a backward glance at the State investment already undertaken.  At the 31st March, 1949, the total State investment for commercial, financial and industrial purposes by way of repayable advances to, and purchases of shares in, State enterprises amounted to £27.6 million.  This had increased to £31.7 million at the 31st March, 1950. The gross amount received by way of interest and dividends on this investment during the year 1949-50 was £938,000 of which £858,000 came from the Electricity Supply Board.  This represents a return of 3.4 per cent. on the amount invested at the beginning <Col N="1640" /> of the year.  The average rate of interest on long-term debt outstanding is 3.6 per cent.  The direct return to the Exchequer from these enterprises may, therefore, be regarded as reasonably satisfactory.  It is hoped that some of the organisations, such as Bord na Móna, which are still in the developmental stage, will soon be in a position to discharge their obligations to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In 1938, the first year for which an official estimate of national income is available, taxation of all kinds represented about 23 per cent. of national income.  The proportion for 1950-51 is much the same, showing that, on a broad view, Government borrowing and spending has not imposed an increased strain on the economy.</P>
    <P Just="Center">STATE GUARANTEES.</P>
    <P>In connection with the direct State debt, reference should be made to the contingent liability incurred by the State in respect of guarantees.  This form of State assistance has been instrumental in securing working capital and even development capital for various State and semi-State organisations.  The total principal liability on foot of guarantees of bank overdrafts of State-sponsored companies amounted to £7.7 million on the 31st March last and the guarantee of debentures of Córas Iompair Éireann was £12.9 million at that date.  During 1949-50, the State was called upon to discharge its liability as guarantor of £1,550,000 of Córas Iompair Éireann debentures.  The sum of £7.7 million includes over £4.3 million for the guaranteed overdraft of Fuel Importers, Limited.  Here again a call upon the Exchequer is in sight, as losses on the disposal of the company's fuel stocks will have amounted to about £3,000,000 by the end of the current year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">RISKS IN STATE INVESTMENT.</P>
    <P>Apart from increasing the burden on the taxpaper, an unduly rapid rate of increase in the State debt may have other undesirable consequences, which it must and will be the aim of the Government to avoid.  The risk of inflation will arise if methods of financing <Col N="1641" /> are employed which involve the introduction of an excessive volume of new purchasing power.  This risk is less serious when the supply of goods can be augmented by the repatriation of external assets, when incomes are rising and the community increases its savings and while there is still a reserve of manpower available for gainful occupation at home.  There is the further risk of a lowering of living standards if home production does not expand in such a manner as to compensate for the loss of the income derived from the external assets which are realised to finance domestic capital outlay, but some relaxation of this principle is permissible where the security of the capital is enhanced by employing it at home.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SOURCES OF FINANCE.</P>
    <P>There are various sources from which this year's investment programme of £31,000,000 may be financed.  Immediately available is the pool of American loan counterpart moneys of which over £13,000,000 was still uninvested at 31st March last. These counterpart resources will be augmented in the course of the current year.  The Central Fund Act, 1949, authorised the investment of the American Loan Counterpart Fund in Government securities and £8,500,000 was drawn from the Fund last year for Ways and Means Advances to the Exchequer.  There will be further recourse to the Fund this year for the long-term capital required to finance the land rehabilitation project, local authority drainage works, harbour improvements and minerals development. The Fund may also continue to be used, to some extent, as a temporary source of finance for other items of capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>There are various other funds under Government control, such as the Post Office Savings Bank Fund and the social insurance funds, the accruing resources of which, subject to preservation of an adequate degree of liquidity, can be invested in Irish Government securities and thus made available to finance State capital outlay. The balances awaiting investment in funds under my control amounted to over £2,000,000 on the <Col N="1642" /> 31st March last.  During the year it is expected that new Post Office Savings Bank deposits to an amount of about £5,000,000 will become available for investment.  The funds under Government control also provide a valuable financial reserve in so far as they hold substantial sterling investments which, within certain limits, might gradually be replaced by Irish Government securities.  It is necessary, however, to bear in mind that the realisation of sterling assets and the use of counterpart moneys are methods of finance unrelated to current savings and, as such, may have inflationary tendencies.  Recourse to such sources must, in present conditions, be cautious, and the greatest care will be taken by the Government in choosing the methods of financing its capital programme, to ensure that there will be no adverse consequences for the economy.</P>
    <P>It is essential that as much as possible of the capital required for State investment should be met from current savings.  The public will, in the course of the year, when conditions appear favourable, be afforded an opportunity of placing its savings at the disposal of the Government by subscribing to a new National Loan.  I am confident that the public response will show a recognition of the need for further national development and of the excellent security of Irish Government stock.  I am also confident of continued public interest in the Post Office Savings Bank and in Savings Certificates, channels through which a substantial volume of current savings is reaching the Government.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SMALL SAVINGS.</P>
    <P>I may refer here, with gratification, to the great increase in small savings recorded during the past year.  The improvement in Saving Bank deposits, which followed upon the restoration from the 1st July, 1948, of the traditional 2½ per cent. rate of interest and was further stimulated by the publicity campaign inaugurated in November, 1948, continued during 1949.  By comparison with a net deposit in the Savings Banks in 1948 of £1,591,000 the net deposit in 1949 came to £4,695,000. <Col N="1643" /> These favourable results may be contrasted with the net withdrawal of £241,000 which took place in 1947.  Total deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank, including accrued interest, are estimated at £52,000,000 on 31st March, 1950, an increase of almost £6,000,000 on the figure at 31st March, 1949.</P>
    <P>Savings in the form of Savings Certificates have also revived, though not to the same degree.  In 1949 the net sales of Saving Certificates, after deducting repayments with interest, amounted to £233,000 as compared with an excess of repayments of £51,000 in 1948.  The State's liability (principal and interest) to holders of Savings Certificates is estimated at £17.7 million on 31st March last as against £17.1 million a year before.</P>
    <P Just="Center">III.  ECONOMIC SURVEY.</P>
    <P Just="Center">AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES.</P>
    <P>It is now time to survey the economic conditions in which the programme of State investment is likely to take place. Obviously, State investment can be properly considered only when it is brought into relation with estimates of private investment and of the resources likely to be available for investment, after consumption needs are met.  Only by placing it in its proper context in this way can any judgment be formed of its practicability and of its general implications for the national economy.  Hitherto, such a survey has not been possible in the absence of current estimates of national income, expenditure and capital formation.  This year, although the preparation of such estimates by the Central Statistics Office is well advanced, only provisional indications can yet be given and these must be regarded as subject to revision.</P>
    <P>The national income is taken to be the aggregate current value, before payment of taxes and rates, of incomes in money and kind of persons normally resident in the State, for services which command a monetary reward whether performed currently or in the past. The national income, so defined, is estimated to have been about £320,000,000 in 1947, £335,000,000 in <Col N="1644" /> 1948 and £350,000,000 in 1949; the official estimate for 1938 was £154,000,000. These estimates are necessarily given in money terms and, therefore, reflect the changes in money values since 1938. It is not possible at this stage of the investigations to allow accurately for the increase in prices as it affects national expenditure, but there are grounds for concluding that the national standard of living is now, on the whole, higher than it was pre-war.</P>
    <P>The income of agriculturists (farmers, their families and wage earners) constitutes a higher proportion of the national income than in 1938&mdash;about 30 per cent. as against 25 per cent. Wages and salaries, including agricultural wages, and the remainder of national income form about the same proportion of national income now as in 1938.</P>
    <P>Estimates of national income and expenditure afford a general picture of the resources at the disposal of the community in any year and of the purposes to which these resources are applied.  This picture may, perhaps, be better understood in terms of market prices, which means that the figure of national income&mdash;which, broadly speaking, represents income originating from production and services&mdash;has to be adjusted by the addition of taxes that add to prices, the subtraction of subsidies that reduce prices and the addition of depreciation allocations which, of course, are not treated as income.  When this adjustment is made, the estimates for 1948 and 1949 become £377,000,000 and £395,000,000, respectively.  The resources available in any year for domestic use are augmented or diminished by the net inflow or outflow of goods and services as shown in the balance of payments; a net surplus indicates a transfer of resources abroad for investment and a net deficit a repatriation of investments previously made abroad or incurring of external debt.  In 1948, the net external disinvestment was £20,000,000 and in 1949 it may have been about £10,000,000, but this is still a provisional estimate.  We may, therefore, put the total resources available for <Col N="1645" /> domestic use in 1948 and 1949 at £397,000,000, and, say, £405,000,000, respectively.  This is the pool available for consumption, including repairs and maintenance, and for investment, including renewals.  Consumption, by private persons and by public authorities, is estimated at £347,000,000 in 1948 and at £354,000,000 in 1949, and gross investment at home&mdash;defined as new capital goods brought into use and increase in stocks and work in progress &mdash;at £50,000,000 in 1948 and £51,000,000 in 1949.  Investment included, in 1948, over £8,000,000 of additions to stocks and work in progress, but in 1949 additions to producers' capital goods formed a higher proportion.  In 1948 domestic capital formation may be regarded as having been met as to almost one-half by the realisation of external assets whereas in 1949 it was provided for to a greater extent out of current savings.</P>
    <P>A substantial part of the domestic investment which occurred in 1949 was financed by the State.  In 1950/51 State-financed investments may be as much as £10,000,000 in excess of the 1949/50 level.  Assuming that private capital outlay is at least maintained, provision for this additional State-financed investment can be made only in two ways: by a greater allocation of current resources to domestic investment or by heavier external disinvestment. An increase in domestic production would enable more current resources to be set aside for investment without any curtailment of consumption, but no increased allocation will take place unless savings increase, as this is the means by which resources are diverted from consumption to investment.  Increased saving is, therefore, of the first importance as a basis of orderly national development.  In this context, I may also stress the need for avoiding increases in incomes not related to increases in output.  An expansion in consumption generated by increases in money incomes would deplete the resources available for investment and have inflationary consequences.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the State investment programme can be carried through without causing inflation or <Col N="1646" /> restricting the amount of capital available for private enterprise, if output is expanded, if resources are withdrawn from consumption by increased savings, and any deficiency in the resources so set aside for investment is made good by external disinvestment in the form of imports of goods.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REPATRIATION OF STERLING ASSETS.</P>
    <P>The probable dependence of the 1950/51 investment programme on further external disinvestment calls for some comment.  The Government favour the repatriation of sterling assets where it is clearly in the interests of domestic development.  To ensure that the general standard of living of the community is at least preserved the reduced purchasing power over imports, resulting from the loss of income from the sterling investments realised should be made good by a compensating expansion in production for the home market or for export.  Even if the external balance is not fully restored by increased exports or reduced imports arising from higher domestic output, some net loss of external purchasing power may be regarded as a premium worth paying for the expansion of employment and the greater economic and social security which domestic investment is expected to afford.  These basic principles command general acceptance to-day, but there is still some confusion about certain aspects of the question of repatriation of external assets.</P>
    <P>Repatriation can take place only through imports of goods and services in excess of current earnings, that is, through a deficit in the balance of payments. Only in this way can the realisation of sterling assets add to the pool of resources available.  Unless the proceeds of sale of sterling investments are used to pay for imports of goods and services, no net reduction can take place in the sterling in Irish ownership.  If there is no deficit in the balance of payments, the sale of sterling assets by some Irish holders merely leads to an increase in the holdings of others.</P>
    <P>Repatriation, which depends on the import of goods, must thus be clearly <Col N="1647" /> distinguished from the sale of sterling investments, the immediate effect of which is merely to transform a sterling holding into cash available for spending in Ireland.  Without an increase in imports a sale of sterling assets can only mean a switch to active domestic use of purchasing power hitherto dormant. Unless this extra purchasing power finds an outlet in increased purchases from abroad, involving a deficit in the balance of payments, it is almost certain to be inflationary.  So far, therefore, as the investment programmes of public authorities and private enterprise are financed out of new purchasing power, there is a danger of inflation which will, however, be offset to the extent that domestic output of consumer goods and domestic savings increase and external assets are repatriated in the form of imports.  It is evident that the owners of sterling investments who sell them to pay for imports of plant, machinery, timber and other goods are effectively repatriating their sterling holdings in the sense defined above.  Effective repatriation also takes place when bank deposits are drawn upon to pay for imports and the sterling holdings of the commercial banks are thus reduced.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to bear in mind not only that the essential condition of repatriation is a deficit in the balance of payments but also that the mere existence of a deficit is not evidence of the repatriation of sterling assets for domestic development.  The import surplus may go merely to increase current consumption, there being no net increase in capital investment. Direct capital expenditure by the State is a net addition to domestic capital development only in so far as it does not restrict or delay private domestic investment which would otherwise have taken place.  It is only if the deficit in the balance of payments is accompanied by a corresponding net increase in capital outlay at home that it can be said that sterling assets are being realised for domestic development.  The question cannot be decided merely by considering the amount of capital goods imported as <Col N="1648" /> this may be proportionate only to the normal level of domestic investment and, in any case, the latter involves the use of domestic resources of labour, food, materials, etc., as well as of imported supplies of capital and consumer goods.  For these reasons, the resources approach is obviously the correct one, as it estimates the total volume of investment and the extent to which it is expected to be provided for by current savings and by external disinvestment.</P>
    <P>The improvement of productive efficiency in industry and in agriculture by the import of modern plant and machinery is one of the most desirable forms of repatriation of sterling assets. Improved efficiency is so urgently necessary to keep pace with developments elsewhere and to expand production on sound economic lines that the Government hope that full advantage will be taken of the technical assistance which is being afforded by the Economic Co-operation Administration.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONTINUOUS REVIEW OF STATE INVESTMENT.</P>
    <P>The State can exercise directly only a limited influence on the repatriation of sterling assets, which must depend mainly on the decisions of the owners of sterling investments and of bank deposits.  It can, however, indirectly promote repatriation for productive domestic development by maintaining conditions favourable to private investment in our own resources and by its own investment and financial policy. The resources available for consumption and investment and the disposal of resources between these competing uses cannot be accurately predicted and it is, therefore, essential, if undesirable economic and social consequences are to be avoided, that there should be a continuous survey of the reactions of State-generated activity. In particular, State investment must not be allowed impinge upon productive private investment or impose undue strain on the economy.  So far no such undesirable consequences have manifested themselves but, with the higher level of State investment planned for the current year, closer attention will be necessary to guard <Col N="1649" /> against their emergence.  The Government are fully alive to their responsibilities in this matter and if it should be found that State-financed capital expenditure was proceeding on an excessive scale, the programme as a whole would have to be reviewed and priorities established in the interests of economic and social stability.</P>
    <P Just="Center">EMPLOYMENT, WAGES AND EARNINGS.</P>
    <P>The steady post-war increase in non-agricultural employment continued during 1949.  The average number engaged in industry in 1949 is estimated at 206,000 as compared with 195,000 in 1948.  The continuous increase in non-agricultural employment since the war has more than offset the decline in the number engaged in farm work.</P>
    <P>The percentage of unemployment amongst persons in occupations insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts, exclusive of agriculture, fishing and private domestic service, fell further in 1949, being only 9 per cent. as compared with 9.4 per cent. in 1948 and 15.6 per cent. in 1939.</P>
    <P>Industrial earnings rose by 3.8 per cent. between September, 1948, and September, 1949.  Agricultural wages at July, 1949, were almost 9 per cent. higher than a year before and 123 per cent. above the 1939 level.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRODUCTION.</P>
    <P>The value of gross agricultural output in 1949 amounted to £127.8 million as compared with £119.6 million in 1948.  The value of net output rose from £105.1 million in 1948 to £110.5 million in 1949.</P>
    <P>In volume, agricultural output has now regained the pre-war level.  Gross output in 1949 in terms of 1938-39 prices is estimated at £53.3 million as compared with £53.5 million in 1938-39 and £49.7 million in 1948.  The 1949 volume of gross agricultural output represents an increase of 7.3 per cent. over 1948.  The improvement is most noticeable in cattle, pigs, poultry and eggs.  Milk production has also increased remarkably.</P>
    <P>Amongst the crops, the rise in barley output was particularly <Col N="1650" /> marked.  Potatoes and sugar beet also showed an increase over 1948, while wheat output did not fall to a material degree in spite of a 30 per cent. decline in acreage.  The increase in live-stock numbers, particularly those for breeding purposes, augurs well for the future, and it is also satisfactory that a high proportion of feeding stuff requirements is being met from home production.</P>
    <P>The complete results of the Census of Industrial Production for the year 1948 are now available, and they record a considerable increase in industrial output.  The total gross output of transportable goods amounted to £177.6 million, as compared with £154.6 million in 1947, being an increase of £23,000,000 or 14.8 per cent. Net output increased from £48.2 million to £58.5 million, or by 21.6 per cent.  Virtually all industries producing transportable goods shared in the improvement, but the principal increases occurred in the food, tobacco and drink groups, and in the assembly, construction and repair of vehicles.</P>
    <P>In industry as a whole&mdash;including building and construction, Government and local authority works, transport and public utilities as well as industries producing transportable goods&mdash; total gross output increased from £184.1 million in 1947 to £215.6 million in 1948, or by 17.1 per cent., and net output increased from £65.8 million to £80.1 million, or by 21.7 per cent.  The main increase, other than in transportable goods, was in building and construction, mainly State-financed, where the gross output advanced from £12.2 million in 1947 to £16.8 million in 1948, or by 38 per cent.</P>
    <P>Industrial output continued to expand in 1949.  Provisional indices of the volume of production in industries producing transportable goods show increases of 7 per cent. above the volume for the year 1948, and 43 per cent. above that for the year 1938.  For the last quarter of 1949 the volume of production in these industries showed an increase of 10 per cent. over the volume in the last quarter of 1948. Among the industries with a marked <Col N="1651" /> increase in output are those such as bacon-curing &mdash; with output almost double that of last year&mdash;and the creamery industries which reflect the recovery in agriculture.  In industry as a whole, the provisional figures of production for 1949 show an increase in volume of 9 per cent. over 1948 and of 39 per cent. over 1938.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PRICES AND MONETARY SITUATION.</P>
    <P>Retail prices have been virtually stable since 1947, the index for November, 1949, and for February, 1950, being 100, the same as at mid-August, 1947. This is equivalent to a rise of 84 per cent. above the level at mid-August, 1938.</P>
    <P>Wholesale prices in 1949 remained at the 1948 level but, following devaluation, have shown a tendency to rise. The March, 1950, index, at 139 per cent. above 1938, is 2½ per cent. higher than for March, 1949.  We have, so far, not experienced any significant upward movement as a result of devaluation, perhaps, to some extent, because we have been drawing on stocks of food and raw materials purchased at the old prices.</P>
    <P>Agricultural prices, which were 148 per cent. above the 1938-39 average in 1948, rose slightly during 1949.  In March, 1950, the index was 267 (to base 1938-39=100) as compared with 259 in March, 1949.  The high level of prices is an indication of the prosperity at present enjoyed by the farming community but it must also be viewed as an indication of the need for an increase in efficiency and output if agricultural incomes are to be maintained in the era of improved world supplies and increasing competition which is now upon us.  The expansion in recent years in the use of agricultural machinery and the progressive introduction of improved methods are hopeful signs.</P>
    <P>Total monetary circulation increased by £3,492,000 between March, 1949, and March, 1950.  Advances by the banks to Irish customers and bank investments in Ireland increased in the same period by about £3,000,000.  The circulation of cheques in 1949, as indicated <Col N="1652" /> by the figures of debits, shows an increase of almost 9 per cent. over 1948.</P>
    <P>On the whole, monetary stability has been well maintained over the past year.  Devaluation may, as time goes on, have a more pronounced effect, but we may reasonably hope to avoid any serious increase in living costs.</P>
    <P Just="Center">TRADE.</P>
    <P>The increase in output in 1949 was accompanied by an increase in exports and an improvement in the balance of trade.  The volume of exports recovered to within 10 per cent. of the 1938 level having been 25 per cent. below it in 1948.  The value of exports rose from £49.3 million in 1948 to £60.5 million in 1949.  The higher receipts in 1949 were due almost entirely to a bigger volume of exports whereas the increase which took place in 1948 was due mainly to higher prices.  Exports of live stock yielded £5,000,000 more than in 1948 and there was an increase of £5,000,000 in exports of other foodstuffs, of which eggs were the most important item.</P>
    <P>The value of imports in 1949 was £129.8 million, approximately £6,500,000 less than in 1948.  There was a slight decline in volume, but it is still about 27 per cent. higher than in 1938.  With the aid of Economic Co-operation Administration dollars we were able to purchase £18.5 million worth of goods from the United States as compared with £11.4 million in 1948.</P>
    <P>The terms of trade further improved during 1949; the ratio of export to import prices rose to 112.5, taking the 1938 ratio as 100.  Almost the same volume of imports was obtained for a reduced outlay and this factor, together with the increase in the value of exports of £11.2 million, resulted in the deficit on visible trade being reduced from £87,000,000 in 1948 to £69,000,000 in 1949.</P>
    <P>The trade deficit has tended this year to rise again, being £22.9 million for the first three months as against £18.3 million for the first quarter of 1949.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS.</P>
    <P>The £18,000,000 reduction in the <Col N="1653" /> trade deficit in 1949 brought the balance of payments closer to equilibrium. A provisional estimate suggests that the gap between current outgo and receipts was in the neighbourhood of £10,000,000, as compared with £30,000,000 in 1947 and £20,000,000 in 1948.  It is satisfactory that this improvement is attributable mainly to a better trade balance.  Net receipts from tourism are estimated to have fallen in 1949 and, as holidays abroad become more popular for our own people and Ireland loses some of its special attractions for visitors, every effort will be needed to sustain this important source of external income. If the improvement in the current balance of payments continues, we shall be better able to bear such loss of external income as may arise from the realisation of sterling assets to carry out productive work at home.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DOLLAR POSITION AND PROSPECTS.</P>
    <P>In common with all Western European countries we are obliged to give constant attention to one of the major problems in the field of external trade, namely, the means of payment for necessary imports from the dollar area.</P>
    <P>As I explained last year, the deficit on dollar account has since the 4th April, 1948, been met from the allotments made to this country under the Marshall Plan, that generous assistance afforded by the Government of the United States towards European recovery.  For the period to the 30th June, 1949, the aid finally allotted to Ireland was $86.3 million, all being furnished as a loan, and for the current American fiscal year ending on the 30th June, 1950, the allotment is $44.9 million, of which $3 million has been given as a grant and the rest as a loan.</P>
    <P>The level of our dollar expenditure on goods and services in 1948 was relatively low, being of the order of $70,000,000, or less than half of the abnormally high dollar outlay in 1947, and it was not until the second quarter of 1949 that delays and difficulties arising from the transition to Economic Co-operation Administration financing had been overcome and imports from <Col N="1654" /> the dollar area began to flow in accordance with programmed expectations. For that reason, a substantial portion of the 1948-49 Economic Co-operation Administration allotment was carried over for utilisation in 1949-50 and thus enabled a programme of imports for the 12 months from 1st July, 1949, to 30th June, 1950, to be planned at a figure of nearly $90,000,000, of which $24,000,000 was to be met from our own dollar income, which accrues mainly from tourist expenditure and emigrants' remittances.</P>
    <P>We are now nearly half-way through the period covered by the Marshall Plan.  We know that in 1950-51 the amount of aid which each participating country, including Ireland, can get will be much less than in 1949-50.  In 1951-52, there will be a further sharp reduction in American aid, and thereafter we shall have to meet our dollar expenditure from our own dollar income and from such resources as we can command through our membership of the sterling area system.  While the recent improvement in the position of the sterling area reserves has been observed with satisfaction, it would be unduly optimistic on our part to assume that the difficulties which the sterling area as a whole experiences in achieving a satisfactory balance with the dollar world will have been surmounted completely by 1952. The indications are, indeed, that, despite the substantial progress towards recovery already made by the countries receiving Marshall Aid, a serious world shortage of dollars will be experienced after 1952.  We must, therefore, prepare ourselves for the emergence during the next two years of a more critical dollar situation.</P>
    <P>The gravity of the problem can be understood by comparing our dollar imports with our dollar income.  The tentative programme of dollar imports for the 12 months beginning 1st July, 1950, which was prepared some time ago, contemplated an expenditure of about $65,000,000, inclusive of freight. In that figure is included some $47,000,000 for wheat, maize, tobacco and petrol.  The other items are of a high essentiality and, on present information, available only from dollar <Col N="1655" /> sources or procurable only from such sources on satisfactory conditions of supply.  Our dollar income has recently, I am glad to say, shown some tendency to increase and is now running at the rate of about $33,000,000 a year as compared with $30,000,000 in 1948-49.  It will be understood, however, that, of their nature, the amount and timing of these receipts can never be predicted with certainty.  Moreover, portion of these receipts is required for non-trade transactions, the amount of which fluctuates considerably being $9,000,000 in 1948 and $6,000,000 in 1949; only the balance is available to meet the cost of imports.</P>
    <P>It would not be safe to assume that income actually received in 1950-51 and available for trade purposes will, at the current rate of inflow, exceed $26,000,000 to $28,000,000 so that, on the basis of the original import programme for that year, a deficit of at least $37,000,000 would emerge.  Whatever may be the amount of American aid granted to Ireland for 1950-51, it is to be feared that it will be substantially below that figure.  The picture I have given for 1950-51 may in the result be somewhat improved by a carry-over of funds from 1949-50, but it is too early yet to say how far that may happen.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, faced not only with the prospect of having to revise our dollar programme for 1950-51 but of having to draw up our programme for 1951-52 on much more stringent lines.  It is clear that during what remains of the breathing space afforded by Marshall Aid we shall be forced to examine with increasing strictness all dollar expenditure with a view to the elimination of imports that can be obtained from non-dollar sources or are not of the highest order of essentiality.  Our efforts&mdash;and this is of vital importance&mdash;must also be bent towards securing a substantial increase in our dollar income.  Although merchandise exports to the dollar area are small they are capable of expansion and the Government are considering measures that might be adopted to stimulate them.  Our main hope, however, of a material increase in dollar receipts centres on tourism.  Arrangements <Col N="1656" /> are being made, with Economic Co-operation Administration assistance, for a visit this month of representatives of the hotel industry to the United States to study means of attracting increased numbers of American visitors to this country.  This problem has been under investigation by the Irish Tourist Board and the Government for some time.  When the report of the delegation of hoteliers is available decisions will be reached as to the most effective manner in which the State, through the agency of the tourist board, can help the hotel industry to earn more dollars.  Meanwhile, hotel keepers will be serving the national interest if they fall in readily with any proposals of the tourist board for reserving accommodation for, or otherwise facilitating, American visitors.</P>
    <P Just="Center">IV.  CONCLUSION.</P>
    <P>To sum up, our economic position, while on the whole satisfactory, is urgently in need of improvement if we are to be able to meet the exigencies of the future and weather possible depressions without impairment of our living standards or loss of amenities and comforts now regarded as essential. I have already stressed the need for increased earnings of dollars and reduced reliance on dollar goods. I have also referred to the need for greater efficiency and for increased output both in agriculture and industry if the substantial progress recently achieved is to be continued and consolidated. Our finances are healthy, but we must be constantly on guard against inflation.  The large programme of State investment which is being undertaken to develop the national economy must not be allowed to over-tax our resources or trench upon the capital needs of private enterprise.  Apart from increased production, our principal need is increased savings.  If the community as a whole works harder, strives after efficiency in all fields of activity, and sets aside more of its income for capital development, we can reasonably look forward to an expansion of employment and to a general improvement in the health and welfare of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who were reared in the country will recollect in our own districts the type of gentleman who &ldquo;raps and calls and pays for all,&rdquo; and leaves his debts to his widow and children to pay.  The Minister for Finance, backed by the efforts of the Taoiseach and other Ministers during the last couple of months, is trying to put over on our community the idea that there is something virtuous in getting into debt even if we are in an inflationary situation.  Judging this Budget from the point of view so very vigorously and even viciously expressed by the Minister for Finance and other members of the Government, it is a rake's Budget, the Budget that is operated by the waster throughout the country, who spends all the money he has, sells his cattle, puts his farm into debt, and leaves his children to clear up the mess.</P>
      <P>To go back to the time when he was in opposition, when he and his colleagues condemned as a &ldquo;crazy extortion&rdquo; a sum amounting to the half of what he proposes to spend this year, the Minister for Finance in 1948 said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We have been fortunate in not having been forced into debt to the same extent as other countries.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He was referring then to a debt of £91,000,000 in actual fact.  That was a large sum, he said.  To-day he was clapped by some members of his Party, who clapped him in the old days when he was condemning Fianna Fáil for its extravagance and its crazy extortions, because he announced that, without taking into account contingent liabilities, the national debt at the end of this year will be £145,000,000 instead of the £91,000,000 which he took over from Fianna Fáil.  He may get claps from the Fine Gael Deputies who want to spend £34,000,000 or £35,000,000 this year and leave it to future generations to pay the debt.  It is very easy, if the Parties comprising the Government have no conscience upon the matter and if they can grab certain funds, to put the payment for their expenses on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year the expenses, which should <Col N="1658" /> normally be met out of taxation, amount to £87,000,000, £78,000,000 for the Supply Services and £9,000,000 for the Central Fund Services.  That compares with a total of £65,000,000 for similar services in the last year of Fianna Fáil.  The present Ministers stumped the country and condemned Fianna Fáil as extravagant for spending £65,000,000.  They promised to reduce Government expenditure by £10,000,000.  Instead of that, this year it has gone up by £22,000,000, and the Minister proposes to spend another £34,000,000 or so.</P>
    <P>We can see the effect of the Minister's proposed borrowing scheme from an examination of the State accounts over the last couple of years.  In 1947-48 we spent £3.2 million in paying for interest and sinking funds.  That went up by £720,000 in 1948-49 to £3.9 million, and this year, according to the table which the Minister sent around yesterday, it is going up to £5.1 million, or an increase of £1.8 million over the year 1947-48.  By taking into account the contingent liabilities of the State, the Minister has indicated here to-day that that figure should be amended upwards and that, instead of £5.1 million being paid out in the coming year on interest and sinking fund charges, it should be really £6.3 million.  The Minister has succeeded in three years in adding 50 per cent. at least to our interest and sinking fund charges, or he will have succeeded in doing so by the end of this year.  He has in three years added more to that type of expenditure than was added in 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government. They have succeeded in burdening the future taxpayers of this country more in three years than Fianna Fáil did in 16 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in 1948 said also that a high proportion of even the capital assets that Fianna Fáil had left &ldquo;yielded no return in relief of annual charge or yielded an inadequate return&rdquo; and that he was appalled by that.  I can say to-day that most of the assets we left&mdash;they were left mostly by us&mdash;yielded at least an average 3.6 per cent.  But the Minister was not satisfied with that and he went on to warn the Dáil in his Budget speech of <Col N="1659" /> May, 1948: &ldquo;At a time when taxation is of unprecedented severity an economy in State expenditure is imperative; it is more than ever necessary to examine critically proposals for capital expenditure which add to the taxpayers' annual burden and thus tend to stifle incentive and reduce savings.&rdquo; The Minister this year is proposing to add to the taxpayers' annual burden a sum of at least £12,000,000 for which not one single penny will come into the Exchequer by way of return.  He is spending this year £12,000,000 for services of a type upon which in the last year of Fianna Fáil £3,000,000 was spent without a single penny being passed on to the future. This, of course, can go on as long as the Minister thinks fit.  Even though the ordinary taxpayer will not entrust his savings to him, he can go in spite of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister has at his disposal certain funds, including the Marshall Aid funds, which he can invest in Government loans.  He has the Post Office Savings Bank.  He has various accounts from which he can draw, and from which he has drawn, money at rather low rates of interest.  I asked him a question a couple of weeks ago in order to get the situation as to how he raised the £15.278 million, Ways and Means Advances, as at 31st March this year.  He gave me the account.  Of this £15.2 million, a sum of £3,300,000 was got from the Paymaster-General. It was free.  Of course, if it had been invested somewhere else we might have got a little more than that.  A sum of £200,000 was from the general balance of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. That also was interest free. At 1½ per cent. we got a series of other advances&mdash;£2,800,000 from the Post Office Savings Bank Fund; £374,000 from the Unemployment Fund Investment Account; £48,000 Savings Certificates Reserve Fund; £50,000 from the Pensions Investment Account, and £8.5 million from the American Counterpart Fund.</P>
    <P>Even though the Minister last year spent £720,000 more for interest and sinking fund than Fianna Fáil, he did not pay the full amount of interest <Col N="1660" /> which, according to his own statements in the past, a Government should pay. This £15.2 million should have been borrowed from the public and they should have got the normal rate of interest, according to the Minister's own professions of financial rectitude. Instead of that, he took money from the Post Office Fund, for which the Post Office paid 2½ per cent. to the depositors, and he gave them 1½ per cent. for it.  Last year or the year before he took outright from the Post Office Savings Bank Reserve a sum of £466,000.  We all know perfectly well that the Post Office Savings Bank Fund, in the present situation of the falling prices of securities&mdash;a large amount of them are invested in Britain&mdash;needs all the reserves it has.  Instead of that, the Minister took £466,000 from it&mdash;swept it from the reserve&mdash;and he this year took £2,800,000 odd at 1½ per cent. from them.  If they had invested in Government securities in the ordinary way, I suppose they would get 3¼ per cent. either here or in Great Britain. In order to get a proper picture of the situation we must add the amount which the Minister normally would pay for this £15,000,000 to the £720,000 extra that interest and sinking fund cost last year.</P>
    <P>The question people should ask themselves is: What is going to be the situation, supposing we add another £12,000,000 or £15,000,000 annually to Government expenditure which we raise by borrowing and as a result of which expenditure not a single penny will come into the Exchequer directly by way of return on investment? Almost £2,000,000 will have been added to the interest and sinking fund charges within two years.  If we go on for a few years, it will not be so very long until we are paying, by way of interest and sinking fund, more than the total of the last Fianna Fáil Budget, at which the people in the country were appalled.  Do the Deputies supporting the Government think it is good policy to put a millstone around the necks of the people of this country in the future in order to avoid the political difficulties of the Coalition Government?  We know that a number of the Parties comprising that Government <Col N="1661" /> will make demands on the Minister and that every one of these Parties&mdash;with the exception of the small group, the Farmers' Party&mdash;has to get their price from time to time. But, is this hanging on&mdash;this pleasing of the various little sections simply to avoid a general election&mdash;and at the price of putting a millstone around the necks of the Irish people in the future, worth while?</P>
    <P>The Minister himself denounced the policy of increasing the national debt, even for productive enterprises, but he now calmly asks the people to accept the increasing of the national debt simply to avoid taxation.  They will increase the national debt for purposes for which, under the previous Governments, money was found by the ordinary method of taxation.  I do not want, at this stage, to prove in detail what I say to the effect that various members on the Government Benches have in the past denounced as &ldquo;crazy,&rdquo;&ldquo;extortion,&rdquo;&ldquo;imposition&rdquo; and &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo; budgets that were less than half as costly for the people. We have another day for that.</P>
    <P>I do not want to close without referring to one strange omission from the Minister's speech.  For a number of years the members of the Fianna Fáil Government were accustomed to hear loud denunciations of the Fianna Fáil Government on the question of emigration. Did the Minister once to-day in this supposed survey of the national economy even mention the word &ldquo;emigration&rdquo;?  Did he refer to the fact that in 1947&mdash;the last year of the Fianna Fáil régime&mdash;11,166 more people came back than went out; that in the first year of the Coalition Government 12,793 more people went out than came back and that, last year, 1949, that figure went up to 18,105?  For years the Minister calculated, by reference to the population of towns and cities and villages, the number of people who went out under Fianna Fáil.  During the time when, as he admitted here to-day, we were the victims of forced savings&mdash;when we had to export and could not get material back in return for our agricultural exports&mdash;he denounced the then Government because we could not protect <Col N="1662" /> our people from all the ill-effects of a world conflagration and he used to speak here for many hours on financial questions in reference to that question of emigration.  Here to-day not once during the 63 pages of his speech did he refer to that.  The Minister referred in a very off-hand way to the fact that, five years after the actual hostilities had ceased, our adverse visible trade balance is still £69.2 million, that last year we brought in goods to the value of £129,700,000 and exported only £60.5 million.  Do Deputies think that this country can continue to have an adverse visible balance of trade of £69,000,000 a year? Do they think that, if we get rid of our external assets and have no invisible income as a result, the situation will be improved?  Do they think that, even if we continue from now on to balance our trade, visible and invisible, with the rest of the world to the extent that we have been doing it up to the present time, we can continue to depend on the tourist trade to balance an adverse amount of £69,000,000 on our visible trade?</P>
    <P>We know that the Government recently referred with favour to the tourist trade.  They have urged the people to give preference to foreigners in our hotels.  The smaller parties in the Coalition are no longer pushing out leaflets describing every tourist coming in here as a spiv coming to eat our butter and eggs.  The Minister for External Affairs has ceased to say that we should put a tax on tourists in order to keep them out.  They all say now that they should be welcomed.  Do the present Government and the supporters of the Government throughout the country think it is right to depend to the extent of £40,000,000 or £60,000,000 on tourists to balance our international trade?  Do they think we should be dependent, for our future supplies of bread and even nylon stockings or the wherewithal to make them, on our tourist trade in a permanent fashion?  While the Government attitude to the tourist trade has changed slightly in their talk, their actions have changed very little.  Although State expenditure has gone up on the Supply Estimates to the tune of <Col N="1663" /> £22,000,000 since Fianna Fáil, hardly a single penny is devoted to the development of this trade upon which the Government now say our future economic security so much depends.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, they have let the Minister for Agriculture loose to destroy the industry that might have helped to balance our international accounts.  When that Minister came back in 1948 after the agreement with the British, he told us in the Dáil that the agreement provided&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;for the farmers a sure and certain market at remunerative prices for every conceivable product that the land of Ireland can produce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He was backed by the Taoiseach in that debate with similar words.  Having secured, as he told the country, this great agreement, he set out as well as he could to kill those portions of our agricultural production that were producing for the home market.  He told the farmers that they would get maize at £20 a ton.  It is now £30 to the farmer.  By making these promises, he succeeded in getting a reduction in the total amount of tillage.  He said he was the Minister for maize and that the people could depend on it that they would get the maize at £20 a ton, as much of it as they wanted.  I see in last year's returns that we spent something like £8,000,000&mdash;I suppose most of it dollars&mdash;for maize, to substitute for our own barley, oats and potatoes. He so effectively discouraged potatoes that at the present time we have a famine in potatoes, even for humans. I have not yet seen any member of the Clann na Poblachta Party or the Labour Party, who were so loud in their denunciations of the cost of living, putting down a question in the Dáil as to what the present cost of potatoes is, and were potatoes ever so dear since the time of the famine.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at least one record that the Coalition Government have broken; they have increased the price of potatoes to consumers not only by more than Fianna Fáil did in their 16 long years of office, <Col N="1664" /> but brought it to the highest level in the 100 years since the Famine.  I suppose the statistics department will take note of the high prices the farmers are getting for their potatoes and they will put it into the general agricultural index, although the fact is that there are very few potatoes being sold, because there are practically none left, and the height of their agricultural prices index will be taken as an indication of the great prosperity of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  From the point of view of the past declarations of the Minister for Finance this Budget is a rake's Budget.  I want to say that from the point of view of anybody who has a reasonably modern, scientific outlook on the question of finance, this Budget is a treacherous Budget.  It used to be said by the opponents of the modern trend, of the modern outlook in finance, that Governments were not to be trusted, that we ought to keep bankers and other people in control of the level of credit because otherwise Governments would go berserk in their efforts to avoid the political unpopularity of taxing when they should tax and, instead, have recourse to the printing press or an increase of credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leaving aside the warnings of the Central Bank, leaving aside the evidence of our eyes, according to the Minister himself there is inflationary pressure and, in spite of that, he proposes this year to add £12,000,000 more to the money stream which is pressing upon a short supply of goods. I grant you that for the moment there are only certain categories of goods in short supply.  If we pump plenty of money into the stream, all we have to do is to allow imports and the goods will be bought.  In a country like France, or some other country with a fairly closed economy, closed by the fact that they have no foreign reserves to buy goods or by the fact that they do not allow them in, a comparable increase in the monetary supply of the people would have the effect over a year of gravely increasing the cost of <Col N="1665" /> living.  We saw one such experiment in France in 1946, when a few billion francs had the result of just doubling the cost of living.</P>
    <P>If we continue with this programme of borrow and spend instead of taxing in an inflationary situation the net adverse trade balance to which the Minister referred&mdash;some £10,000,000&mdash; will probably be very gravely increased during the coming year.  If we continue it for another 10 years on a somewhat similar scale the £400,000,000 or £500,000,000 that we have invested abroad will very quickly disappear.  I do not mind our external assets disappearing if they reappear here as internal assets.  The Minister for Finance and friends of his tried to hang round our necks as a millstone the report of the Banking Commission, which denounced the decrease in the external assets that took place here. During the years before the war Fianna Fáil, as a deliberate policy, tried to realise our external assets by the creation of internal assets.  I think it is just a crazy policy to throw away any assets that we have abroad unless we can create an asset of equal value here, an asset that will be of equal value to the community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance in recent months brought a new type of asset forward.  The Taoiseach, down in Clonmel, spoke about the coming Budget as an investment in human improvement.  The Minister for Finance spoke about it as a social investment.  If we can borrow for human improvement, why not borrow for other things, too?  If it is right to borrow for social investment to the tune of £12,000,000, why do you not borrow for orphans' pensions, family allowances and all our health services?  Surely they, too, are human improvements?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance can even get the assistance of a gentleman in another chamber, one of the team who tried to put the report of the Banking Commission as a millstone around the necks of Fianna Fáil in an endeavour to drown them.  He asked for support for education through borrowing.  I think it would be a good capital investment if we did borrow some money <Col N="1666" /> and spent it on the education of some of the university professors of economics, particularly one gentleman who denounced Fianna Fáil for realising external assets while the big housing campaign was going on.  This gentleman recently suggested to the Minister that he should borrow for university education, including, I suppose, the pay of university professors. If it is held out that the investment of £12,000,000 in human improvement is a good thing and that it is a good social investment, why do we not get more of the good thing?  Why should we have to pay anything at all on our beer or tobacco, or have to pay any income-tax for services which are human improvements?</P>
    <P>If the Minister does not know it himself, he can quite easily discover that it is disastrous in times when there are inflationary pressures about to borrow money for ordinary current expenditure. I, as Minister for Finance, had the very distasteful job of trying to cut down on an inflationary situation. We did not get very much help at that time from the present Minister for Finance.  However, I pointed out in my Budget speech of 1947 that &ldquo;it is too seldom realised that the spending by the State of money borrowed from the public tends to add to the amount of active purchasing power almost as surely as an increase of loans by the bank or a fiduciary issue of notes by the State&rdquo;.  I went on to say, however, that &ldquo;while in times of a surplus of saleable goods, it is socially and economically desirable to have additional money created by the State or by the banks, so as to enable consumers to buy total output, any large addition would be disastrous in times like these when there is a grave shortage of goods and an over-supply of money&rdquo;.  There is at this present time, on the Minister's admission, a grave shortage of Irish goods upon which to spend the money, and, to soak up the amount of money in circulation, goods are coming in from abroad. That is a disastrous policy, and one of the reasons I bitterly resent this Budget is that I believe it is a treacherous one, a betrayal of the men who stood for a modern approach to finance in the present age.</P>

    <P>(1)  That whenever and so often as the rent for the time being payable <Col N="1669" /> in respect of any lease first executed on or after the 3rd day of May, 1950, is reduced on or after that date in consideration of any money, stock or security moving either to the lessor or to any other person, the instrument (in the subsequent paragraphs of this Resolution referred to as the said instrument) on or after that date acknowledging the receipt of the consideration for the reduction (or, where the consideration is payable by instalments, of the instalment after payment of which the reduction becomes effective) or recording directly or indirectly that the rent has been reduced shall, notwithstanding anything in any Act (other than the Act giving effect to this Resolution), be charged with the same stamp duty, and be subject to the provisions of the Stamp Act, 1891 (as amended by subsequent enactments), as if, instead of being such instrument, it were&mdash;</P>

    <P>(b) That the provisions contained in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph shall have effect in relation to the said instrument, if executed before the passing of the Act giving effect to this Resolution, notwithstanding that, before such passing, it may have been stamped with a particular stamp denoting either that it is not chargeable with any duty or is duly stamped.</P>
    <P>(c) That notwithstanding any of the provisions contained in the foregoing sub-paragraphs of this paragraph, the total stamp duty chargeable on the said instrument, if executed before the passing of the Act giving effect to this Resolution, shall not exceed the amount with which it would have been charged if it had in fact been executed after the passing of that Act.</P>
    <P>(d) That where, at the expiration of 30 days after the passing of the Act giving effect to this Resolution, the said instrument, if executed before such passing, is not stamped with the stamp duty charged thereon by virtue of that Act, a sum equal to twice the unpaid stamp duty shall thereupon be a debt due to the Minister for Finance for the benefit of the Central Fund by the person beneficially entitled at the date of the taking effect of the reduction of the rent to the lessee's interest in the property out of which the rent so reduced issues or, where two or more persons were so entitled, by those persons jointly and severeally, <Col N="1671" /> and the said sum shall be recoverable at the suit of the Attorney-General in any court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following amendment to Section 7:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> (2) Where an officer or an employee of the society is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service, pursuant to the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section, he shall be appointed within a grade at least as favourable, having regard to existing rights and salary scale, as his or her existing grade in the society's service.&mdash;(Dr. Ryan.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, this amendment is the most important of the many amendments to this Bill.  On its acceptance by the Minister or its rejection by the House will depend the security of many of the people who have, for many years past, been employees of the National Health Insurance Society.  The Minister appeared to be sympathetic, or at least he put a veneer of sympathy on his many statements, but when he discovered that Deputy C. Lehane was in sympathy with the amendment &mdash; not his own amendment, but the amendment in the name of Deputy Ryan, which he said was preferable &mdash; he became rather uneasy, because, at that particular stage Deputy Dr. Ryan was not agreeable to withdraw the amendment nor had Deputy Con Lehane given any indication that he would withdraw his amendment.  The Minister saw that defeat was staring him in the face and he deserves congratulation for the astute way in which he got his forces together again to agree on a matter on which, a few moments before, I thought agreement could not be reached.  He raised the old bogey of politics.  I can safely say that, as far as the Deputies on these benches are concerned, politics is the remotest thing from their minds.  I can assure Deputies who may have the slightest suspicion that, unquestionably, politics was the remotest, and should be the remotest, thing from the mind of any Deputy who wanted to see that the 600 persons concerned would get security in future employment.  Politics do not enter into this matter and should not enter into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House has to decide whether a Minister's word, no matter how sincerely given, will cover the position in the future.  Assuming that the present <Col N="1673" /> Minister is sincere and anxious as to the security of the people concerned, he will not occupy that position for ever.  He will not live for ever, any more than anybody else.  We know full well that those who handle the purse strings in this country are of a conservative nature and must be of a conservative nature.  In that knowledge, we must all bear in mind the conservative interpretation that they will put on every section of this Bill in its application to the security of the future employment of the employees of the National Health Insurance Society.</P>
    <P>Candidly, I was amazed that Deputy Con Lehane took the cue from the Minister because I was sure that Deputy Con Lehane would stand firm on that matter and, by doing so, would see the amendment implemented in the Bill and so put the matter beyond yea or nay.  If Deputy Con Lehane had remained firm on that matter, the Minister, of necessity, would have agreed either to Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment or Deputy Lehane's amendment, or would himself, as both of these Deputies suggested, have drafted a somewhat similar amendment that would be acceptable to everybody.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the old bogey of politics was drawn in.  Never have I heard Deputy MacEntee as mild as he was last night.  Never for a moment did I, or anybody else in this House, even Deputy Con Lehane, dream that Deputy MacEntee was playing politics in this matter.  Of course, he was not. Nobody knows that better than the Minister and Deputy Con Lehane but, when you want to do something or to find an excuse for not doing something, you always put the blame on the other fellow and that is what Deputy Con Lehane has done.  Nobody is going to believe Deputy Con Lehane now. Deputy Con Lehane has run away from the employees of the National Health Insurance Society that he has been pretending up to now to be favouring so much.</P>

What security does the ministerial statement really give?  None whatever.  The Minister assures us verbally that he will do certain things, that he is more or less in agreement, but he has failed hopelessly to give any reason to the House for not accepting one or other of the amendments.  I do not know if Deputy Lehane's amendment has been withdrawn.</P>

      <P>He was more or less anxious, I think, to have that amendment accepted.  However, the Minister has given no real concrete reason for refusing to accept it and it is obvious that he wants to bring the unfortunate employees of the National Health Insurance Society into a fool's paradise. He knows, of course, that unless he says some soft words now they may, as Deputy Lehane suggested, become vocal.  He knows full well that unless some hope is held out to them they may become obstreperous and, perhaps, cause uneasiness to the Minister or even to the Coalition.  Many of them belong to trade unions and I think it would appear rather bad for the leaders of the trade union organisations if they allowed their members to be badly treated.</P>

      <P>There is no question of a privileged class.  This amendment asks for guarantees to be inserted in the Bill.  I cannot understand why practically every Deputy who spoke up to a certain point last evening was in full agreement with this amendment and thought that it was necessary.  If it were necessary at 8 o'clock last night I fail to understand why it ceased to be necessary at 8.30 last night or at 7 o'clock this evening.  Even at this late hour, despite any alleged ruffling of feathers or under-the-skin speeches the Minister may imagine were made, I hope he will reconsider this in the interests of fair play and in the <Col N="1676" /> interests of providing himself with a contented staff.  Nothing is so essential in employment than contentment, if that section of the community is to give what every man is expected to give in this country, value for the money he receives.</P>

      <P>I had no intention of intervening in this debate and would not have done so were it not for one statement made by Deputy MacEntee. I wonder would Deputy Davern and others have spoken in the way they did had Deputy MacEntee been the Minister introducing this Bill.  Do these people realise the implication of what Deputy MacEntee said last night?  I am sorry that he is not in the House at the moment.  He mentioned that he had been Minister in various Departments, including the Department of Finance.  He also said that he understood the position of the Minister for Social Welfare in moving this when he stated that he presumed the Minister was in favour of having something included on the lines of this amendment but for the fact that the Minister for Finance would be opposed to it.  When Deputy MacEntee said the Minister for Finance would oppose it he was quite clearly stating that he himself, if he were Minister for Finance, would take that line.  Is not that most illuminating?  Is there not a touch of Jekyll and Hyde about that?  As Deputy MacEntee, he stands up here demanding that this amendment should be included and Deputy Davern supports him.  If he were Minister MacEntee he would not agree to its inclusion.  I think that shows what is behind this amendment.  I think that shows how much there is of sincerity in it and how much nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment was discussed <i>ad nauseam</i> last evening. Some acrimony was introduced into the debate, in my opinion, initially by the Minister.  This Party was accused of playing politics.  I can assure the Minister that, so far as I am concerned, and so far as the members of my Party are concerned, we are acting in good faith in insisting on the inclusion of the provision sought by Deputy <Col N="1677" /> Dr. Ryan.  The Minister, in the course of one of his replies last night, assured us that the unions catering for the people affected by this amendment and their representatives came to see him and were in no way apprehensive of their status on their transfer into the Civil Service.  He told us that they accepted unreservedly the assurances given by him.  Reference was made also to the deputation that visited the Minister and the other political Parties, including the Fianna Fáil Party, during the Second Reading.  It is rather odd that the deputation met the Fianna Fáil Party last of all. They met that Party after they had met the Minister and after they had got his assurances.  I can assure the Minister that some members of that deputation, at any rate, were very concerned about this particular provision, and it was as a result of our interview with that deputation that this amendment was inserted.  It comes somewhat queerly from the Minister at this stage to assure us that in the light of the statement made by the spokesmen of this deputation the employees are in no way apprehensive.  The Minister gave them the assurances before they met our Party.  Nevertheless, it was as a result of what was said at that interview that this amendment was inserted.</P>
      <P>During the Committee Stage on another Bill recently dealing with semi-State employees I submitted an amendment to the Minister in charge of the Bill.  In the light of an assurance given me by the Minister I agreed to withdraw the amendment.  I was assured by him that these employees would receive special consideration and that my amendment was unnecessary. Subsequently I accompanied representatives of these employees to the particular Minister's Department. I am not now referring to the Minister for Social Welfare.  I was told by an official that any benefits that would accrue to these particular employees were entirely a matter for their unions and the Minister was in no way responsible either by legislation or otherwise. That is a concrete fact.  In the light of that experience I feel apprehensive about any assurance given by a Minister here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a very reasonable amendment and I cannot understand the Minister charged with responsibility for the Department of Social Welfare opposing an amendment of this kind.  The National Health Insurance Society is a solvent institution. It is not in liquidation.  It is being taken over by the Minister and his Department.  Surely it is only fair that the employees should be given guarantees.  This institution accumulated a good deal of money in the past. Surely it is only fair that these people's interest should be safeguarded.  I cannot understand a Minister who talks so much about the welfare of the people refusing to accept an amendment of this kind.  It is very hard to understand it.  Surely if these men are going to be transferred from this good, solvent organisation, their conditions of employment should not in any way <Col N="1679" /> be impaired.  There is no use in the Minister saying that he will do this and that he will do that.  If it is not provided for in the Bill, his assurance will not be binding on his successor and it will not be binding on himself, if he wants to go back on his word, and that is not an unusual thing.  The Minister will find plenty of means of repudiating <Col N="1680" /> the promises made to these men if he wishes to do so.  He may say: &ldquo;Well, it was not in that light I said it.&rdquo;  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his position, to ensure that these men are safeguarded properly and that they will enjoy the same rights as they had in the society.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5 was tabled by me in order to safeguard, as far as possible, the position of the employees of the National Health Insurance Society.  I think it is a pity that the Minister does not see his way, as he has already indicated, to write into the Bill the assurances that he has given.  However, in view of the very specific nature of the assurances given by the Minister in the course of the debate yesterday, I think I would not be justified in pressing this.  I would say to the Minister that I think, from the point of view of putting these people's minds at ease, it would be preferable to write the assurances into the Bill.  However, if the Minister takes a strong line on that, I would not feel justified in pressing him.  I should, however, like to have from him a definite assurance that the work on which the established outside agents will be employed, when transferred, will be the same as the work upon which they are now employed.  If he can satisfy me on that point, I am satisfied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 19, to add at the end &ldquo;and in the assessment of his superannuation, he shall not be less favourably treated than he would have been if this Act had not been passed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When these officials &mdash; officers and employees of the National Health Insurance Society &mdash; are transferred, they will be transferred into certain grades in the Civil Service.  It is possible that the superannuation rights which they acquire by going into these grades will give them the same or at least as good a position in reference to superannuation as they have at the moment. But there is always a fear that some individual or another may not fare as well as he would have fared if he remained where he was for superannuation purposes.  There is very often a section of this kind put into a Bill to make sure that there would not be anyone overlooked, as it were, or anyone who would suffer as a consequence of transfer.  Perhaps the Minister has considered it and he might let us know what his views are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the position is fully safeguarded under Section 7 (2).  The officers are being taken over on substantially better terms than the pension terms they have at the moment.  The officers concerned and the whole staff can have the Deputy's amendment if they like but, if they prefer that, they cannot have Section 7 (2).  If you want to put into the Bill a section whereby you say that they &ldquo;shall not be less favourably treated than they would have been if this Act had not been passed,&rdquo; it might be possible to allow them to carry their existing pension rights, but it will not pay them to do so.  I am offering them something better.  They can have the existing one if they like. I will have the matter examined to see if there is any difficulty in giving it to them and let them carry on with that. Against that, I am offering them something better.  I think the Deputy has every reason to be satisfied that they are fully safeguarded in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> What is the position?  At present a woman in the National Health Insurance Society has a pension calculated on 1/60th for each year of service. In the Civil Service, a woman has a pension calculated on the basis of 1/60th for each year of service. For a long number of years women in the Civil Service have tried to have their pensions calculated, not under the Act of 1859, which provides for 1/60th as the basis of computation, but under the 1909 Act which provides 1/80th as the basis of computation, plus a lump sum based on 1/30th of salary for each year of service, subject to a limit of 45/30ths.  Under this scheme it is proposed to bring a woman on the staff of the society into the Civil Service on terms under which she would enjoy the benefits of the 1909 Superannuation Act, which will give her in future a pension based on 1/80th of salary for each year of service, plus a lump sum based on 1/30th of salary for each year of service, subject to a limit of 45/30ths and, in the event of death while in the service, a lump sum will be payable if that person has as much as ten years' service.  Therefore, the female staff of the society will be much better off under the superannuation terms of the Civil Service than they are at present.  Those of the female staff who get married will be entitled in future to a marriage gratuity which will be based on 1/12th instead of 1/16th.  So far as the men are concerned, they are getting the provisions of the 1909 Superannuation Act, namely, 1/80th as the basis of computation, plus a lump sum, plus a death gratuity.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy may rest satisfied that that is a substantial improvement on the present superannuation code. In any case, it would be impossible to ascertain whether a person transferred from the society to the Department and serving in the Department for 30 years was or was not getting less favourable treatment than if this Act had not been passed.  How can you ascertain what would happen if this Act had not been passed or attempt to go into the realm of prophecy as to what might or might not have happened if this Act had not been passed? What is happening is that these people <Col N="1686" /> are coming into the Department and, in so far as they are pensionable officers, they are getting the Civil Service terms of superannuation.  These terms are vastly better than their present terms.  They are in black and white in Acts of Parliament and Acts of Parliament were considered very precious when discussing the last amendment.  They can read all about their pension rights in Acts of Parliament, in the 1909 Act and the 1914 Act. There is no doubt, whatever, that they are doing very well by getting Civil Service terms which, as I have said, are vastly better than what they have at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister, he told me at the beginning they would be better treated.  He said then that in 25 or 30 years' time you would not know whether they were as well treated or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that there is a physical difficulty here in either you or I or anybody else determining whether people have been &ldquo;not less favourably treated than they would have been if this Act had not been passed.&rdquo;  If this Bill were not passed, something might happen or might not happen about which you or I know nothing.  How could we decide such a thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is not fair in that argument.  When he used that expression, I think he meant as conditions exist at the moment.  He did not go further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that they are doing very much better than they hoped to do in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister believes that, but still he has a doubt&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the slightest doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that in 25 years' time a person might prove that he was not as well treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the physical impossibility of determining the thing by the reference which the Deputy gives me.  What would happen if this Act <Col N="1687" /> had not been passed I do not know. My legal advisers say that they do not know what construction to put on it. Here is clear evidence of substantial benefits on transfer.  I do not know why the Deputy wants to look a gift-horse in the mouth.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear they are better off than they ever would be in the society.  There is a substantial number of resignations of the female staff in the society on marriage.  If they resign on marriage while in the society they get 1/16th for each year of service; they will get 1/12th in the Civil Service.  Is not that a clear gain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it quite clear that the section, as drafted, will apply to everybody who comes in?  There is a very comprehensive superannuation code cited in this section.  It began in the year 1834 and, to date at any rate, is defined by the 1947 Act.  How do we know what snag there may not be embodied in that vast corpus of superannuation law?  The purpose of the amendment, as was the purpose of amendment No. 4, is to try to make sure that no person in the service of the State will be worse off than if the society had been permitted to continue and he or she had been permitted to remain an officer of the society.  Is not that a fair and just thing to try to do? The Minister, like other Ministers, and like his predecessors and, presumably, his successors, may be a bird of passage. Anything he will say does not bind anyone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen things done even since the institution of this Government which indicate that plainly.  There were people who were taken into the service of semi-State bodies and who were trained for the special purpose of that service and the Government came in and shut down the service for which they were trained.  They were scattered to the four winds of the earth. When they were employed first, they were certainly given a tacit assurance of permanent employment by the Minister's predecessor in the office of <Col N="1688" /> Tánaiste.  But it did not bind the Minister or any member of this Government.  What the Minister is saying now in relation to the people he is going to bring into the service of the State will not bind any of his successors. That is clear.  Surely we are justified, therefore, in these circumstances, in asking that they should be given a definite assurance that in no circumstances, provided they discharge their duties competently and conscientiously, will their position be worsened. The Minister says it is not possible to operate the amendment in the form in which it is on the Order Paper.  It is not beyond the competency of the draftsmen to amend Deputy Dr. Ryan's proposal if the Minister is prepared to accept it in principle.  I know that there are many statutes which embody a similar principle that people will not be less favourably treated when their employer changes than they would have been if they had remained in the continuous employment of one person. There are many precedents for this formula.  If it merely means the amending of the phraseology which follows the words &ldquo;less favourably treated&rdquo; surely the Minister can address himself to the task and say: &ldquo;He (or she) shall not be less favourably treated than he (or she) would have been had this Act not been passed and he (or she) remained in the continuous employment of the society&rdquo;.  I think that is what we are trying to get at.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Deputy would discuss the matter with the National Health Insurance Society staff in this connection and try to get some advice from people before speaking, apparently, in their interest and making such statements as he has made this evening.  This matter was discussed with the staffs of the society.  They know that this is a substantial improvement on their present position. Their present pensions are based on a fund.  There is no statutory guarantee that the fund must be solvent.  There is no obligation on the State to keep it solvent.  It is purely a fund which may go insolvent at any time.  They are being transferred to the State now with a guarantee that their pensions will be carried on voted moneys in the <Col N="1689" /> same way as the pension of every other State employee is carried.  I know that the Deputy has read sub-section (2).  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a person who is appointed to a situation in the Civil Service of the Government by virtue of sub-section (1) of this section was, immediately before the transfer day, a member of the pension fund, such situation shall be a permanent situation and such of his service under the society and of his previous service (if any) under any approved society as, but for this Part of this Act, would be reckonable as pensionable service for the purposes of the pension scheme shall be treated as established service for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts, 1834 to 1947.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the first place they are going to have their pension carried by the State in the same way as that of every other pensioner in the State service.  At present it is carried by a fund, the solvency of which is not guaranteed. They are getting very substantial benefits.  If Deputy MacEntee wants these people to be given a guarantee in relation to their existing pensions, we shall look into that matter and see if it cannot be incorporated in the section and give them a guarantee on their existing pensions.  I shall examine that.  I would point out, however, that that is going to be substantially less than what they are getting. The Deputy might well, therefore, take further advice in this matter.</P>

      <P>The Minister is representing the State.  We represent the private individuals to be affected by the legislation which the Dáil is asked to pass.  Our position is quite simple.  Let us be quite clear about this.  We do not ask the Minister to accept the principle which is embodied in amendment No. 6 as an alternative to sub-section (2) of Section 7 but as an additional safeguard to remedy any defect there may be in the existing law by reason of which a person coming from the service of the National Health Insurance Society into the service of the State might not secure what the Minister professes to give him or her, as the case may be.  That is what we want.  We do not know whether the Minister speaks for these officers or not.  I do not think he ought to.  I think it would be quite contrary to his constitutional position that he should hold himself out here in this House as the spokesman of these persons who are coming into State employment. The Minister has said that if the individuals concerned in this sub-section want to see what their position may be they can go back and look up the Act of 1909.  Will the Tánaiste tell me where they are going to get it, where that Act is of easy access?</P>

We should not open a betting ring, employing tick-tack men in order that the general public may know what odds the Tánaiste is offering to the Opposition <Col N="1691" /> in regard to any matter.  For an ordinary individual, it is very difficult to procure a copy of British statutes of early date.  We have found that difficulty here in relation to this Bill, as it is exceedingly difficult to get copies&mdash;I think only one copy is extant in the House &mdash; of the 1911 Insurance Act.  There are other statutes, even of this Dáil, which are not available at the Government Publications Office.  I doubt whether it would be very easy for these people to get hold of the 1909 Act and satisfy themselves as to what is in it.</P>

      <P>In regard to amendment No. 7, I have found out since putting it down that those on probation are a very small number.  My idea was that it might be a better safeguard to say that the Minister would have to certify a person as unsatisfactory through inefficiency or misconduct, rather than that he should do nothing and not certify them at all.  I have learned, however, that the number at present is small and that there may be no one in the probation class.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(4)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment, no officer or employee of the society, who is in receipt of a military service pension will have such pension suspended or abated as a result of his transfer to the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are aware that any man in receipt of a military service pension who receives his pay out of public funds is subject to an abatement and, in some cases, complete suspension of his pension, on a scale graded according to his salary.  There are some men <Col N="1692" /> in the society who are in receipt of such pensions and if they are transferred now, that scaled reduction will take place, though no deduction ever took place before in the society.  In that respect, they will suffer an injury. In his statements previously, the Minister seemed to think that this particular staff were very anxious to go into the Civil Service.  I do not know whether that is true about the whole of them.  Certainly, these I.R.A. men, unless this amendment is passed, will suffer a definite injury and it is to avoid this injury I put down this amendment.</P>
    <P>The previous amendments were concerned with just securing that men transferred would not suffer in their salary and other rights.  This is something that will happen even if this is effected, as the Minister says it will be.  When these men get their first pay order for military service pension, they will find a deduction on it, because they are being paid now from public funds.  To my mind that is an obvious wrong which should be remedied.  There is no reason on earth why those few men should be the only sufferers.  If this amendment is not passed, and taking the Minister's statement as right, they will be the only sufferers.  They are being put into the Civil Service whether they like it or not: they have no option, unless they throw up their job which, of course, nobody can afford to do, due to economic stress.  As they would indirectly suffer this loss of pay, it is only common justice that this amendment should be accepted.  There is no reason why Old I.R.A. men, of all people, should be picked out as the only class that will suffer.  That will be the case, even though their pay remains the same, unless this amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>This deduction from pension on people in public employment is inequitable at any time, but it is a grave injustice if it is forced on men who are being put into the Civil Service without any personal say on their own part, men who do not go in from choice just to get a job, but who have been transferred.  I hope the Minister will accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Deputy Colley's amendment and I think he has reasoned it very clearly.  These people in their present employment have the privileges of the rest of the staff and also have the full pension awarded for their services to this country that put the State in the position it is in at present.  I cannot see why they should be placed now in the position that anything they earn over £250 per annum will be abated to a certain degree.  We all know that £250 at present is a very low rate.  It is entirely wrong and unjust and I am sure the Minister will give consideration to this point and see that those men are put in the same position as regards their pensions as they were in under the society.  They are not a very big body, the number will be diminishing year by year, but it is wrong that those who did so much and made such sacrifices should be the only people in the national health organisation to be penalised in this way.  I appeal to the Minister to look into it.  It will not involve much money and he may reconsider his decision and admit this amendment.</P>

      <P>At the risk of leaving myself open again to the charge of blowing hot and cold, I say that I am in complete agreement with what is sought to be achieved by this amendment; but again, subject to what the Minister has to say, I still am faced with the same difficulty as when we discussed amendment No. 4, namely, the creation of different conditions for one set of civil servants inside the Civil Service.  I agree with Deputy Colley that it could be described as inequitable at any time to make these deductions from civil servants who are in receipt of service pensions.  Deputy Colley was here for a considerable number of years when these deductions were being made and this is the first occasion that reference has been made to that inequity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear to me that this is a situation which flows naturally from the inclusion of these people in the general State service.  What I would suggest to the Minister, if I am right in assuming that he cannot accept this <Col N="1694" /> amendment, is that he is bound to find some other method whereby they will be compensated.  That may be by a lump sum payment, by payment of a capital sum in respect of what they will lose, or by some other method.  The Minister should bring some proposal before the House to ensure that those in receipt of service pensions, and going into the service of the State from the society, will not lose.  I do not know what method would commend itself to the Minister as the best to achieve that purpose.  Frankly &mdash; and I am being perfectly honest in this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would not attempt to convince Deputy MacEntee of that but there is, perhaps, a latent honesty in the other Deputies in his Party that I can recognise with my honest qualities.  I say quite sincerely that I do not think the amendment could achieve what the Deputy hopes to achieve by it.  In the first place, I see the difficulties in which the Minister would find himself if he accepted it.  Perhaps Deputies would join with me in getting the Minister to meet the point by some other method, by a lump sum or an alteration of the regulation.  I suggest commutation by way of a lump sum would be the best method.  The Minister must see to it that these people will not suffer.  Perhaps he could tell us how many people are affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I investigated this matter when the amendment was submitted and, so far as I can gather, there are not many persons affected by it.  I have a certain sympathy with the amendment.  This whole Bill has been framed on the basis that I do not want to do any conscious injustice to anybody who is transferred from the society into the Department.  I take it the object of the amendment is to ensure that any persons so transferred will not lose by reason of the transfer. It is possible to get adjustment in that direction so as to avoid any loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Colley, Deputy Lehane and Deputy McGrath are concerned with making sure that the person who <Col N="1695" /> is transferred from the society to the Department will not suffer any monetary loss by reason of the abatement of his pension, I will undertake to look into that matter between now and the Report Stage in order to see if it is possible to provide compensation in some other way.  I take it the Deputies are mainly concerned that the man gets his compensation and if he gets it Deputies do not mind in what particular way it is done.  If that is agreeable, perhaps the Deputy will withdraw his amendment.  I will look into the matter before the Report Stage and if I do not submit an amendment designed to give him compensation for what he may lose, I will give the Deputy an opportunity of resubmitting his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might consider placing the number who are affected &mdash; I do not think there are very many &mdash; in the Civil Service at a higher incremental point.  That probably would be a way out.  I understand that when some of these people were introduced into the society they were introduced at a wage&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did what the Deputy has suggested, the pension would be abated still further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;leaving him in a position that he will draw weekly or monthly the same amount of money, or perhaps a little more.  I understand when certain Old I.R.A. men were taken into the society as employees their pensions at the time were taken into account.  That was some years ago.  Then they paid them a scale of wages which, added to their pensions, left them with a small weekly wage. There was one man taken in at a wage of 34/- a week which, added to his pension, left him with a certain small weekly wage.  That case was fought for a long period of years before it was corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Deputy Colley is concerned, he has achieved his purpose in the promise of the Minister to consider how he can best reconcile the position of these particular people in the Civil Service with their National Health Insurance Society income and their <Col N="1696" /> pension combined.  I suppose it is too much to hope that this whole matter of abatement and deduction from military service pensions will be considered by the Government, but, if the Government were to take the broad policy of ending these abatements, it would solve this particular problem.  I do not agree that it is a dear way.  I understand the amount involved in all the deductions would not be very considerable. I understand that something in the nature of £20,000 would cover the entire figure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Or perhaps less than that.  We did hope last year that certain representations made to the Government and to the Minister for Defence would result in this problem being settled and these abatements or deductions done away with.  This amendment may bring the matter to light again, and perhaps the Minister might offer as a solution a recommendation to the Government that as far as the Civil Service is concerned these abatements or deductions should be stopped.</P>

The Minister made what we on this side of the House are quite prepared to accept as a reasonable gesture. We recognise the difficulties. The Minister quite reasonably said that he would examine the whole matter and if he cannot find a way of meeting Deputy Colley the amendment can be put down again for the Report Stage. We accept that.  Does Deputy Lehane not now realise that if he supported <Col N="1697" /> amendment No. 4 he would be supporting what this amendment purports to do?</P>

      <P>We were prepared to agree in response to the Minister's gesture.  At the time, it looked as if the Minister were about to give a certain reconsideration to the matter and then we had Deputy Cowan getting away from the whole idea at the back of this proposal.  What we are concerned with is the fact that a certain limited number of people are being transferred into the State service, not because they desire it and not because they made any request for it, but because an Act of Parliament is being passed.  We have all the time tried to argue that their conditions should not be worsened.  We discussed on amendment No. 4 ways and means of calculating their entry into the Civil Service so that they would not be worse off ultimately or immediately, and we discussed on the amendment previous to this the pension which would accrue to an individual as a result of his service. Deputy Cowan argues against the sense of this amendment by saying that the National Health Insurance Society calculated a person's military service pension for the purpose of giving him an appointment at a lower rate of pay.</P>

Here are people who are going to be immediately worse off and I rather feel that, when Deputy Lehane gets up and says he agrees with the principle of the amendment but that for this and that reason he does not think the Minister could accept it, he is putting himself back into the position he was in at the end of the discussion on his own amendment.</P>

I hope he will be able to find a way out which will satisfy everybody concerned that Old I.R.A. men who are fortunate enough to be in positions of this kind will not lose any money.  I feel certain that if the Minister has <Col N="1700" /> difficulties in the matter, the Old I.R.A. men who are Deputies will stand behind him.  If they do not, they ought to forget about talking of ever having been in the Irish Republican Army.</P>
      <P>Mention was made here of a privileged class.  I say that the Minister would be fully entitled, and nobody in this country could dare to question his right, to make the Old I.R.A. men who are in this service a privileged class because they deserve it.  But for them, this House would not be discussing a proposal of this kind.  All this matter would be under discussion in the British Parliament, were it not for the Old I.R.A. men to whom this amendment refers.  I regret that I cannot agree with Deputy Cowan that sane sensible and Christian men in the National Health Insurance Society ever took into consideration the Old I.R.A. man's pension.  They did not think Deputy Cowan believed in fairy tales, but it strikes me that he does. Again, I want to say that I appreciate the Minister's approach to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be a little clearer about this matter.  I do not know precisely why Deputy Lehane should be so anxious that it should be withdrawn and that we should not have a more explicit understanding than we have had so far as to what the Minister intends to do. Some suggestions have been thrown across the House, one of them by Deputy Cowan, and Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Davern have pointed out that there were certain difficulties which would be created by the adoption of Deputy Cowan's proposal, and the Minister himself has pointed out that, so far from helping the situation, his proposal would in fact probably make it worse for the person concerned. There is no doubt whatever that if a servant or officer of the society who is in receipt of a military service pension is brought into the service of the State, his position, so far from being improved, as the Minister told us, will be definitely worsened.  Of that there is no doubt.  It will be worsened to the extent that his pension which he now enjoys in full will be substantially abated.  That is the problem. <Col N="1701" /> It is not a question of whether we are going to embarrass the Minister or not but whether we are going to do something practical to ensure that his position will not be worsened and what is practical is embodied in the amendment. Deputy Lehane shakes his head. The Deputy is a neophyte in this House.  He has been three years in it. There are members here who have been Ministers and there are members who are Ministers and they know that this amendment could be accepted.  If Deputy Lehane has the courage of his convictions and Deputy Cowan has the courage of his and the Labour Party are prepared to do what they were always pretending they wanted to do, there would be no difficulty; the Minister would have no difficulty in impressing his colleagues with the fact that he must accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>It does not depend on us whether this amendment is accepted or not.  We are a minority.  You are the gentlemen who keep the Government in power. You are the gentlemen who can write the law and if you really believe that it is unjust that a man in receipt of a military service pension in the service of the National Health Insurance Society will have that pension abated when he comes into the service of the State, you are the gentlemen who can ensure that that injustice will not be done.  It is on your heads that that injustice will rest, if it is perpetrated.</P>
      <P>It is all very well for Deputies to get up and talk about sympathy.  You are the people who are in a position to call the tune.  It is your votes that are paying the piper.  Every Old I.R.A. man who is in the service of the National Health Insurance Society and who is brought into the service of the State and who suffers in consequence &mdash; if he should suffer, and I hope he will not &mdash; can place the responsibility squarely on your shoulders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lehane has said that this matter was not dealt with before in this House.  It was dealt with in this House before.  It was dealt with in an amendment to the Military Service Pensions Act and the hardship which was embodied in the 1924 Pensions Act was mitigated to some extent in this House and there is no use twitting Deputy Colley or myself or any other <Col N="1702" /> member of the Fianna Fáil Party that we did not abolish the injustice altogether.</P>

One must admit that there will have to be a departure in legislation.  In my opinion, those people in the employment of the National Health Insurance Society who have had this privilege should continue to have it even though they are transferred to the Civil Service, and I am very glad we have had an indication of the Minister's future approach to the matter.</P>

      <P>There was a suggestion made by Deputy Cowan that the person might be brought in at a point in the salary scale an increment or two higher than he otherwise would get. At first sight, that might look good. But, take that person four or five years later, when he reaches the maximum. Then, of course, he has no further advantage. In addition, when he reaches the maximum, there will be a bigger reduction, so that it will only be a temporary advantage.</P>

      <P>I mentioned last night cases of part-time or temporary outdoor agents in the country and I set out, from the communication I received, a list of duties performed by these individuals.  Apparently, the average remuneration is £5 per week, out of which they have to pay rent, fire and light of office, postage and travelling expenses.  This may be an opportunity for the Minister to say whether there will be an improvement in the conditions of employment of these particular agents and whether or not the responsibility for office accommodation <Col N="1705" /> and postage will be a charge on the Department of Social Welfare or on the wages and salary of these outdoor agents.  Notwithstanding what Deputy Davern said about the Christian gentlemen who control the National Health Insurance Society, I think the terms and conditions under which some of these people have to serve, if the information given to me by the Connaught provincial committee of rural agents is correct, are neither very good nor very Christian.  Perhaps the Minister will deal with that matter.</P>

      <P>Last night I mentioned specifically the question of the promotion bar within the Civil Service.  I appreciated then, and still appreciate, that the Minister will have some difficulty in overcoming that problem when transferring these officers from the society to the Civil Service.  The Minister is aware that there are promotion bars between the clerical grade, the executive grade and the administrative grade in the Civil Service.  The Minister has assured us that these officers will not suffer financially on transfer. That can easily be understood.  I mentioned earlier a deputation that visited the various political Parties.  That deputation put before our Party the problem of promotion and I thought, having personal knowledge of the position, that this would create considerable difficulty for the Minister.  The Minister told us last night there would be no difficulty from the financial point of view, but he made no attempt to explain how the problem of promotion would be overcome.</P>
      <P>The members of the staff of the society are apprehensive and I presume there will be a corresponding apprehension within the Civil Service itself in case society employees on transfer may enjoy any special privileges in regard to the promotion bar. Perhaps the Minister would elaborate, now or at a later stage, how he proposes to overcome that difficulty.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cowan has raised the position of the provincial agents with special reference to the agents in Connaught.  The conditions of agents in Connaught are substantially similar in general practice to those of agents appointed elsewhere.  I <Col N="1706" /> do not for a moment accept the computations made by the individual who corresponded with Deputy Cowan. What I said on the Second Stage and during the discussions on the Committee Stage still stands.  Their conditions of employment and their wages will not be worsened on transfer to the Civil Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>They could not very well be worsened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for their present conditions.  On transfer, I take it that whatever the Deputy's correspondent spent on postage, and he made a fairly substantial tot when he went about it, will become the responsibility of the Department.  I imagine the same will be true as regards accommodation.  There is probably some prospect there that he may get relief from the impost he put on himself by letter, at all events, when he was communicating with the Deputy. I do not think this provides an occasion for any dismal foreboding on his part and he may reasonably look forward to some improvement under both these headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch dealt with the promotion problem as it affects the staff of the National Health Insurance Society.  I do not know where the Deputy got the information that has bewildered him so completely in this matter.  For the benefit of the Deputy, I shall make another disadvantageous tot from my point of view.  If we throw into one pool the junior clerical and the clerical staff of the society, men and women, and throw into the other pool the higher posts for which they would be eligible for promotion we get a situation in which the prospects of promotion are at present one in six in the National Health Insurance Society while, in the Department of Social Welfare, the prospects of promotion for a clerical officer are now one in four and, when the employment branch staff are included, the prospects of promotion will be one in three.  There is nothing to prevent a clerical officer being promoted to the rank of minor staff officer, staff officer and junior executive officer. Once the staff of the National Health Insurance Society qualify for promotion <Col N="1707" /> in accordance with conditions of service and ability there is nothing to prevent their being promoted.</P>

      <P>In the last seven or eight years 178 persons were appointed as a result of examination.  Here I am comparing the prospects of promotion for clerical officers in the Department with clerical officers in the National Health Insurance Society; you have one in four in the Department and one in six in the society.  Which is better?  It is as clear as daylight that the opportunities for promotion are better in the Department than they are in the society.  Remember, too, that the Department is taking over the posts in the society to which these people are now eligible for promotion and they will remain eligible for promotion to them in the future.  You could not have less from the point of view of opportunities for promotion.  How are their prospects curtailed in any way?  Bear in mind, too, that this is an expanding Department.  In face of these figures, I invite the Deputy to tell me in what way their opportunities are worsened.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we are arguing on all-fours.  I agree that the prospects of promotion may be better but as the Minister is aware, once an employee comes into the staff of the National Health Insurance Society he can be promoted on merit right through to the top.  Once he is transferred into the general service clerical officer grade, as is apparently now envisaged, he will go into a much larger pool than merely a pool within the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out last night, serving civil servants up to the age of 25 have the same rights as new entrants up to the age of 19 or 20 in the open competitive examination for appointment to the junior executive grade.  Over and above that, there are limited examinations within the Civil Service, by means of which clerical officers can be promoted to the junior executive grade.  These examinations, as I said last night, are run in two heats.  First of all, there is the departmental qualifying examination which is by way of interview.  These candidates are selected by the departmental board and are then put forward to take their chance with the over-all Civil Service Board who again examine all the candidates put forward by the various Departments and only a limited number of the successful ones are appointed to the junior executive grade.  It does not necessarily mean that a clerical officer who comes from the Department of Social Welfare will be appointed a junior executive officer in his own Department.</P>

I put it to the Minister, and I put it confidently, that there would be no limited examinations for promotions within the Department of Social Welfare.  I never heard of it and I spent some time in the Civil Service. The reason I am insistent on that is that I should like again to refer to the deputation which came to all Parties. The Minister said that these members of the National Health Insurance Society staff were reassured by whatever guarantees he gave them. Nevertheless, our Party being the last Party before whom these people came, the members of that deputation expressed their concern about the promotion <Col N="1709" /> bar and it is as a result of that concern that I am raising this question. I do not think, with all respect to the Minister, that he is quite right in his approach to the question.</P>

      <P>I was rather astonished at the flippancy with which the Minister disposed of the representations which Deputy Cowan made on behalf of rural agents.  Listening to him when he protested that he was not responsible for the salaries which they now enjoy, it rather reminded me of a historical hand-washing operation because, after all, the Tánaiste is the Minister who is responsible for the National Health Insurance Society. When I was speaking last night on Deputy Dr. Ryan's amendment No. 4, he endeavoured to make the responsibility of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health for the administration of the society very specific and very definite.  He asked me if I would not go to the people who had come to me and asked me to make their case, and ask them whether they did not prefer his method of dealing with it to my method.  I see in that an admission that the Tánaiste, had he wished to improve the conditions of any officer or servant of the National Health Society, could have done so by personal interference on his part.  That is the suggestion he was making last night. To-day, however, when Deputy Cowan draws his attention to the position of certain outdoor servants of the society who operate in Connaught, he disclaims responsibility.  He treats the matter with a jocoseness that ill becomes the Tánaiste, who was at one time the chairman of the Labour Party and who is supposed to be concerned with the position of the under-privileged classes, as he would probably describe them, in the State.  To-day they were the subject of fun for the Tánaiste.  He was able to speak of their condition with a great deal of complacency, and apparently with some amusement and enjoyment, when he was discussing the matter with Deputy Cowan.  What a change has come over <Col N="1710" /> the Tánaiste since he was translated from these benches to the opposite benches!  When he was here, how his poor heart used to bleed for the temporary postmen who enjoy possibly better conditions than these men!</P>

Deputy Cowan read a letter last night in which certain statements were made which I do not think accurately represent the conditions of the people so employed. I have no responsibility for the conditions of employment of that staff.  They are quite entitled to be in a trade union and to bring their case before the committee of management and to bring their case before the Labour Court.  If they do, unlike Deputy MacEntee when he was Minister for Local Government, I will not send an officer of my Department down to justify the sweated conditions as I told the staff of the National Health Insurance Society when they asked me to intervene and ask for increased wages.</P>
      <P>I said: &ldquo;The Labour Court is open to you.  Go to the Labour Court and make your case there.&rdquo;  They said: &ldquo;If we do, the Department will send down an officer to plead that the Department has no money because it has exceeded its administrative expenses. Deputy MacEntee when he was Minister for Local Government did that.&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;I will not do it.  If you make your case before the Labour Court and the Labour Court makes an award, we will find the money to meet that award.&rdquo;  That is a contrast to that high priest of low wages over there.

I had my duty as Minister for Local Government and Public Health responsible to ensure that the funds provided by the beneficiaries would be managed and expended for their benefit.  There are 640,000 persons who are compelled by law to pay into the funds of that society.  I said to the officers of the society who I thought were going to deflect from their duty in relation to <Col N="1712" /> the members of the society that I felt that if the Labour Court is there, they could not allow any claims before that Labour Court to go by default, and so far as claims were made which would entrench upon the funds of the society, in my opinion, the committee of management were bound to go there and as representatives of the members of the society adduce arguments which would protect the funds of the beneficiaries. That is what I did and I did not, in order to curry favour with the members of the society or of the general public, fail to do my duty as the Minister failed to do his duty in that case.</P>

      <P>Section 12 is a section which, if you remember, relates to the reserve fund.  I asked for information about the guarantee fund, as to what it was, and I was given an explanation by the Minister which appears in columns 246-7 in Volume 120, No. 2, of the Official Debates and is as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Deputy is a very knowledgeable person and, no doubt, reading a Bill presents no difficulty to him.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It does not.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If he reads the remainder of the Bill before him he will see what the guarantee fund is.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I read the remainder of the Bill and I could not see what the guarantee fund was and neither could any Deputy in this House see what the guarantee fund was.  The Minister went on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;In case the Deputy is not able to grasp the Bill, may I tell him that <Col N="1714" /> the guarantee fund is a fund created by the 1911 Act, which he apparently administered for a long number of years without knowing anything about it?  The fund is designed to make good deficits in particular societies which then existed separately. I shall endeavour to have this written for the Deputy in simpler language, and submit it to him well in advance of the Committee Stage, so that he can discuss it to his heart's content.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The reason I raise that matter is to show that if I did administer the Act for a long number of years I knew something about it and I would at least have had the good manners, if I were Minister and were asked a question, to reply to it more politely than the Minister has done.  On the following day I pointed out what, in fact, the fund was to which the Minister had referred in the passage I have just quoted.  I now quote from column 360 of Volume 120, No. 3, of the Official Debates.  I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is quite clear that what the Minister had in mind when he was talking about this was not the guarantee fund to which I referred, but a fund that was originally set up and called the central fund.  That was a fund designed precisely for the purpose which he mentioned.  I think that fund was set up under the Act of 1918.  The purpose of the fund was to provide a sort of general reserve for all the approved societies from which, if the valuation of the assets of any society disclosed a deficit greater than the resources of the society, or the capacity of its members, would enable that to be liquidated within a reasonable term, the resources of the society could then be supplemented.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My purpose then, in dealing with a somewhat complicated matter, was to put it in simple language.  I now come to the document which the Tánaiste, apparently at my insistence, has had written out in simple language and submitted to me well in advance of the Committee Stage.  I find from it this reference to Section 12 of the Bill:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" />&ldquo;There are also invested moneys under the National Health Insurance Acts held by the Minister for Finance on behalf of the National Health Insurance Reserve Fund set up under Section 6 of the National Health Insurance Act, 1942.  This fund was the successor to the National Health Insurance Central Fund set up by the National Health Insurance Act, 1918, for the purpose of making good deficiencies arising in individual societies on the quinquennial valuation of their assets and liabilities.  On the dissolution of the National Health Insurance Society no purpose would be achieved by maintaining the National Health Insurance Reserve Fund as a separate entity and, accordingly, Section 12 of the Bill provides for the merging of its investments with those of the National Health Insurance Fund under the control of the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now all I have to say about that is that, I think I have conclusively proved that, in administering this Act, I knew a little bit about it, something more than the Tánaiste knew at any rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>On Section 13, I wish to deal with a remark of the Tánaiste so that we may have it on record that the reflection which he cast upon my knowledge and information on this matter was without any sound foundation. It is an animadversion upon myself, and as it appears in the Official Report, I think I am entitled to say that I did know what I was talking about and that it was the Tánaiste who did not know what he was talking about.  Having recited Section 26 of the Act of 1911 which is.  I think, referred to in the interpretation section of the Bill, I am reported at column 359 of the Dáil debates for the 30th March last as saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Will any Deputy tell me that he <Col N="1716" /> heard me mention the words &ldquo;guarantee fund&rdquo; once while I recited the terms of that section under which the Minister tells us this fund was set up?  The fund, perhaps, was set up under regulations made by the National Health Insurance Commissioners of Ireland, in the first place, and then subsequently modified and amended by the Minister for Local Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there was just one slight inaccuracy in what I said.  I said, if I remember, that the fund was set up by regulation.  The fund originally, according to the memorandum which the Tánaiste has circulated, &ldquo;was not set up by regulation but was set up by an administrative act of the commissioners. The provisions regarding the fund appear, however, in the National Health Insurance (Approved Societies) Consolidated Regulations, 1918.&rdquo;  I did know a little about this Act when I was speaking on the Second Stage, and the lesson in zoology which the Tánaiste gave to the House when he was concluding the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill was a little bit misplaced.  I see here, because I asked him a question, that he had the graciousness to characterise me as an elephant.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;him&rdquo; where it firstly occurs in line 37 to insert &ldquo;for the benefit of the fund&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not so certain, looking at the section, that the draftsmanship is not ambiguous because it says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" />&ldquo;Notwithstanding any other provision of the Acts, all sums standing to the credit of the fund and not required to meet current expenditure shall be paid over to the Minister for Finance and retained by him until they are so required, and while such moneys are retained by the Minister for Finance, they shall be invested by him...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My difficulty is this: If the society is transferred to the Minister, as it will be under this Bill and if all the officers of the society become civil servants, surely all the salaries and charges of the society will become charges on voted moneys.  Therefore, all that it would appear could happen would be that all the moneys collected by way of weekly contributions from the members must be paid into the fund in the first place, and must remain there with the Minister in order to meet the demands of the beneficiaries of the society and to meet the salaries and wages of the society.  That would appear to be the position, but whether it is or is not, what we want to ensure is that, where the society has a surplus income over and above current expenditure, howsoever that current expenditure is to be provided, these moneys will be invested by the Minister for the benefit of the fund.  It is not clear from the section as it stands that the Minister will in fact invest the moneys for the benefit of the fund.  He can invest them for the general benefit of the State, I think, as the section stands.  We want to ensure that that will not happen and that a position will be created analogous to that of the Teachers' Pensions Fund where the moneys are invested and the income is used as an Appropriation-in-Aid towards meeting the cost of teachers' pensions.</P>

      <P>I think it is clear what the section means.  The intention is, and I think the phrasing of the section implements the intention, that the Minister for Finance is to invest for the benefit of the fund, under regulations to be made by him, whatever surplus is not required for the purpose of paying benefit under the fund.  If, however, there should be any doubt in the matter, we could put in a phrase such as &ldquo;on behalf of the funds&rdquo; so as to make it clear beyond all possible doubt that the Minister was required to invest the money on behalf of the fund. A somewhat similar reference occurs in Sections 9 and 10, and we can carry it into this section if there should be any doubt as to the intention with reference to the investment.  What is being done here is what is being done at present under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act, namely, whatever moneys are not required for the payment of benefit are switched to the Minister for Finance to invest these surplus moneys on behalf of the fund. That is done under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act and it is proposed to bring the National Health Insurance Fund into line.</P>

      <P>This is to ensure that, instead of the fixed sum of £215,000, we shall take the average expenditure of the society for the years 1946, 1947 and 1948 as the basic figure.  I do not know how the sum of £215,000 was arrived at, but I think it is reasonable that we should have regard to the average for the three years, 1946, 1947 and 1948.

There is no question about its being any guess sum.  It is actually expended.  It goes out on the one hand: it goes in on the other hand.

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I forgot precisely what I was trying to get at.  I am grateful to the Minister because he has now brought the whole thing into proper focus.  What I was saying is that under this Bill, as soon as the society is taken over, the Minister for Social Welfare becomes responsible for administering the affairs of the scheme.  The society will disappear but he will be responsible for administering the National Health Insurance scheme.  He will have to administer it properly and efficiently.  The question that arises is this: can we reduce the amount of recoupment which he will secure for the administrative expenses that will inure to the benefit of the fund?  We hope, naturally, that this will not be desiccated.  We hope it will increase.  Therefore, the smaller the liabilities we impose on it for administrative purposes the greater the security the existence of the fund will afford to the people brought into the scheme.  For that reason we looked at the three years mentioned here &mdash; 1946, 1947 and 1948.  We thought that instead <Col N="1722" /> of taking the £215,000 as a fixed sum and taking it as the basic amount which must be charged against the fund for the administration of benefits, it would be better to take the average over these years.  Some years may be more expensive than others.  It is quite a possibility, despite everything, that administrative costs might come down.  If they fall below £215,000 then the fund will be carrying an undue debit &mdash; it will have to meet an undue debit.  For that reason I think it would be rather unfair.  Therefore, on the principle that matters should be evened out, taking one year with another, we put down this amendment which provides that the average figure for the three years should be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that this is only a stop-gap arrangement. When the society comes into the Department it will not be possible to ascertain what sum of money it costs to administer the society in the Department. Costs of administration can be ascertained in the society because the society is doing only National Health Insurance work.  When it comes into the Department it will be taken over by the Department and we will not be able to get the figures with that kind of precision.  Officers may be doing different classes of work.  You will not be able to calculate what percentage of time they will spend on National Health Insurance work and on other work.  The best way, therefore, is to find out what it cost the society to run itself in the last ascertainable year, namely, the year ending 31st March, 1950.  That figure is going in there. The figure on which the State will pay its 2/9ths grant is the figure for the year ending 31st March, 1950.  That was the cost of expenditure last year and we think it is the most reliable index as to what administrative costs will be this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At all events, next year this whole business will go by the board.  It will all be integrated in an entirely new organisational and financial set-up. This is a device to keep things, as it were, separate until the main scheme comes along.

The position here <Col N="1724" /> is that an actuarial review of the finances of the society on the 31st December, 1940, would not be available until December, 1951, and would not affect the amount to be made available for additional benefits until the year commencing April, 1952&mdash;by which time the new scheme would be in operation and special provisions made with regard to what the additional scheme is likely to be.  Therefore, even if an actuarial review were held it could not be available until next December twelve months.  It would involve a considerable sum of money to have an actuarial review.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Deputy thinks it would be worth while to undertake an actuarial review which would probably not be available until after the discussion of the main scheme.  If it is any help to the Deputy I will undertake, when we get to that stage, to make available to him any information regarding the actuarial position of the society that is available to myself.  Perhaps that would meet his point?  An actuarial examination undertaken now will not give us figures until December, 1951, but I undertake to ensure that the Deputy will get all the mathematical statistics he wants when we come to discuss the main Bill.</P>

      <P>Looking at this explanatory memorandum, it appears that the last actuarial examination was made for the year 1943.  That is a long time back.  We have no good idea as to how the funds stand, whether the members should be getting a higher rate of benefit or not.</P>

      <P>It is useful information to any Minister preparing a comprehensive scheme to know whether the members are getting as high benefits as they are entitled to get, considering the contributions they have been paying. In preparing this scheme it would help the Minister to have an actuarial examination at a later date than 1943. I cannot understand how it could be such a long time.  I am sure an actuary could do the job in three or four months and give the result to the Minister.  As <Col N="1725" /> the Bill stands, these additional benefits will cease after three years&mdash;two years from now.  The Minister may answer by saying he will have his comprehensive scheme in operation before the expiry of that time.  Supposing, however, he has not, if we pass this Bill the additional benefit stops then.</P>

      <P>No doubt, the Minister expected me to be critical, but I do not think I was unduly or unfairly so.  I promised to be constructive and if he examines my statement in the calmness of his office he will discover that my contribution to the debate was a constructive one.  In view of certain doubts which he had, apparently, in regard to figures, I think it well for me to go back again to the question of land and land acquisition.  Many Deputies will probably think that, having discussed it last night, I am devoting altogether too much time to it, but it is my experience, in seeking the success of any project in which one is interested, that it is wise to attend to the obvious and fundamental matters first.  In creating any structure, we must first lay the foundation and afterwards, course by course, raise the building.  If we tackle the land problem first and deal with it to a conclusion, all other matters will fall to be dealt with in their logical sequence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could be very voluble here and talk with a great appearance of learning and knowledge about the various varieties of trees and the soil suitable to their full development.  I might discuss at length what has been discussed here, the vast employment that might be created by a properly developed forestry scheme, although in regard to that I am not quite as sanguine as other people are.  I might also talk endlessly, as other Deputies have, about the industries that follow forestry; and very learnedly, like other Deputies, about plastics.  But, being of the earth, earthy, I prefer to deal with the fundamental question of land. I say again that I totally disagree with those Deputies who suggest that we should use arable land for forestry, and with those who believe that any kind of land might be used.  It cannot. The Minister's problem, a most difficult one, is to secure plantable land, nonarable land but plantable, and to be able to acquire it at a reasonable price. I am glad he made the point in his speech that he did not propose to pay outrageous prices for land.  It is well <Col N="1727" /> that those who offer land for forestry should know exactly what they are likely to get and not be expecting to make a fortune out of a piece of mountainside.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to have certain doubts about his and my figures.  I think it is well to examine them again, to point again the moral of the difficulty of the Minister and the Department. The Minister gave his figures: he seemed to doubt mine; yet they both came from the same source, the Forestry Department's office.  In 1948-49 we agreed to purchase 6,635 acres and there were advanced negotiations for the purchase of 9,873, a total of 16,508 acres.  We acquired 3,712 acres.  In 1949-50 we had arrangements to purchase 9,822½ acres and negotiations were far advanced for the purchase of 10,167 acres, making a total of 19,989½ acres.</P>
    <P>I would like the Dáil to examine the meticulous accuracy of the figures given by the Forestry Department down to the last half-acre&mdash;valley and hill, stream and roadway, fence and ditch, stony land and good land, down to the last blade of grass, to the last half-acre, absolutely and meticulously accurate.  The Minister generally deals in round figures, which are not always what they seem; they are so round sometimes that I am afraid to swallow them.  With all these purchase and advanced negotiations for 19,989½ acres, all we acquired up to February 28th was 6,149 acres.  The Minister seemed to have some doubt about that.  In Volume 119, No. 13, column 1891 we read: &mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During the 11 months ended 28th February, 1950, 6,149 acres of plantable land were acquired.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made by the Minister. In his speech, however, the Minister told us he had purchased and acquired 9,122½ acres, so, during the month of March&mdash;the year ends on March 31st&mdash;the Forestry Department purchased 3,000 acres.  It seems to me that my question on 15th March was a shot in the arm for the Forestry Department.  If Deputy Commons and a few more of the boys tried hypodermic injections of that sort we might <Col N="1728" /> get a little further with the development of forestry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doubtful of the Minister's <i>bona fides</i> in regard to his whole programme, because the success of it depends on the acquisition of land. I made a considered suggestion last night, that land at river sources should be acquired.  I think it is both wise and necessary that the land in the areas around the sources of our larger rivers should be acquired.  One of the places where it is possible to get suitable land is in the upper reaches of the rivers.  It is there it will do the most good, particularly in preserving the water levels of the country.</P>
      <P>The reason I am doubtful about the Minister is because he immediately raised a difficulty when he asked: &ldquo;How are we going to get labourers to go into these districts?&rdquo;  Deputy Dunne has constituted himself a champion of the labourers.  I have no doubt he realises the value of forestry from the labour point of view.  Also, I have no doubt if Deputy Dunne, with his regard for labourers, were in the Minister's shoes, he would find no difficulty about getting the labourers to the forests.  If we are going to undertake a vast expenditure in the development of forestry, and if our great difficulty is the getting of the land we ought to get the land where we can and we could make the necessary arrangements for the transport of labourers there.  That has been done elsewhere.  Then again, this island of ours could be crossed in three hours.  It is not a tremendous area of land, a continental divide. There is no place so remote, so isolated, that workmen cannot be got to that part where they would work, with reasonable facilities.  I think the Minister should consider the view I put to him of acquiring land in the upper reaches of the rivers, and particularly around the sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather interested in the swift development of our planting procedure. Anything I can do to help the Minister to get the work done, I shall do, but people who are anxious for a swift and wide development of forestry&mdash;of which I approve&mdash;might come with experience <Col N="1729" /> to regard the idea as sound that too much speed at the very start will run us all out of breath.  In the five years before Fianna Fáil took office the average planting was 1,413 acres.  I will omit the transition year as between Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, but in the eight years before the war the average planting was 6,140 acres; that is, roughly, four and a half times as much as was planted before Fianna Fáil took office.  The greatest annual planting was in 1938, 7,389 acres.  The average for the war years, which was the greatest achievement of the Forestry Department, was 4,259 acres.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil did come into office with the forestry idea that it derived from the old Sinn Féin days.  They were anxious to promote forestry during the eight pre-war years and during that time they certainly raised the standard of planting by four and a half times annually.  It will be difficult for the Minister to raise it again by four times, which is actually his target, and because it is difficult we want to give him all the help possible from all sides of the House.  The Minister should be quite as meticulous in giving us his figures as is the Forestry Department in providing him with figures.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister stated that he had planted more trees than Fianna Fáil had planted at its best.  In his Estimate speech last year, he spoke of 8,000 acres but, nevertheless, he admitted in the speech that, up to 31st March, which is the end of the year, the amount planted was 7,000 acres. That is to be found in Volume 115 (1), column 51, of the Official Debates, so that last year at any rate he did not get past the target set for him.  This year the Minister again tells us that he has planted 8,000 acres.  I hope he has done so, but, because of our deep interest, we will, as long as we are permitted to be here, check these figures, so as to assure ourselves that the work we so very earnestly desire should be done is being done.  Times do change and there may be Parties in this House at a later date who would be much more critical of the Minister in any slip he made than I am.  I will say no more about land, but I want <Col N="1730" /> again to stress that the one outstanding factor in the development of forestry is the acquisition of land.</P>
    <P>Another point which is very important is the stock of equipment in the hands of the Department.  The Minister knows, and has said, that one important factor in forestry development is the preservation of the rhythm of planting, to have a settled and fixed programme which you follow from year to year planned over a period of three years.  I think that if we are to preserve that rhythm, the Forestry Department should have in hands a reserve of four years' supply of all kinds of material, wire, tools and machinery.  Judging by the answer to a question of mine recently in regard to wire, the amount of wire in the hands of the Forestry Department was not sufficient for one season's planting. I may be wrong in that, but, at a casual glance, without being an expert, it seemed to me that the amount of wire in stock was not sufficient for one year's planting.  We cannot have a forestry without wire and the reason there was such a slowing down in planting during the war years was that we had not the reserve of wire which we should have had in stock.  This is an uncertain world and we ought to ensure in relation to forestry against the uncertainty of it.  Be not solicitous for to-morrow is a very good piece of advice when it is contained in Scriptures, but it should not be transferred to forestry.  We should try to be most solicitous for to-morrow.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I want to be assured and satisfied is the question of seeds.  The Minister has completely bemused my already muddled mind by the information he has given me in regard to seeds.  In Volume 115 (1), column 51, the Minister told us that 590 lbs. of foreign seed had been delivered during 1948-49.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the date of the statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be found in Volume 115 (1) at column 51.  On 15th <Col N="1731" /> March, he told me that he had got 1,000 lbs. of imported seed&mdash;650 lbs. of abies pectinata; 200 lbs. of pinus contorta and 150 lbs. of Scots pine.  The reference in that case is Volume 119 (13), column 1893.  Then the Minister, on 26th March, a fortnight after, in Volume 120 (1) at column 6, tells me that he has got imported seed to the amount of 4,399½ lbs.  Before the discussion on the Social Welfare Bill finished, Deputy MacEntee was demanding a further actuarial inquiry.  In this case, we have 590 lbs., 1,000 lbs. and 4,399½ lbs., all within calling distance of each other.  Somebody slipped up there and I think it would be well if the discrepancy were put right.</P>
      <P>I should like to be assured that the Minister is satisfied with the position so far as he can satisfy himself, because we find that the total amount of seed sown last year was 14,200 lbs., which means that most of the seed was secured at home.  The Minister's Department is responsible for forestry and if there is any blame to be apportioned, it will certainly be apportioned to the Minister, and, if there is any credit going, we ought to give it fairly and squarely to the Minister, without distributing it over a wide area.  This position in regard to the seeds was very peculiar in so far as it got so many different answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this pantomime of the seeds last year, the Minister for External Affairs appeared as the principal boy.  There was so much talk about the amount of seeds secured by the Minister for External Affairs and the tremendous effort he had made in doing the work of the Minister for Lands that I began to believe that all the Department of Forestry had to do was to press a button in his midriff and he would immediately exude plants and seeds in every quantity and variety and without any trouble to the Minister.  I am always doubtful about slot machines&mdash; they are generally out of order&mdash;and the Minister, with his physical proportions, should be very doubtful of slot machines.  I do not think that, in future, he should content himself with pressing a button in the midriff of the Minister for External Affairs.  He has <Col N="1732" /> a job of his own.  I want to give all due credit to the Minister for his own work when there is credit due to him and not to anybody else.</P>
    <P>I venture to come in between Deputy Dunne and the Minister in regard to forest labourers, the question of their wages and conditions.  It seems to me that forest labourers have no special skills, that no special skills are demanded from the labourer who is employed in forestry that an ordinary agricultural labourer has not.  I subscribe to the view, of course, that there is no such thing as an unskilled labourer, and possibly a good agricultural labourer is one of the most skilled men in the world.  But, because a forestry labourer has not demanded of him in his employment by the Department any special skills that an agricultural labourer has, their wages are geared to the agricultural labourers' wages and that is the reason why it is quite justifiable. Having had more time at my disposal lately than I had before, I did make an examination of the position and I have a good deal of experience in another sphere of the conditions under which forestry labourers work and, on consideration of the position I think that, having regard to the fact that these men do work in isolated places, far away from home and thus, of course, work a longer day, and are more exposed to the inclemency of the weather, on that basis alone is there a justification for differentiation.</P>
    <P>There is adequate precedent in arrangements made with the building trade for wet-time payment which may affect these men when it does not affect agricultural labourers.  The Minister should not be content merely to discuss with the finance officer of his Department, who is naturally conservative, but should really examine the position for himself and discover, as I believe he will discover, that there is a definite and just reason for differentiation between the two types of labourers.</P>
    <P>Apart from forestry proper, the Minister mentioned last night that many people had not availed of the £10 scheme and he hoped, nowadays, when supplies were more readily available, to advertise the scheme a good deal more I am afraid the Minister will have very <Col N="1733" /> little success in regard to that.  While the planting of shelter belts and woodlands cannot be called forestry, it is very important from an economic and aesthetic viewpoint and I would like to see it developed and encouraged as far as possible.  I think £10 is inadequate. The cost of fencing must be a good deal more nowadays than it was when the £10 grant was fixed.  If, under the land reclamation scheme, the Government consider it worth while to pay £18 an acre for reclamation and drainage, they might remember that no large-scale reclamation and drainage is really valuable and lasting without a very definite scheme of afforestation and planting of woodlands.  I think the Minister should examine that situation and discover what it costs to fence a particular acre of land and, instead of offering a grant of £10, should offer to fence whatever acreage any farmer throughout the country is prepared to plant, always subject to specification, inspection and satisfaction on the part of the Forestry Department, and to arrange payments so as to safeguard the Forestry Department in their demand for proper plantation.</P>
    <P>Another group of people who need to be dealt with nowadays are those who secure licences for felling with an obligation to replant.  Up to this, it was hardly possible to insist on their fulfilling that obligation because, particularly, of the lack of wire and fencing. It seems to me that many of these people are anxious to avoid living up to the obligation and the Minister should definitely take a strong stand in regard to those people and make them plant.  Another reason, possibly, why they have not been able to plant is the fact that with the ordinary nurserymen plants were scarce.  A strange anomaly is that plants have been annually destroyed by the Forestry Department. I can understand the reason for that but I do think it should be possible to make some arrangement as between the Forestry Department and the nurserymen to co-operate with each other. Furthermore, I do think the Department should act as an information and advisory bureau for those people who want to plant, to let them know where they will get the materials, where they <Col N="1734" /> will get the plants, what the cost is likely to be, what their obligations are to the Forestry Department, and so on, because it is only by encouraging people to believe in forestry that we will get effective co-operation.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a matter last year&mdash;I mention it again&mdash;I think it is essential for our success in forestry&mdash;that is, the question of publicity.  Nurserymen do advertise their wares on a small scale.  But the Department of Forestry are the dark brothers in the abyss.  They never advertise.  One of the reasons why I insist on speaking on this debate every year is because it is the one piece of advertising&mdash; forestry gets&mdash;I need no advertising&mdash; during the year.  Nobody ever hears anything about afforestation.  Even the pearls of wisdom that drop from my lips to-night will be concealed by the Budget to-morrow.  Since the Government has gone to a good deal of expense and trouble in producing a booklet showing their concern for housing and hospitalisation and for bringing home the craftsmen from England, with all due credit to themselves, and since the Minister for External Affairs is not behind hand in advertising his wares and since the Minister for Social Welfare takes a good deal of credit in his particular booklet for his humanity and achievements, the Minister for Lands need not hide his light under the bushel of congestion.  After all the development of forestry will not adversely affect congestion.  It will be helpful in solving it.  The creation of employment as a result of forestry development will prove as helpful in relieving congestion as anything the Minister can do under the Land Acts.</P>
    <P>Last year Deputy C. Lehane said on the Estimate: &ldquo;Unless we can make people forest-conscious the task of the Minister and his Department will be much more difficult.&rdquo;  The Minister promised us a map last year.  We got the map.  While it is a very interesting one I think he could do more valuable work by expanding the idea a little further.  For instance, I would be willing to pay for a map of my constituency showing the plantable land therein so that I could try to help the Minister in securing these lands for that purpose.  I think it would be an <Col N="1735" /> excellent piece of advertising to publish maps of all the constituencies on the same lines as the map at present hanging in the Library.</P>
    <P>I suggested a few years ago one idea. I suggested to the Minister that he should have a competition for poster design among our artists.  Heaven knows, they need a little help and we need a little beauty on the billboards. I would suggest, too, an essay competition among the children.  I would suggest a documentary film.  I would suggest a radio talk.  I would even suggest that the Minister should give that radio talk.  I would love to hear him and I would love to get a chance to talk about it myself on the radio so as to balance the issue.  All these things would be helpful.  People are completely in the dark about forestry. They do not know there is a forestry division.  They do not know what it is doing.  Even if the Minister got as much advertising as some of his colleagues look for and get, I would have no grouse.  I would be delighted to see him get it.  When he is pleasant he looks very pleasant indeed.  Any method that would bring home to the public that there is a forestry division and that it is doing valuable work would help to educate public opinion and make the work of that division easier, swifter and more valuable.  The co-operation of the people is needed for the success of forestry and the success of forestry is, in my opinion, a matter of deep concern for both the people and the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, may I say that Deputy Moylan's speech was very interesting and constructive. There is no doubt that he knows plenty about afforestation and I am sure his remarks will be of considerable help to the Minister.  I am sure his speech was listened to with intense interest by those Deputies who know little or nothing about afforestation.  Those Deputies who do not know Deputy Moylan might be tempted to say to themselves: &ldquo;Now, is it not a pity that a man like Deputy Moylan cannot be made a Minister for afforestation. Look at all the wonderful things that would be done.&rdquo;  Despite Deputy <Col N="1736" /> Moylan's shyness, I think most Deputies know that he was Minister for afforestation and that he successfully hid his light not behind afforestation but behind a furze bush.  He described himself last night as a forestry enthusiast.  I have no doubt that he is an enthusiast and I believe that, to give him his due, Deputy Moylan would have made much more energetic efforts towards an afforestation drive if he had received the backing of his Government at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it can be denied that afforestation has been neglected under successive native Governments.  The mentality in the past was one that looked for quick returns on expenditure. Nobody can say that there are quick returns from afforestation.  It is quite evident that much of the planning in the past, and I am not now accusing the previous Government only in this matter, was short-term planning. Plans were initiated and work was done with an eye to quick returns. Recently it was stated here by the Minister for Finance that there did exist in the past a mentality which believed it was unsound financial policy to lock up money in afforestation. With that outlook what hope was there for a large-scale afforestation drive?  The sooner we stop talking here about how many acres we plant in the year the better it will be.  Fianna Fáil tell us they planted 6,000 acres in one year, and the present Minister tells us that he planted 7,000 or 8,000 acres; the sooner we forget that type of poppycock the better it will be.  I wonder if it is generally known that during the last war our next-door neighbour, with her people living in dire straits and under the most appalling conditions, kept up all during those years an average plantation of 30,000 acres per year.  In spite of the fact that this country was not invaded, the most we could do was an average of 4,000 acres.  Somebody was at fault in not making provision prior to the war for the importation of plenty of wire netting and equipment and for not making available proper nursery accommodation so that seedlings could be planted and grown, and in that way ensure during the war years a good average yearly plantation.  It makes <Col N="1737" /> me feel downhearted to have to listen here to talk of afforestation in terms of a few thousand acres a year.  It reminds me of the words of the song: &ldquo;Only God can make a tree.&rdquo;  I am afraid, judging by the present outlook, that the good Lord himself will have to come down and plant the required trees.</P>
    <P>I think it is an accepted fact also that wood is now a raw material that can satisfy almost every requirement of human existence.  I do not propose to attempt to give a learned speech on afforestation like Deputy Moylan; neither do I think it necessary to be an expert on afforestation to speak in this House, because I believe that if that were the case, if it were necessary to be an expert on the particular subject under discussion in the House in order to be qualified to speak in the debate, there would be more silence than talk at times.  Afforestation, or should I say timber, has played in recent years a very important part in world politics. The Germans prior to the last war strained every effort to get control of the world timber supply, and I think it is fairly evident that the reason the Germans put up such a show and lasted so long, was that they were not dependent for their raw materials on sources outside their own State.  They had one source of raw material in timber from which they made practically every commodity that one could think of including such well-known products as petroleum, fuel and ammunition.  Soap, cosmetics, clothing and food, all were made during the war years from timber and timber products both by the German and the Swedes.</P>
    <P>It is therefore vital that we strain every nerve here in this country to get as many acres of land planted in the shortest space of time possible.  At the present time huge sums of money are being spent both in American and Continental countries in forest laboratories to explore the possibilities of further uses for timber and its by-products. Even to-day in America 50 per cent. of the ice cream used there is flavoured by a by-product of timber&mdash; vanilla ice.  It is extraordinary, but nevertheless a fact that lignum from which the flavour is made, is only a waste material of timber.  That is only <Col N="1738" /> one of the thousand by-products that can be made from timber.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned that he wants to reach a minimum of 25,000 acres in new plantations every year. That is much better of course than the 6,000 or the 7,000 accomplished during the last ten or 15 years but taking into consideration the fact that afforestation has been so much neglected for years past, I think that we should aim at a higher target than 25,000 acres. There was a good deal of talk here to-day and on other days in reference to the question of the repatriation of our external assets.  I heard the Minister last year tell us proudly that they had now secured a bulldozer in the Department of Forestry.  There are to-day in Scotland hundreds of these bulldozers preparing the countryside for afforestation.  We cannot go back to the pick and shovel if we are going to get a big scheme under way.  If we had last year only this one solitary bulldozer, about which the Minister told us, surely he should have got some pals for it in the last 12 months.  I think that if he is in earnest about this problem of afforestation, he should buy the materials and the equipment necessary and buy it soon.  It is an excellent way of helping, as I say, to repatriate some of our external assets I repeat that I am not an expert on afforestation and I do not propose to go into the different types of timber which could be suitably grown in various parts of the country.  I agree to a great extent with Deputy Moylan's statement in connection with the plantation of the upper reaches of rivers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan also mentioned&mdash;and in this I agree with him&mdash;that the most important factor in afforestation is the acquisition of land.  I am not going to repeat what I said last year to the Minister, I am not going to be very critical of him, but I would ask him to make every effort to secure as much land as possible per year for this purpose and I think he will get the assistance of every rural Deputy in this House.  When the Minister is informed that people in a locality are only too anxious to give land at a reasonable price to the Forestry <Col N="1739" /> Department I think it is only reasonable to expect that the Minister should send an inspector to that locality as soon as possible to interview the people and examine the land as to its suitability or otherwise.  It is in things like that that we will see how sincere the Minister is about this afforestation drive.  I could mention many areas in my own constituency which I believe are ideal for afforestation purposes but I do not want to debate particular localities.</P>
    <P>If we are going to go ahead, as I hope we are, with afforestation I think we should pay well the men who work on it and other Deputies will I am sure also make that point.  I do not think that the foresters and labourers get a fair return for the work they do.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan mentioned the need for a publicity drive and again I find myself in agreement with him.  It is too bad, however, that he makes that suggestion when he is sitting on the far side of the House; it is an awful pity that he did not think of it when he sat on this side.  Great use could be made of the cinema in this publicity drive. It would be money well spent if a film on afforestation were made.</P>
    <P>With regard to waste land, I believe that a grant of £10 per acre is given to a farmer for planting on his own land.  This plan has not proved very successful in the past.  I would suggest to the Minister now that the land reclamation scheme is under way that when an application is made to the Department of Agriculture and the land in question, be it half an acre, an acre or two acres, is examined by an inspector and he considers it may not be altogether suitable for reclamation, that he should recommend instead that that portion of land should be planted and the reclamation scheme machinery be used to do that job.  I do not propose to go into detail but I can see no reason in the world why the officials who are acting for the Department of Agriculture could not be of immense assistance to the Minister for Lands by having an eighth or half an acre of scrub land planted whenever they are asked to interfere in connection with the land reclamation scheme.  It would <Col N="1740" /> not mean extra officers or setting up fresh machinery.  The machinery is getting into operation and with a little planning the scope of the inspectors' work could be enlarged.</P>
    <P>I think that we can hope for a great deal of assistance in rural areas from the young farmers' clubs in getting this publicity drive across to the people. I do not think anybody on the Fianna Fáil side can deny that in very recent years afforestation came into the limelight in a very big way as a result of the policy of Clann na Poblachta.  Deputy Moylan may look on us as being too optimistic about the acreage we would like to see planted each year and I will not dispute that with him, but at any rate the propaganda campaign conducted by our Party during the last few years has brought home to the people to a great extent that this very necessary adjunct to agriculture has been sadly neglected in the past.  I would go so far as to say that afforestation is our greatest weapon to preserve our economic freedom if another world conflict takes place.  That may sound a very sweeping statement.  It may not, if you like, be really factual at the moment, but I venture to say that those words of mine would be correct to-day if 25 or 30 years ago a proper programme of afforestation had taken place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan, I think, mentioned that mountain land should be acquired as soon as possible and that it would be much better if it were used for afforestation than as it is at present in rough grazing.  I do not think that anybody can deny the truth of that.  I think it should be pointed out that if people are removed from a locality where congestion exists it might be more advisable to use the land for afforestation purposes than to reallot it among the remaining small-holders. However, if this appeal for land for afforestation does not meet with the success that we all hope it should meet with, I think the Minister will have to be prepared to take steps to get this land when we consider that afforestation is so vital to our national welfare.</P>

      <P>I defy contradiction of that.  If he were to do that he would create a furore in the country.  This idea of getting cutaway bog in the West to grow commercial ash, oak and beech, or any of the other class of trees that brought a big income to the owners who had such timber in the war years is all nonsense and moonshine. You can grow on cutaway bog only stunted, twisted and gnarled trees of narrow width that will never be any good except for firewood.  Experience has shown that.  Deputies from the West of Ireland have spoken to me about the fine trees that were cut down in the Midlands during the last war. They had great width, height and were perfectly straight.  It would be impossible to grow such trees anywhere except on good land.  That is a fact that needs to be known before there is any attempt made to go ahead with a big scheme of forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Forestry Department has done its best.  We have a unit at Castle-pollard where I live.  It has become a considerable unit since it was established. What would the people in the townland of Foyran say if they were <Col N="1742" /> to be asked to give up for forestry purposes acres of the divided land that they got?  Under no circumstances would they give up half an acre.  They would tell you that their farms were small enough as they are.  Deputy McQuillan would advocate the use of compulsory powers to add to that unit. I want to know from the Minister how he is going to add to it.  He certainly will not do it by persuading the people to give up their land unless he gives them a colossal price for it.  They have small, economic holdings that they got under the 1923 Act.  There is another unit in Louth but the area of land there suitable for forestry is exhausted.</P>
    <P>We are wholeheartedly with everybody in the House on this matter.  We have had the same kind of debate, year after year, on this Estimate.  I have heard it when the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, and the Fianna Fáil Government were in office, and we have it to-day.  We must be practical in our approach to this subject. I should like to refer to one point that was dealt with by Deputy Moylan in his speech.  We did sell many acres of forests during the war. Acres and acres were sold in my county which is now depleted of good trees. There was a great deal of good ripe timber sold.  In many cases, the timber was not ripe at all, but the commercial men came in and bought so many trees.  At that time, you would need to have a guard in every acre of forest to see that they took only the number of trees they had actually bought.  The man that sold them the trees was not there, perhaps, at the felling and so they cut away.  That practice has denuded the country of many good trees.</P>
    <P>I am well aware of the difficulties of the Department and of the Minister. If Deputies, however, want to do any good for the country in this matter they cannot close their eyes to the fact that we had an emergency period or tell us, after the event, that everybody should have foreseen this, that and the other, and that we should have stores of all these things.  Hundreds of acres of forests were cut down during the emergency period.  The trees that were cut have not been replaced. <Col N="1743" /> Deputy Moylan has advocated that they should be.  The Minister will need to exercise all the powers that he has at his disposal under the law to see that those men who made hundreds of thousands of pounds out of the sale of commercial ash, oak and beech, particularly in the Midlands, will be made replant, not the number of trees that they cut down but the whole areas that have been denuded of forest.  I know, of course, that those people will do everything in their power to get out of their responsibility in that respect, but the Minister should do what I have suggested to him and use the powers that he has under the law.  I am putting these points to Deputy McQuillan and to other enthusiasts for the planting of trees.  I have one particular area in mind where one man made what I consider to be a fortune out of the sale of a forest that he inherited. At the present time, he is cutting down every whin bush and bramble that appears over that wide area so that his cattle and sheep may have grazing there.  I believe he told the Department that he replanted.  If he has replanted, it is on cut-away bog.  He said some of the trees planted failed.  They will never grow on that cut-away bog. He will never grow a forest on a cut-away bog in place of the forest of trees he sold.  That is what you are up against.</P>
    <P>When estates are taken over to relieve congestion I should like to see the Department attempting to plant trees where they were before.  There would be an outcry immediately if they attempted it.  In Ballinagall, on the Hawksworth-Smyth estate, five miles from Mullingar, migrants from Sligo and Mayo were put on the land.  They are decent, hard-working farmers and they do their farming well.  They complained to me about the Department taking over good land and planting it. I am standing over my statement that on that estate the Forestry Department are carrying out plantation on good land.  The migrants and the local people who got land on that estate are kicking up a row with me and other Deputies representing the constituency about good land being used for forestry. The principle is right, but look at what you are up against.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1744" /> Another matter I should like to call attention to is that when sheep farmers burn old spent grass in order to get new grass for the lambing season there is no co-operation between them and the Department of Forestry and the result is that belts of trees are burned down.  Something should be done to see that the burning of this old grass periodically does not destroy young trees.  In the Midlands during the war a lot of ditch timber was sold.  A lot of valuable larch, I believe, went into the aeroplane factories during that time.  It would be very desirable to have these trees replaced by young trees.  It would be desirable also, particularly in the West of Ireland, to get hawthorn hedges planted instead of existing stone walls.  It might mean the beginning of forestry in these districts. I read a book recently by Mr. McLysaght dealing with the 17th century here which showed that there was not a prevalence then of the hawthorn hedge.  Its development only took place in the last couple of hundred years and it could be developed further.  In Kerry they complain about the impossibility of getting hawthorn bushes.  Deputy McQuillan spoke about the forestry work done in Scotland.  In the Orkney Islands they began with bent grass and then used gorse and furze.  Eventually they went on to some kind of forestry, not good forestry, but they got a rough growth anyway.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous for people to be talking as if nothing had been done before and during the war, as if people had not been in earnest about reafforestation. The big difficulty is to get land. We wish the Minister well in his efforts to get land and we shall put no obstacles in his way.  But you have not to be a great prophet to be able to tell him that he is not going to get land easily.  As long as people value land and there is an agitaion for it and for more homes, the Minister will not get land easily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be prepared to accept the view, because I think it must be accepted, that the emergency period threw the reafforestation programme in this country back a long number of years.  Anybody who has <Col N="1745" /> had any knowledge of what went on in the country during that period knows very well that there was wholesale spoliation of the best timber.  Timber which could have been put to good commercial use in many cases was consigned to the firewood market.</P>
      <P>As has been mentioned, it was perhaps unavoidable because of the need for domestic fuel and the utter impossibility of maintaining adequate supervision wherever timber was being felled.  The result was that in many cases trees in forests were felled far in excess of the permitted number and the best commercial timber was used for firewood.  The standing timber of the country was diminished to an extent which it is almost impossible to calculate.  We can, however, accept it that the development of the emergency did throw us back in the matter of reafforestation. In my view, that situation places upon the Minister a very grave responsibility.  Each year it seems to be the custom in this House to talk piously of reafforestation.  It has been stated with truth that practically the only publicity that reafforestation gets is the discussion which takes place yearly on this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that many Deputies, in their approach to the question of reafforestation, fail to see the human beings for the trees.  The full effect of any long-term policy of reafforestation cannot be seen for 50 or 100 or 150 years. What great good is it going to do this nation to have tremendous wealth in the form of trees in 100 or 150 years if, meanwhile, these trees have to be planted and grown under miserable working conditions?  We have to think first of all of the people who are now living and the unfortunate men who are condemned to work for the Forestry Department.  People with little knowledge of the matter talk about the tremendous potentialities which reafforestation has in the way of giving employment.  Sometimes I think it would do them a great amount of good if they visited some of these State forests in periods of inclement weather and saw what some of their fellow-Irishmen, who are paid low wages, are suffering under the present conditions <Col N="1746" /> on some of the mountain-sides in the most remote districts.</P>
    <P>As an ideal, as something to be desired and aimed at, something which turies, everybody will agree that reafforestation is essential.  I do not think we are approaching the matter in the right way.  I do not think it has ever been approached in the right way. It strikes me that the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands has always been the forgotten child of that Department.  That, again, is, to a great extent, unavoidable because the responsibilities which are thrust upon any Minister for Lands of administering the Lands section of his Department&mdash;and these responsibilities are very well evidenced by the Order Paper as we see it from day to day&mdash;must afford any Minister for Lands at any time very little opportunity of dealing with the question of forestry as it should be dealt with. That applied, I am sure, to Deputy Moylan when he was Minister and it must have applied to his predecessor.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that if reafforestation is ever going to be tackled fully and adequately some reorganisation will have to take place.  No matter how well-intentioned the Minister may be, I think it is a physical impossibility for him to give the attention that is necessary to this question of reafforestation and, at the same time, deal with every local dispute relating to land division and congestion that arises from day to day in this country&mdash;and, God knows, they number in their thousands.</P>
    <P>I want, specially, as I have done last year and the year before, to direct the attention of the Minister to one aspect of this question with which I am vitally concerned, namely, the question of the wages and working conditions of forestry labourers.  In the course of his speech on this Estimate Deputy Moylan endeavoured to justify the policy which he followed, and which was followed for a long number of years, in relation to forestry workers' wages, by arguing that because it was not considered that a forestry labourer required to have a greater degree of skill than an agricultural worker it was not, therefore, considered that the <Col N="1747" /> wages of the forestry labourer should exceed those of an agricultural worker but that, in view of the remoteness of the locale of his work, a case could be made for a differential.  Surely that is an entirely false approach to this question?  In the first place, we have to decide whether we are going to pay men working for this State upon what we describe here annually as a vital national project&mdash;the bringing into being of forests in this country&mdash;a living wage or not.  That is the question we have to face.</P>
    <P>Farmers in other parts of the country&mdash;those of them with whom we can discuss the question of wages in reason, and they are not too many&mdash;will always say that the agricultural labourer is badly paid.  They will say: &ldquo;We are ashamed that we must pay them so very little.&rdquo;  How many times have we heard Deputy Corry say that? &ldquo;The only reason why we do not pay them is because we cannot pay them&rdquo;&mdash;that is their <i>credo</i> as far as wages are concerned.  We know that they were singing that tune two years ago. Despite a very big increase in their income, they are still singing the same tune.  They make the case that the reason why they do not pay a higher wage than an average of £3 odd per week is because they cannot afford to do it.  They admit that it is not a living wage.  How then, in conscience, can a State Department expect workers to accept that they should receive only a couple of shillings a week more than the agricultural worker?</P>
    <P>The wages of agricultural workers are fixed by a wages board which is dominated by farmers&mdash;many of them large farmers.  The wages are so fixed that it would be no hardship on the smallest farmer living on the most uneconomic holding to pay the wage. That is the method they have of paying the wages of the agricultural worker. It is suggested that the employees of a State Department should be paid on the same basis.  I think that is a policy of poor expediency.  It is a policy dictated only by the idea that no matter what else is done money must be saved and, in my view, unfair advantage is being taken of these men. <Col N="1748" /> They are relatively small in number. Until recently they have not been in any way organised.  Because they have found very few friends to express in any kind of forcible terms at all their grievances and because of their lack of any kind of economic power to enforce their demands, advantage is being taken of them.  More than that, it seems to me that it would be absolutely impossible&mdash;no matter how hard a Deputy might try&mdash;to get a more reactionary view on any question relating to workers as that which a Deputy will get if he once comes into contact with the officials of the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands.</P>
    <P>I have a strong feeling and belief that the Minister for Lands has the best of intentions.  I do not want to quote any clichés about good intentions. In passing, I should like to say that I had occasion, as a Deputy, to inquire, within the past few months, for a copy of the regulations governing the wage and working conditions of labourers employed by the Forestry Section.  I was told I could not be given it.  I was almost told in the House that they were almost an official secret&mdash;simply because, I believe, the officials of the Forestry Section chose not to give these regulations to any Deputy.  Surely that is a denial of a fundamental right to the Deputies of this House?  More recently still I was told by one official of the Department of Lands that I could only visit State forests within my own constituency with the permission of the officials of the Department and only if they permitted it.  I wonder if that reflects the views of the Minister or is that, in fact, in accord with the rights and privileges of Deputies of this House?</P>
    <P>In my view, while I do not want to be so foolish as to suggest that the reason for the refusal of these regulations was because they were of such an awful nature that the officials did not want to reveal them, that refusal reflects the obstructionist attitude, the die-hard, dyed-in-the-wool attitude that has developed in the Forestry Section, in the matter of workers over a long number of years.  Sympathy or understanding or thought for the men <Col N="1749" /> out on the mountainside you will not get inside the Forestry Section.  I often think it would do a great deal of good if some of the higher officials were brought out and put through the same course as these men have to go through, where they would get 62/- a week, in all weathers.</P>
    <P>Last year I raised a question&mdash;it was looked upon as a minor one&mdash;of men who were working under very bad conditions on a mountainside.  I suggested that, as well as amelioration of their conditions, rather than have them wading up to their knees in water they might be given rubber boots.  There was something done about that.  For one gang of 18 men concerned, two pairs of rubber boots were sent out.  I suppose the idea was that they should share them.  I do not know how they were going to do it, but that was the implication.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Minister means very well.  However, this question of wages and working conditions must be taken away from the position where it now lies.  It seems to lie almost entirely in the hands of a group of officials who care very little and apparently know very little of what these men have to suffer.  These workmen make the Forestry Department what it is.  All the planting and talk about reafforestation and national wealth and all the suggestions which may be made, are as nothing if we do not get the desire among the ordinary people to work hard to restore forests and to plant forests.  All this talk that we do here does not matter one single iota, if we do not convince the people who have to do the hard slogging and go through the hardship, that this is beneficial to them, not in 150 years' time but now.  Unless we do that, we cannot achieve that end and we are just wasting our time talking about reafforestation.</P>
    <P>I had occasion in Galway recently to talk to a man who was on his way on the hard road of the emigrant.  He was hoping that he might get a bit of a job in England up on a building and take the road that Irish navvies have taken from time immemorial here.  I asked him: &ldquo;Why do you have to go across to England?  Is there no employment <Col N="1750" /> here in your own country?&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;The only thing you get here is the forestry work and sure nobody would work on that, because there is not a living in it for a man at all.&rdquo; That was in North Galway.  It is true, and it is time that something was done about it.  I am convinced that the Forestry Section of the Department of Lands, as far as the higher officials and the general staff are concerned&mdash;I do not say this in a spirit of bitterness &mdash;seem to be dominated by one idea, to economise every conceivable moment at the expense of the workers and to keep the few shillings they get each week as low as possible.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, a recent decision announced by the Minister, that forestry workers' wages would be increased in each county to the level of the rates paid to county council workers.  That was all right, apparently where it meant an increase of 3/8 per week.  The men were given that 3/8&mdash;3/8 in this day and age, the cost of a couple of packets of cigarettes, which, of course, they could not afford to buy.  But what happened in County Dublin?  I might mention that in my constituency there are roughly only 14 men working, or 17 in the entire portion of County Dublin under forestry.  They had been receiving a rate of about £3 4s or £3 5s. a week.  In County Dublin, had they been given the local authority rate, their wages would have been increased to £4.  That was too good, it would have been too high for them, so it was decided that the forestry workers in Dublin would be given wages at the County Wicklow rate, which was lower and which gave them the princely sum of an extra 3/- or 4/-.  We are just wasting the time of the House in talking about reafforestation while these circumstances are obtaining.</P>
    <P>Regarding the location of these forests, there are plantations, as every one knows, in the heart of groups of mountains, high up on the mountain sides.  Inevitably they must be a long way removed from the workers' homes. The workers are expected to be on the spot at 8 o'clock in the morning just as if it were as simple as getting on a bus at Cabra and arriving at Nelson Pillar.  Many of them have to travel <Col N="1751" /> very long distances and in some cases I know of they must be out of their beds at 6 a.m., because of the long distances they have to travel.  On the Friday of each week, they finish at 6 o'clock and get home about 7.30. They have been out since 6 o'clock in the morning, and they spend seven hours from the time they get their lunch&mdash;and a meagre lunch it is on the mountain side, where the mountain air has whetted their appetite&mdash;until teatime. Recently, when the Department were asked to make some kind of change, in order that a man would not be such a long time without food, we were told that &ldquo;the Department after careful consideration, is satisfied that the working hours are the most suitable that can be devised and it is not proposed to alter them.&rdquo;  It is difficult to talk on this subject and to read a communication such as that, which reflects the attitude it does&mdash;to read it and be content with it, having in mind that possibly the person who conceived and composed the letter has no knowledge of what it means to undergo the hardships that these men have to undergo.</P>
    <P>The question of protective clothing was raised last year and the year before by myself and a number of other Deputies from various parts of the House.  Little has been done about it. In connection with shelters, tarpaulins were provided for the workers as a sort of makeshift shelter.  If you ask the men concerned are they satisfied with them, or if there is any effectiveness in these shelters, you will find that they are next door to useless for the purpose for which they were issued.  If the Minister could direct his officials in the Forestry Department to make some kind of shelter available which would be waterproof and which would, at the same time, permit the workers to have some kind of fire whereby they could boil water for their meals&mdash;some kind of light asbestos shelter which would be portable&mdash;it would be much better than the present arrangement.  That is the view of the workers in the forests throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Last year the forestry workers had <Col N="1752" /> an average wage of £2 18s. 4d., and during his reply to the debate at that time the Minister said that the forestry workers had a middling wage.  At the present time the lowest wage they have, as a result of the recent magnificent gesture made by the Department, is 62/- and the highest is 69/6.  Forestry workers must, of course, be rural workers, and one thing rural workers everywhere are noted for is their very Christian belief in the idea of having large families.  I think that is very true in this country.  Here we find that the forestry workers, with few exceptions, are married men and, relatively, they have large families.  They are asked to live on 62/- a week.</P>
    <P>I wonder is there any appreciation or realisation of what the cost of living for these men is like?  Nobody can put forward the myth&mdash;and it is no more than a myth&mdash;that forestry workers can go to their employers and get a couple of gallons of milk a day or a couple of stones of potatoes and all the other perquisites that some Deputies tell us farmers are wont to bestow upon those employed by them.  I do not say that there are not farmers who do that, but I do not think they do it to the extent mentioned.  Undoubtedly, there are farmers who give perquisites with wages.  These perquisites, where they are given, represent a substantial increase to the wages paid, but they are not given on anything like as wide a scale as some Deputies suggest.</P>
    <P>The forestry worker has not the slightest chance of getting any perquisites like these.  He gets a bare 62/- to spend upon his family and himself. He wends his way down, after a week of hard work and exposure upon the mountainside, and I am sure when he picks up the paper to-morrow, if he gets it, and reads of the grandiloquent schemes suggested by one side or the other indicating the great benefit that can be got for this country, he will say to himself that he has very little faith in public representatives, at any rate. All these discussions, if they are not based upon hard facts, upon the mechanics of reafforestation, are entirely unrealistic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moylan, in the course of what I thought was a pretty constructive speech on forestry, the type of <Col N="1753" /> speech for which he is noted&mdash;for a man who is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party he is one who is singularly free from venom and malice&mdash;made some points which are worthy of consideration. One is the suggested use of the cinema.  In this country of late years the cinema has become very popular.  Possibly, our people spend as much time in the cinema as any other people on the face of the earth. In the cinema they have been presented with documentaries representing the progress that is being made in other countries in one sphere or another.</P>
    <P>The American way of life is being thrown before our eyes every week, and British industry is shown on the screen, but never do our people get any opportunity of seeing what is being done in this country.  Perhaps it is just as well.  If we do make a film I think it would be as well if the camera would be directed away from the workers, because I am sure the workers would be inclined to demonstrate on such an occasion.  They would show their disgust and dissatisfaction of the position that we now find here. <Col N="1754" /> This question of using the cinema to educate the public in relation to forestry is one that merits consideration, and it might be applied with good results to many other aspects of our national life.  It is true, indeed, that there is sufficient trash of one kind or another being thrust on the youth of the country in the nature of imported films.  It should be possible&mdash;and God knows there is sufficient help in the Department to do it&mdash;to get something different by way of a documentary that will be helpful to our people in taking a long view of forestry.</P>
    <P>According to the tables with which we have been supplied in connection with the financial statement for 1950, I note that there is an increase under the heading of planting programme and increases in wages to the extent of £23,878.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported, the Committee to sit again.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Thursday, 4th May.</P>

      <P>Prices ranged from about 10/- to £8 an acre during the period in question.  The answer to the latter part of the question is &ldquo;No&rdquo;. The suitability of any land for forestry purposes depends on many factors other than area.</P>
