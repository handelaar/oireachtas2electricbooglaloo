      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will state (a) whether any plans for the conversion of the Store Street premises for use by his Department have been made, and, if so, by whom; (b) whether his Department have been consulted in the preparation of such plans, and, if so, by whom; (c) whether the architects employed or to be employed on the conversion plans have been chosen, and, if so, their names and by whom they were chosen; (d) whether any liability for the payment of such architects has been incurred or is likely to be incurred by any Government Department, and, if so, the liability accruing to date and anticipated prior to handing over the premises to his Department; (e) the number of staff which it is anticipated the converted building will accommodate, and whether this equals or exceeds the total staff of his Department; (f) whether he has considered the desirability of acquiring only the office portion of the premises and not the omnibus garage, and (g) his reasons for deciding to acquire the whole building.</P>

      <P>As I informed the Deputy on the 15th of last month, the premises mentioned are still the property of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
      <P>The particulars required by the Deputy, so far as available, are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Plans for the conversion of that part of the premises which will require alteration have not yet been made but, <Col N="1260" /> with the company's approval, there have been discussions of the necessary changes between the secretary of my Department and the architect and other consultants of the company.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Deputy's query under this head is covered by my answer to query (a).</P>
    <P>(c)  The services of the architect engaged by the company&mdash;Mr. Michael Scott&mdash;and of the other consultants already engaged are being retained.</P>
    <P>(d)  The cost of consultations with the architect and other consultants to date is negligible and the ultimate cost to be borne by the Department cannot be determined unless and until the premises are transferred to it.</P>
    <P>(e)  It is roughly estimated that the premises will accommodate staff totalling 1,100, and this figure falls short of the total number of staff of my Department located in the City of Dublin, assuming, for the purpose of this reckoning, the addition of the Dublin headquarters staff of the National Health Insurance Society, which it is proposed to merge in the Department before the introduction of the new insurance scheme.</P>
    <P>(f) and (g) I have considered the desirability of acquiring only the office portion of the premises but have found it necessary to acquire also the basement for essential storage purposes and the ground floor for use as public offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the long delay which has occurred since the decision of the Government to acquire these premises was announced, will the Minister say if any difficulty has been experienced in the preparation of plans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am aware of no difficulty that has arisen.  Consultations are taking place and every effort is being made to convert the premises for use as public offices.  Instructions have been issued that that work is to be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state how it is that the decision announced 12 months ago has not yet resulted in <Col N="1261" /> the preparation of plans even for the conversion of these premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No decision to acquire these premises was announced 12 months ago.  From the time at which it was decided that the Government would take steps to purchase the building-Córas Iompair Éireann having decided to abandon it-every possible effort has been made by the Department to push ahead with the plans for the conversion of the building.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an easy job, but it is being handled with the utmost expedition.  It is not a matter on which an architect can be sort of bullied into doing things.  He has to be allowed to do things in a competent way, and I prefer to leave the matter in his hands to do it competently.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Workmen's Compensation and National Health Insurance.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDunne" hpid="Mr. Dunne Mr. Dunne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the long delays being experienced by workers in having cases relating to workmen's compensation and national health insurance dealt with, and whether he will take steps to ensure that a more effective and speedy system of dealing with such cases is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Health Insurance Acts provide that where compensation in respect of an accident disability is paid or payable no sickness or disablement benefit can be paid in respect of that disability if the weekly amount of any compensation or the weekly value of any lump sum equals or exceeds the amount of benefit otherwise payable; if the weekly amount or the weekly value of the lump sum is less than the benefit in question the difference is payable as benefit.  Further, the National Health Insurance Society is authorised to withhold benefit in any case where a member appears to be entitled to compensation and unreasonably refuses or neglects to take proceedings to enforce his claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those provisions which are primarily intended to safeguard national health <Col N="1262" /> insurance funds throw a serious responsibility on the society as the body concerned with the payment of benefit, but I am not aware that there is undue delay on its part in discharging its duty in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that some delay in the payment of benefit is inevitable where adequate particulars of the compensation aspect of the case are not available at the time benefit is claimed and the society finds it necessary to institute inquiries.</P>
    <P>I would add that the society is empowered to pay benefit by way of advance pending settlement of a claim for compensation, and I understand that, being fully alive to the possibility of hardship arising out of the absence of payment from some source, it freely avails of this power in this respect.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy will furnish me with particulars of any case in which it is alleged there has been undue delay, I will have the matter fully investigated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he proposes to hold an examination for established posts as employment clerks confined to persons who have served as temporary clerks at employment exchanges; and, if so, whether extra marks would be awarded to those who served in the Defence Forces during the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware of the inferior quality of turf, generally wet or consisting of turf mould, which is being distributed to old age pensioners, widows, and unemployed persons at 6d. or 1/- per cwt., and free to persons on home assistance, and whether he will take steps to have good quality turf distributed in future to these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers to the fuel being supplied under the cheap fuel scheme in Dublin.  I have gone into <Col N="1263" /> this matter personally and I find that the heavy rainfall during February affected some of the fuel.  Although special arrangements were made to handpick the turf for distribution, it has been found that some of the clamps had become damp and the turf unsuitable. I am arranging, therefore, that machine-won turf will be supplied.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Éamon Ó Cíosáin Éamon Ó Cíosáin">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cíosáin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare whether he is aware that workers in Kerry are being pressed to go to work in the bogs of Kildare and, in the event of their not going, are deprived of their right to unemployment assistance; and, if so, whether steps will be taken to provide those workers with employment on schemes of bog development at home in Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Workers are not being pressed to go to work in the bogs of Kildare.  Unemployment assistance recipients refusing this type of work are, if it is considered suitable for them, refused further, payment of unemployment assistance, as would any other worker refusing an offer of suitable employment.  The Deputy is, of course, aware that a condition to be satisfied for the payment of unemployment assistance is that the applicant be genuinely seeking but unable to obtain suitable employment.  A worker aggrieved by refusal has a right of appeal to a Court of Referees.</P>
      <P>The provision of employment on bog development schemes does not come within the functions of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there are cases in Kerry in which people are being compelled to go to Kildare to work in bogs, and when they find themselves unable to do this, they are deprived of their unemployment assistance?  Is he aware that there are even single men who have family ties and responsibilities which they cannot shed without creating hardship?  Is he aware that there are bogs in Kerry to be developed and that it would be much more sensible and equitable to provide work for the unemployed in these bogs than to send <Col N="1264" /> them 150 or 200 miles away?  Is he aware that at present Bord na Móna are removing machinery from bogs near Listowel and Cahireiveen?  Will the unemployed people of Kerry be compelled to follow the machinery and, if they are unable to take up work in bogs outside Kerry, will they be deprived of unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy that it is not the function of my Department to deal with the development of bog schemes.  Any question which the Deputy desires to ask in that respect must be addressed to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is concerned with the development of bog schemes.  With regard to the other point raised by the Deputy, let me say definitely that no body in Kerry can be compelled to work in Kildare or anywhere else if he does not want to work there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Deputy an answer to his previous question. He can ask further supplementaries if he wishes.  I say to the Deputy that nobody in Kerry can be compelled to work in Kildare or anywhere else if he does not want to work there.  It is a condition of the receipt of unemployment assistance benefit that a person must be available for work and genuinely seeking work. If, therefore, an offer of work is made to an unemployed man in Kerry, he has to satisfy that condition.  If he refuses to take the work that is available for him, he is then refused unemployment assistance benefit if it is considered that the work is suitable for him and that his domestic circumstances do not prevent him from taking up that employment.  But if benefit is refused in these circumstances, that person has a right to appeal to a Court of Referees, and if that Court of Referees, after hearing the case, are satisfied that it is not reasonable to expect a person living in Kerry to take up employment in Kildare or elsewhere, the Court have full power to restore the unemployment assistance benefit in his case.  I do not come into <Col N="1265" /> the matter at all.  The Court of Referees have full power to decide whether or not benefit will be paid.  If the Deputy has in mind any person who he thinks has been unfairly treated by being offered employment in Kildare or elsewhere, there is a simple remedy&mdash;to go to the Court of Referees, which consists of representatives of employers and workers with an independent and neutral chairman not responsible to me in any way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that he has not answered my question, good or bad?  I asked the Minister whether the people of Listowel and elsewhere, especially the people of Listowel who are already cutting turf on turf banks which they have had for a <Col N="1267" /> number of years, will be left in possession of those turf banks if and when a scheme for the division of the bog will be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBlowick" hpid="Mr. Blowick Mr. Blowick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blowick</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy listened to the latter part of my reply he would see that I replied to the question.  I said: &ldquo;All applications for turf banks on the estate will be fully considered before the Land Commission complete their arrangements for the allotment of the bog.&rdquo;  I am well aware that a number of people have conacre lettings on this bog at present.  When the Land Commission take possession, they will go through all the applications for bog plots and I presume, in fact I am nearly sure, they will give plots to the most deserving cases.  Let me say for the Deputy's benefit that if people who already have conacre lettings on the bog have plenty of bog on their own lands, I would not hold out much hope for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned at the moment about the people who have plenty of bog on their own lands.  Is the Minister aware that my question has been put to him in connection with a certain number of poor people in Listowel who have been cutting turf on this bog for many years and who have no other place to go to for turf?  I simply want to know whether, in the event of this bog being divided by the Land Commission, the people who have been working these plots on the bog and who have spent money on the development of them will be allowed to continue to cut turf without being interfered with by the Land Commission?</P>

The matter of allotment is a reserved function for the commissioners and must be left to them.  If they are competent for their job, they will do it right.  If the Deputy is alleging something else, there is another way of dealing with that.</P>

Work is now being resumed on this scheme which has been in abeyance for some time past owing to pressure of more urgent work.  There are approximately 800 post offices to be <Col N="1270" /> dealt with in the country as a whole and the order of priority must be determined mainly on engineering considerations.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will give details of the basis on which bran is at present distributed by the milling industry, and if he will state whether he has received any further information since his reply to a question of the 15th February last which may give hope for an increase in the supply of bran in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In the present distribution period millers are allocating bran to their customers at the rate of approximately 15 per cent.  of each customer's datum which has been determined on the basis of purchases of bran and pollard effected in the year ended 31st August, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can give no hope of increased supplies of pollard in the near future. The whole offals supply position is difficult.  In normal times scarcity of home supplies could have been made good by imports.  I have, however, examined the import supply position and the prices quoted are practically prohibitive.  Since I referred to this matter on 15th February, when I indicated that the price of imported bran and pollard would involve a retail price of about 22s. per cwt., an offer of pollard has been received at a price of approximately £27 12s. 0d. per ton c.i.f. Dublin.  In all the circumstances I feel that for the present at any rate the best course of action is to utilise such pollard as we produce to facilitate <Col N="1272" /> the maximum production of balanced rations at competitive prices. Steps have been taken materially to increase the percentage of bran produced and to reserve it for retail distribution.</P>
    <P>The quantity of bran available in the present quota period is approximately 2,000 tons as compared with approximately 1,000 tons in the period ended 25th February, 1950, and an average of 1,400 tons for the three previous periods.</P>
    <P>The output of pollard in the present period provides for a total quantity of balanced rations which exceeds by almost 100 per cent. supplies available in 1949, and were it not for the scarcity of high protein supplements the increase would probably have been much more considerable.  One factory for the production of meat and bone meal is actually building and another is being planned, while at the same time every opportunity of securing supplies of white fish meal is being pursued and where possible availed of.</P>

      <P>The Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, is due to expire at the end of the present year and, in that connection, I am about to have the position in regard to rent control generally fully examined by a commission of inquiry whose function it will be to advise whether the present Act should be continued in operation and, if so, with what amendments.  The scope of the inquiry will necessarily embrace the question of extending rent control to houses that are not covered by the 1946 Act and, pending the investigation of the whole question, I do not propose to introduce legislation on the lines suggested in the question.</P>
      <P>As regards the renewal of leases under the Landlord and Tenant Acts, I assume that the Deputies are referring to the position of lease-holders under Part V of the Act of 1931.  I propose to have the position of these lease-holders examined by the commission which is about to be set up, but it is only right that I should say at this stage that it is likely that the commission will be required to give priority to the question of the Rent Restrictions Act, 1946, in view of the impending expiration of that Act.</P>

      <P>The Dublin County Council commenced negotiations with Mr. McCarthy for the purchase of land for housing purposes on the 21st April 1948. A proposal was received in the Department for the purchase of nine acres on the 24th November 1948 and sanction in principle issued on the 2nd December 1948.  A difficulty arose in connection with the site through the discovery of <Col N="1286" /> two superior interests with whom negotiations were entered into by the council.  The legal difficulties in connection with the site involved protracted negotiations and in the case of one of the interests the title documents were lost and the whereabouts unknown. This complicated the whole transaction.  Arrangements were finally made in November 1949 by the council's law agent for the purchase of a site and the terms of the purchase were approved on the 16th November, 1949. On the 16th December 1949, plans were received for the erection of 31 rural type houses on the site.  These were examined by the Department's staff and as a result a rather long letter, which I do not propose to quote, was issued to the council on the 5th January 1950. Arising from that the number was extended so as to bring it more into consonance with the demands of the locality and the operation of the sanitation scheme.</P>

Final plans for the scheme were approved on the 28th August, 1947.  The scheme has been undertaken in two sections, the first of which, comprising 126 houses, now completed, was carried out by contract. Tenders for this section were invited on the 20th June, 1947, and approval to the acceptance of a tender was given on 28th August, 1947.  Work on site development and foundations commenced in October, 1947, and on the superstructures in January, 1948.  The balance of the scheme, comprising 119 houses, is being carried out by direct labour.  The development work commenced in May, 1948, and the building work in March, 1949.</P>

More is involved in the proposals than &ldquo;the provision of a surgical ward&rdquo;.  It would be necessary to improve the theatre and ancillary accommodation and to provide a high-level surgical team if the quality of the work done was to be up to the necessary standard and in view of the fact that facilities and staff of the required standard had already been provided in the county hospitals at Mullingar, Roscommon and Tullamore, I did not feel that I would be justified in present circumstances in acceding to the request of the urban district council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for this Bill at all, and I am sure the Minister, having heard Deputy Corry and other Deputies from County Cork, realises that the simple course would have been to draw the attention of the farming community in other counties to the wonderful lead of Cork, where, apparently, the agricultural workers are living in a sort of paradise. Perhaps it might also be well for the Minister to draw the attention of other counties to the El Dorado of the West, as mentioned by Deputy Beegan.  He stated that the agricultural workers are <Col N="1294" /> not alone the best paid in this country, but in the whole world.  As a Corkman, naturally I would like to be able to agree with Deputy Corry, Deputy P.D. Lehane and also Deputy Moylan, who represents one of the Cork constituencies. Unfortunately, I can say from my experience that the grand picture painted by them is nothing but a picture painted by their own fertile imaginations.  It is true, as we will find by looking up the Official Debates, that a previous Minister for Agriculture did say that the agricultural community in Cork were in the first three at the winning post in reducing the wage between 1931 and 1935.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was refreshing to hear Deputy Corry telling us that the men were able to trot off to Mallow races and to Pigeon Hill races.  He forgot apparently that Ballinrea races are held once a year, on St. Patrick's Day, which is both a Church and a national holiday.  Great emphasis was laid on the fact that these men went away for the day, and even Deputy Smith was apparently worried lest the grand facilities given by some employers would be upset, that, if this Bill became law, some of these employers might say: &ldquo;We will not give the facilities we gave in the past; we will give barely the minimum required.&rdquo; Looking at the matter from the point of view of facts and not from the point of view of fancy or making political capital, I can truthfully say that this picture is not a true picture of conditions in North Cork, spoken of by Deputy Moylan; in East Cork, spoken of by Deputy Corry, or in South Cork, spoken of by Deputy P.D. Lehane. There may be some employers who give an odd day off, and I give them full credit for it, but in the whole of County Cork I know from records kept that there are only two cases of employers giving a week's holiday.  I am also aware that wages were reduced in respect of three hours spent by men who had to attend the funeral of a relative.  It is only fair that all sides should be looked at and it is not fair to say: &ldquo;Just set down what is being given in Cork and let the rest follow.&rdquo; It is a very good job for the rest of <Col N="1295" /> the country that the employers there are not following in the footsteps of some of the employers in Cork.</P>
    <P>I personally agree with this Bill, which I regard as a step forward. There may be certain points in it which I would consider shortcomings, but as under it these workers are to get a week's holiday, it is to be welcomed. We have been told about the harmonious relations which exist between employers and workers.  Deputy Corry took exception to a member of this House, Deputy Dunne, going around the country on Sundays after Mass.  It may be well to remind Deputy Corry and other Deputies that when, four or five years ago, the farm workers in Cork offered full co-operation with the farmers and when they asked the farmers' representatives to meet them at a round table conference to discuss their difficulties, their offer was completely ignored.  When Deputies talk about the harmonious relations which exist they seem to forget that the relationship which exists is the relationship between master and man. There have been, and still are, odd cases of an employer treating his worker differently, and for that we give them full credit, but when we are dealing with a large number of workers, roughly 85,000 permanent and 51,000 casual, it is no use for a Deputy to talk of upsetting the harmonious relations which exist between these workers and their employers by making this proposal part of the law for the protection of the worker.  It has been done in the cities in the past and has not interfered with the relations existing there.  I believe this Bill will have no ill effects on these relations, because it means that the worker will be placed in a more secure position than he is in at present and will not have to depend on the goodwill and charity of his employer.  Because it does that, we support the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some members were in favour of staggered holidays, but we cannot look with favour on any such suggestion because we know it can lead to abuse and we know also that the worker is not in a position to ask his employer, as man to man, for certain days suitable <Col N="1296" /> to himself.  There may be odd cases, but we cannot legislate on the basis of these odd cases when dealing with 85,000 permanent and 51,000 casual workers.  We must base our whole approach to the Bill on the fact that we are dealing with a large mass of workers and a large number of employers and it is only fair that all should be on a level footing.</P>
    <P>One point raised by the Minister was the increase in the agricultural income from £78,622,000 in 1947 to roughly £100,000,000 in 1949.  Great credit is due to the Minister for helping to bring about that increase.  Certain members may have objected to the suggestions put forward by the Minister from time to time in connection with the possibility of improved production, but if we take into consideration the figures, we must admit that the Minister was right.  The Minister also drew attention to the fact that, in that period, there was an increase of 20 per cent. in the agricultural worker's wage from £2 10s. 0d. to £3 0s. 0d., and when we take into consideration the fact that one week's wages in the year will mean about 1/2½d. a week to the employer, it is surely not too much to say: &ldquo;Pass this Bill, and the sooner the better.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Many Deputies were rather noncommittal. They said they would vote for it, but it struck me in listening to the debate and reading over the debates which took place in the past that the same line was adopted when the Agricultural Wages Bill was introduced. They were all mad to give the wage, but they had not got it to give.  When that Bill was introduced, some Deputies said there would be a terrible increase in unemployment. The reverse has proved the case.  This time, again, you have Deputies saying something like that.  Deputy Corry gave a figure of 21,000 agricultural workers who were leaping over the fences.  If we say we will leave conditions as they are, in case there may be an increase in unemployment, it means we are failing in our responsibility. Whether the number employed is large or small, it is our duty here as Deputies to see that their conditions are something approaching the standard of Christian conditions.  In the <Col N="1297" /> debate on the Agricultural Wages Bill, the present Minister used a good phrase when he said we should not have those workers living as coolies.</P>
    <P>I heartily agree with Deputy McQuillan when he spoke of conditions in the west.  I do not know the west a lot, but I know he spoke the truth. These things are true and it is here they should be brought up.  Deputy Cowan, while Deputy Allen was speaking, asked more or less in the form of a question, if it were so that some agricultural workers were living over barns.  In turn, Deputy Allen did not deny that these men were sleeping in such places, but his own words were, as reported in the Dáil Debates last week, that they were living in comfortable conditions.  Apparently, it has come to the time of believing ourselves, and trying to make other people believe, that sleeping over a barn is in itself sleeping under comfortable conditions.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies were worried about the dangers of regimentation.  Believing in democracy, no one can agree with regimentation in the full sense of the word, but if you take into consideration that regimentation was introduced of necessity in the Agricultural Wages Bill, surely no Fianna Fáil Deputy can say it was unnecessary then, and if that is so, why say it is not necessary now?  I want to agree with Deputy Larkin on the question that arose naturally about the possibility of a weekly half-day.  Unfortunately&mdash;I have this again on the basis of the records&mdash;there are employers who can give it and have stated to us that they could give it, but, simply because their neighbours are not giving it, they are not doing so.  That applies to employers holding various political views.  In such a case, where they can give it&mdash;and we have instances where they are giving it, and we give them full credit&mdash;I fail to see why the agricultural worker is not entitled to a half-day the same as any other worker. Various methods might be adopted by various Deputies in objecting to it.  In any democratic institution there are bound to be objections to any given course, and any Deputy may adopt any line which he thinks may suit his policy.  I am basing my argument on <Col N="1298" /> the fact that it has been proved successful and is being given by one or two individuals whom I know.  The rest are simply watching what their neighbours are going to do.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I think it is essential to mention again our view in connection with staggered holidays.  We are definitely of opinion that six days, where a man is working for the full 12 months, should be given and that the man of necessity should take the holiday to which he is entitled.  It should not be left open to the possibility of abuse, whereby a man may not get the week's holiday and may not even get the money, unfortunately, because in some areas he may have to act in a hush-hush manner even as regards wages.  In this Bill the worker should be safeguarded by making sure that he gets the holidays and gets them in full consecutive order.  When that has been done we may reach the possibility at a later stage of considering fully having included as well a few hours off as a half-day for the agricultural worker.</P>

      <P>We can all congratulate the Minister on the figures he produced when introducing the Second Reading of this Bill and particularly on the rise in agricultural production. In this matter we are dealing with one particular industry which has a peculiar characteristic that differentiates it from every other industry&mdash; it is almost entirely a one-man business so far as the employer is concerned. While noting the rise in agricultural production and the increase in agricultural income, for the efficient running of that industry, in order that additional burdens can be imposed on the employer&mdash;and I do not use the word &ldquo;burden&rdquo; in the sense of objecting to anything in this Bill&mdash;and approaching it from the practical point of view, we have to consider the particular overheads of that one-man business. One of the overheads which is very often&mdash;in fact, entirely&mdash;lost sight of is the credit available to the farmer at different times during the year, or perhaps during the whole year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, it being a one-man business, it is different from others and the way <Col N="1299" /> others are run in this respect, that the assets on which the farmer can fall back usually are his farm, his stock, his own skill and the hard work of himself and his employees.  I have given the matter very serious consideration and this is not the first time I have mentioned this problem.  I believe it goes to the whole root of our industry and of our economic future. Several times a year and in different places from honest, hard-working men I have heard the remark: &ldquo;I am keeping the farm going, but I am not working for myself and I have not done so since my father died, and he was not working for himself either&rdquo;.  The position in this country in connection with this large one-man industry is that the control of credit and the price at which credit is available to the farmer is outside the farmer's sphere of influence. At the moment the rate which the farmer has to pay, if he even gets as far as getting the loan, is 5 per cent.  I consider that is much too high, when all the industry can economically pay is a rate of 3 per cent.</P>

      <P>That seems to be the kernel of the argument.  I now want to deal with a very particular point.  To hear Deputy Desmond speaking about the members of Fianna Fáil, one would imagine that Fianna Fáil were anxious that agricultural workers should not get holidays; that Fianna Fáil were bad employers who would not consider giving a holiday to anybody. In County Dublin there is and always has been a spirit of goodwill among a large number of workers and their employers.  I hope that will continue. There is a number of decent, charitable employers in that county who looked after their employees well and who never objected to an employee taking a half-day to bury a friend or to go to a football match.  I hope that will continue.</P>

      <P>Before the workers' organisation was known the Agricultural Wages Board gave the agricultural worker of County Dublin and Ireland some status.  The workers' organisation has only improved on that slightly.  They have given the workers of County Dublin nothing more than the Agricultural Wages Board gave them.  I want to warn the House that the day is not very far distant when, as a result of the Minister's policy in regard to the farmers of County Dublin, agricultural workers will not be needed.  That is the position now.  People who grew barley, oats, tomatoes and other agricultural produce in County Dublin will not be able to employ labour as a result of the Minister's attitude.  He knows that.  I did not hear a word from the Labour members, the archangels of the workers, as to the number of agricultural workers who have been sacked in County Dublin and every other county as a result of the policy adopted by the Minister.</P>

      <P>Pardon me.  I bow to your ruling.  As I have stated, I welcome the Bill.  We in Fianna Fáil have <Col N="1302" /> always been progressive.  We have not tried to retard progress.

      <P>This Bill has been introduced in an honest manner by the Minister.  He has said that it is a simple Bill, to give a week's holiday to agricultural workers.  He has pointed out that it will have to fall on the backs of the farmers.  He has pointed out reasons why the farming community should be able to bear this Bill.  I welcome the Bill as being a step on the road towards placing the agricultural workers, to whom so much praise is given by all sides of the House, in a somewhat similar position to their colleagues of the industrial field.</P>
      <P>Deputy P.J. Burke appears to have indulged in wishful thinking when he said that this Bill will cause farmers to let workers go.  There seems no reason at all why the fact that a farmer should give his agricultural worker one week's holiday in the year should influence the labour content of his farm so much as to necessitate a man being let go.  I suggest again that the Deputy has been indulging in wishful thinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have pleaded for the system of give and take which, they claim, existed in the past between the farmer and his worker.  As a trade union worker I have experience of give and take methods being operated in the industrial world and, in many cases at any rate, the employer's idea of give and take was to take the very best a man had to give and to give as little as he could in return.  It is time that the <Col N="1303" /> State should step in and fix the minimum in wages and holidays.  This Bill deals with holidays and fixes a minimum holiday period to which the worker will be entitled if this Bill becomes an Act.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should accept an amendment which will make it compulsory upon the farmer to give holidays, whether the worker agrees or not.  That is not to save the workers from themselves but rather to save a worker from being intimidated into agreeing to accept wages, or promises of wages more likely, instead of holidays.  It would be very easy for a farmer to suggest to his man, and very difficult for his man to refuse, that the man should accept holiday pay instead of holidays. Unless that man is well organised, he will not have the courage to go back to his employer and to demand that pay for the holidays which he should have got.  I suggest to the Minister that the method adopted in this Bill should be similar to the method adopted in the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936 for industrial workers, that it will be an offence for the employer not to give holidays, whether the man agrees to accept pay instead or not.</P>
      <P>I regret very much that the Minister when he was taking this bold step and bringing in legislation to cover farm workers did not see his way to introduce a compulsory half-holiday for farm workers, as I believe he agrees should be done.  Surely these people give as much service as any other people in the State.  They are practically the only big body of workers who are not enjoying a half-holiday.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should consider accepting on the Committee Stage an amendment from the Labour Party and incorporating in the Bill a section that would give compulsorily to farm workers, as well as six annual holidays and other recognised holidays, a 50-hour week.  I welcome the Bill because I feel that it is a positive start to bring the status of farm workers somewhat nearer that of their colleagues in the industrial field</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the House <Col N="1304" /> has decided unanimously to pass this Bill.  I do not present it to the House as being an epoch-making or revolutionary departure; it is merely one of many steps that we hope to take to improve things generally in our own country.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke amuses me when he has the fortitude to remind the House that Fianna Fáil introduced the Agricultural Wages Board.  The dramatic result of that achievement was to fix the minimum wage for agricultural workers in Ireland at the quite astonishing figure of 21/- per week.  I do not know that that is an achievement that I would look back upon with glowing pride if I were Deputy Burke. It was, in my opinion, about the lowest nadir of degradation to which the agricultural industry of this country ever sank, and I do not believe that in any conceivable circumstances, short of the catastrophe of a return of Fianna Fáil, could so degrading a nadir ever be reached again by our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to dissipate the other fraudulent representation which Fianna Fáil, and Deputy Burke in particular, have sought to pass off in this House and that is that over the last two years there has developed a tendency for the number of agricultural workers on the land of Ireland to decline.  Deputy Burke deplored that he had only had made available to him for comparison the statistics of 1947.  I am going to give him now statistics for the whole hideous 15 years.  I need not further describe the period to which I refer&mdash; just the hideous 15 years.  In 1931 the census returns reveal that there were 562,573 men employed on the land of this country.  Now I shall read down the figures for the next 18 years.  I begin with 562,000; 559,000; 550,000; 579,000; 573,000; 560,000; 555,000; 537,000; and 530,000 in 1939, a decline of 32,000 in the first eight years of the hideous 15.  Then came the war and in 1940 there were 543,000; in 1941, 555,000; in 1942, 541,000; in 1943, 536,000; in 1944, 526,000; in 1945, 521,000; in 1946, 519,000; in 1947, 507,000 and the nightmare ended.  But is Deputy Burke illuminated now?  He has had his whole hideous history recapitulated and throughout the whole <Col N="1305" /> period of that Administration there was a steady, unwavering decline which resulted in reducing the number of persons who worked on the land from 562,000 to 507,000.  Yet with the brazen-faced dishonesty on which they lived for 15 years they storm around this country now to create the impression generally that during their period of office there was a rush of the people to the land with a hive of industry on every acre and that now vast tracts of desert silence mark the departure of these young Lochinvars that came out of the west.  Poverty, misery, destitution and ruin mark their passing and we have taken the initial steps to repair the devastation that they did. We have performed what is little short of a miracle in two years on the land of Ireland to repair their devastation, but we do not pretend that it is in our power to repair in two years the wreckage that 15 years of profligacy left behind them.  But we do not intend to stop until we bury their evil memory fathoms deep.</P>
    <P>I want to make this clear to the House: I consider it no cause to boast if we were to set up as our purpose to multiply the number of lowly paid agricultural workers on the land of this country.</P>
    <P>Pharaoh, when he set about building his pyramids in Egypt, provided abundant employment of slaves&mdash;200,000 to a pyramid.  A modern contractor could build the same with 1,000 men, adequately equipped.  Shall we glory in thrusting down upon our people the standard of living appropriate to Pharaoh's slaves, or is it our objective to equip our agricultural workers with equipment which will enable them to produce two and three times what those who went before them produced with the implied understanding that if a man can do to-morrow what it took three men to do yesterday, and if it costs £9 a week to keep three men, what honest employer will offer one man doing as much £3 to-morrow?</P>
    <P>My purpose, and I want the Dáil to know it, is to increase the productive capacity of each individual worker upon the land of this country by putting within his reach the best equipment that science can make available, so <Col N="1306" /> that in enabling him to do what it took three men to do in the past we may with a clear conscience expect the farmer who employs him to adjust the wages he receives in proportion to the increased quantity of wealth which, with proper equipment, he is now able to produce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen or Deputy Corry, or some such like, laid down this ponderous aphorism as an inescapable rule in economics for us, that if prices went down wages must follow.  Tripe!  Only somebody so ignorant that he would not know how to come in out of the rain could lay down such a proposition.  Did the Deputy who made that proposition ever envisage the possibility of increased production from effort intelligently used?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Reilly from Cavan was recently advocating a change in the price of milk on the grounds that the average yield of a cow was 260 gallons. It took just as much to feed that 260-gallon cow as it would have taken to feed a cow yielding 600 gallons.  The farmer receiving 1/2 a gallon for 250 gallons had about £14 for the produce of his cow and 10/- for his calf during the 15 hideous years.  If he were only getting 1/- now, and had 600 gallons from his cow, he would have £30 for his cow's milk, and from £5 to £10 for his calf.  Who would be the better off, the man who had the £14 10s. 0d. in the hideous years or the man who had from £35 to £40 on the way out of the desert whence we come?</P>
    <P>Let me give the House a few statistics on that, statistics relating not to 1947 but to all the hideous years.  In 1941, there were 463,000 acres of wheat sown in this country, and the mills received 1,770,000 barrels.  In 1949 there were 100,000 acres less under wheat&mdash; 362,000 acres&mdash;and the mills received 2,400,000 barrels.  Where was the most labour spent&mdash;on the 463,000 acres or on the 362,000 acres?</P>

      <P>I do not upbraid the Deputy with the record, the ludicrous record, in 1946 or 1947, because it is fair to say that in 1947 the weather was inclement and the season difficult, but I do not think that excuse is valid for 1941.  I did not dwell on the years 1942, 1943, 1944, 1945 and 1946 because the case might be made that fertilisers were not available.  But the fact is, of course, that wheat to-day is being grown where farmers think they ought to grow it and where the land is fit to grow it.  Under the Administration which preceded us it was grown where any ladeen who was sent around the country told the farmer he was to grow it.  A great deal was sown where it never should have been sown.  This is one interesting instance of where an intelligently-directed effort can produce a 25 per cent. larger return.  That is not all.  The figures for beet are not without interest.  This was Fianna Fáil's pet.</P>

      <P>Certain statistical facts have been imported into this debate <Col N="1309" /> and I think I do not exceed the limits of relevancy if I give the correct figures.  I want to deal with the several speeches made about everything.  I notice a tendency among some of my Labour friends on the left, in their eager solicitude to welcome a reform, very seriously to denigrate much of what has been done, which shows a certain sign of a clear conscience.  But the Government and the Deputies who support it are not backward in examination of their own conscience and in setting for themselves a high, stern level below which they feel the Administration they are supporting should not fall.  I think, however, that Deputies ought to be a little careful, in their zeal for reform, not to paint a picture that can be subsequently quoted against them.  I am sometimes a little shocked when I hear our supporters gladly sharing in the indignation expressed that this has not been done and that has not been done, without very carefully questioning themselves has it been done or has it not been done.  When I hear the agricultural workers of this country being described as a depressed class, I begin to ask myself do the Deputies who so speak recall that since we came into office the level of agricultural wages has gone up by 20 per cent.</P>

      <P>Let us then, in evaluating our own achievement, be resolute to do better with every year that passes, but let us not provide fuel for so unscrupulous an assembly as confronts us for more misrepresentation than they can themselves think up. They are pretty good hands at it without any help or inspiration from this side of the House.  Deputy Smith, I <Col N="1310" /> need hardly say, approved of the Bill, but apprehended that the general agricultural policy would reduce the number of agricultural workers on the land. I have exposed that fraud.  He is shocked by the necessity to import oats, tomatoes and potatoes.  So am I. But the fact that there is a scarcity of these crops this year is solely and entirely the result of the activities of poor little Deputy Blaney and poor big Deputy Davern who set out covertly to sabotage our efforts by a whispering campaign.  But Deputy Davern could not keep his big mouth shut.  He had to get up and bawl out in public what he had been instructed to do &ldquo;under the rose&rdquo;, and therefore we got on his track.  That is the reason we have not got these crops.  It is the cause of grave injury to our people that that campaign last year has had the result of so materially reducing the supplies of these crops now.</P>

      <P>You have, no doubt, an abundance of alibis, but we have not got the silos.  We will shortly have the silos and you will not then require the alibis.  Deputy Dunne led off the healthy symphony of self-criticism to which I have just referred, and one of his animadversions was that the Agricultural Wages Board was anti-worker. With great respect to Deputy Dunne, that is all nonsense.  The Agricultural Wages Board has on it representatives of the workers and of the employers. There are extremely conscientious neutral members.  They have tried at all times to do their best, bearing all considerations in mind.  I think it is right to warn Deputies that if, in an excess of passionate desire to redress <Col N="1311" /> every grievance overnight, this Government were forced to put its hand to everything at the same time, the only place this Government would end up would be in the ditch with everything on top of it.  Deputies had better make up their minds to this right here and now.  This Government will not end up in the ditch.  It has a radical programme which it intends to put through just as fast as the resources in men, money and goods will allow. There is no restriction on the speed with which that programme will be put through through lack of money.  I hope there will be none arising from non-availability of hands and men to do the work, though I fear there may be.</P>

It might be well for our colleagues, instead of expressing apprehensions on that score, to reaffirm boldly, courageously and with certainty the fact, which our predecessors in office are anxious to conceal, suppress and distort, that there is no part of this Government's programme that will be held up for one moment for lack of money.</P>

      <P>The Agricultural Wages Board was described by Deputy Dunne as being anti-worker.  I put it to the House that what that board has done heretofore is to increase agricultural wages with prudent regard to the capacity of the industry to pay.  If you try to pile on to the agricultural industry a greater burden than that industry can at any given time carry you will end in the ditch.  The only way effectively to achieve a large programme of development and reform is to do it with due regard all the time to the resources at your disposal and by using those resources to the limit of your capacity.  I congratulate the Agricultural Wages Board on discharging their task faithfully and well, of constantly keeping under review the agricultural wage while facing the misrepresentation they put themselves in danger of when, having regard to the capacity of the industry to carry it, they fixed a minimum which bears a relation to that industry's capacity to pay.</P>

      <P>I mentioned that Deputies should bear in mind the difference between the wage paid and the statutory minimum.  I think another danger arises.  It is one thing for Oireachtas Éireann to fix statutory minima.  It is quite another thing for Oireachtas Éireann, or the Executive of the State, the Government, to arrogate to itself the duties of the trade union movement. In every free society the trade union movement has certain functions which it should be allowed to perform. One function is to fix by agreement with employers contracts of employment for its members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think you have to have an employers' organisation, necessarily.  My point is that the tendency to invite the Oireachtas and the Government of the day to undertake work which ordinarily should be the work of a trade union is an unhealthy tendency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the less the Government interfere in the field where trade unions should be the appropriate organ for effecting agreement the better it will be for any free society. Therefore, let us bear in mind when we speak of an agricultural wage or of six days' holidays or anything of the kind that these are the statutory minima.  They are not the limits beyond which no one may go.  They are this and no more, limits below which it is not legal for anyone hereafter to go&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy now knows that to which he gave his cordial and enthusiastic consent.  I would invite Deputies to think well before they too closely identify the probable wishes of agricultural workers with the probable or known wishes of industrial workers.  If a man is employed in a factory and gets his annual holidays it is perfectly obvious that, circumstances permitting, he will like to go with his wife and family to the country or the sea to get a change, and he will like to go at a time of the year when a seaside holiday or a country holiday is agreeable, when the days are long and the climate is mild. Do not let us assume, therefore, that a man whose work is in the hayfield wants to have his free time when working is a pleasure.  He may very reasonably want, having spent his year in the countryside, to bring the wife and children to Cork, Dublin, Waterford or to a neighbouring town in Christmas week to see the shops and the Christmas decorations.</P>

      <P>Why does the Deputy keep on saying that?  Three pounds is a minimum.  How many agricultural workers in this country, worthy of the name, accept £3?  Go out and ask them.  I know.  If I sought agricultural workers to-morrow for £3, I would work alone because my neighbours would pay them more and, if for no better reason than that of competing with my neighbour, I have to bid more for agricultural workers.  Do not let us go on saying that, despite all we have tried to do, everyone who works on the land to-day is obliged to take the minimum and that that is what they all earn.  Ours would be a poor achievement if we succeeded in doing nothing in the past two years but to increase the income of the farmers of this country from £70,000,000 to £100,000,000. We have created a situation in which 90 per cent. of the first-class agricultural workers in this country can laugh at an offer of the minimum wage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would urge that we reflect before pressing that there will be a statutory obligation to give not only six days' holidays but to give them in a given period.  Am I wrong in urging Deputies to refrain from compelling their neighbours to do what Deputies think their neighbours ought to do?  I do not want to tell any agricultural worker in this country what time he should take his holidays or what time he should not do so.  If there is an abuse, if it transpires that this arrangement for mutual agreement as to the time at which the holidays be begun has given rise to an abuse or a denial to the worker of all which this Bill, is designed to give him, we shall <Col N="1317" /> correct it.  Have no apprehension on that score.  But do not let us rush in to correct an abuse that may never arise if this anticipatory precaution means an added right for the Government to tell an agricultural worker what he may do and what he may not do.  This Government, I would suggest to Deputies, should be remembered as the servant of the people and not as their masters.  This Government should not be charged by Oireachtas Éireann with the duty of going into every man's home to tell him what is good for him.  A Government so charged are very likely to forget their proper role&mdash;that of servant&mdash;and when a Government ceases to glory in the title of servant they tend to become dangerous.</P>
      <P>Again I would press on Deputies not to forbid an employer and a worker the right to agree to take a week's wages in lieu of a week's holidays.  I see Deputy C. Lehane shaking his head gloomily.  Do not forget that in rural Ireland there is not that uniformity that obtains under industrial conditions.</P>

      <P>I should like to see the Labour Party devoting a week to expounding the duties of employers and of working men and then I should spend a week after them dwelling on the rights of agricultural workers and farmers.  Both of us possibly would be the better of our week's cogitations. There are duties as there are rights on both sides.  I should like to proceed on the assumption that we can leave <Col N="1318" /> a wide discretion, because we expect employers and workers to be conscious not only of their rights but of their duties.  I cheerfully pledge myself to this: that should experience reveal that either party has forgotten their duties and are solicitous only for their rights, Oireachtas Éireann will still be functioning and, albeit with reluctance, will take a hand.  But it would be very much happier for all of us if, having laid down the statutory minima, Oireachtas Éireann neither empowers nor compels the Executive to break into any man's home, whether he is an employer or a worker, to tell him where he is to take his holidays, how he is to take his holidays, when he is to take his holidays, or in what form he is to take his holidays.</P>

If by any manipulation or device anyone in this country succeeds in preventing any agricultural worker from freely making that choice I shall amend the Bill; but let us not start off on the assumption that our own people are all nasty, corrupt, mean and dishonest, and that when the crime of denying the labourer of his hire was described as one of those that cried out to heaven for vengeance, the Lord God Almighty had the Irish people in mind.  I do not believe that is true.  I do not believe the farmers of this country are the exploiting, unscrupulous, slave-driving individuals that some people seem to think.  I am going to try that out and I think I shall prove that I am right. I am quite prepared to say that if I am wrong I shall ask Oireachtas Eireann to amend the law to deal with the situation as it then emerges but I stake my reputation that no one will ever be able to make the case in this House that such an amendment is necessary.  I am certainly not going to proceed on the assumption that it is.</P>

      <Col N="1319" /> Deputy Dunne deplored the fact that the worker was dependent on his employer. Is that so great a humiliation? I am a worker, and if any worker in Ireland has a more mercurial employer than I have I should like to know him.  The Irish electorate is neither generous in its stipend nor conservative in its demands upon its servants.

      <P>I have not traduced the Deputy on that score in any case, and he might extend the same courtesy to me.  Deputy Corry, as usual, did not say much.  There is a subtle distinction between talking and saying something. Deputy Con Lehane spoke vehemently on the attitude of the farmers to this Bill being the criterion by which their <Col N="1320" /> Christianity should be judged.  May I amend that to say that the attitude of farmer and agricultural worker to this Bill will be an excellent test for both and the test will be if both parties recollect that they have rights and duties and if they both discharge them? I think the Deputy will accept that as a reasonably good definition of practical Christianity and he may proceed on the assumption that that is the general rule.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moylan rose to confirm the proposition that the agricultural workers are a depressed class.  Well, the difference between Deputy Moylan and his colleagues on the one side, and myself and my colleagues on the other, is that we are going to do something about it.  He did not do much.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Reilly, with his usual telling eloquence, said that farmers could not take a holiday themselves and farm workers could not take a holiday and everybody on the land was in misery.

He told me that he could prove, with the assistance of a costing accountant, that it cost 7½d. to produce an egg.  I demurred to that proposition and he then said to me: &ldquo;What will you do if I bring in a costings accountant, lay the whole case before you and demonstrate the truth of that proposition?&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;I would send promptly for my colleague, Dr. Browne, and get the pair of you <Col N="1321" /> committed to Grangegorman.&rdquo;  But he believed it.

Anyone who wants to can make the change.  There is no use pressing the contention that milk does not pay.  I think it may cause the farmers considerable embarrassment if that contention is pressed too often and too long.  The farmers know their own business.  That is the basis I have always proceeded on.

      <P>In the first eight weeks of 1947 the farmers produced 2,882,000 gallons of milk; in the same period of 1948 they produced 3,416,000 gallons; in the same period of 1949 they produced 4,582,000 gallons and in the same period of 1950 they produced 5,538,000 gallons.  Does Deputy O'Reilly think that the farmers have gone so daft as to double their production of a commodity on which they lose 1/8 a gallon every time they sell it?  He has a very much lower opinion of the farmers than I have now, than ever I have had, or than I ever am likely to have at any time or stage in my life.  He was also concerned about the 3/1 a gallon milk but I do not know that it is necessary to pursue that matter very much further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Cowan who said he thought that farmers rarely, if ever, gave their workers a holiday. He protested that, if not himself a farmer, he is the son of a farmer, and a farm labourer.  Well, he has become very much separated from the soil and all that appertains thereto if he imagines there is a continuous class war proceeding between the farmers and the labourers.  They are not all saints or angels any more than Deputies here. They are average, normal men and they do not spend their time eating the faces off one another.  They get on just the same as other men, and 95 per cent. of them are reasonable, rational beings who rub along as best they can and, on the whole, make a pretty good job of it.  I am grateful to Deputy Cowan for recognising the grotesque inadequacy of ministerial emoluments here.  I can only refer him to Emily <Col N="1323" /> Lawless' poem &ldquo;After Aughrim&rdquo; for the explanation of why the country goes on securing servants for the inadequate wages it pays.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen entered the fray then. Of course, he agreed with the Bill&mdash; that went without saying&mdash;but he said the farmer was getting no more for milk or for beet and no more for wheat. It is true the price of milk has not gone up and the price of beet has not gone up.  The price of wheat has gone up 5/- the barrel.  But in respect of all these products I think I demonstrated pretty clearly that with no greater efforts farmers are getting 30 to 40 per cent. more for each of them since the 15 hideous years came to an end.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cogan reached the apotheosis of his argument by demanding that the State should provide for all.  Has Deputy Cogan ever asked himself what is the State or who is the State, or, if the Government goes spending money, whose money do they spend?  If it is true as I think he believes it to be true, that, in the last analysis, everybody living in this country and earning a living in it derives his income ultimately from the land, how can the Deputy argue that the Government of such a society can remedy every grievance by subsidising the price paid for the produce of the land out of the land?

      <P>If the Deputy withdraws the contention, there is no need for me to deal with it further.  The last matter is the matter raised by Deputy Larkin and touched on by some of his colleagues. I demur to the division of our people into poor farmers and rich farmers.  I do not think it is necessary to discern classes in our rural community. We have not been conscious of it in this House and we are drawn from all sections of our people, and I have yet to meet the Deputy who is too proud, purse-proud, race-proud or any other proud, to bid his colleague &ldquo;good afternoon&rdquo;.  Do any Deputies discern in rural Ireland class consciousness amongst our own people, or a feeling of superiority in one group as opposed to another?  If they do, I should be glad of a lesson in the correct approach to the hierarchy of dignity in rural Ireland; if they would tell me where the licensed publican fits in and should he bow down when passing the dispensary doctor, and does the draper take precedence or fall behind?  Does the agricultural worker trail after the industrial worker, or does the man who lives on eight acres of land give way to the agricultural worker who is earning £6?  I found no trace in the 35 years I have lived in rural Ireland of any such hierarchy, or a desire on the part of any of our people to establish such a hierarchy or to recognise the pretension of any individual or group who asserted its existence.  Do not let us try to call it into existence where it never has been and where it would be a most exotic growth.</P>

I will be no party to compelling the farmers to provide a half-holiday for their agricultural workers at the present time, and, even if I wanted to do it, I would not be fit to do it because Oireachtas Éireann would not enact it.  Do not let us therefore throw away the attainable and possible in a futile resolve to insist on the impossible. Maybe it would have been impossible 15 or 20 years ago to do the little thing&mdash;and I do not claim any more for it than that&mdash;that we do to-day, but whatever was the situation 20 years ago it is possible now.  Maybe it will be possible in time to see on every farm in practice what is already practised on very many farms.  Maybe the time will come when we shall be entitled to say, with the consent of Oireachtas Éireann, in legislation that which I say now by way of persuasion and recommendation.  I should like to see every agricultural worker getting his weekly half-holiday.  On every State farm and institution every agricultural worker gets a half-holiday.</P>

That is, in common parlance, understood as meaning a weekly half-holiday, but Deputy Dunne does not mean a weekly half-holiday by anything other than a 45-hour week. We do not agree about that.  Let us agree to differ.  I say that the duty of a farmer, if it is within his power, is so to arrange the hours of his men that they can have their half-day by helping one another out.  I say that where the farmer's circumstances are such that he has only one man, that he is delicate or something of that kind, it is not possible for him to do it and I am not going to ask that he be made do it.  I should like to see the practice widespread and widespreading, <Col N="1326" /> but what I like and what my neighbours like may be two different things.

If such a change of mind occurs amongst the majority of the farmers of this country, I welcome it, personally; but I am just as solicitous to ensure that the will of the majority prevails when it does not agree with me as I am to see that it prevails when it does.  That is democracy, as I understand it.

      <P>Deputy Lemass, speaking on the Bill, expressed regret that the company did not find it possible to reach the full economic development at Slievardagh within the limit of £50,000.  Needless to mention, that is a regret which I share, but the fact is that they were not able to do it and, in order to give them an opportunity of arriving at the output from the mine which they expect to reach within the next year and a half, which will enable them if not to make a profit at least to break even, it is necessary to give this additional £38,000.  I think I did mention that, of the £38,000, the sum of approximately £10,000 would be required for the purchase of washing plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also mentioned that the Government had departed from his scheme of an expenditure of £85,000 a year for a period of seven years and he implied that nothing was being done along the line which was contemplated by the expenditure of that £85,000. Other Deputies spoke as if nothing was being done with regard to mineral exploration or development in the country.  I am very glad to be able to tell the House that there is more activity at present regarding mineral exploration and development than at any period since this State was established and that much more mineral exploration and exploitation is being carried on by private interests than ever before in the history of the country.  I want to inform the House also that in at least three of the projects which were contemplated under the expenditure of the £85,000, work which should be carried out by Mianraí, Teoranta, is, in fact, now being carried out by private <Col N="1328" /> interests.  The silver mines in County Tipperary is one; Abbeytown in County Sligo is another; and the barytes in Cork is a third.  These are being worked at the moment and the activities are being carried on by private interests.</P>
    <P>So far as Wicklow is concerned, the position at Avoca is quite simple.  The experts advised the Government that for an expenditure of approximately £120,000 they would reach a position where they could recommend as to whether further money should be expended on the developments at Avoca.  If the Government is advised, when the stage of development recommended by the experts is reached, that there is a reasonable prospect of a further expenditure of money producing a desirable result, I can assure the House that that development or further exploration will not come to an end for the want of money.  I think, however, that it is a reasonable thing to limit the expenditure to an amount which the experts themselves assure us will enable them to give a fuller and clearer report to us on the possibilities of Avoca than we have at present.</P>
    <P>In view of the line taken by certain Deputies here, I want to emphasise that there is, comparatively speaking, a good deal of activity in connection with mineral exploration and development in this country&mdash;far more than we have ever had before since the State was established.  I do not know that there is anything else I should say or need say at this stage, except that so far as I am concerned I am prepared to give whatever assistance I can to the development of any resources we have which are capable of development.</P>
    <P>Deputies know&mdash;and Deputy Lemass knows, as well as I do&mdash;that there are people in this country who have the idea that because there was a mine or even an opening in the ground somewhere at some time within sight there are possibilities, even probabilities, there which should be explored at Government expense, irrespective of the cost.  The Deputy is also aware that those views are held locally, in spite of the data that are at the disposal of the Government and the <Col N="1329" /> Geological Survey Office.  It is quite true to say that certain mineral deposits which in the past were entirely uneconomic are economic to-day, not merely because prices have soared but because of the developments which have taken place as a result of research by scientists, engineers, and so on, and because in this country, where our resources are rather limited, they are nowadays in a position to segregate minerals which, probably, they were unable to do when those particular deposits were last worked.</P>
    <P>The other point that was stressed was that I should indicate to Mianraí, Teoranta, that money for their various projects would not be easily forthcoming every time they asked for it, that they should not go along gaily in the belief that if they wanted additional money, or if their estimates were very wide of the mark, all they had to do was to make application and the money would be forthcoming.  I would like to assure the House, if it is necessary to do so, that all State companies are urged to work within the limit of their original estimate or as near as possible to the estimate, and I can assure the House that no company will get additional moneys without making a very good case for it. No Minister is anxious to come to the House to look for money over and above the original amounts provided, if he can possibly avoid it.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is a simple Bill; there are only two sections, and I would ask the House to pass it.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
    <P>Agreed to take remaining stages to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 7, to delete Section 6, lines 1 to 13, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) (a)  The board shall consist of such number of members as the Government may from time to time appoint.</P>
      <P>(b)  The Government shall so exercise their powers under paragraph (a) of this sub-section that the number of members of the board for the time being holding office is not less than three or more than seven.</P>
      <P>(2)  The chairman of the board shall be that member of the board who at the time of his appointment or subsequently is nominated by the Government as chairman.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to secure a minimum, as well as a maximum, number.  It is brought in to meet, as far as I can meet, the point made by Deputy Lemass and other Deputies on the Committee Stage.  It will be remembered that, as the Bill stood, the proposal was that the board should consist of not more than seven members, that the Government should appoint six and that the board should be free, if they so desired, to appoint the general manager as a director. Exception was taken to that from all sides of the House, such strong exception that I promised to look into that section dealing with the appointment of the general manager and the question of giving that power to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1331" /> In deference to the wishes of the House, I am withdrawing that section, not insisting on it, and, consequently, I am asking the House to agree that the board shall consist, as originally contemplated, of not more than seven, or not fewer than three.</P>
    <P>As the Bill was introduced, there was no minimum.  Deputy Lemass had an amendment to the effect that the number should never be allowed to go below four and &ldquo;not for a greater period than a fortnight&rdquo;, as far as I remember, was in his original suggestion. I think the proposal I am now putting to the House will meet both points of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move an amendment to amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3)  A person who holds a whole-time executive position in the board's service shall not be eligible, while he continues to hold such position, to be appointed a member of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the Minister's amendment is concerned, it is acceptable to me and represents, in my view, an improvement on the original Section 6.  I move this amendment to the Minister's amendment, not for the purpose of pressing on the Minister the acceptance of the limitations which that amendment suggests, but rather for the purpose of getting from him, if I can, an indication now of the type of board that he contemplates.  The House will remember that when we were discussing Section 6 of the Bill in Committee the Minister was asked to indicate the type of board he had in mind but found himself unable to do so and our position now is that we do not know whether the new Córas Iompair Éireann Board will be composed of part-time directors remunerated by fee, like directors of a commercial undertaking, or whole-time salaried executives with no activities except those attaching to membership of this board. I had expressed an opinion in favour of a whole-time board.  The view which I expressed in favour of a whole-time board was, I think, generally shared <Col N="1332" /> by those Deputies who spoke on the section but there was perhaps less unanimity as to whether the whole-time board should consist of persons holding no executive position in the board's organisation or executive officers.  The discussion arose upon the amendment by Deputy M. O'Sullivan to delete the sub-section in the original section which enabled the board to appoint the general manager to be a director.</P>
    <P>I take it that although that sub-section has disappeared it is still open to the Government to appoint the general manager and other executives of the board to be directors of the undertaking.  We could in fact have a type of board composed entirely of the departmental heads of Córas Iompair Éireann.  That type of board may have something to recommend it. It exists more or less at present for the direction of the electrical undertaking; the majority of the members of the Electricity Supply Board are departmental heads in the board's organisation.  I think, however, that it is not a desirable type of organisation. Inevitably in any large organisation inter-departmental rivalry develops in some degree, and when the spokesmen of the various departments are themselves directors that rivalry takes the form of disagreements on the board.  No, departmental head acting as spokesman for his subordinates on the board will like to have the departmental view expressed by him rejected by the board as a whole. These rivalries when expressed through the type of organisation which could be established under this Bill, a board consisting of departmental heads, can lead to great losses of efficiency.  Having regard to the nature of the organisation we are setting up, the magnitude of its responsibilities and the difficulties of the task confronting it in the immediate future, I think that if there is to be a whole-time board it should comprise men who have no executive responsibilities at all, who will act as general supervisors of the board's administration and have responsibility only for general questions of policy. The decisions of the board can be communicated to its organisation through <Col N="1333" /> the general manager or other departmental heads, and they also will, in my view, find their work facilitated if they have to fulfil these orders without themselves being held responsible for the making of them.  I know that opinions as to the best type of organisation in a concern of this kind are many, but I have little doubt that my experience would justify the opinion which I am expressing now: that the administration of the Córas Iompair Éireann undertaking will be far better if the board appointed by the Government are whole-time in the sense that the members of it will be able to give all the time necessary to the proper supervision of the undertaking and that it does not contain a majority, or perhaps members, who are also heads of departments of the organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt, but would the Deputy mind indicating, just to give us a line on this, what a board of laymen would be doing full-time?  What duties would the Deputy say should be allotted to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in the immediate future the decisions on policy which will have to be made, the accumulation of information which would permit of those decisions being made, the management of the concern's finance and the supervision of the undertaking, particularly in its public relations aspect, will involve a great deal of work, sufficient to require the full-time services of the board.  I know that we in this country have not had much experience of that type of board. In Great Britain various nationalised undertakings, including the transport undertaking, and certainly the air companies and other organisations established by statute as well as a number of private commercial organisations, have boards of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I certainly do not want to press my view on the Minister.  If I were charged with the responsibility of setting up this organisation, I think I would like to have upon the board more than the chairman giving whole-time service; it might not be necessary to have the whole board giving whole-time service. I would adopt the policy enshrined in <Col N="1334" /> my amendment of not including on the board departmental heads and, on the whole, I think I would decide in favour of a board consisting entirely of whole-time members, because <i>vis-a-vis</i> such whole-time members, the ordinary type of part-time directors can carry very little weight.  I move the amendment merely to get from the Minister, if he can give it now, an indication of the type of board he contemplates.  I would say that my experience is against the type of board which includes departmental heads and I am therefore moving the amendment in the form in which it appears upon the paper and which would result, if the Minister adopted it, in the exclusion of departmental heads from the board.</P>
    <P>The other type of board that could be contemplated, a whole-time chairman with a number of ordinary directors attending weekly or fortnightly meetings and depending for their information concerning the board's activities on reports from the executive officers, might be quite adequate for this concern at some future date.  I think, however, that in the immediate future it would be inadequate.  I express that point of view as my own.  I have no desire to force the Minister on to any line.  I do think, however, that at this stage the House should get from him some picture of the organisation he has in mind and some idea of its composition. It may not be feasible to ask him to particularise on the type of appointments the Government intends to make in a manner which would, perhaps, enable the House to identify individuals, but we should know what type of organisation he intends setting up, because it is entirely upon it that responsibility for the management of the concern will rest.</P>
    <P>In my view&mdash;and I have expressed it here before&mdash;the only real change we are making in the transport situation is the decision to have a new method of appointing the Córas Iompair Éireann Board.  That may be desirable, but if it is desirable we should know what type of board is contemplated and how it will function.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us some information on this point and I <Col N="1335" /> think the Dáil could reasonably press for the information at this stage of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I assumed that Deputy Lemass, with his intimate knowledge and experience of the past, including past failures, not all associated with his own administration but over a long period of years, would be willing to try, for a period of five years at any rate, some other type of managerial system rather than the system of part-time directors, which is responsible for the failures of the past.  Without any disrespect to any of the directors of the railways who have been in control before and since 1924, in my opinion, with my little knowledge of the transport business, the failures of the past were due to interference in the day-to-day managerial control of the railways apart altogether from policy, interference by men with no intimate knowledge of the working of a transport system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lemass, himself, took the decision in 1944 to put one man in charge at that very critical period in the emergency.  I supported him in the decision he took then.  I think his decision was a clear admission on his part that he had lost all faith in the board that was then in control of our transport system.  The chairman then put in was nominated by the Government, and I am sure Deputy Lemass had good reasons for doing that.  For good, sound national reasons I supported the Government of the day in that matter.  The nomination of the particular individual at the time&mdash;it did not matter to me who he was&mdash;was, I think, in the interests of the maintenance of the concern.  I do not want to go into the reasons why I think Deputy Lemass and his colleagues in the Government took that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards what is before the House, Deputy Lemass seems to think that we have no experience to guide us in the matter of the establishment of a board consisting of executive officers.  He thinks it would give rise to inter-departmental rivalry.  I take it that the reference he made to a board was to the Electricity Supply <Col N="1336" /> Board.  I confess that I do not know, and never will know, as much about the administration of the Electricity Supply Board as Deputy Lemass does. In my opinion, inter-departmental rivalry might not be a bad thing.  Suppose you had a board consisting of four or five people who were familiar with the work in the different sections of a particular concern, I think it would be a good thing for that concern that people of an independent type of mind should be on the board.  Their knowledge would enable them, either at board meetings or in between board meetings, to criticise their colleagues and do so in no unfriendly spirit.  If, on the other hand, you have a board consisting of &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men it may be that the meetings of the board will be very friendly and harmonious, but then, I think, at the end of a year or two you will be nearer a crash than if you have a board consisting of the type of men that I have indicated.</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy Lemass has described as inter-departmental rivalry. I would not be in the least afraid of that.  Personally, I would be prepared to advocate the establishment of a board consisting of executive officers, and I would not confine myself to Córas Iompair Éireann.  I would select the executive officers for such a board for the five years now before us from the ranks of other transport concerns in the country&mdash;road, rail or canal.  I am sure that we can find inside our shores men competent to do that job, capable of bringing the transport concern out of the state of chaos in which we find it to-day into a position in which it will be able to pay its way in the future and, at the same time, giving better service to the community and, if possible, better conditions to its own servants.</P>
    <P>I have watched very carefully in recent years the working of Córas Iompair Éireann and I respectfully suggest to Deputy Lemass that one thing that must strike any man with a transport mind, a man in close touch with the working of a transport system, is this, that apparently there was nobody strong enough on the revenue earning side to say whether certain traffic should be carried over <Col N="1337" /> long distances by road or rail.  The revenue-earning side was the vital section.  We know that in the past there were conflicts of opinion between district superintendents as to whether certain traffic should go by road or rail. My opinion is that if you had a member of the board, fortified by executive authority, prepared to go to Cork, or Sligo, or Waterford, or wherever there were these conflicts of opinion, in a position to decide in cases of genuine disputes whether traffic should be carried over long distances by road or rail, things would be different from what they are.  I have personal knowledge of cases&mdash;I am sure Deputy Lemass has, too, and must regard it as regrettable&mdash;where traffic was carried on lorries by road from Tralee to Dublin and where there was no load for the return journey.</P>
    <P>Surely to goodness that sort of thing had something to do with the state of bankruptcy into which the concern was allowed to get.  I suggest that a director, with knowledge and experience of the working of the transport industry on the revenue-earning side, would not have allowed that state of affairs to continue for a week.  Deputy Lemass knows that kind of activity had been going on for a period of years, and, apparently, there was no one in the concern prepared to take responsibility for putting an end to it.  It led to inefficient service, so far as the community was concerned, and added to the cost of the concern by reason of inefficient working.</P>
    <P>Take the spending side.  If you had a board properly constituted of executive officers who knew their job, let us see what the position would be.  We may take it that the chief engineer would be in charge on the spending side.  He would give an indication in pounds, shillings and pence of the sum that he would require and, after due deliberation and consideration, the board would give him an indication of the amount that would be available to him for the maintenance of the permanent way, the reconstruction of rolling stock, and so on.  I think it is fair to say that no sensible executive officer on the revenue-earning side would, at a board meeting, attempt to dictate to <Col N="1338" /> the chief engineer as to how he should spend that money.  There would not be, in my opinion, any inter-departmental rivalry in a case of that kind. One man, an engineer, would be an expert, and would know best how the money should be spent.  I could not imagine a man on the revenue-earning side holding up a board meeting and arguing with the chief engineer&mdash;an expert&mdash;as to the best way of spending the money that had been allocated to him, particularly in view of the fact that the matter had been carefully considered by the board as a whole.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the system enshrined in this Bill being christened as another failure at the end of five years.  I want to say, in all seriousness, to the Minister and to Deputy Lemass, that the small amount of money that would be involved should not prevent them from getting inside the shores of this country five, six or seven men, all experts in their own particular sections, on a board such as I suggest.  They would be all experienced men, and I think it would pay the country if such a body were got together.  I hope it will be for a short period only that the country will have to find a subsidy.  I believe that, in the end, it would pay the country to get the most experienced men, men trained in the school of experience in road, rail and canal transport.  I suggest it should be a full-time job for them.  I would hope that in five or six years' time the Minister could stand up here and say that he had a full-time board consisting of executive officers rather than one consisting of drapers, chemists, doctors or men who knew nothing at all about the industry, and who could be &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men only at a board meeting.  If the Minister were in a position to do that, he would then be making some attempt to give to the chairman and his colleagues the opportunity of doing the job that I know he wants to get done, namely, to bring the transport industry as a whole out of the chaos in which we find it to-day. I favour that as an experiment which has never before been tried in this country.  I think it is one that is well worth trying&mdash;the appointment of a board drawn from executive officers <Col N="1339" /> engaged in the transport system of the country as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear Deputy Lemass saying that he was not going to press the amendment.  There is no desire on my part that this board should consist of or be representative to any degree of heads of departments or executive officers.  On the other hand, I think it would be unfair at this stage to impose a greater restriction on the selection and appointment of the board of Córas Iompair Éireann than has been imposed on any other company established by the State. Let me say also that there is no statutory provision in any of the Acts establishing any of the State or semi-State companies which lays it down whether the ordinary members shall be whole-time or part-time members. So far as the statutes are concerned, any of these boards could be either whole-time, part-time, part whole-time, or part part-time, so to speak. I do not think it is reasonable that we should lay down here and now any restrictions on the type of board or the type of person who would be put on that board.  I think we are anxious on all sides of the House&mdash;I am certainly anxious and the Government are anxious&mdash;to get the sort of board, the type of personnel that is going to give this organisation the best chance of succeeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say quite frankly that, like Deputy Lemass, I would be completely opposed to a board composed of departmental heads or executives.  It would I think lead to friction and a lot of difficulty. Deputy Davin says: &ldquo;Let us get an executive man who knows his job and make him a completely full-time member of the board.&rdquo;  If he is a completely full-time member of the board, somebody else must take his place as executive officer.  You are going to have friction.  That is what we want to obviate as much as we can.  Equally, I can see no case for a board composed entirely of full-time laymen. Suppose you appoint a chairman and <Col N="1340" /> six laymen, what will they be doing? Deputy Lemass talked about general supervision of the board's administration. Again, I can see very great dangers in that.  I think it would be almost impossible to find work which could be usefully done in the ordinary day-to-day administration by laymen members of a board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that, because they would not know what they were doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is so, so far as ordinary administration is concerned. I did not pretend at any time, Deputy Lemass has not pretended, and I do not think anyone has pretended that it is going to be easy to get the sort of board we all wish to get.  No two Deputies on any side of the House are in full agreement as to what sort of board they want, whether it is a part-time board, a part part-time, or a part full-time, or whether it is composed partly of laymen and partly of executives, or entirely of executives, or entirely of laymen.  As I say, in respect of every other company established here, it was left to be determined by the Government and the tenure, so to speak, of the members of the board was set out in the warrants of appointment.  The desire is to get the best possible board that we can&mdash;there is no other desire than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I can give a clear indication to the House of my point of view, it is that I am not in favour of a board composed of heads of departments and I am not in favour of a board composed entirely of full-time laymen.  I do not think either one or the other would be good for the future of the company.  I do not think that you can have either one or the other type of board I have mentioned functioning without fear, not merely of friction, but of a certain amount of dislocation and a certain amount of overlapping leading to a very strong conflict of opinion.  Deputy Lemass has intimated more than once in our consideration of this matter that we have an example of that type of conflict already.  That is so.  So far as I am concerned, I am anxious to get a board <Col N="1341" /> of such a type that the danger of conflict, the danger of dislocation, or the danger of open or underhand disagreement between the members of the board and the chief executive officers of the company will be obviated.</P>
    <P>In regard to the amendment, I think it would be unreasonable to set down in the statute that at no time or in no circumstances should an executive officer of the company be eligible for appointment to the board.  It may be found in certain circumstances or at a certain period that the addition of a particular executive officer to the board might be of very great assistance to the company and to the organisation as a whole.  I say &ldquo;it may be.&rdquo; I am not saying that I am in any way anxious to do it, or that the Government are anxious to do it&mdash;we are not.</P>
    <P>I have responded to the views which were so strongly expressed from all sides of the House about the sub-section with regard to giving the board power to appoint the general manager and have taken that out.  I do not know, however, whether the House thinks it is fair or right or reasonable to expect me to say that I shall have five, six or seven persons and what they are going to be representative of. I have probably given more information on this question of the type of board to be appointed than was given in regard to any other company that we have set up in this State.  I know that the concern of Deputies is just the same as my own concern, and that is to get a board that will function effectively and that is likely to bring the company out of the very serious difficulties in which undoubtedly it is.</P>
    <P>Another thing I should like to stress &mdash;I think Deputy Lemass will agree with this&mdash;is that it is not easy, either in a part-time or in a full-time position, to get five, six or seven men of the type that we would all really like to get. You simply cannot pick them off the trees.  I think that is recognised and admitted.  All I can say to the House is that I shall endeavour to see that the board that is appointed by the Government will be a board of the type that is most likely to lead to the successful working of this organisation.  I <Col N="1342" /> am not trying to hide anything.  I am not trying to stall on any of my responsibilities in the matter, but I think it would be unreasonable to ask me at this stage to be more specific than I have been.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> In page 9, before Section 10, line 9, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Public Authorities Protection Act, 1893, shall not apply to any action, prosecution or proceeding against the board or in respect of any act, neglect or default by a servant or agent of the board in his capacity as a servant or agent of the board.</P>
    <P>This amendment is to provide that the board shall not be covered by the Public Authorities Protection Act.  As Deputies are aware, there are certain advantages to public authorities proceeded against; a public authority is limited to six months and so on.  A person who takes action against such authority leaves himself open to very heavy costs.  It is not considered desirable that these provisions should apply to the board and I think that is a reasonable provision to make in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree.  The board will not be a public authority and, therefore, should not be subject to the protection of the Act of 1893.  I might, perhaps, at this stage refer to a matter that came to my attention which, while not entirely relevant to the amendment, has nevertheless sufficient relationship to it to justify my referring to it.  As the Minister knows, a person in receipt of a military service pension has that pension abated if he takes employment with a public authority. If he is not employed by a public authority there is, of course, no such abatement.  There are a number of persons employed by Córas Iompair Éireann who are in receipt of military service pensions and who are mistakenly under the impression that the effect of this Bill will be to make Córas Iompair Éireann a public authority and, therefore, render their pensions subject to abatement.  I have assured those who spoke to me in the matter that their fears were unfounded and that Córas Iompair Éireann, under this Bill, will be in no different position from the Electricity Supply Board, and that their pensions will not, therefore, be subject to abatement. I think it might be no harm if the Minister confirmed that in order to allay these groundless fears which <Col N="1345" /> are circulating amongst a limited number of the Córas Iompair Éireann staff.</P>

    <P>(l)  to make working agreements or arrangements for the provision by any person of transport services which the board is required or authorised to provide, or for the provision by the board of any transport services which any other person has power to provide.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a slightly different point.  At any rate I am proposing to put the same idea into a different section.  As the Bill emerged in Committee Córas Iompair Éireann will operate under these conditions.  It will be subject to no control exercisable by the Minister or by any other authority in the matter of the fares charged for transport services.  In the matter of railway services it will be obliged to maintain existing services unless they are released from the obligation to do so, following an application to the tribunal to be established by the Bill.  There is no power given either to the Minister or to the tribunal to require Córas Iompair Éireann to provide a service where such service is considered necessary and where there is not an existing railway service. Deputies will have noted from time to time representatives from various constituencies urging upon the Minister the extension of bus services, the provision of new omnibus services, and the improvement of other transport services in accordance with the requirements of areas in their constituency as <Col N="1349" /> made known to them by residents in them.  The transport needs of the country as a whole change from time to time with shifting population, the development of new housing areas, the opening of new factories and for other causes.  It is necessary for the transport organisation then to alter their schedules and running arrangements in order to meet the requirements resulting from these shifts of population.  We have no reason to assume that the Córas Iompair Éireann Board will not be concerned to provide transport services where they think them necessary. Opinions, however, may differ as to what constitutes necessity, particularly in the matter of omnibus services in outlying areas to meet the requirements of people who are not living along the regular scheduled routes.</P>
      <P>It seems to me desirable that there should be somebody with power to request or to require the company to provide services.  We could, in certain circumstances, find ourselves in the situation that the company, for reasons of economy or otherwise, was seriously curtailing the transport services of the country&mdash;particularly the omnibus services because, of course, the curtailment of rail services would bring the tribunal into operation&mdash;and we could do nothing about it.  If Deputies have demands from localities in their constituencies for the extension or the provision of new omnibus services, I think they should be able to express them here and that the Minister should have power to do something about them if he thinks them reasonable.  Ordinarily I know these things are done informally. The Deputy will approach the board and, if they can be persuaded that there is a case for the extension of services, they may meet it.  If the Deputy cannot get satisfaction from the board he may get the Minister to add his voice in support of the request.  But if, having come to the limits of possibility of action in that informal way, there is still a reasonable demand unsatisfied, then I think the Minister should have power to require the company to do it by Order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am moving to insert these two subsections&mdash;which will enable the Minister to require the board to provide a service for the conveyance of traffic by <Col N="1350" /> rail, road or water or to increase an existing service and to make an Order compelling the board to do it if they do not meet his request&mdash;into Section 13.  The effect of putting these two sub-sections into Section 13 is to create a situation in which the Minister cannot, in fact, exercise that power by Order unless the Order is confirmed by resolution here.</P>
    <P>That is a very slight addition to the provisions of the Bill, but it seems to me to meet a gap in the Bill.  I think most of us will regard it as an unsatisfactory measure if it is passed with that gap in it.</P>
    <P>We are setting up this transport board.  We are entrusting to it the public transport of the country by rail, road and canal.  We are giving the board substantial power.  We have been committed by the present Government to provide subsidies against losses and I think we should have here some power to ensure that they give reasonable services and to require them to give these services if the opinion of the whole House is that they are not being provided in any particular case. That is the purpose of this amendment. It closes what I think is an undesirable gap in the Bill.  Incidentally, it would have the effect of making it in order for a Deputy to express here any discontent existing in his constituency regarding the inadequacy of omnibus services which have been, I think, the main subject of various Dáil Questions and other similar references here in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Lemass on this amendment which, as he says, closes a gap that is in the Bill as drafted.  Undoubtedly Córas Iompair Éireann, as established under this Bill, will be subsidised for a considerable period by the taxpayer.  It may be that in some particular part of the country a transport service is required.  The Minister may be of opinion that the demand for that particular service is not unreasonable. It would be well, therefore, for the Minister to have in the Bill and it would be wise for the House to give to the Minister the power which it is sought to give the Minister in this particular amendment.  It is a power <Col N="1351" /> which will not, of course, or cannot be lightly used and it is a power which, as Deputy Lemass has stated, is subject to approval under the section.  It is subject to confirmation, not only by one House, but by both Houses.  I think the Minister himself ought to accept the very strong case that has been made for this amendment and ought to agree to its incorporation in the Bill.</P>

      <P>Superficial consideration of the amendment would lead one to the view that there was nothing in it to which exception could be taken and with the apparent general underlying principle of the amendment I am in agreement.  However, I can see its acceptance in its present form creating difficulties for the Minister and difficulties for this House.  It is all very well to talk about the Minister taking this necessary power to himself but I would urge Deputies to read the amendment in its entirety and to consider all its implications.  I think that the amendment goes too far and into much too much detail and that if the Minister took the power sought to be thrust on him he would find that, as a concomitant of that power, this House would be open to have its time wasted in intervention by this House in what it was agreed from both sides of the House should be left alone, namely, the day to day administration of the company. I think the amendment seeks to give the Minister power to intervene and interfere in the minutiæ of the company's administration.  Therefore, I do not think the amendment should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly could not agree to accept this amendment.  Deputy Lehane has given some of the reasons.  This would be coming down to very ordinary day to day details. My first objection is that I consider that the question of frequency, varying of routes and so forth is a matter that must be determined, if it is to operate at all, by the appropriate officers of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second objection is that I must say that in my experience over the past two years, since I became Minister, I have seen nothing but a desire on the part of the company&mdash;<Col N="1352" /> both under the present chairman and under the previous chairman&mdash;to extend the services as rapidly as possible and to give the people the best and the most frequent services that it was possible in the circumstances to give them.  There has been a very great improvement in the services&mdash;both rail and bus services and particularly bus services&mdash;in the past couple of years. Deputies ought to bear in mind that this is going to be a national board. This company is going to be a national company.  This property is going to be the property of the people of the country and the desire of that board will be to give the most satisfactory service that can be given to the public.</P>

      <P>That is another story.  We were dealing with a different matter altogether.  We were <Col N="1353" /> dealing with a property and an organisation that was in private hands and owned by a private company. We are dealing now with a national company. In any case, I think it would be preposterous that any Minister should be dictating to the company as to their routes and frequencies, as to whether they were running too many buses or too few.  I am appalled at the picture that would open up in this House.  Deputy Cowan would be claiming that Deputy Lehane's constituents were getting too many buses and were getting better service than his constituents were getting. In any case, we ought to appreciate that this will be a national board and that that board will understand that it is the desire not merely of the House but the desire of the company that the best possible service that can be given to people will be given.  So far as I am concerned, the provision of a suitable and satisfactory service for the community would be No. 1 priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I do not want to force the amendment on the Minister if he does not want to accept it?  I think what the amendment proposes is quite clear.  As the Bill will pass the House, there will be no power in this House or in any officer of the House to require this company to provide reasonable transport services, if they are not doing it.  We are entitled to assume that they will be concerned with providing the best service they can.  If, however, they run into difficult times or if the Minister for Finance cuts the subsidy, they may decide to solve the resulting problem by withdrawing services from outlying districts which are not highly remunerative and we can do nothing about it. I think we should have power to do something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1354" /> The Minister says that a similar power in the 1944 Act was never used but that is beside the point.  The fact that the Minister had that power meant that a Deputy could come in here, voice the grievances of his constituents and ask the Minister to use the power.  As the Bill now stands if power is not given to the Minister, any Deputy seeking to raise such a question will be told that the Minister has no responsibility and no power to intervene.  I think it is most unlikely that the power will ever be used because not merely would the mere existence of the section in the Bill give Deputies a certain right to query the Minister but it would also give the Minister certain influence with the board which would make it unnecessary to have recourse to the making of an Order when in the Minister's opinion there was a reasonable and legitimate grievance in some parts of the country.  However, I am less concerned with the Minister's refusal to accept this power by reason of the fact he will have always effective power over the minutiæ of the company's administration so long as the Minister for Finance has to provide a subsidy and, secondly, because I hope he will accept a slightly weaker amendment which appears later in my name.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise one point in connection with this amendment.  Sub-section (5) of the proposed new section says: &ldquo;The board may attach to the services afforded by it such terms and conditions as the board thinks fit.&rdquo;  That, of course, continues a practice that exists at the moment but I can see some difficulties that may arise.  Probably I should have put an amendment down to that sub-section.  It is the practice now and again, in respect of certain types of tickets issued by Córas Iompair Éireann, to exempt themselves from liabilities to which they would otherwise be subject.  I do not know what I can do with regard to that except to draw attention to the point.  I feel that the issue of excursion tickets, or tickets of that kind, by Córas Iompair Éireann, should not be permitted. Certainly they should not be allowed to exempt themselves from legal liabilities for carelessness or negligence to which they would otherwise be subject.  I merely mention that so that the Minister may consider whether the matter could be dealt with elsewhere before the Bill is passed.</P>

      <P>I would like to endorse what Deputy Cowan has said and make this additional point for the Minister's attention.  In the normal course of events it is almost impossible to purchase a ticket for the existing services that is not an excursion ticket.  Many Deputies are aware that the ticket bought normally by a passenger going on business is issued at some reduced rate which brings it within the category of an excursion <Col N="1358" /> ticket.  I merely add that to what Deputy Cowan has said.  It means, in effect, that more than 90 per cent. of the passengers carried by the railway services have no right of action in the event of an accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to point out in regard to tickets that they are for one day only.  For instance, as regards the tickets Deputies obtain from the railway company, portion is available for the day of issue only and that is inconvenient for us on certain occasions where we may have to break journeys to attend meetings.  I would like to bring that matter to the Minister's attention and perhaps he will get the board to consider it and so arrange that the same conditions will apply for the outward and return portions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Flynn's intervention is not quite so helpful as it sounds.  The Minister might consider directing the attention of the board to the desirability of re-examining a number of changes in the ordinary practice of the company, changes that were introduced during the emergency. During the war a ticket could be issued only for the one day because the company could not guarantee transport facilities for the following day.  Deputy Davin referred to the through rate arrangement for passengers.  That was also a consequence of the emergency because the company could not allow a ticket to be sold in London which would guarantee a train service in Ireland when that train might not run or might be crowded.</P>
      <P>A number of changes introduced during the emergency may no longer be desirable.  Possibly the company may wish to hang on to them because they are more convenient from their point of view, but it is desirable that these things should be re-examined.</P>

      <P>I wish to direct attention to the fact that on the Committee Stage reference was made to the peculiar, the almost exceptional position that obtains on the Timoleague-Courtmacsherry branch line and the Minister undertook to look into that matter.  I regret it was not brought to the Minister's notice until a very late stage.

      <P>Further to the remarks made by Deputy O'Sullivan, I regret that we were not in a position to see the Minister earlier in reference to this matter.  I would like to know where we stand.  Leaving this line out altogether, the same thing may perhaps happen in another area.  The difficulty is that it might require an Act of the Oireachtas to bring about a remedy.  The point is, before actually closing down the line in what way would the system of investigation be introduced?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I understand the position, this is a line that is alleged to be dangerous.  Is not that so?  The company's engineers say that the line is dangerous; the local people believe it is not.  I do not know what the Deputy wants to have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> Unfortunately, I had not an opportunity of going into this matter very fully.  If it is a conflict between the engineers advising the local people and the company's engineers, then the Minister for Industry and Commerce has a right to get a report from his own railway engineers.  I think the Minister has the right to make a recommendation to the company on the matter.</P>

      <P>The position is that there is a very old order issued by the Board of Trade laying down a certain axle load on that line&mdash;I think it is eight tons.  That axle load cannot be exceeded and, because of that, unnecessary expenses are being placed on the working of the line, such as double headed engines and other things of that kind.  The contention locally is that the line cannot be run economically, whereas the Minister has indicated that it is, in fact, as good as any other branch line so far as safety is concerned.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 19, Section 20, to insert before sub-section (5) a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(5) The provisions of paragraph (b) of the above sub-section shall not operate to release the board from the liability to repay to the Central Fund, with interest thereon at the rate appointed by the Minister for Finance, the full amount of any advance made under sub-section (3) of Section 18 of the Transport Act, 1944, at such times and in such instalments as the Minister for Finance may appoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this for the purpose of getting clarification on one point.  Section 20, which deals with the transfer to the <Col N="1361" /> board of undertakings of dissolved undertakers, says in paragraph (b) of sub-section (4):&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The board shall not by virtue of this sub-section be subject to any liability in respect of any security of either dissolved undertaker in substitution for which transport stock is issued under this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it intended to release the board from the obligation which Córas Iompair Éireann has to repay to the Exchequer the amount advanced from the Exchequer in this year or in 1949 to meet debenture interest?  It seems to me that the obligation which the present Córas Iompair Éireann undertaking has under the 1944 Act is to repay to the Exchequer any amounts advanced from the Exchequer under the guarantee of debenture interest and that the effect of this sub-section might be to release it from the obligation. I have no objection to its being released from that obligation, but if the Government wants to do it&mdash;it does not seem to me to be of very much moment whether we release it from the obligation or give it a subsidy to meet the obligation&mdash;I think we should be quite clear what we are doing and should have the purpose of the sub-section put beyond doubt.  My amendment is to remove&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

Is it intended that Córas Iompair Éireann will be released from that obligation entirely or that the obligation will remain?  If it is intended that it should remain, the wording of the sub-section may require to be examined, because it could possibly be held to have the effect of releasing Córas Iompair Éireann from the obligation.</P>

      <P>The present liability of Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of moneys which the Dáil voted to recoup the Exchequer against these advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I can explain it more clearly this way.  The Supplementary Estimate we had in 1949 included in the non-repayable grant a sum of £561,000 to enable Córas Iompair Éireann to repay the sum advanced from the Central Fund.  This payment has been made.  Córas Iompair Éireann were required out of their own resources, to meet the interest on that amount, a sum of £17,000 odd.  Provision was also made in the Supplementary Estimate for debenture interest amounting to £209,000 for the second half of 1949, which fell due in January, 1950, and which the company were unable to meet themselves. No advance was made for this purpose from the Central Fund under the guarantee.  The position is, accordingly, that Córas Iompair Éireann has at present no liability to repay to the Central Fund any moneys advanced under the guarantee.  The board, that is, the new board, will be liable to repay £2,464,000 which was included in the Supplementary Estimate and which was advanced for capital purposes. That is the distinction I am <Col N="1363" /> making.  These advances were not made under the guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I understand the Minister correctly, what he is trying to tell us is that we are amending an Act of the Oireachtas by a footnote to an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what it comes to.  The position of the law at the moment is that Córas Iompair Éireann got a guarantee of their debenture interest. If they failed to meet it, the amount was advanced from the Exchequer to Córas Iompair Éireann under the general authority of the 1944 Act.  Córas Iompair Éireann having failed to repay the money within 12 months, the Minister had to come to the Dáil to get the Dáil to vote the recoupment of the Exchequer in the amount Córas Iompair Éireann had failed to repay; but the 1944 Act says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The provision of moneys by the Oireachtas under sub-section (7) of this section shall not exempt the company from the liability to repay to the Central Fund, with interest thereon at the rate appointed by the Minister for Finance, the full amount of any advance made under sub-section (3) of this section, but such repayment shall be made by the company at such times and in such instalments as the Minister for Finance may appoint.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>So far as Córas Iompair Éireann are concerned, the mere fact that the Dáil voted the money has not released them from the liability.  It still remains for them, under sub-section (8) of Section 18 of the 1944 Act.  The effect of this sub-section may be to release them from that liability.  If that is not intended, it seems to me it could be held to have that effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial position of the new board will have to be cleared up somehow, but I am anxious to have it quite clearly stated that the liability under the 1944 Act of the present Córas Iompair Éireann undertaking to the Exchequer is transferred to the new board.  If it is to be released from that liability, it must be done by an Act of <Col N="1364" /> the Oireachtas and I certainly will not assent to the theory that we release them from the liability by a footnote in an Estimate.  The law was clearly stated in an Act of the Oireachtas and can only be removed by an amendment of that Act.  If we want to amend that Act, this is the occasion for doing it.</P>

      <P>In page 21, Section 23, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(6) Where it is anticipated that, by reason of an arrangement under sub-section (1) of this section, any officers or servants of the board or of the transferor or of the Irish Railway Clearing House may suffer loss of employment or worsening of their conditions of service, such arrangement shall provide for payment of compensation to such officers or servants in terms no less favourable than are contained in Sections 35 and 36 of this Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 23 provides for the voluntary acquisition by the board of transport undertakings, either wholly or partly within the State.  Apart altogether from the question of the Great Northern Railway, which was specially referred to in the earlier stages of the debate, I should like to point out to the <Col N="1365" /> Minister that there are other transport undertakings which could be affected by the section, namely, the Sligo, Leitrim and Northern Counties Railway, the County Donegal Railways and the Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railways.  The staff of the clearing house, numbering about 100, are apprehensive lest any changes that might be made by the operation of this section should affect their employment and they seek an assurance that they will be kept covered, so far as compensation or the worsening of conditions is concerned. There has been a deterioration in their position as a result of the setting up of the Ulster Transport Authority, to some extent at any rate, and they fear that there will be an intensification of that position if the cross-Border services to which I have referred are acquired.  I should like to know if, since the Railway Clearing House is not specifically referred to in the Bill, except by way of reference to the 1924 Act, the Minister would be prepared to see that they are mentioned in the special way we set out here.</P>

      <P>While I have a good deal of sympathy with what the Deputy has in mind, I think it is undesirable to anticipate legislation.  As I understand the position, this can apply only to one or two of the smaller companies here and to a cross-Border company.  In the case of acquired transport undertakings such as lorry or haulage contractors, these are covered by the Road Transport Act.  In the absence of any specific proposal at the moment to acquire any further undertakers, I think it is undesirable to include provisions in this Bill in anticipation of legislation.</P>
      <P>On the point the Deputy raised about the railway clearing house, I will have that matter examined; but until we have a particular case I think it would be undesirable to include provisions in the Bill.</P>

That, in fact, may take place without any special legislation, and if the Parliamentary Secretary would be prepared, as the previous Minister was, on an occassion of this character, to give an assurance that in the event of any changes of that kind likely to affect the employment at the Irish Railway Clearing House, they would in fact be subject to the same terms of compensation as other services, that assurance would satisfy our people here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can give that assurance.  As I understand it, the cross-Border company interchanged some of the staffs between the Six Counties and the Twenty-Six and for that reason, if the section as contained here were put in, it would deal specifically with that situation and difficulties would arise in the working out of it, because of transfers either on promotion or otherwise.  I understand they endeavour to keep the staff in the Six Counties and the staff in the Twenty-Six Counties working in their particular areas; but if this section were included and if for any reason they had to transfer them, it might be difficult to administer.  In regard to the assurance for which the Deputy asks, I think that can be given.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear that that covers the point.  Deputy O'Sullivan was concerned with the staff of the Irish Railway Clearing House, but there is perhaps more involved in this section than that staff.  If Córas Iompair Éireann acquires another transport undertaking, we are anxious to be assured that the staff of the acquired undertaking will be transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann with the same rights to compensation in the event of subsequent dismissal for redundancy as the staffs now being transferred are given.  It may be argued, and could be argued, that as the acquisition Order under sub-section (1) would have to be confirmed by the Dáil anyhow, we could then ensure that the necessary arrangements to protect the staff are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1367" /> As was pointed out earlier in the debates on this Bill, however, the difference between a motion confirming an Order and a Bill is that there is only one discussion, one debate, and no possibility of amendment, in the case of a motion.  The Dáil would be presented with the passing of the motion even though it regarded the Order as unsatisfactory, or the alternative of rejecting the motion even though it regarded the purpose of the Order as satisfactory.  It would be much better to have in this Bill an omnibus provision to ensure that, whenever Córas Iompair Éireann does acquire another transport undertaking, the mere fact of acquisition will confer upon the staff of that undertaking the same rights as are conferred by this Bill on the Grand Canal Company staff who are now being transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>I hardly think it is necessary to anticipate further acquisition at this stage.

      <P>It is more than that.  I moved in Committee to delete the words &ldquo;with such modifications and exceptions as may be specified in the Order&rdquo;.  The purpose of an Order under this section is to apply to any person whose employment is affected by the transfer of the Shannon Navigation to Córas Iompair Éireann the protection of Section 35, that is to say, the right to compensation, the right to employment and the right to compensation on subsequent dismissal.  As originally framed, the section had these words, &ldquo;with such modifications and exceptions as may be specified in the Order&rdquo;.  I sought to amend that so that there should be no modifications or exceptions and that the staff of the <Col N="1369" /> Shannon Navigation transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann should have the same rights as the staff of the Grand Canal Company transferred to Córas Iompair Éireann.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If necessary.  I hope-it will not be necessary.  When the Emergency Powers (Córas Iompair Éireann) (Reduction of Railway Services) Order, 1944, was made, I was subjected to a great deal of interrogation in the Dáil concerning the intention behind the Order.  The Order which authorised Córas Iompair Éireann to suspend services over a number of branch lines was justified then on the ground of scarcity of coal and of railway equipment.  Some Deputies, however, suspected that in making the Order, even though it was temporarily justified on emergency conditions, I had in mind some long-term transport policy and they feared that the services on these branch lines, even though they ceased because of emergency conditions, would never reappear because of that long-term transport policy.  Consequently, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking for the Government then in office, I gave to the House an <Col N="1373" /> undertaking that wherever a service of trains on a branch line was temporarily suspended under the authority of the Emergency Powers Order, that service would be restored when supply conditions permitted and that there would be no attempt to carry out any long-term modification of railway services under the authority of the Emergency Powers Order.</P>
      <P>The closing of a branch line or the termination of a service of trains over a branch line, was, of course, possible under the permanent railway legislation but only if the procedure prescribed in that legislation was followed.  I had intimated to the Dáil when the legislation was being enacted that it was my intention that where there was opposition to the permanent closing of a branch line or withdrawal of railway services there would be an investigation of the circumstances through an inquiry conducted by the tribunal established under the 1944 Act and that the closing Order would be made only if the tribunal recommended it.  The effect, therefore, of the undertaking I gave to the Dáil, as Minister, on behalf of the Government, in relation to the Emergency Powers Order was that, inevitably, the services would be restored and could only be withdrawn again if the procedure laid down in permanent legislation was followed. In fulfilment of that undertaking given in 1944, these branch lines were restored temporarily in 1946.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that they lost money for the company but they were restored wherever the lines were in working order.  A fuel emergency developed again in 1947.  In the winter of 1946-47 there was the period of prolonged snow and ice which stopped the output of coal in Great Britain and stopped the import of coal to this country. We were again thrown into a transport crisis and again these branch line services were terminated.  Again I gave an undertaking to the Dáil, as <Col N="1374" /> Minister, that the termination of these services under the authority of the Emergency Powers Order would be temporary only and that there would be no permanent closing of these lines or no permanent stopping of these services except under the authority of railways legislation.</P>
      <P>I am not the Minister in office now. I cannot implement here on my own motion the undertaking I gave to the Dáil.  The Emergency Powers Order is still in force.  These branch line services are still suspended.  I cannot now fulfil the undertaking I gave but I can do the next best thing.  I can bring this proposition to the Dáil and ask the Dáil to support it and, if they support it, the effect will be that either Córas Iompair Éireann within 12 months must restore these branch line services or they must go to the tribunal which the Minister proposes to establish and get exemption from the obligation to restore them.</P>
      <P>I do not think that is asking too much from the Minister.  I do not think that it is desirable that the practice should be established of a Minister coming into office ignoring the undertakings of his predecessor or refusing to implement them without coming to the Dáil and giving good reason for his attitude.  The Minister may have a good reason for his attitude but so far as he is my successor in office he is, until he justifies his course of action, in my view, bound by my pledge that these branch line services would be reopened after the emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that it might be unreasonable to ask the present Córas Iompair Éireann Board, which is now going to pass into oblivion, or the new board, which will replace it, to restore these services without further examination. Therefore, I am not asking it. Does any Deputy think it is unreasonable that we should at this stage decide to terminate this Emergency Powers Order at some definite date in the future?  That is all I am asking.  I am asking the Dáil to support an amendment the effect of which will be that within one year from the date on which the new Córas Iompair Éireann Board is established the Emergency Powers Order will cease to have any force. <Col N="1375" /> Unless, therefore, the company has gone to the tribunal within that year and justified before the tribunal a decision not to restore the services and got the approval of the tribunal of its decision not to restore them after one year after the establishment date they must be restored.  I know that the matter of branch lines and the suspension of branch line services has been a controversial point in this House; I know that before the general election many of those candidates who were subsequently elected as Deputies pledged themselves to the restoration of the branch line services.  I am prepared to forget that.  I am coming here solely on my own behalf to secure from the Dáil, in so far as I can do it, the implementation of the pledge I gave as Minister that with the disappearance of emergency conditions, the branch lines would be restored unless those operating the services were prepared to justify before the tribunal and in a manner that would satisfy the Dáil the continuation of the closing of these branch lines or the suspension of these services permanently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on this matter, but at the same time I think Deputy Lemass must have lost his memory when he says that the branch lines which were closed down during the time when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce were closed down on the definite understanding that the services were only temporarily suspended.  I have a very clear recollection of getting from Deputy Lemass and his Department and here in the Dáil on one occasion reasons why three of the branch lines were closed in my constituency. It was made quite clear to me when I raised the question of why the Birr-Roscrea branch line was closed down that it was closed down solely and only because it was not a paying section of Córas Iompair Éireann.</P>

      <P>I think it is a pity that anybody who has so able a tongue as Deputy Lemass should, on any occasion, have to put it in his cheek and I think that Deputy Lemass's tongue was in his cheek when he put down this amendment.  This, to my mind, is a whitewashing amendment and the speech which Deputy Lemass made in introducing it was a whitewashing speech.  Deputy Lemass may feel that by tabling this amendment he creates what he would describe as an embarrassing situation for the Deputies who were vocal on the question of the reopening of the branch lines.  Let me assure Deputy Lemass without more ado, through you, Sir, that there is no degree of embarrassment on our part. I described the case he made on his amendment as whitewashing.  That does not alter the inherent merit or demerit of the amendment proposed and I think that the weight of the argument is in favour of the amendment tabled by Deputy Lemass.  Unless the Minister has some very coercive arguments to put before the House I would certainly feel myself bound to support it, but there is a qualifying circumstance in my mind that on this side of the House we have confidence in the Minister's approach to the question of branch lines and of rail versus road transport in a general sense.  Rightly <Col N="1378" /> or wrongly, many of us believed that there was in the mind of Deputy Lemass when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce an undue bias in favour of road transport.  I do not want to multiply instances or cover the ground which Deputy Davin has covered already, but there is hardly a Deputy in this House who does not know of instances when, during Deputy Lemass's period of office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, alterations were made in freight charges, passenger charges, time schedules and frequencies and every one of them was made&mdash;it may have been purely incidental or coincidental&mdash;to militate against the rail system in favour of road transport. There is hardly a Deputy in this House who, if he expressed his mind honestly, would not agree that that is so.</P>

      <P>Believing that there is not that undue bias against rail transport in the mind of the present Minister, some of us might perhaps be inclined to let that affect our approach to the suggested amendment.  However, I think the strongest argument in favour of the amendment was that an undertaking had been given by the Minister's predecessor, and that that undertaking should be honoured.  I am prepared to use that as the touchstone whereby I will decide my attitude on this matter.  If Deputy Lemass is correct in his statement that he gave an undertaking which he intended to honour in respect of branch lines closed down under an Emergency Powers Order, then I think that undertaking should be honoured.  On the general principle, inasmuch as lines were closed down due to emergency conditions, I think it is a fair argument, and one that can be urged with some force on the Minister, that, when those conditions no longer operate, the Emergency Powers Order closing branch lines should not be allowed to continue <Col N="1379" /> to operate, and that if there is a case for closing branch lines then the other appropriate method should be adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with Deputy C. Lehane that there is a case for going into this matter thoroughly and deciding, on the merits of the case, whether those branch lines are to be closed or not.  I happen to represent a constituency in which two very long stretches of branch lines have been closed.  The Woodenbridge-Shillelagh branch line was referred to. I understand, in regard to it, that under the old Act steps were initiated to have it permanently closed.  As far as I know, it was only in the position of being temporarily closed, but the fact is that for a long time the rails have been completely removed.  The grass is now growing where the track used to be, and the property has deteriorated to a great extent.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Sallins-Tullow branch line, a service is not being operated there except the running of a goods train on fair days.  There, again, the track is deteriorating rapidly. With regard to that branch line, I think the old company did definitely indicate that they contemplated closing it permanently.  It could not, however, have been closed without an inquiry.  I think it would be desirable to have the machinery of an inquiry put into operation at the earliest possible date.  It is rather undesirable to continue the present emergency closing. In present conditions it is hardly justifiable.</P>
      <P>I think that the position of branch lines must be judged in the light of the transport policy of the new nationalised company.  If the plans of the new company are progressive, and if the policy is to co-ordinate rail and road transport by maintaining the maximum mileage on the railways, then we can look forward to those branch lines being reopened.  I think the situation has changed in many ways. We have, of course, increased supplies of fuel for rail transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter which has arisen in recent years is the growing feeling of alarm in regard to the weight of traffic that has been put on the county <Col N="1380" /> roads.  I think it is appalling to see heavy lorries with heavy trailers being put on roads which were never constructed for that purpose.  It would be desirable if a time limit could be put to the emergency and so have the whole matter fully investigated in the light of present circumstances: in the light of the interests of the people in the districts served by these branch lines, and in the light of the interests of the ratepayers who, in the main, contribute to the upkeep of the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment and I suggest that the Minister should accept it.  I think that the new tribunal should be given the opportunity of deciding in the light of railway policy in the future, whether these branch lines should remain closed permanently or be reopened.  Local authorities throughout the country are seriously perturbed by the amount of heavy traffic which ordinarily would be carried by the railways but which is now carried on the roads.  I and many other Deputies said here before that millions of pounds must be spent in making roads to carry the traffic that is being put on them, whether passenger traffic or heavy goods traffic.  If the railways are to get a new start under Government auspices in the future there should be a determination by some tribunal with regard to the continued existence or otherwise of the railways.</P>
      <P>It was understood generally in the country that the Emergency Powers Order was made to cover the period of the emergency only.  I am quite certain that Deputy Davin, as a railway man and with a railways bias, understands that well, and that he would like to see an examination by a tribunal as to whether they should be reopened or not.  It is of the utmost importance that such a determination should be made by a tribunal which would examine all aspects of the question from the national point of view.</P>

      <P>I also wish to support the amendment.  I should like to correct Deputy Lehane and to say that he was totally wrong in thinking that Deputy Lemass has a bias against the railways.  I was present in the House on the day that Deputy Lemass, <Col N="1381" /> as Minister for Industry and Commerce, gave the undertaking referred to when the question of branch lines was raised.  One would imagine, listening to Deputy Davin and some other Deputies, that the decay so far as the railways are concerned only set in during the emergency of 1947.  Nothing at all has been said about what the Fine Gael Party did when they singled the line from Galway to Dublin.  There was no emergency then and no decay.</P>

      <P>I make a slightly different appeal to the Minister.  The branch lines are a problem.  We know now that the whole railway system is a sorry problem.  The appeal I make to the Minister is to get down to the question of the branch lines and to let us have the full significant facts relevant to each branch line.  Where the situation is that it is impracticable, uneconomical and practically insane to run a branch line, let us tell the people of the area <Col N="1382" /> what the real facts are and get rid of this queer kind of cancer once and for all, because there may be a very legitimate case to be made for the complete cessation of any work on certain branch lines.  I appeal to the Minister to get the thing clear once and for all.  I think that this House, even the most loquacious of us on branch lines, will be reasonable in the circumstances where it can be satisfactorily argued and established that it would be reasonable to close down a branch line.  Do not play with the problem.  There is no good holding forth the opening of any branch line in any area unless it is practicable and feasible and part of a necessary national plan.  I appeal to the Minister to get the thing settled once and for all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HarryColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Collins's purpose can be achieved by the adoption of this amendment.  As I understand it, it means that, if Córas Iompair Éireann do not apply to the tribunal within the next 12 months and make their case and give the local people concerned an opportunity of making their case, and if the company do not succeed in making a case to keep these lines closed, they must be reopened at the end of 12 months.  I think that is fair enough.  The Emergency Powers Order under which these lines were closed should, I think, now be abolished.  We abolished Emergency Powers Orders in regard to a number of other matters as soon as that could be done after the war.  I think the time has now arrived when we can say that, in regard to fuel and other things which were the cause of the closing of these lines, the emergency has passed.</P>
      <P>I think there is every reason for adopting the amendment.  It is fair all round, fair to the company and fair to the local people concerned.  It will give the company a chance, if they have a case, to close the lines permanently and also give the local people a chance of having them opened and save the county councils the cost of the road upkeep which we have heard about.  I think that the amendment should appeal to every one of us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words in favour of the amendment. I do not like to see written into the Bill this Emergency Powers (Temporary Provisions) Order, 1944.  After all that was an Order made under the Emergency Powers Act to deal with an emergency position.  As it is written into the Bill now, it would appear as if it were going to get a longer life than it ought to get.  I think all of us would like to see the Emergency Powers Act and all the Orders made under it abolished.  However, Deputy Lemass suggests that that Emergency Powers Order shall cease to have effect after the expiration of 12 months from the establishment date.  I think that that is reasonable.  As a matter of fact, I think that the Emergency Powers Order ought to cease earlier than that.  But, if we were satisfied that it would cease to have effect within 12 months after the passing of this Bill into law, then we would have got somewhere.  There are provisions in the Bill which relate to this whole matter of the closing of branch lines and that position will have to be faced up to when the Bill becomes law.  For that reason, I support the amendment on the general principle that I should like to see the end of this Emergency Powers Order.  Certainly, I should like to see the end of it inasmuch as it was an Order made in 1944 to deal with an emergency situation then existing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of Deputy Lemass's amendment apparently is to secure that within 12 months a number of branch lines will have to be reopened unless the company goes to the tribunal and gets an order to the contrary. If that is the purpose of the amendment, it does not achieve it. There has been a lot of pother about all this.  The fact of the matter is that this Emergency Powers Order will cease to have any practical effect as from the establishment date, as Section 9 of the 1933 Act will not apply and, under Section 56 of this Bill, the company cannot discontinue permanently lines or services closed down temporarily.  They must go to the tribunal.  Deputy Colley said this amendment should be accepted because it would be fair to the company and <Col N="1384" /> to the users of the particular branch lines.  I am opposing the amendment because I do not think it would be fair to either one or the other to insist that a decision on this matter should be taken within 12 months.  It is quite conceivable that, if this matter were pushed and the tribunal had to make an order within 12 months, that might be an order against the interests of the users.</P>
      <P>So far as Deputies are concerned about the Emergency Powers Order, that Order ceases to have any practical effect whatever as from the establishment date.  The position then is that the lines that are now temporarily closed cannot be kept closed permanently by the company.  It must go to the tribunal.  I think it is only right that this new board, having regard to all the problems with which they will be faced and to the fact that they will have to give serious consideration to every aspect of our national transport system and to the many points arising out of the Milne Report, should be given a reasonable time.  I think it would be very undesirable from every point of view and wholly unreasonable that we should fix a limit of 12 months. Remember, there is no question whatever of keeping these branch lines, which were closed down temporarily, closed permanently.  That cannot be done under Section 56 of this Bill.  The board must go to the tribunal.  I object to their being tied in this unreasonable fashion.  I am as concerned about branch lines as is every other Deputy.  As has been said by some other member of the House, my views on rail and road transport are pretty well known.  If this matter is to be looked at in an intelligent way and if the board and its officers are to be given a reasonable opportunity of examining the whole transport situation, surely Deputies do not want to have this matter dealt with piecemeal. I do not believe they do.  I think the aim of all of us is to get, if we can, a properly co-ordinated national transport service.  In my opinion it would not be fair either to the users or the would-be users, if there are any, or to the board to limit it in this way in regard to branch lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1385" /> I want to make these points clear. The Emergency Powers Order will cease to have any practical effect as and from the establishment date; secondly, the board even if it so wished &mdash;and, so far as I know, I doubt if there will be any desire on the part of the board&mdash;permanently to keep closed these branch lines which were closed down temporarily for certain reasons, cannot do it.  Under Section 56 of this Bill they must go to the tribunal. It may be said, of course, that there is no obligation on them to go this year or next year.  I would ask Deputies to take a reasonable approach to this matter.  We are now in process of establishing here a national transport board to carry out the provisions of the national transport Bill.  Surely, any board so established as a national board, appointed by the Government, responsible to the Government and, through the Government, to this House because this board will be responsible to this House to a much greater extent than any board existing in the State at the moment, should be given a reasonable opportunity of examining the problem of the branch lines.  Deputies should not forget that this board will be responsible to this House.  It is only reasonable that they should be given an opportunity of examining the situation in relation to the branch lines and other matters.  Branch lines do not stand entirely on their own.  They are not apart from the whole of the transport problem.</P>
    <P>I have no desire to go back on the undertaking which my predecessor Deputy Lemass gave, but I think if the Deputy, or any other Deputy, were standing to-night where I am standing now, in the new circumstances in which this Bill is passing through the House, he too, would think that this amendment was unreasonable.  I do not think it will have the effect which the Deputy apparently thinks it will have.  May I say also, in regard to a number of speeches that have been made and a great many amendments that have been moved, we ought to give this board whatever chance we can to succeed? We ought not continually to hamper the company.  We ought not to look at it with suspicion.  We ought not to talk about it in such fashion as it has been <Col N="1386" /> talked about.  We ought not to put in all the safeguards as if it were some foreign body with no connection or relation either with the Government or the House.  I am perfectly satisfied that Deputies will be satisfied that under the Bill, as it will finally emerge from this House, if there is any attempt to delay approach to the tribunal beyond a reasonable period on this particular matter, they will now have machinery enabling them to raise the question here.</P>
    <P>Deputies will remember that I brought in an amendment, in response to Deputy C. Lehane, to enable members of the House to raise matters other than the ordinary day-to-day administration.  If Deputies wish on any future occasion to raise the question of the closing down of the branch lines and if they want to make the case that the board is unreasonably delaying the reopening of these lines or the submission of their case to the tribunal, so far as I am concerned I shall facilitate Deputies in raising that matter and having it debated and ventilated here.  I want again to emphasise the point that the Emergency Powers Order for all practical purposes disappears as from the establishment date and the board cannot permanently discontinue these services.  Under Section 56 they must go to the tribunal. To those Deputies who are concerned about this I stress again the point that it may be against the interests of those who are anxious to see the branch lines reopened to rush this matter in this particular way.</P>

I understood him to say that as from the establishment date the Emergency Powers Order would cease to have practical effect.  I find it difficult then to see how the amendment came on the Order Paper at all.  Is the Minister satisfied that he can honour the undertaking given by his predecessor by taking the course he is adopting?  If the Minister is satisfied on that point, he will satisfy me.</P>

The position, as I understand it, does not disclose any desire as far as I am concerned not to have this matter resolved within a reasonable period.  May I repeat once more that, because of the fact that Section 9 of the 1933 Act will not operate on the board, the Emergency Powers Order will cease to have any practical effect as from the establishment date?  The other point is that the company cannot permanently keep closed the lines which were closed temporarily for certain reasons.  Even if they wish to do that, they cannot do it.  They must go to the tribunal.  I think that meets the points raised.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;I am desired by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to refer to your recent representations regarding the Timoleague-Courtmacsherry branch railway line.  An Act of the Oireachtas would appear to be necessary to empower Córas Iompair Éireann to operate any engine, carriage and vehicle on this branch railway line with a greater axle load than 8 tons or at a speed in excess of 25 miles per hour.  Furthermore, the Minister has been informed by the company that a heavier axle load would involve full investigation into the strength of the track, bridges and other structures and would probably necessitate expenditure on track improvements and on strengthening or renewing bridges.</P>

Obviously, if that purpose were to be secured the word &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 56 would have to be substituted by a reference to one or two years or whatever period was considered desirable.</P>
      <P>I think, however, that the Minister has put the matter to the Dáil altogether from the side of the board.  The House should consider this question from the point of view of the areas served by these branch lines.  These branch line services were stopped, because of a shortage of coal, by an Emergency Powers Order.  If the services had been suspended under permanent legislation the commercial and other interests in each locality would have had an opportunity of making representations against the stoppage of the services or in favour of their reopening. I think that five years after the war has ended is far too long a period to keep restrictions of that kind in force through an Emergency Powers Order.  The effect of the proposal I am making is that, instead of taking this omnibus closure of a number of branch lines&mdash;taken because of emergency conditions and maintained without explanation in present circumstances&mdash;each branch line that the company desires to keep closed should be the subject of a reference to the tribunal before which the interested parties in the area can come and make their case.  The clear implication in the Minister's reluctance to adopt the suggestion is that none of these branch lines is going to be reopened.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that this argument is reasonable? If the intention is that the closure of these branch lines should not be permanent except in a few cases, then it is not unreasonable to ask the board, within a year of its establishment, to go to the tribunal <Col N="1390" /> and justify its decision in these few cases and get approval on their decision.</P>

      <P>When the fuel crisis passed the services should have been resumed and the company should have been permitted to have proceeded with the applications it was making for Orders to suspend services upon certain of these lines.  We know the company had proposed to apply for Orders for the permanent closure of the following branch lines:&mdash;Birdhill and Killaloe, Crossdoney and Killeshandra, Goold's Cross and Cashel, Schull and Skibbereen, Tralee and Dingle, Woodenbridge and Shillelagh. They had intended to go with applications to the Minister under the other Act for the permanent closure of these lines.</P>

      <P>Oh, no, I am not suggesting that.  What I am suggesting is that if the Emergency Powers Order had been repealed in 1948 or 1949 the company would have proceeded with these applications under the 1933 Act.  That would have meant reference to the tribunal and ample opportunity to the parties interested in each case to make whatever representations they could against the closure of these lines.  It is not unreasonable to expect the new board, within a year of its establishment, <Col N="1391" /> either to reopen these lines or to make a case for their abandonment within that period.  If the Minister could make a good case for it&mdash;while I would not be convinced &mdash; I would agree to lengthen the period but I must say that the position in the Bill is much too unsatisfactory.  With the word &ldquo;permanently&rdquo; included in the sub-section the section might conceivably operate to keep these lines closed under the authority of an Emergency Powers Order for 20 years.</P>

    <P>Amendment negatived.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 36:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 35, line 18, to add after &ldquo;request&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including in relation to any particular locality specified in such request, the adequacy of the facilities provided by the board to meet the reasonable needs of the public, agriculture, commerce, and industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes that the tribunal which is to be established by this Bill shall in addition to the functions conferred upon it in Part 8&mdash;that is to say, the functions relating to the closing of branch lines&mdash;will also, when requested by the Minister, advise him on matters relating to transport services specified in his request.  It seems to me that the sub-section is incomplete, that if the tribunal is going to have any sort of general supervisory powers over transport services, or any obligation to advise the Minister concerning transport services, there should be either a reference to the obligations of the company under Section 14 or some particularisation of the matters upon which the tribunal should advise the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, I think the Minister would be well advised to give to this tribunal the obligation of dealing with complaints that services provided by the company are inadequate.  If the Minister gets that type of complaint, as the Bill stands, he can do nothing about it except refer it to the board and the <Col N="1395" /> board may or may not pay attention to it.  Assuming that the complaint is <i>bona fide</i>, that it represents a genuine demand in the locality concerned, and that that demand is backed by an agitation to ensure the exercise of political pressure upon somebody to get the desired service provided, is it not in the Minister's interest as well as in the general interest that he should have power to do something more about it than merely pass it on to the board?</P>
    <P>I suggest that as this tribunal is going to have advisory functions it should have a particular advisory function in relation to requests from the Minister to report upon the adequacy of the service provided, whether by road, rail or canal, to meet the reasonable needs of the public in any locality.  If the Minister does not like that phraseology, I would be quite satisfied if he inserts additional words to give him power to request the tribunal to report on the manner in which the board was meeting its obligations under Section 14.</P>
    <P>If it is not intended that the tribunal should deal with specific matters of that kind, the adequacy of the facilities provided and the suitability of the arrangements made to meet the convenience of trade or industry in a locality, I am not clear as to what it should report on.  It seems to me that is the only matter that the Minister will, as a public representative, be directly concerned in. Any other matters that may possibly be referred to the tribunal would relate more definitely to the administration of the company and should be exclusively the concern of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not necessary.  The sub-section says that the Minister may refer any matter concerning transport services to the tribunal.  That obviously will include adequate facilities, so therefore this matter is really covered and there is no necessity for the amendment.  I think the Deputy will admit that.  Any matter regarding transport services may be referred by the Minister.</P>

    <P>I feel that the House should give favourable consideration to the claim of common stockholders to be put more or less on an equal footing with owners of other stock.  It does seem unjust to write down their stock to 80 and I venture to rectify this apparent <Col N="1397" /> injustice.  I think the Minister will be sympathetic to this proposal, although I have not very great hopes in view of his statement on the Committee Stage.  The Minister then stated that he had given this matter very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I think it necessary to remark that holders of common stock, particularly those who have held that stock over a long period, had their property written down to 10 per cent. in 1933 and under this measure it is being further reduced.  Many of the people who hold those investments are comparatively poor; in some cases they are very poor people.  There would seem to be a reasonable case for the Minister giving them the small concession asked for in the amendment.</P>

      <P>I know they are, but I do not think there is any good ground for it.  Under the terms of the Bill, the stockholders are being guaranteed practically 2½ per cent. with the eventual redemption of their stock within a reasonable period.  Having regard to the position in which we found this company and to what was likely to happen to the stockholders and their stock, if there is one section of the community who ought to be extremely thankful that this company is being taken over and that this Bill is going through Dáil Éireann, it is these stockholders. It is admitted by most of the stockholders&mdash;the trouble is that there is always a small minority who are vocal, although they are not so vocal this year as last year&mdash;that the terms set down here are not merely just but border almost on being generous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Norton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £198,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for Old Age Pensions and Pensions to Blind Persons (Old Age Pensions Acts, 1908 to 1948); for Supplements (No. 22 of 1946); and for certain Grants.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is rendered necessary because of the fact that we have to make provision for paying pensions to greater number of old age pensioners than was originally anticipated.  The original provision in the Estimates was based upon a figure of 154,300 as an average figure throughout the year, but that number of old age pensioners increased during the year and we find that, in June last, it was necessary to provide for 155,923 old age pensioners.  That number increased in September to 158,434 and by December it had jumped to 159,866.  The latest statistical information available shows that the number of persons of 70 years and over is likely to increase for the next few years, and, for the financial year which commences on the 1st April next, it will be necessary to make provision for an even larger number of old age pensions than the maximum covered by the normal Estimate and by the Supplementary Estimate this year.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £60,200 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for certain Grants-in-Aid of the National Health Insurance Fund and for other payments under the National Health Insurance Acts, 1911 to 1948, and the Supplies and Services (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1946 (No. 22 of 1946).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Practically all this money, £60,000 of it, is necessary to meet the increased Exchequer grants which fall to be made by the Exchequer in respect of its contribution towards actual benefits and the administration of the National Health Insurance Acts.  The Exchequer pays a contribution of two-ninths of the actual amount spent on benefits and administration.  This year, the amount of money spent on benefits and administration was higher than in the previous year.  It was higher in respect of sickness, disablement and maternity benefit, and the more money spent by the National Health Insurance Society under these heads, the greater is the State contribution towards the benefits thus paid, and, if administration costs increase, the State is also liable to pay the increased amount of two-ninths of the costs of administration.  In this particular year, <Col N="1400" /> 1949, sickness, disablement and maternity benefits were higher and thus more costly than in 1948, and expenditure on dental, optical and hospital benefits were also higher.  Similarly, administration costs were higher, inasmuch as the society had to meet increased charges, due to generally increased costs, and also because of the fact that the remuneration of the staff of the National Health Insurance Society was increased during the year. A sum of £60,000 of the £60,200 in the Supplementary Estimate is required to meet increased charges under the headings to which I have adverted, and the remaining £200 is required in respect of increased rail and bus fares and increased costs of medical examination.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is rendered necessary by the fact that it was necessary to recruit and employ increased staff in the operation and general administration of the Social Welfare Act of 1948 and the payment of overtime to staffs in consequence of the increased work which flowed from that Act.  In addition, during the past year, the remuneration of clerks of old age pension committees was increased and it becomes necessary to meet that charge in this Supplementary Estimate.  Likewise during the year, the field staff of the Department were engaged in additional travelling duties necessitated by the increased volume of work which flowed from the 1948 Social Welfare Act.  All these increased activities, together with increased postal charges, which reflected the expanding work of the Department, represent the total sum required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Everett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £109,700 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs already approved by the Dáil for the financial year ending 31st March, 1950, amounts to £5,117,800. Owing to causes which could not have been foreseen, this provision will be insufficient, and an additional sum of £109,700 will be required to meet expenditure up to the end of the financial year.</P>
      <P>The gross extra expenditure on the sub-heads for which the original provision is insufficient is estimated at £169,040.  Against this, however, receipts from appropriations-in-aid will be higher by £28,840 than was estimated and savings amounting to £30,500 will be available from other sub-heads, leaving a net sum of £109,700 to be provided. Against this increased expenditure, I should tell the House that I estimate that additional revenue of £120,000, approximately, will be secured.</P>
      <P>The cause of the increased expenditure are briefly as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Sub-head BB: Increase&mdash;£4,000.  This is due to the additional cost of subscriptions to the International Postal and Telecommunication Unions consequent upon devaluation, and to increased cost of representation at meetings of these unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-head E (1): Increase&mdash;£53,500. Of this sum £43,000 is due to increased payments to the Railway Clearing House in respect of parcels posted in this country for delivery in Great Britain, the volume of which during 1949 was much higher than anticipated. The balance of £10,500 is due to increased payments to the railway companies for the carriage of internal parcel mails, the traffic in which has been higher than anticipated, <Col N="1402" /> and to additional payments to Córas Iompair Éireann for the conveyance of letter mails on account of increased traffic and additional services.</P>
    <P>Subhead E (5): Increase&mdash;£28,400.  Of this amount £25,000 is due to increased payments for the conveyance of air mails, as a result of devaluation, particularly in respect of air mails conveyed to the United States.  The balance of £3,400 is in respect of increased traffic and extension of services.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K: Increase&mdash;£50,000.  Due to increased purchases of stores resulting from the expansion of the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Sub-head N (1): Increase&mdash;£23,140. Of this sum, £20,000 is required to meet the cost of increases in certain pensions and allowances arising from the pensions increase legislation.  The balance is due to greater expenditure on marriage gratuities and death gratuities.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q (2): Increase&mdash;£10,000. This is due to payments in respect of contracts for which provision was made in 1948-49 but for which claims have only been made in the current year. These are offset by savings on construction works.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister would have told us under subhead K what progress he was making in carrying out the plans for telephone development and how much money was being spent, but it may be as well for us to wait for the main Estimate, which I suppose will be coming very soon.  I think he should give us some indication of how he is getting on with telephone development.  Considerable complaints were made at one time, especially in the Dublin area, where telephones were being installed and the lines and equipment were being put in and people were left with telephones and could not use them, although they paid their accounts.</P>
      <P>Some other matters could be raised on this Estimate, but on the whole I think it is better to leave them over until the general Estimate is before us.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £8,670 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926), including Public Concerts.</P>
      <P>When presenting the Estimate for Wireless Broadcasting for the current financial year to the Dáil in July last, I mentioned that another source of international news had been made available to the news section of the broadcasting service.  The current year's contract for the additional news service was entered into after the main Estimate had been approved and provision was not, therefore, made for it. As sufficient savings will not be available on sub-head B to cover the fee to the additional news agency and the cost of handling the extra material now reaching the news-room, an extra £2,600 will be required under sub-head B during the present financial year.</P>
      <P>An additional £8,165 is required under sub-head F.  Of this amount, £1,515 is in respect of studio equipment which was provided for in the Estimate for 1948-49 but which was not delivered or paid for until this year, and £4,940 is in respect of accounts from the contractor for the short-wave station which should normally have been paid last year but were not because the contractor did not send in his bills in time.</P>
      <P>The remaining £1,710 required under sub-head F represents the cost of completing the short-wave station and reerecting aerials which were taken down and put into store when it was decided to suspend work on this station.  The only short-wave provision in the Vote for the current year is a small sum for maintenance cost and it is therefore necessary to provide by Supplementary Vote for these outstanding bills for equipment and for completing the station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transmitter and aerial system for North America have now been completed, but extensive engineering tests over the air will be needed.  I hope to have more information available on <Col N="1404" /> this subject by the time the main Estimate for the coming year is ready for presentation.</P>
    <P>The gross total needed for the items specified above is £10,765, but it is estimated that there will be savings amounting to £2,095 under sub-head A. These savings are due mainly to vacancies being unfilled for portion of the year.</P>
    <P>The net additional sum now required is, therefore, £8,670.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLittle" hpid="Mr. Little Mr. Little">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Little</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could give us some idea of his intentions with regard to the use of the short-wave station.  Some little time ago there was a reference in one of the papers to something the Minister had said.  He seemed to cast doubt on going ahead with the short-wave station, on the grounds that other inventions had come along, that the use of the short-wave was not so great and the benefits were not as effective as we might have anticipated.  In view of the fact that other countries are not shutting down their short-wave stations and are, if anything, developing them for the purpose of national emergencies &mdash;which was the first and greatest reason for the setting up of the station in Ireland&mdash;I would like to know what the Minister's intentions are with regard to the development of the short-wave station, not merely the mast to America but the other masts which are also in store.  He has not told us whether these have been put up or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all pleased with the way in which the news in Irish is sometimes presented to the public. Sometimes, I am afraid that one at least of the announcers is not very distinct. It is all important that those who are in charge of giving out news in the Irish language should be very careful to be as distinct and as clear as possible.  I know of nothing more likely to make the Irish language unpopular than presenting news in Irish incoherently and without proper punctuation. It is especially important for students of the language.  I would like the Minister to turn his attention to that feature of broadcasting news in Irish.</P>
      <P>I know, of course, that an attempt is being made to cater for all dialects in the Irish language.  That is as it should be but, no matter what dialect is used, it should be distinct and clear so that students of the Irish language would derive real benefit from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJosephTimoney" hpid="Mr. Timoney Mr. Timoney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timoney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to endorse what Deputy Kissane has said as regards elocution in the matter of announcing Irish news.  I do not think it would be proper to go into personalities here but I think the Deputy will agree with me that there is one announcer who is particularly distinct and clear in the manner in which he speaks. He is very easy to follow.  I think perhaps the real trouble is the absence of some standardisation.  It would be desirable that there should be an official standard and that local idioms would be avoided as much as possible. There was an article on that very point in a recent issue of <i>India.</i>  I thought it dealt with the question very well.  It is a matter of importance that I would like the Minister to bring to the notice of the authorities.  The first point is that of elocution; the second, the matter of standardisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think this is a proper occasion upon <Col N="1406" /> which to congratulate the Minister on having extended the time for the Irish news, within the past few months, from ten to 15 minutes.  It now gets 15 minutes at night.  It is only right that the Minister should be congratulated on having arranged that.  As I have said, and as Deputy Kissane has said, something should be done about elocution and standardisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Kissane should complain about the announcers in Irish because I have received very complimentary messages from native Irish speakers in regard to the selection each week of announcers in different dialects, which was done for the purpose of catering for each Irish-speaking area.  It may be a bit awkward for Deputy Kissane, being a Kerryman, not understanding the dialect of a Donegal announcer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonKissane" hpid="Mr. Kissane Mr. Kissane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a native Irish speaker but I give every support I possibly can to the development of the Irish language.  I gave a promise last year that I would extend the time by five minutes.  My only regret is that we are unable to give half an hour to news in Irish.  I hope the time will come when a much longer period will be given to the news in Irish for the benefit of native speakers and students of the Irish language.  I am sure Deputy Kissane appreciates the difficulties of getting in the news in Irish and English when you are limited to a few hours.  When we have the second wave-length, I hope we will be able to devote a much longer time to Irish in the day-time, even for school children, and that the Irish language will have longer time than a foreign language. In my young days I made my contribution to the promotion of the language, when we had the O'Growney books.  Unfortunately, I am not able to speak the Irish language but I supported the Irish language in the days when it was not popular to do so.  If Deputy Kissane or any other Deputy can show me how we can improve the position of the Irish language, I am only too anxious, with their co-operation and help, to promote the language in any way I can and to see that <Col N="1407" /> there will be no complaints as regards the Irish broadcasting station not helping and developing the Irish language by every means in its power.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy Little's complaint in connection with the short-wave, I have pointed out to him that our engineers are already testing the station.  I will be in a position, when I am introducing my Estimate, to give full information to the House in regard to the entire position of the short-wave station.</P>

A number of members of the Dublin Metropolitan Garda <Col N="1408" /> have complained that they are very dissatisfied with the new dress uniform, and have asked me to raise the question with the Minister.  I am informed that the members of the force were to be asked their opinion about it, and quite a considerable volume of opinion among the men was against this type of uniform.  We all have our own views upon it and to my mind, at any rate, it is an extraordinary looking affair. On behalf of those individuals, and there is a considerable number of them, I would ask the Minister whether he intends going ahead with this new issue of uniforms.  They have wonderful buttons down the back and I understand there are no suitable pockets, while the length of the tunic itself is not a bit nice looking.  I would ask the Minister whether or not any attention was given to the complaints of the Dublin Metropolitan Garda, and if there is a considerable number of men in the force who are dissatisfied with it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask if the Minister is satisfied with the number of Gardaí in the city.  I know that not so long ago, a couple of years before I left office, I had a deputation from Dublin Corporation, which included members of the House, and they pointed out that Dublin City was completely under-policed.  At the time I could not do very much but I know that a certain percentage of recruits were allocated to the city.  Anybody who looks around the city can see quite plainly, whatever may be said about other parts of the country, that the city is not over-policed and the general opinion is that it is under-policed. There was in my time, and I am sure there is in the Minister's time, dissatisfaction among the Gardaí about the onerous work they have to do due to the under-policing of the city.  It could not have improved very much since my time as there has been no recruiting since then and only a percentage of the recruits who came in in my time were allocated to Dublin.  Has the Minister anything to say on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Boland, in referring to the question of Dublin being under-policed at the <Col N="1409" /> moment is probably under a slight misapprehension.  There are areas, undoubtedly, where for the convenience of the public there ought to be a Garda station and that situation has lasted a very long time.  One of the areas I have in mind is the East Wall and North Wall area, in my own constituency, which is a very large self-contained unit.  For the convenience of the public in that area a station is necessary.  While that is so&mdash;and that, I think, could be arranged even within the strength of the Gardaí at the moment&mdash;there has been in the past couple of years a great improvement in the efficiency of the Garda Síochána in Dublin due to new methods, particularly the wireless patrol cars.  I think the feeling of the citizens of Dublin is that that efficiency leaves the city, from the point of view of policing, better than ever it was.  That is just a normal natural development in the use of technical and scientific aids in the detection of crime and I think it is no harm to avail of the opportunity of this Vote to mention that.</P>
      <P>There is undoubtedly in this city a lessening of crime and that lessening of crime may be due to many things.  The general public feel that, to some extent, it is contributed to by the efficiency of the Dublin Gardaí as a whole.</P>
      <P>Deputy McQuillan has referred to uniforms.  This matter has already been mentioned in the House from another angle.  I would repeat something that has been asked before, and that is that the Dublin Gardaí be provided with a more suitable type of uniform for summer wear.  The uniform that they are wearing is a traditional one&mdash;the helmet and all that.  It is a traditional form of uniform, hardly suitable to modern ideas.  I would suggest to the Minister that he ought to take the earliest opportunity of providing the very fine force of Gardaí that we have in Dublin City with a uniform that will enable them to be smart and at the same time to be comfortably attired during the warm spells, even if they are short spells, during the year.</P>
      <P>Another matter that, I think, might be mentioned is the question of more suitable barrack accommodation.</P>

      <P>Then I will have to leave the question of barracks.  On the sub-head which deals with salaries, I possibly could make this suggestion to the Minister, that there are within the force, not only in Dublin, but all over the country, some excellent Gardaí who are within a few years of retiring. Those men have contributed more than one can understand to the building up and development of the force over the years.  I think it would be a gracious thing, and a proper thing if the Minister were to arrange, by Order or otherwise, that there would be a large number of promotions to the rank of sergeant from the rank of Garda within the force.</P>

      <P>No, Sir.  With all respect, it is my submission that while the regulations are there saying that promotions can take effect in particular ways, the Commissioner is bound to operate them in regard to the percentage of sergeants that there may be to Guards.  I say that the Minister has a big responsibility, and that he may alter regulations to provide for an increased number of promotions.  However, <Col N="1411" /> I am only availing of this opportunity to make the suggestion to the Minister that he might consider this matter of those Gardaí who have given very long service, almost 30 years, in the rank of Garda, to the nation.</P>
      <P>On many occasions in the past the Gardaí have suffered from reductions in pay.  There have been clamours from time to time for a reduction in the Garda Síochána Vote.  Now, there is no tendency, as far as I can see in any part of the House, to demand any reduction in the amount that should be paid in salaries to the Garda Síochána.  I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect of it so that these men, many of them right through the country, might in the last few years of their service receive the promotion which would be indicative of the thanks of the general public for service which they have very well given over a very long period.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate has to be looked at from two points of view.  The proposal is to saddle the taxpayer with an additional burden of £323,000 and, naturally, we who represent the taxpayer, will have to look at it from this point of view and examine it, having regard to the fact that it is only one of a number of Supplementary Estimates not budgeted last May but amounting in all to £1,250,000 roughly which we are being asked to pass to-night.  We must also, of course, look at it from the point of view of the members of the Garda Síochána; but, from whatever point of view we look at it, we must be astonished that the Minister for Justice should have the hardihood to introduce it into this House, because three years ago, about this time in the year 1947, the Minister was then on this side of the House and was bewailing the enormous burden which the taxpayers of this country were carrying. Since 1948 the amount extorted from the taxpayers of this country has increased by almost 15 per cent., and the Minister brings in a Bill to-night to increase it by a further £323,000.  I think that the taxpayers have a right to hear from the Minister his justification for piling taxation higher and for extracting more money from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the other hand, I think the Gardaí have an equal cause of complaint, because the Minister has not kept his pledge to the members of the Garda Síochána any more than he has kept his pledge to the taxpayer. Three years ago he promised to reduce taxation and to increase the pay of the Garda substantially.  We were told by the present Minister for Finance that, according to his calculation, since the cose-of-living index figure had gone up from 175 in September, 1939, to 310 in September, 1947, the pay of the Garda Síochána ought to be increased proportionately, that it ought almost to have been doubled.  That, of course, was when the Minister was in Opposition. I contend that the revision of the Garda pay cannot be regarded as satisfactory. I am basing that case upon the argument used by the present Minister for Justice when sitting on the Opposition Benches.  At that time he was telling the Garda that their pay ought to be almost doubled and he certainly led them to believe that, if he became Minister for Justice, he would take steps to see that that was done.</P>

      <P>I am not going to remind the Garda of their sorry experience in this matter, of the long, protracted negotiations they had before they were able to wring from the Minister the £323,000 which they are getting now.  I am not going to remind them that they asked that this increase should be ante-dated and made payable from the date on which the Government took office.  Of course we know they are not going to get that.  The Minister is full of soft words and he has honeyed lips.  He is not a gentleman who is going to speak plainly and bluntly to any deputation which approaches him.  When Deputy Byrne raises this matter in the House, the Minister is full of plamás, he is going to do the best he can to see that they get justice, that his pledges to the Garda will be fulfilled or he will know the reason why.  But, when it comes down to brass tacks, there is no person more subservient to the Minister for Finance than the Minister for Justice <Col N="1413" /> and he fobs the Garda off with this £323,000 instead of doubling their pay and allowances as he promised to do in 1947.  Of course, we do not expect anything more from the Minister in his present company.  He is just one of a collection of individuals who made some sort of promise to the taxpayers.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee says that this Parliament should not vote this sum.  He has made the case that this Parliament should not pass it, and on what grounds?  He made a case that would not be made by any member of any Parliament in the world and I was surprised because Deputy MacEntee is decent in many ways.  The charge is that we have not sufficient Gárdaí in the City of Dublin. We have more Gardaí in the City of Dublin than we ever had in the history of this country.  I am not satisfied that that is necessary.  Might I avail of the opportunity to say that I have a commission set up to inquire into the whole question of the policing of the country?  I think that we can do it at much less than the present cost. It may be that we shall have to take technical advice and make use of all the modern equipment that we should have.</P>
      <P>Deputy MacEntee and another Deputy raised a point about uniforms. The Garda Síochána have what is called the Representative Body for 16 years which makes representations to the Minister for Justice and that is the means by which they approach the Minister. They come in and they make their case.  I am quite satisfied they make it <i>bona fide.</i>  I listen to them and I report to the Government.  In this particular matter the Government has directed me to take the line that the whole question of the policing of the State must be examined.</P>
      <P>The sum asked for here is all that is required to pay the Garda in this particular year.  I ask the House to vote that sum.  If the House does so without any comment, I can assure the House it is doing a good day's work.  The Gardaí have done their work very well. I have great faith in them.  Theirs is a difficult task and, difficult as their task is, they are open to attack right, left and centre.  Yet, they do their duty faithfully and well in the interests of the nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Dr. Browne)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £447,770 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Health, and certain Services administered by that Office, including Grants to Local Authorities, miscellaneous Grants and a Grant-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
      <P>The original Estimate for the Department of Health was £2,020,420.  It is now expected that net expenditure in the year will amount to £2,468,190, allowance being made for an increase in the estimated Appropriations-in-Aid of £3,000.  It is, therefore, necessary to seek a Supplementary Vote of £447,770.  The sub-heads under which this Vote will be accounted for are: sub-head E&mdash;expenses in connection with international congresses etc.&mdash; additional sum required, £1,770; sub-head H&mdash;grants to health authorities&mdash; additional sum required, £442,000; sub-head J&mdash;national blood transfusion service, Grant-in-Aid&mdash;additional sum required, £7,000.</P>
      <P>The main increase arises under sub-head H, grants to health authorities. The additional money is required to meet the arrears of grants payable under this sub-head in respect of the year 1948-49 and payments in excess of the figures on which the original Estimate was framed, which fall to be made in the current year.  As has been explained to the House on previous occasions, grants are paid under this sub-head to recoup each health authority up to a certain limit the amount by which the running expenses on its health services in each financial year after 1947-48 exceeds the local expenditure on those services in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The calculations on which the provision in the original Estimate was based were made by the health authorities and my Department before the commencement of the current financial year and it is not surprising that the overhaul and expansion of the health services, which is being carried out as <Col N="1417" /> rapidly as possible, has resulted in the need for additional provision.  To a great extent the rapid expansion and improvement of the tuberculosis services is responsible for increasing the original Estimate of the cost of the service during the current financial year by approximately £250,000, while almost a further £140,000 of the additional sum now sought is required to pay to health authorities arrears in respect of expenditure on the tuberculosis services in the year 1948-49.  Altogether 1,136 new beds have been provided for tuberculosis patients since 1st April, 1949.  This naturally adds considerably to the total cost of the maintenance and treatment of patients under this service.  The X-ray service has also been extended to provide free examinations for patients of private practitioners.</P>
    <P>A number of tuberculosis medical officers were sent on study courses abroad and publicity was given in newspapers circulating in each health authority's area to the facilities available under the tuberculosis service. The cost of the service was increased to a lesser extent by the grant of increases in remuneration to officers and employees and the provision of improved conditions of employment, including adjustment of working hours and expenditure on repair work which had been suspended or reduced while materials were scarce.  I am quite satisfied that this increased expenditure on tuberculosis was necessary.  It will pay dividends in the future by reducing the loss caused by this disease to the economic potential of the country.  If any money is well spent, this is, and I do not think the House will begrudge it.</P>
    <P>There was also an increase in the cost of the public assistance services, caused mainly by an improvement in the working conditions of officers and employees.  The cost of maintenance allowance for persons with tuberculosis, or other infectious diseases, was also higher than at first expected. These increases were to some extent balanced by savings on other services.</P>
    <P>Of the £1,770 additional provision sought under sub-head E, expenses in connection with international congresses, <Col N="1418" /> etc., £1,720 is required to meet a supplementary contribution which it was necessary to make to the Working Capital Fund of the World Health Organisation.  This is an organisation many members of which are unable to pay their annual contributions before the second or third quarter of each year because of the different fiscal years and legislative processes.  The executive board of the organisation decided in 1948 to institute a Working Capital Fund of 1,650,000 dollars which would be used to cover expenses incurred in advance of the receipt of the bulk of annual subscriptions.  In practice, this has been found to be inadequate and at the Second World Health Assembly, which was held in Rome last year and at which this country was represented, the fund was increased to 4,000,000 dollars for the year 1950.  Certain other credits which were available to the organisation were merged in the fund and this had the effect of reducing to approximately 1,449,000 dollars the supplemental sum which member countries were required to contribute to the increased Working Capital Fund for this year.  In common with other member countries of the organisation, Ireland's share of this sum, 4,949 dollars, was calculated on the basis of a special scale which had been agreed upon during the First World Assembly and which fixed the contribution of this country at a relatively satisfactory level.  The balance of £50 required under this sub-head is needed to meet the expenses of the delegate who attended the meeting of the Second Mental Health Assembly held at Geneva in August, 1949.  The actual expenses of the delegate amounted to £70 but, as there is a saving of £20 from the provision made for the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the amount required is reduced to £50.  No provision was or could reasonably have been made in the original Estimate for these two items of the sub-head.</P>
    <P>As regards the additional provision required under sub-head J, National Blood Transfusion Service, Grant-in-Aid, it will be recalled that in my speech on the Estimate for my Department for the year 1949-50 I referred to the setting up of the National Blood <Col N="1419" /> Transfusion Association.  This association, which is a company limited by guarantees, was established for the purpose of organising a national blood transfusion service and it is expected it will be in a position to start operations about a month hence.  The Grant-in-Aid of the association, amounting to £18,000, was included in my Department's Vote for the current year.  This sum included provisions for alterations and repairs to buildings, and £5,710 for equipment.  On the basis of revised estimates of expenditure, which have been received from the association and which I am satisfied have been estimated as conservatively as possible, the sum needed for alterations and repairs to buildings requires to be increased by £7,780 and that for equipment by £641.  On the other hand, the original provision of £7,750 for ordinary revenue expenditure has been reduced by £1,421.  This leaves the net total increase now required in the Grant-in-Aid at £7,000.</P>

      <P>This must be an enlightening Supplementary Estimate to the Deputies and the people who have been misled by the propaganda so zealously conducted by the Minister for Health that the steps to improve our national health service were initiated by him.  The Estimate is for a very considerable sum, £447,770.  Of that £447,000 odd, no less than £442,000 arises under an Act, the Health Services (Financial Provisions) Act, 1947, passed before ever the present Minister came into this House.  That was an Act passed because it was realised that, in order to give effect to the plans which the then Government had prepared for the development of our health services, a considerable readjustment in the financial relationship between the local health authorities and the central authority would be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That adjustment was foreshadowed in a White Paper setting out the late Government's proposals for the improvement and expansion of the health services and nothing has been done since by the local authorities or by the central authority that was not foreshadowed in that White Paper and <Col N="1420" /> for which plans had not already been prepared.  There is not a single bed, with perhaps one exception, that has been established or provided in any hospital, in any sanatorium, in this country that had not been comprised within the plans of the late Government. The allowances paid to persons who are suffering from certain diseases, and to which sub-head H is intended to contribute, are payable under regulations made by the Minister's predecessor. The improved facilities for the treatment of tuberculosis, to which the Minister has referred, had been planned for by his predecessor.  The proposals to send doctors abroad for special treatment were already in effect before the Minister became Minister for Health.  There is not a single item that has to be defrayed, or to which the moneys to be provided under sub-head H are a grant towards the defrayment, that had not been provided for or anticipated by the Minister's predecessor.  What is happening now is that under sub-head H the Dáil is paying for the Fianna Fáil health programme.  We are not ourselves giving effect to it but we are glad to see that, at any rate, we had the foresight to make certain that it would be a practicable proposition and that the local authorities would be able to carry out the plans we had prepared for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite correct in the assertion that the financial provisions under the Health Act were certainly an enlightened piece of legislation.  I think that the health services will most certainly benefit by it.  My regret had always been that this piece of legislation, which is a very acceptable and a very desirable piece of legislation, had been delayed for so long and that it was not until that late period in the administration of the Deputy's Government that they felt impelled to introduce that legislation. However, I suppose better late than never and I am glad that our people are benefiting by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were a few inaccuracies in the Deputy's statement with which I do not know whether I should deal or not. There has always been, in the Deputy's speeches on these matters, what might <Col N="1421" /> be described as a fanatical preoccupation with the subject of plans which were there and which I had merely to implement.  I have had two years in which to implement these plans.  The Deputy had a very much longer period and he did not do it.  I feel that that is sufficient comment on that particular point.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Vote is required to meet the costs in increased pensions of retired national teachers which were approved by the Dáil in the national teacher amendment scheme, 1948, and the Pensions (Increase) Bill, 1949. Deputies will recall that increased scales came into operation on the 31st October, 1946, and that, immediately following that, teachers who went out on pension were having their pension based on the average of the last three years and were awarded pensions based in part on the new scales and in part on the old scales.  It was then decided, on the superannuation scheme of 1948, that the teachers pensioned after the 31st October would be pensioned with their pensions based notionally on the new scales running for three years. Then, under the Pensions (Increase) Bill that has just passed through the House, pensions that were awarded before 31st October, 1946, were increased by certain percentages.  The result is that provision has to be made for an additional £108,000 in respect of these pensions increases by reason of the Pensions (Increase) Bill and provision has to be made for £17,000 for pensions that were increased under the 1948 scheme.  The total amount that is involved is £125,000.  The reason why the Estimate is for only £81,000 is that there are savings in other directions.</P>

That was, whether we like it or not, I think, a clear commitment from the then Government to the teachers.  That Government was not permitted to remain in office to fulfil that commitment.  It was, however, succeeded by the members of other Parties who had clearly indicated to the teachers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I shall show the Minister.  The Fianna Fáil Government was not permitted to remain in office to fulfil that commitment.  It was, however, succeeded by the members of other Parties who had clearly indicated to the teachers that, in their view, the proposals of the then Government were not sufficient.  That constituted, I think, a pledge on their part.</P>

      <P>Deputy MacEntee does not wish to interrupt the Chair?  I cannot permit Deputy <Col N="1423" /> MacEntee to discuss scales of salaries on this Estimate.  What he can discuss on the Estimate is the superannuation scheme.  The Estimate provides money for superannuation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am contending that these superannuation proposals are unfair and unjust to the teachers.  I am saying that they are a violation of pledges given by the previous Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the Estimate as is shown by the details, is for the specific purpose of providing moneys for payment to the fund established under paragraph 8 of the National School Teachers' Superannuation Scheme, 1934, and for the payment of pensions under the National School Teachers' (Ireland) Act, 1879, as amended by the Act that has been just passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the basis of the superannuation were as just as we believe it should be, then these additional sums would be paid.  The Minister is asking the House to authorise this payment to the fund because if he does not make this payment, there will be a deficiency in the pensions fund and the pensions will not be paid.  If the basis of these payments were more generous and if the superannuation were payable from an earlier date, this sum would be larger.  My contention is that the sum should be larger.  If the Minister is going to fulfil the promise which he gave when in opposition, the new scale should be enforced since September, 1949, and the pensions should be payable on the basis of the scales in force in 1949.  There are quite a number of teachers who retired in September, 1949, before the new scales came into force.  They are getting, I contend, smaller pensions than they would be entitled to if the present Government had honoured the pledge which they gave when in opposition. I think it most unfair that teachers who did not go out on strike, city teachers or teachers throughout the country who remained at their posts and did their duty to the children of the nation, should be victimised by a Government which pretends to be concerned <Col N="1424" /> for the rights of the teachers. That is what this Supplementary Estimate amounts to.  You are not doing justice to the teachers because you are not implementing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know, Sir.  I happened, if I may say so, to be the Minister who piloted the 1934 Act through this House, which was responsible for this scheme.  Does the Minister suggest that I do not know what I am talking about?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to smile at the Minister and at his obvious discomfort. It is quite clear that he does not want the grievances of the teachers to be ventilated.  It was all very well when he was on this side of the House.  Then the teachers were the most downtrodden and depressed body in Ireland. I did not believe they were.  I do not believe they are now, but I do know this, that a number of teachers who served until they reached the retiring age and who retired after the date on which they believed the new scale should come into force, have been very badly hit.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether it was done deliberately or not but I do think that they have a distinct grievance in that they should be compelled to retire and have their pensions based on the old scales instead of the scales which the Minister should have brought into force much earlier than he did.  If these scales were brought into force earlier, these teachers would be retiring on the pensions to which they would have been entitled when they accepted the pledge of the Government in 1946 that the scales would be introduced in September, 1949.  I am saying the Minister ought to face up to that fact.  It is quite possible for him to bring in another Supplementary Estimate to permit those teachers who retired between September, 1949, and the 1st January, 1950&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to say before the Minister concludes that I find <Col N="1426" /> myself in a rather awkward position. I listened very carefully to the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate by the Minister.  If he cares again to read his brief, as he read it to the House, he will find that he did make some reference to certain recent dates with regard to the need for the Supplementary Estimate.  Later on in the debate he brought us back to the year 1814.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>1814.  What I want to find out from the Chair is this.  Surely the position is that this Supplementary Estimate arises from the fact that a new arrangement has been made whereunder there is an additional sum payable to retired teachers who retired at a certain recent date?  The Deputy who has just spoken, Deputy MacEntee, was referring to the fact, first of all, that if this arrangement had been made earlier, certain teachers would have come off somewhat better. He was trying to make the point that the position, while slightly improved, is not yet a solution of the problem from the Minister's point of view.</P>
