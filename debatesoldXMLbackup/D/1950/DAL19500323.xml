      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will state whether any practical steps have been taken by the Government to reduce the cost of living, and, if so, what those steps are, and if he will further state when the Government expect that the cost of living will, as a result of those steps, be reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="The Taoiseach John Aloysius Costello">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave in this House to a similar question asked by him on the 1st December, 1948.</P>
      <P>Since then, the Government have continued to take all the practical steps of which I gave the Deputy particulars in my reply to the question, with results that cannot be regarded as unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>Among the more recent results of the Government's activities in this direction, I might mention the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  the reduction, announced in the last Budget, in the standard rate of income-tax and the increase, on the same occasion, in certain income-tax allowances, the combined effect of which will be to save taxpayers an estimated total of £1,221,000 in a full year;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  reductions effected in manufacturers' prices of a wide range of articles of clothing and in the retail prices of a number of miscellaneous commodities &mdash; additional to those <Col N="2360" /> mentioned in my reply of the 1st December, 1948 &mdash; such as candles, electric bulbs, bedsteads, cutlery, soap and soap powders, paints and varnishes, sheet glass, putty, foundry products, chocolate confectionery, biscuits, laminated springs, calor gas, paper bags and cardboard boxes; and</P>
    <P>(3)  further reductions effected in the retail prices of the following commodities and utilities since the 1st December, 1948: sweeping brushes, fireclay goods, metal windows, nuts and bolts, concrete pipes, sugar confectionery and gas.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the Government's policy in regard to agriculture, which is represented by active, well-considered measures to improve the efficiency of the industry, reduce its costs of production and increase its output, is designed not only to promote the prosperity of the farmers but also to reduce the prices of food to the consumers below the level that would otherwise obtain.</P>
    <P>Retail prices, as indicated by the official cost-of-living index number, have remained virtually static, at the figure of 100, over the past two years, notwithstanding rises in salaries, wages and wholesale prices generally, increases in the cost of living elsewhere and the inevitable tendency for prices to rise following the devaluation of the £ last September.  To have held the cost-of-living index number against the upward pressure exerted by the combination of all these forces was no mean achievement.  Further to assess the measure of that achievement, it is relevant to note that, since about mid-August, 1947, the cost-of-living index in Ireland has remained fixed at 100, whereas the British index has increased by 13 per cent., and that, between January, 1948 and January, 1950, wholesale prices generally in Ireland have increased by 1.5 per cent., while the corresponding index in Great Britain increased by 15.2 per cent.  In this connection it is well also to recall that, in the inter-war period, trends in the cost of living in the two countries were strikingly similar&mdash;which makes the recent divergence the more remarkable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will indicate the number of untrained teachers in all primary schools which come under inspection by his Department, and if he will further indicate the policy of his Department regarding untrained teachers in primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (General Mulcahy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total number of untrained teachers in all national schools is 2,899 or 23 per cent. approximately of all teachers recognised; 43 per cent. of the untrained teachers belong to the category of junior assistant mistress.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the post of junior assistant mistress, the Department's regulations provide for the permanent recruitment of trained teachers only, and untrained teachers are recognised permanently in particular cases only when the services of trained teachers cannot be obtained.</P>
      <P>In the case of the junior assistant mistress group, it has already been announced that, after a date to be prescribed, only trained teachers will be appointed to these posts, thus giving full effect to the policy of discontinuing the admission of untrained teachers.  It will not be possible for some time to bring this plan into operation as it will be first necessary to augment the supply of trained teachers, and it would appear that this cannot be done without an increase in the number of training colleges.  In the present uncertainty as to the future format of the educational system for this country, it would be injudicious to embark on the provision of extra training college facilities.  In the meantime, however, trained teachers accepting the post of junior assistant mistress receive the trained teachers' salary up to the sixth incremental point.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that grave <Col N="2366" /> dissatisfaction exists regarding the allocation of houses by the Dublin County Council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation.  No special administrative action by my Department is required to regulate lettings, as housing authorities are already bound by the provisions of statutory regualtions governing the allocation of houses.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state the reasons for the extraordinary delay in the provision of houses for families living in deplorable conditions by the Dublin County Council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation; if he will indicate whether it is the practice of his Department to dictate to local authorities the methods and terms by which houses are allocated, and whether, in order to safeguard the Christian fundamentals on which family life is based, and to terminate the many cases of separation of fathers from their wives and children, he will take adequate remedial steps at once in respect of the areas concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there has been any extraordinary delay in providing houses in either County Dublin or the Borough of Dún Laoghaire.  On the contrary, the Dublin County Council have provided 313 cottages between February, 1948, and February, 1950, and have at present 716 cottages in course of erection.  Sites have been acquired for a further 340 cottages.  These figures amount to 1,369 cottages, which is much more than half of the estimated housing needs of the county, namely, 2,500 cottages.  In addition, compulsory purchase orders providing for the acquisition of sites for approximately 435 cottages have been made by the council and a further order providing for approximately 102 cottages is in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>In the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, 212 houses have been completed since 31st March, 1947, up to the 28th ultimo and 377 were in progress on that date. Sites for a further 132 houses have been acquired and plans approved for 86 of these.  These figures total 721 houses, which is almost 75 per cent. of the estimated needs of the borough, which are 1,000 houses.  In addition, sites for 176 houses are proposed for acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> In view of these achievements attained notwithstanding the obstacles which have been encountered, such as difficulty in obtaining suitable sites and certain types of skilled labour and materials, I do not think that it can be fairly contended that the Dún Laoghaire Corporation and the Dublin County Council are not making satisfactory progress in the provision of houses.</P>
    <P>In regard to the methods and terms by which houses are allocated, the procedure to be followed and the preferences to be given in the letting of houses are clearly laid down in statutory regulations with which the local authorities must comply.  The only function exercised by my Department in this matter is to see that in allocating houses and cottages provided with the aid of subsidy under the 1932 Act there is strict compliance with the regulations.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the Kerry County Council submitted schemes under the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, to the county engineer, and that these schemes were under the heading of public interest?  The county engineer did not include most of these schemes in his report to the Minister.  If, due to that fact, the Kerry County Council again put these schemes forward would the Minister consider them in conjunction with the list already submitted?</P>

    <Title>Private Business. - Local Government Provisional Orders Confirmation Bill, 1950 (from the Seanad)&mdash;Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHogan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Patrick (Clare) Hogan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the two provisional Orders set out in the First and Second Schedules.  These Orders have no effect unless confirmed by the Oireachtas.  The First Schedule contains <Col N="2372" /> the text of the City of Limerick (Extension of Boundary) Provisional Order, 1950.  That Order proposes to add to the City of Limerick a contiguous part of the county of approximately 3,000 acres.  The purpose of the extension of the city is to facilitate the development of the housing policy of the Limerick Corporation.  The petition of the corporation sought to have included in the city an area of approximately 6,000 acres including a portion of the County Clare.  The whole question was fully discussed at a public inquiry, and subsequently with representatives of the local authorities concerned. On consideration of the whole question, it appeared that the case for the inclusion of part of County Clare has not been established, and that the area sought to be taken from County Limerick was rather beyond the limit within which development might reasonably be expected to take place within the not too distant future.  The compromise has, I understand, satisfied both parties.</P>
      <P>The other parts of the Order have, in the main, been taken from the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, as provided by the Limerick City Management Act, 1934.  Provision is made for the necessary consequential financial adjustments between the corporation and the county council, and for the payment to the county council of a sum in respect of increase of burden and for the loss of benefit occasioned as a consequence of the extension.  Provision is also made whereby the added area will not pay the full Limerick City rate for a period of ten years.  In the interim, the city rate will be adjusted as provided in Part II of the Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Second Schedule contains the text of the Bray Urban District (Financial Relations) Order, 1950, and it proposes to amend the provisions of Article 1 (b) of the Bray (Financial Relations) Order, 1903.  The order of 1903 exempted the Bray Urban District from contributing to the salary and pension of the county surveyor for County Wicklow.  At that time the Bray Council was responsible for all roads within the urban district, but since 1927 all the main roads in the urban district have been maintained <Col N="2373" /> by the county council.  The urban council considered the request of the county council for its alteration, and stated that they will be agreeable to contribute towards the salary of the county engineer and the superannuation of the former county engineer. As the original adjustment was made by a provisional Order confirmed by Parliament, it is necessary that any amendment be made by provisional Order confirmed by the Oireachtas.  I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>

      <P>In the course of this debate the Minister for External Affairs referred to me as pursuing and, in the course of his contribution, he conveyed, by innuendo if not directly, that the attitude of this Party was against proper development here and one of adherence to the Banking Commission report.  Before I deal specifically with these matters, let me say I did pursue the Minister through the columns of the <i>Irish Times,</i> because at that particular time he was making general statements, he was making a number of declarations <i>in vacuo</i> without relation to the specific facts of the situation existing, and I chased that nebulosity and sought to reduce it by a series of concrete questions, and to this day these questions have not been answered.  The matter has been referred to by the Minister in this House and, with characteristic misleading innuendo, he seeks to draw an implication from that letter which was not in it, as I will show.  He then seeks, in addition, to make the innuendo, the suggestion, in regard to the attitude of this Party towards development here, and the Banking Commission report.  I propose to deal with that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1932 onwards, when the Fianna Fáil Government was in office, <Col N="2376" /> a consistent and sustained effort was made to develop industry and our own resources, and a call was made on our assets everywhere for that purpose as far as possible.  That progress was blocked and hindered in every respect by the Fine Gael Opposition at the time.  They played the part of fifth columnists during the economic war, considerably retarding the progress then made.  The progress at that time had to be made in three directions&mdash; politically and economically, and in developing the morale of our people. On each of these fronts they put their best, or their worst, efforts into blocking and, if the situation to-day or after the last war was not as favourable as all of us would have liked to have seen in the matter of economics, the blame should be laid where it properly lies.  It is no part of my function to raise these matters, were it not for the attempts of the Minister of External Affairs to try to paint a completely misleading picture in that regard, and the only way to answer him is with facts.</P>
    <P>The facts are these.  In the drive towards economic and political independence, years were lost in doing what could have been done in a shorter space of time because of the opposition of the people who are now in the present Government.  We could have been rid of the oath and of the Governor-General and we could have gone much faster in the political sphere of liberation if it were not for the consistent opposition of Fine Gael &mdash; even the use of the Second Chamber of the time as a delaying tactic.  We could have gone forward more quickly with economic development if it were not for their attitude in the economic war, their resistance and their attempts to break public confidence and, thanks to the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration before that, there was a much more difficult problem for the Government of the day to get investments at home.  The Minister for Finance at the present moment will find it easier to get the funds he requires and he will find greater confidence in our stability here and our capabilities than there was in 1932.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1932 there was no confidence in the country and from 1932 onwards the Deputy and his Party did every conceivable thing &mdash; the present Minister for Finance in particular &mdash; to cut and undermine public confidence and block in every way any attempt at investment.  These are the facts.  Going on from that, you find the Minister for External Affairs saying that his Party was not in favour of the policy to which he is now at least paying lip service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Then show us what you propose to do.  It is not enough <i>in vacuo</i> to make general declarations; you must relate them specifically to facts, as they are, dealing with transitional problems and the rest.  In the course of that antagonism to development at home, two weapons were used by Fine Gael, and let the Minister for External Affairs note the weapons that were used by his bosom brethren of the present moment.  One of the big blocks was the cry that we were reducing our external assets and becoming less credit-worthy.  That was one of the big cries of the Minister for Finance and his Party and it was exploited to the full with a view to blocking the development going on at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next big item after 1938 (when it came out), in the arsenal of Fine Gael, was the Banking Commission report.  This Party and the Government then in office were never committed to the majority report, but on every useful occasion to them Fine Gael and the members thereof used that report as ammunition to attack the policy of the Government on every occasion on which it was available. Then the Minister for External Affairs tries to pretend that we were taking our stand by the majority report of the Banking Commission.  There is some very valuable information to be found in that report, but this Party never was and is not committed to any of the conclusions or the recommendations <Col N="2378" /> therein contained.  These are facts, let the Deputy who interrupted me appreciate, not professions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcQuillan" hpid="Mr. McQuillan Mr. McQuillan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>You committed yourself to nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I will commit myself to further facts.  The commission report came out in 1938.  From that time onwards, the Government of the day had to face a worsening problem going into the war emergency and that particular situation was not the time to take precipitate action.  The matter was being examined, but more urgent problems came up for consideration with the emergency.  The problem of surviving it was quite enough without committing ourselves to then less important problems in face of what had to be regarded as more urgent ones. So the matter lay in abeyance until 1946, after the war.  That is briefly the history of the situation.</P>
      <P>It is to be noted that in 1938 the majority report of the Banking Commission was, as I have called it, the big weapon in the Fine Gael armoury. I have noted in one of the more recent Seanad reports where the present Minister for Finance has been talking, that he apparently seeks to change a viewpoint now on the plea that the situation then was different from what it is now.  That will be found in the Seanad debates of the 12th March, Volume 34, column 2,392.  I might well quote the paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Then there is an onus put upon them in another way.  The Banking Commission considered that many years ago, and the report is very cautious.  They stated that, in the then circumstances, they considered it was desirable to maintain a particular situation.  The circumstances have changed very, very much since. There have been very different courses pursued by the two economies &mdash; the economy in England and the economy here.  If the commission could only report that in the circumstances as they were about 1936 it was right to maintain a particular situation, then certainly we are thrown back on an inquiry.  Now that the circumstances have changed, would the Banking Commission  <Col N="2379" /> likely report for the maintenance of the old conditions?  However these are just comments.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There was the position in regard to these two matters.  The Minister for External Affairs seeks to saddle us rather than his bosom brethren of Fine Gael with the implications of that report, and with whatever the blame for the disadvantages of the situation in the country.  As I have pointed out, if the Banking Commission report was adopted by anybody, it was adopted and used politically by Fine Gael.  If we did not get as far as we would have liked to get by the war, to be in a more favourable and more economically independent position after the war, the fault is also due to the obstructionist and sabotaging &mdash; that is a very popular word with them and is now a very appropriate one to use about them&mdash; tactics of Fine Gael in those years.</P>
    <P>Now, coming forward from that, here was the situation in 1946.  The Minister says I chased him.  The Minister tries to pretend that I was committed or that we were committed to the majority report of the Banking Commission and the situation as it was. What I chased him on was this.  I said: Whatever the history and whatever the past, a certain specific set of circumstances now exists at this time &mdash;that was the end of 1947; you are talking in the air; you are making platitudinous statements, many of which, generally, a lot of people will agree with, but you have not related these statements to the factual situation; you have not given a proper plan or programme for implementing your declared intentions; you have not, as far as can be gathered from your published statements, given any thought or consideration to the problem of transition, and before we will deal further with you we ask you a few concrete questions and answer them.</P>
    <P>Now that is what was done at that time.  In the letters he was asked a series of questions in order to clarify and bring down to earth all this talk he was going on with.  As I said before, to this day these questions have not been answered, but instead an attempt is being made here to <Col N="2380" /> suggest that our attitude, and mine in particular, was that of being wedded eternally to the then existing system and to the Banking Commission report.</P>
    <P>Now that I have stated the matter let me offer my evidence in support. The evidence that I intend to offer I propose to put on the records of this House with the permission of the Chair.  My evidence is the recorded letter of the Minister for External Affairs and my reply thereto, and then to trace thereafter the course of the Minister.  The Minister is a member of the Government, and the Government surely have collective responsibility. The Minister has been persistently giving voice to what I can hardly call financial views.  I will call them that, but to say the least of it they have not been in accord with what action, if any, the Government have taken in this regard.  It is very relevant to follow him.  The issue arises as follows.  In January, 1948, the <i>Irish Times</i> put two questions in particular.  The Minister for External Affairs &mdash; he was then Deputy MacBride &mdash;in a letter written to that journal on the 27th January, 1948, replying to the invitation of the <i>Irish Times</i> in so far as the currency matter is concerned, wrote as follows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the difficulty is to get suitable extracts.  I have given the date of the letter and it can be judged whether I am in any way misleading or inaccurate.  He starts by saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As to the currency question, we believe that the function of a monetary policy is to equate credits to the needs of production and full employment.  In the modern postwar world this has come to be recognised by all economists.  Money is merely a medium of exchange.  The <Col N="2381" /> policy governing the issue of money and credits should be directed towards facilitating production and thereby employment.</P>
    <P>It is of little value to a shopkeeper or to a producer to have his store filled with goods unless there are consumers with money in a position to purchase the goods.  Inversely, it is of little value to a consumer to have his pockets full of banknotes unless those banknotes will acquire goods for him.  The function of a monetary policy must be, on the one hand, to ensure that there is at all times enough money to purchase the goods available, while, on the other hand, to ensure that there are enough goods produced to avoid inflation, having regard to the amount of money in circulation.  It flows from this that the dominating influence of a monetary policy should be to facilitate and induce increased production. The amount of money in circulation should only be limited by the availability of goods.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then goes on to deal with sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>He goes on then to deal with this and he is generally advocating a break with the link with sterling.  In a later paragraph he says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I want to make it quite clear that a separation of currencies would not affect the position of our investments in England.  They would remain, unless their owners decided to sell them and reinvest them in Ireland.  Our policy in this respect is in no way influenced by antagonism to Britain.  It is influenced solely by the desire to ensure that our monetary policy will be directed <Col N="2382" /> primarily towards the achievement of maximum production and full employment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say that the third minority report of the Banking Commission should be adopted, and he gives nothing in that by way of reference to the existing situation or to the problems of transition.  He makes no concrete proposal for action and he does not deal with the consequences or the problems arising from any concrete proposal.</P>
    <P>It was that fact which stimulated me into writing a letter which the editor of the <i>Irish Times</i> published and that was the only occasion on which I have &ldquo;chased&rdquo;, I think that was the Minister's word, through the <i>Irish Times.</i> These are the circumstances to which the Minister for External Affairs referred. My purpose, as will be seen from the reply in the <i>Irish Times</i> of the 31st January, 1948, was to get down to earth.  I am not going to read the whole of the letter but I shall read the first and the last paragraph. I started like this&mdash;and this is what is being misrepresented as being adherence to the report: &ldquo;The generality of Mr. MacBride's reply to your recent query calls for a more definite rejoinder.  At the outset, however, perhaps you will allow me to point out that throughout Mr. MacBride suggests (if he does not say it explicitly) that this State is not free in monetary matters.  That is clearly a misconception, legally and actually. The Oireachtas is completely free to mould her monetary policy into any pattern it chooses and that freedom has been exercised in our currency legislation, the link with sterling was freely chosen as a matter of expediency, and the question, therefore, is whether it is expedient now or in the proximate future to sever it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A further general statement was made in the then Deputy MacBride's letter about the function of monetary policy. This is my reply: it is all very well to assert a belief that the function of a monetary policy is to equate credits to the needs of production and full employment, or to state that money is merely a medium of exchange.  That is all very well.  You can accept the <Col N="2383" /> importance of the role of credit in industry and the importance of money in everyday use.  But there are other aspects of the problem which had to be taken into account.  Such a general statement was not sufficient.  Internally the problem of savings and investments must be taken into account, the repercussions of external economic influences must be allowed for, and regard must be had to the fact that the bulk of retail transactions are effected in cash.  Then, again, money is used as a standard of value and it also provides the means of saving purchasing power.  It is also a consideration in monetary policy that you want a certain amount of stability from day to day.  In order words, in the next paragraph I assembled for him some of the reasons that influenced the majority report of the Banking Commission. Then, in the third paragraph of that letter it was pointed out that, with these considerations in mind, the Banking Commission made certain recommendations. The Minister suggests that in that approach this Party is tied to the Banking Commission's report. May I equate that with this paragraph which follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not suggest that the majority report of the Banking Commission should be the overriding authority, but, so far as I am aware, Mr. MacBride has not answered their arguments nor has he shown that changing circumstances have invalidated those arguments to-day.  He proposes to change.  The onus is on him to show the desirability of change and to propound, in outline at least, a plan to implement his declared intention.  Does he discharge this onus?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In other words, what was put up to him was:&mdash;Your statements are all very well but here are specific aspects of the problem which need concrete consideration.  What are your answers to the problems so proposed?  How can you offset the disadvantages involved in them.  That is not tying oneself to or even adopting the report of the Banking Commission, particularly in view of these guarded words.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2384" /> Then the next question put to Mr. MacBride was, and it is still not answered, that if we were to pursue a policy of breaking the link with sterling, what foreign exchange relations would he propose?  What specific arrangement would he make for foreign exchange.  It was further pointed out to him that if you broke away from sterling at that time you had three possible consequences: (1) Our £ would depreciate <i>vis-a-vis</i> sterling; (2) the relationship would remain steady or (3) it would appreciate.  Working out these in a concrete manner, it was shown that the cost of living would go up if there was depreciation and that it might lead to an inflationary spiral and all the consequences with which we are familiar in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>The simple question asked him was:&mdash;How do you propose to prevent such things happening or, if you cannot prevent them, how do you propose to offset them?  That was in the case of depreciation resulting from a separation.  In the case of No. (2), their staying level, you simply have a link, that is all.  If, by any mechanism, you keep the two at par the whole time, you have a link. If, on the other hand, you appreciate your £ <i>vis-a-vis</i> the sterling power, other problems arise.  You depress your exports straightaway.  I gave a summarised balance sheet in connection with that.  If you appreciate far enough, you have a very adverse effect on the Irish banking system necessitating radical adjustments.  The question was proposed: What are you going to do about it?  All that was put up to Deputy MacBride, as he then was, as a series of questions.  I take this opportunity of putting the same series of questions again to him and asking him for concrete answers, for a concrete, specific, workable plan, for implementing all the airy-fairy financial talk he has been indulging in.  When he does that, we can talk about policy with him.</P>
    <P>Lastly, with regard to the imputation made by the Deputy here.  Could anything be more clearly said than this?:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;When tampering with the existing system, the problems of transition <Col N="2385" /> must also be provided for, and on these Mr. MacBride is silent.  I freely concede to him the possibility that changing circumstances might dictate a break with sterling.  I am not to be taken as defending the existing arrangement or the majority report of the Banking Commission, but it is up to him to show that the time is now opportune for change.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that was not clear enough, at a meeting in Kildare some time afterwards, quite apart from the pronouncements of Deputy Aiken, who represented this Party on the matter and who was then Minister for Finance &mdash;and I think anybody who goes through the records will find that the statements which the Minister for External Affairs is now trying to misrepresent as made by me are, in fact, in accord with what Deputy Aiken said at the time&mdash;I further stated in Kildare and it is reported in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 2nd February, 1948: &ldquo;Many of us are quite prepared to consider this question sympathetically.  As a matter of fact, we had it examined before the war and would have no hesitation in changing the arrangement if the interests of the people would be served by so doing, but we must remember the serious consequences likely to follow from monetary experiments.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Since this Party came into being it has consistently striven for the political and economic independence of the country and it has consistently worked towards that goal. In order to get results, however, one must relate one's actions to the concrete situation existing and work along some practical plan.  A mere subscription to general doctrine and general theory without coming down to facts will get no one anywhere.  But that is exactly what the Minister for External Affairs has been doing in this whole matter.  That raises a rather interesting problem for the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for External <Col N="2386" /> Affairs propagates in general terms, but without getting down specifically to any workable plan or within measurable distance of any concrete proposition, and preaches a particular doctrine and endeavours to pretend that the line the Government is taking is in accord with his views and that the policy of the Minister for Finance conforms to it.  We have had this talk about devaluation.  We have had this talk about sterling and maintaining the link with sterling.  These are the three strings upon which this harpist is constantly playing.</P>
      <P>The people who are charged with responsibility should come forward with a practical concrete plan.  They should face up to the factual situation and put forward proposals and methods of dealing with the transitional problem.  It is easy enough to have an ideal; the difficulty is to achieve the ideal and the transitional stage of development towards the ideal is always the most difficult one.  When the Government gives us concrete proposals we can talk about them.  My complaint is that the Government has given us no concrete proposals and, furthermore, that efforts have been made with all this airy-fairy talk to try to pretend that this Party is opposed to any proper development of the country.</P>
      <P>Coming then to the behaviour of these two Ministers since they came into office, may I say that it is pathetic to see the Minister for Finance, after his first conservative approach, coming back to his old love of economy for economy's sake, coming back to orthodox economy, in the first flush of victory on his becoming Minister for Finance, to the old Fine Gael approach of economy for economy's sake?  It is rather pathetic to find him at this stage trying to shield his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, in a pathetic effort to demonstrate the harmony that exists between them.  Let me quote from the Seanad Reports of 12th March, 1948, at column 2392:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Those who want to keep the link with sterling must realise the onus is on them to prove that the situation is a proper one.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2387" /> One might almost be humorous about that.  The onus may be on the people, but the Government is in the saddle. The Government has maintained the link for two years.  The Minister for External Affairs says: &ldquo;Break it&rdquo;. The Minister for Finance says the onus is on himself and on his Government, which is maintaining him.</P>

      <P>In any event we have the peculiar situation about which the Minister for External Affairs has been talking.  He is a member of the Government.  He has a sufficient number of votes in the Cabinet to make his view felt if he is serious in that view. If he is not serious, that is another story.  I want to quote now from the <i>Irish Independent</i>, a newspaper acceptable to the Government, in this regard.  In January of 1948, Mr. MacBride speaking at Cork said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;English currency is liable to be devalued in the near future.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In July, 1949, the Minister for Finance in Donegal gave warning of an impending serious financial crisis.  That was featured at great length in all the papers on the 25th.  Nobody can say, quite apart from that warning, that this crisis could not have been foreseen. It was foreseen by those outside the House as well as inside it.  It was the responsibility of the Minister to put himself in a position to deal with the crisis when it arose.  What happened? One had the protestations of the Minister for External Affairs, if one can believe that he is serious in his statements relating to a monetary situation, made as far back as 1948.  The Minister for Finance had foreseen it months before.  Every business man in the country had foreseen it months before. The opportunity of doing something to meet the crisis was allowed to pass. <Col N="2388" /> The Minister for Finance makes a statement on the radio as to why we must acquiesce in a certain course Nothing further was done about it.</P>
    <P>The point is this.  With all that there behind them, all that knowledge or foreknowledge behind them, if the Minister for External Affairs was serious and had any particular plan or idea in his head, surely he would have been able to influence and to convince his Fine Gael colleagues as to the course that should be adopted as he convinced them on another occasion.</P>

      <P>Yes, and the Minister for Finance, with the Minister for External Affairs and the Government, are jointly responsible.  If there was anything that should be done, well, there were 18 months behind them for which to prepare for it.  If that is the situation, why talk about a legacy being left that they could not deal with?  I want to refer to this, with the permission of the Chair, and to refer to it again in renewing my question to the Minister for External Affairs specifically. I want to put this question.  In the broadcast which the Minister for Finance gave as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 20th September, 1949, the Minister gave certain reasons for his decision.  Admittedly, he does advert to certain factual problems that are there.  These factual problems exist whether we like it or not and they have to be faced in any event.  I shall not quote the whole lot of what the Minister for Finance said on that occasion &mdash;it is to be seen in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 20th September, 1949. Having regard to those factors which are emphasised by the Minister for Finance, will the Minister for External Affairs come down to earth and show us how the problems arising from these factors are to be dealt with in accordance with his very general proposals? <Col N="2389" /> He goes on coolly on his road.  I do not know how the Minister for Finance is going to react to it but the Minister for Finance is defending the banks at one time in regard to their attitude to the Dublin Corporation.  The Minister for External Affairs comes out and says that the banks' action was disastrous in regard to the restriction of credit.</P>

      <P>He will continue to get it until he answers the questions which were put to him and brings the matter down to earth.  Is he seriously proposing radical changes?  If so, it is the right of the people of this country to know in detail what he proposes and to have provision made in such event for transitional problems or otherwise. If he is not serious, he should not talk about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let me come back to the Minister for Finance.  There was talk about the restriction of credit in 1948.  The Minister for Finance has denied any action on his part &mdash; I am speaking from memory in regard to that.  But the Minister for Finance surely had enough influence as Minister with the powers under the Central Bank Act&mdash; with powers such as those contained in Section 50 and so forth of the Central Bank Act &mdash; to make his will felt.  What kind of carry on is this between two Ministers in the one Government?  If you have a Government with that kind <Col N="2390" /> of carry on, and if you have a Minister for Finance who has changed his financial face so many times in his history, who is now coming in here seeking to borrow without provision for the repayment of the debt, is it not fair to ask whether the country can have confidence in either&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the Seanad on 26th October &mdash; the reference is Vol. 37, No. 2, col. 129 of the Official Report of the Seanad Debates &mdash; the Minister for Finance stated:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If Senators can advise me how I can have credit without getting into debt, limited or complete, I would be very glad to get a lesson.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2391" /> I might alter that to say that if the Minister can tell us how he is going to get all this money without getting into debt we would be glad to learn the lesson.  If he gets into debt, what we want to know is how is it going to be repaid?  That comes in a sense to the kernel of what is involved in the provisions of these Estimates.  It seems to me to be this.  It is all right to get into debt in such a way that the moneys you raise by getting into that debt give you something which later will enable you to repay that debt, and that is only a very homely way of putting the statement that it is all right to invest capital in a productive undertaking because the production later will give you the means of repaying the debt and your liabilities upon it.  But if you get into debt without using the money that you borrow or without making any other provision for repayment of the debt, that debt piles up against you and is a millstone around your neck.  Essentially, our quarrel in regard to the Minister's approach to this is as to how and for what purpose these moneys are to be raised and as to how they are to be applied.  In their application, are they simply going to be dissipated?  That has been dealt with at length by other speakers already in this debate and I am not going to go into it all again.</P>
    <P>I want to finish on the note on which I started and it is this: that here we have what would seem to be an underestimate for the year.  We have a Minister for Finance who has varied his financial outlook.  We have a Minister for Finance who has evidenced here in this debate the attitude of passing everything on to someone else who will pay.  He will not be here to meet the bill which he is creating now.  Is that a good thing for the country?  Must we not consider the future?  He talked about confidence. Must we not consider the future problems of the creditworthiness of the State and so forth?  Will he not, if he pursues this line, simply leave the State in a position where, instead of having production expansion facilitated, development will be hindered?</P>
    <P>Is it a proper thing to have superimposed <Col N="2392" /> on that, evidence of a change in his attitude since he came into office?  There is very little talk to-day about all the economies or about the cost of administration in which the Minister indulged before he came into office.  Administrative costs have gone up and the cost of living has not been reduced.  The Taoiseach gave us some items to-day but, on the other side of the balance sheet, we can put others. Administrative costs have gone up, the cost of living has not come down and the Minister has changed his attitude. What can one expect for the future? There is one thing we can expect and I have asked him already to tell us whether it is not true &mdash; we expect that there will be very substantial Supplemental Estimates to add to this Book of Estimates during the coming year. Finally, you have the Minister for External Affairs gyrating as I have shown already, largely <i>in vacuo.</i>  There you have the whole position.  It is about time that the country knew where it stood in regard to its finances. After all, we demand from people handling the finances of a public business or a private business certain standards of accuracy and reliability.  Here we have a completely unsatisfactory state of affairs in regard to the people who are handling the whole finances of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that Deputies de Valera, senior and junior, will not mind if I tender them a bit of friendly advice.  I advise Deputies de Valera, senior and junior, and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party that they ought to make up their minds at once that the kind of Government sitting at this side of the House has come to stay for five years or more.  If they come to face that fact I say to Deputy de Valera, senior, at any rate, that as Leader of the Opposition it is his duty to the people he represents to cease making the kind of destructive speech that he made here last night.  If he wants to help those he represents, it is his duty to come in here on an occasion of this kind and make criticisms, undoubtedly, but constructive criticisms, of the proposals that are put before us and to offer alternative suggestions if <Col N="2393" /> he does not agree with the proposals put before him.</P>
      <P>He came in here last night and, in effect, he said that he was not prepared to agree to the proposals of the Minister for Finance because they came from his old political opponents of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>I am assuming for the purpose of this discussion that Deputy Lemass who faced up to the question in a much more realistic way was speaking the mind of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Notwithstanding the fact that I listened here for several hours during the last few days to the most contradictory speeches coming from Deputy de Valera and those sitting beside him on the Front Bench and behind him on the back benches, we can assume, I take it, that Deputy Lemass made a careful examination of the Estimates that had been submitted and the policy behind this Vote on Account.  Deputy Lemass in his speech said that economies may be possible but the maximum saving would not exceed £1,000,000.  He indicated that this £1,000,000 saving could be effected if we had not embarked on the news agency administration and also on the Industrial Development Authority Bill which, he indicated a few days ago, he disliked so much.  If these two items were cut out of the Estimates and the Vote on Account, it all boils down to this, there is nothing between us but £1,000,000. Deputy Lemass, however, went on to say &mdash; and if it is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party let the people understand it &mdash; that £11,000,000 out of the £12,000,000 which is to be raised by borrowing, should come out of taxation. In other words, it is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to raise the additional £11,000,000 by way of additional taxation on the people of the country rather than borrow that sum and pass it on to posterity to pay.</P>

If Deputy Lemass interpreted the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party in his speech last night, we know where we stand and I do not think there is a terrible lot between us.  I cannot understand how Deputy Lemass can go on to argue&mdash;because they did not put that policy into operation themselves &mdash; that money provided for arterial drainage, land reclamation, water supplies, improvement of farm buildings, development of the tourist industry and afforestation should be found by way of direct taxation in the years in which the money is expended.  Surely, the benefits, as he suggested himself, to be derived from the carrying out of capital works of that kind do not come back to the Exchequer inside the period in which the money is supposed to be raised, according to him, by way of direct taxation?  Deputy Lemass indicated that he was prepared to advocate a policy of borrowing only when there was a clear assurance or indication that the moneys borrowed would come back directly to the Exchequer in the year in which the loan was raised. Personally, I cannot follow that kind of argument.  I think the Government of the day, whatever it may be, is quite justified in borrowing to carry out works of a capital development nature where these works provide useful employment for thousands of people and will, in the years to follow, provide increased production.  Increased production is going to provide revenue for the Exchequer, indirectly if not directly in the years following the carrying out of these works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rose to take part in this discussion principally for the purpose of dealing with one specific matter and I suggest to the Minister for Finance and his colleagues that it is a very serious matter which is bound to get more serious as time goes on.  I feel very <Col N="2395" /> proud that this Government &mdash; and we have had proof of their progress in this matter published by the Minister for Local Government &mdash; have made such headway in regard to housing schemes. The figures speak for themselves. They cannot be contradicted or misrepresented, whether they refer to houses in the course of erection or houses completed since the Government came into office.</P>
    <P>I want an assurance from the Minister for Finance &mdash; and if he cannot give it to me to-day I hope he will give it to me soon&mdash;that this whole question of the financial structure in relation to our housing policy will be reviewed in the light of existing circumstances and related definitely to the cost of money provided for local authorities for the erection of houses and to the rents which prospective tenants are being called upon to pay.  I assert that with all the loose money that is available, that is lying in our banks on deposit&mdash; close on £400,000,000, nearly the equivalent of the amount of our external assets &mdash; some portion of it should, by arrangement between the Government and the Joint Stock Banks Standing Committee, be provided for the carrying out of our housing policy at a lower rate of interest than is charged through the Local Loans Fund to-day.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and his colleagues will have returns to show what percentage of the total sum provided for the erection of houses by a local authority represents interest charges on the one hand and the site to be acquired, the materials put into the houses and the wages paid to those who build them on the other hand.  I understand that in some cases in Dublin City where houses have been built under the 35 years' loan system, at the end of the 35 years £1,500 was the sum that had to be provided for the erection of houses which cost the local authority or the utility society £1,000. If £500 has to be paid out of a total of £1,500 at the end of the 35 years' loan period, then I think that the money advanced for such an essential purpose is costing the local authorities and the people far too much.  The financial policy from that point of view and the <Col N="2396" /> rates of interest charged will have to be reviewed in the interests of everybody concerned&mdash;the local authorities, the ratepayers, the taxpayers and the tenants.  The whole matter should be treated as an emergency matter and it should receive the early consideration of the Government.</P>
    <P>This question has presented itself to me in a most serious way, and I have had ample illustrations of what is taking place in my own constituency. So far as building costs are concerned, I know very little about them, but will any Deputy say from what he knows in relation to building costs that you would be justified in accepting a tender for the building of a house in a town like Edenderry in Offaly for £1,800 and expect tenants to pay the rents they will be called upon to pay, following the acceptance of a tender such as that?  I say £1,800 is far too much for the erection of a house for a slum dweller in a town of that size.  Houses are being built in some towns, and particularly in my own constituency, for people who have been living in slum dwellings or condemned houses.  How are tenants of condemned houses, with an average income of £3 10/- a week, to be expected to pay the rents which it is suggested they should pay if they occupy these new houses?  Many of these people are living in houses that have been condemned by the local sanitary authority, houses for which they were paying 2/-, 3/-, 4/- and in a few cases 5/2 per week.</P>
    <P>Because of these high building costs that I have indicated, the economic rent of the new houses would be £1 8s. 10d. a week &mdash; I am quoting from official figures.  The tenants are to be asked to pay 18/3d. a week plus rates. In pre-war days the houses built by local authorities cost far less and they were let at an average rent representing one-eighth, one-ninth or one-tenth of the tenant's weekly income.  To-day, as a result of the excessive building costs, and notwithstanding the huge sums poured out from the Transition Development Fund and through housing grants, the tenants getting local authority houses will be called upon to pay rents so high that they <Col N="2397" /> will represent one-third or one-fourth of their weekly income.  That position will have to be rectified immediately.</P>
    <P>I and my colleague, Deputy O'Higgins, can quote many instances in relation to the cost of houses and rents proposed to be charged for them in Portlaoighise, Birr and other small towns.  I am aware, and so are my colleagues, that the same applies to other constituencies.  In Dublin City there are 25,000 or 26,000 people looking for houses, falling over each other in their eagerness to get them &mdash; married men with large families. Naturally, these people would prefer to occupy a house or a flat if they could get one, even at a fairly high rent, rather than remain in rooms where they are being charged excessive prices for the use of even one room. Before they are living long in these houses where the high rents are charged they will find that they have less to-day in the shape of money to buy food and clothes for themselves and their families than what they would have in pre-war days.</P>
    <P>Just take into consideration the cost of house building by local authorities to-day as compared with pre-war days. I cannot emphasise the urgency of this matter too much.  I want to be assured that the huge subsidies we are providing out of this Vote&mdash;an increase of £585,000 as compared with last year&mdash; will not be paid to the local authorities to subsidise excessively high building costs and unfair rates of interest instead of being used as they should be, and as it was intended, to subsidise reasonable rents for the occupants of these houses.  I assume that any Government that provides millions to enable local authorities to erect houses for those badly in need of them has the intention that these huge sums should go directly to bring rents down to a figure within the capacity of tenants to pay; but I have a shrewd suspicion &mdash; and I have evidence in one or two cases&mdash;that this money, instead of being set aside to subsidise rents and bring them to a lower figure, is going to fill the pockets of building contractors who are getting excessive profits out of building contracts.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Government, and to <Col N="2398" /> the Minister for Local Government in particular, that wherever the local authorities have excessively high tenders submitted to them for the erection of houses these tenders should, when they come before the Department of Local Government, be held up.</P>
    <P>I have protested against the acceptance of these excessively high tenders. I have suggested that in these cases&mdash;it has been done in other places&mdash;we could not do worse than experiment in the building of houses by direct labour. I want to point out, however, that when you do suggest carrying out housing schemes by direct labour you find that you are up against the hidden and hostile attitude of the engineers employed by local authorities and, possibly, the engineers who are working in the Department of Local Government.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to go into further detail.  On the 24th November last I put down a parliamentary question asking the Minister for Local Government to furnish me with particulars of cases where houses had been built by direct labour and where a saving had been effected as against the contract system.  I had some particulars myself but I wanted to get the information officially to put it on record. I have examined the lengthy list that was furnished.  I must salute all the members of the Wicklow County Council, because it was a unanimous decision by them, on their achievement in the direct labour schemes they have carried out in that county.  These direct labour schemes in that county have resulted in a huge saving of money to the ratepayers and to the prospective tenants.  I am not saying that must be done in every county, but I suggest it should be done in every county where excessively high tenders are received for the building of houses. These tenders should not receive the approval of the Minister for Local Government.  I certainly would rather risk the building of houses by direct labour in a town like Edenderry than have them built by contract, with my consent, at a cost of £1,800.  In the <Col N="2399" /> long run that will mean a rent of 18/3 plus rates for the prospective tenants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that same matter, I want to draw the attention of the Minister for Finance to what he cannot be unaware of &mdash; the serious consequences to the ratepayers and taxpayers of the conditions under which loans are now being given to local authorities for a 50-year period.  Members of all Parties in this House are anxious to prevent the rates from rising unnecessarily.  That is not the job alone of Deputy Cogan, who is behind me.  We are all as anxious as he is to keep the rates down to a reasonable level, and at the same time to maintain essential public services. I have discussed this question of the rapid rise in the rates with the members of local authorities in my constituency and, recently, with the chairman of one of the county councils in my constituency.  I find that the new conditions laid down for the giving of loans to local authorities has resulted in piling up the rates unnecessarily in one of the two counties in my constituency.  The matter was discussed recently at a meeting of the Laoighis County Council.  It is reported in the <i>Leinster Express</i> newspaper of the 4th March.  Reference is made there to the unfair conditions attaching to the local loans granted for the building of houses.  The chairman at that meeting said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The cost of providing new houses in the coming year was responsible for 9d. in the £ for rates.  No money in the way of rents would be received in that period.  Under the old system the council was charged interest on housing loans only after the first two years, but now it must pay interest from the start although it received no income from the houses until they are built, which usually takes two years.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that, if a Jewman were lending money, he would not expect repayment of the portion of the money or interest on it until the person concerned <Col N="2400" /> had money to enable him to pay.  I think the same principle should be applied by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government in the case of loans to local authorities for the building of houses.  The regulations dealing with them should be amended in such a way as not to make it obligatory on local authorities to pay interest on the loans until such time as rent was coming in from the tenants, and not as at present, two years before the houses are built.  An increase of 9d. in the £ on the rates is a very serious matter in the case of any county.  It is particularly serious in the case in this county which is the sixth highest rated in the country to-day, a county where within a period of five or six years the rates have gone up from 12/3 to 25/6 in the £.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Government to give further consideration to this matter, and see that the payment of interest on these housing loans will not commence until the tenants have gone into occupation of the new houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The vastness of the sum in the Book of Estimates does not hold any great fears for me so long as the money goes towards the provision of vital services.  May I point out that many of these services appear in the Book of Estimates as a result of the activities of the former Government. It was responsible for establishing them.  The Unemployment Assistance Act, the widows' and orphans' pensions, children's allowances, the subsidisation of housing, farm improvements schemes and so on all appeared in the Book of Estimates for the first time during the period when the Fianna Fáil Government was operating.  The vastness of the sum in the Book of Estimates has not been the cause to any great extent of the complaints which have come from this side of the House.  What we do complain of, and complain bitterly of, is the fact that the promises which were made during the last election and for a considerable time before it have not been given effect to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an easy thing for politicians who are seeking office to stand on platforms here and there and outbid each other in a desire to secure the votes of <Col N="2401" /> the electorate.  But it is another thing to give effect to their promises. Above all, it is another thing to be honest with the public to whom you are speaking and not to create the feeling that those who seek the suffrages of the electorate are deliberately deceiving the people.  It is during and prior to an election that proper respect for this House can be built up. If those who go before the people tell them that they can reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. and if, after having made this promise, they take no action in that regard, surely that can only be described as deceit, as securing office by false pretences?</P>
    <P>I was rather amused to-day when the Taoiseach, in answer to a question on the Order Paper in regard to the cost of living, read out a number of items which were reduced in cost as a result of Government action.  My amusement was brought about by the fact that laminated springs are now reduced in price.  I am sure that there will be bonfires in Gardiner Street, Summer-hill, the Coombe, Francis Street and Meath Street as a result of the announcement that laminated springs have now been reduced in price.  I doubt if the digestions of the people in these areas, people who have to suffer very great hardships, will be able to digest laminated springs.  If that is an attempt to show how the cost of living has been brought down by 30 per cent., all I can say is that it is a feeble attempt; it is about as feeble as the attempt to reduce the unemployment figures.</P>
    <P>Last evening, Deputy Coburn made a plaintive type of plea.  He asked us, first of all, for goodwill.  The Deputy has been in this House for a considerable period of time and is well aware of the goodwill that was displayed towards the former Government.  In the course of his plea, he stated that we ought to be well aware that things cannot be done overnight.  We are thoroughly aware of that fact.  But, by an extraordinary coincidence, one of his colleagues when he was on this side of the House did not appear to be aware of that.  His colleague is now a Minister and, as reported in Vol. 105. col. 847, of the Official Reports, he <Col N="2402" /> said when talking about unemployment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the one thing which has remained steady in this country during the whole of the war and since the war ended.  Has the Minister done anything about it? Does the Minister know if that is the real figure?  If we have 70,000 persons unemployed in this country, why have we 70,000 unemployed?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he became emphatic and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I stated here 12 months ago and I want to repeat it here now, that without the slightest trouble every able-bodied man and woman in this country could be put into useful work in the morning.  There is not a shadow of doubt about it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was an emphatic statement by an experienced Deputy.  The only thing I can say in his defence in regard to such a pronouncement is that he was speaking without having the responsibility of Government.  He was speaking as a Deputy who would not have to give effect to his promises. Later on, when he had secured experience, when he had become a Minister and had learned the lesson of responsibility, this is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He had never suggested that it was a problem that was easy to solve.  It was, however, hardly fair to blame the Government for not being able to do in ten months what the former Government had not been able to do in 16 years.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce.  I am not blaming him, because he probably believed that it was possible by some action which he may have had in mind to bring that about, perhaps not in 24 hours as he suggested, but in a very short time.  The Minister has now been in office for a little over two years and, personally, I would <Col N="2403" /> not suggest that even in two years he should have solved that problem. But there were 70,000 unemployed at the time he was speaking &mdash; I am accepting his figure because he gave it himself &mdash; and, by an extraordinary coincidence, the figure given for the month of March this year in the public Press is 70,000 also.  The cost of living is static and unemployment is static.  We are not progressing. We are not moving forward.  We are not creating the <i>El Dorado</i> promised to the people in the pre-election period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coburn asks for goodwill from this side of the House and hopes that his plea will not fall on deaf ears. It will be no harm if I show him the type of goodwill we received when we were on the Government Benches. Again, by an extraordinary coincidence, the speech I am about to quote was made on the Vote on Account in March, 1947, the last year a Vote on Account was brought in by a Minister of the Fianna Fáil Government.  The sum involved was a large one, £17,681,000.  You will notice that the sum that we are now being asked for is £26,000,000.  In Volume 104, column 1976, a Deputy, who is now a Minister, had this comment to make.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>He said on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;...facing up to this debate for an instalment for the largest sum of money that was ever asked for from the taxpayers of this country in the history of the country &mdash; either in the history of the country under an Irish Administration or under a foreign Administration &mdash; there should be some attention paid by Government, even if it is only lip-service, to the conditions that exist throughout the country and to the conditions under which those people live who will be asked to subscribe their hard-earned <Col N="2404" /> money to keep in office a Government spending that money at a greater rate than £1,000,000 a week. That is a staggering sum for a tiny little portion of a very small island&mdash; an amazing, crazy demand on a country made up, in the main, of rather poor or very poor people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was Deputy Dr. O'Higgins on 12th March, 1947.  That was his quota of goodwill towards the then Minister for Finance.  The sum involved on that occasion was very much less than the sum asked for now.  Yet, I do not describe the sum asked for now as a &ldquo;crazy demand&rdquo;.  Not satisfied with that expression of goodwill, he continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Now the largest bill ever presented to this House is presented confidently, in the knowledge that if it was ten times as large, 20 times as large, or if it were going to cripple, bend and bankrupt everyone in this land, it would go through at the ringing of the bell.  That is all that is required to get money, to ring the bell and the boys will march.  Their job is not to question but to obey; their job is not to obey their constituents or to consider them, but to obey and consider the particular Minister that makes a demand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the type of goodwill displayed to the then Government in 1947.  Deputy Coburn is an experienced Deputy and he is well aware of the type of action taken by the Opposition during our period in office. When he makes a plea for goodwill from the present Opposition it is very difficult to understand, to realise or to believe that he is in fact in earnest in making that plea.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that that was the position.  The fact of the matter is to-day that so far as we are concerned the sum of money asked for in this Vote on Account will not be objected to by us provided it is for vital services.  But we must ask ourselves is the money being provided entirely for vital services.  The sum of money asked for in respect of External Affairs is £359,350, more than two and a quarter times as much as was asked for or utilised by the Minister for External Affairs in the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2405" /> Government.  I find it difficult to believe that that is a reasonable demand.  I ask myself is it a reasonable demand especially when I see in the Book of Estimates one heading &ldquo;Athletics&rdquo;&mdash; I am sure Deputy McQuillan is as interested in athletics as I am &mdash; appearing under the heading &ldquo;Obsolete Services.&rdquo;  Apparently there will be a saving of £25,000 on that.  I think it is a pity athletics should be put under Obsolete Services. This nation was well served by its athletes in the past.  They brought honour and glory to the nation.  Many of them who might be described as athletes in the raw broke world records, some of which held until very recently.  To-day our athletes are doing reasonably well without any help from the State.  Other civilised nations are expending huge sums of money in providing for their athletes.  I think these nations have a far deeper concept of what is required than we have here when we place athletics under the heading of Obsolete Services.</P>

      <P>Yet we have £359,350, as I say, two and a quarter times, nearly £200,000 in excess of what was required during the last year of the Fianna Fáil Government.  Surely £25,000 of that could be expended on providing ways and means to give our athletes an opportunity of bringing honour to the nation.  I am not going to say how that money is being spent now.  All I hope is that it is being put to a useful purpose.  But there are large numbers of our people who doubt that very much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall now deal with the problem of emigration, which was used with tremendous effect against the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  We must ask ourselves what has been done to bring emigration to an end.  Every man, every Deputy in this House, every Minister in this House, I am certain, would like to bring to a complete end the continuing emigration of our people.  How it is to be done is one of the problems to which we are all giving very serious <Col N="2406" /> consideration.  The Fianna Fáil Government honestly believed that the only solution to that problem was the provision of industrial employment in addition to the additional employment which our agricultural policy would provide.  We went a long way towards finding a solution to that problem before the outbreak of the recent world war.  Great play was made out of the fact that during the period of that war large numbers of our people were compelled to emigrate.  In that particular case, of course, we were only emigrating across the channel and it was only a temporary movement.  We hoped that the majority of these people would come back and I believe that, to a very large extent, they have come back.  It may be of interest to the House to know this fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Industries which had been set up here and which had to depend to a considerable extent on raw materials from outside were brought to a cessation.  They just could not carry on and these people for whom work of a suitable kind could not be found at home were compelled to cross the water to where they could find employment. We could do nothing very much about that.  We were not going to close the ports and to prevent these people from earning their livelihood when it was not possible for us to provide it for them at home and they were fully justified, from that point of view.  But what is the figure to-day?  The figure of emigration to-day is as high as 40,000. The only reason I am mentioning that figure is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>None of us desires to see our people leave the country.  I believe that the present Government itself, if it could, would go all out to find that solution as quickly as possible. The solution will be found to a very large extent in the provision of industry.  All I can say is that I have grave doubts as to whether the energy that should be put into providing industry is being put into it at the present moment.  I have grave doubts in regard to that and I have grave doubts as to whether the means which were recently devised, and which were discussed <Col N="2408" /> in this House, are the means by which it will be brought about.  However, an industrial arm to this nation, in addition to its agricultural arm, is the only means by which at least some relief will be given to the nation and the hæmorrhage of emigration brought to an end.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies in the course of this debate referred to the failure of the Fianna Fáil Government to solve the housing problem.  All I can say so far as that is concerned is that any Deputy who has any doubts as to the activities of the former Minister for Local Government in respect to the provision of houses has only to go around the City of Dublin here.  I am not dealing with the rural areas although magnificent work was done there also, including the provision of 10,000 labourers' cottages, a provision which was not heretofore even thought of.  Any Deputy who has any doubts as to the activities of the Fianna Fáil Government in respect to the provision of houses for the people of the city, has only to go around the outskirts of the city.  There he will see new communities existing in the healthy surroundings in which these communities are now situated.  We all know that out on the south side of the city, in the Crumlin and Kimmage area, there has come into existence a community which is equal to, if it does not exceed, the population of some of our provincial cities.  I think that is an achievement of which not only Fianna Fáil but every Irishman who calls himself an Irishman, and especially every Dubliner who calls himself a Dubliner, should be proud.  To have provided in one area alone housing accommodation for as many as 50,000 people is an accomplishment that gives the lie to Deputies who, in the course of this debate, denied that Fianna Fáil had done anything to help the people who were in need of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that the need for houses is far from being fully met.  I know that it will be a considerable number of years before the housing requirements of this city alone are met.  They can only be met by the united efforts of every man and every woman who has the interests of this nation at heart. <Col N="2409" /> So far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we have made it quite clear on numerous occasions that we are prepared to co-operate to the fullest extent possible in helping to bring about a solution of the housing difficulty.  The housing difficulty is like the emigration problem; it probably will never be fully solved.  It certainly will not be fully met so long as there are people coming from the rural areas into the city.  That is a problem that will have to be met as well.  It will, perhaps, be met by the decentralisation of industries.</P>
    <P>I want to finish on this note.  I want to say that we are very proud of the fact that the present Government is reaping where we have sown.  I only hope that when they have reaped the full harvest of what we have sown, they will sow as good a harvest or that they will sow as well as we have sown, so that they may reap as good a harvest as they are now reaping from what we have sown.  Whether they have the desire, the energy or the unity as a Government to achieve that is another thing.  It is on that particular phase that I have my only doubts.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the merits of any disputes in progress outside but I have had the unfortunate experience within the last few days of being given a perfect example of how a Coalition Government with Ministers holding diametrically opposed views cannot agree on a simple solution to bring to an end a dispute that is causing grave inconvenience and hardship to innocent people.  I fear very much that what happens in that minor phase will happen to a greater extent in the major phase.  I hope it will not happen but I fear that as a result of the make-up of the present Government, it is difficult to secure the type of unity that is so essential to the interests and the welfare of the people of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSheehan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief in the remarks I have to make.  This Vote on Account has been discussed very broadly from all sides of the House.  The Minister has been complimented by members of the Government Parties and criticised by our friends on the opposite side.  Fair criticism is justified but I have noticed <Col N="2410" /> that every Deputy who has spoken in this House for the last year has invariably put forward a demand for something &mdash; better housing, more houses, increases in wages, pensions and a general improvement in conditions all round.  The Government are doing everything possible to bring about this improvement but still they are being criticised.  The two main problems I see confronting this country are housing and unemployment.  We have heard a lot in the last few days about external assets.  I should like to ask what does a poor family living down in a back lane in Cork City know about external assets?  All they are concerned about is a decent home to live in and employment for their sons and daughters.  I would suggest to members of all Parties that they should join in one bold effort to try to solve the housing problem.  It is hard for our people to lead decent lives in the conditions in which they are living.  I know large families in Cork living in one small room and the same remarks apply to Dublin and other parts of the country.  I think it would be more fitting for members of all Parties to direct their energies to a solution of that problem.  The Minister for Health has brought forward big schemes of hospitalisation.  In fact, I think these schemes are crazy.  I suggest to the Minister that he should call a halt to these big schemes and devote more of the proposed expenditure to the provision of housing.  I do not think that you would need so many hospitals if our people had good houses.  If the Minister were to do as I suggest, we would have a better race and a healthier and happier people.  Up and down the country you see considerable activity and there is a good deal of land reclamation work in progress.  All that is a good sign.</P>
      <P>Running the country is just the same as running your business.  If you intend to expand any business, you must be prepared to spend more capital.  The same applies to the administration of the country, and the money spent in that direction is money well spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment all the Ministers of this Government, because I know they have their shoulders to the wheel.  All they want is co-operation. <Col N="2411" /> If we all co-operate for a year or two I believe we will go a long way towards solving the unemployment question and the housing problem.</P>
    <P>As regards our workers, I will say that the workers in this country are second to none.  We have men here who will do anything for you if they are led properly and given a little bit of encouragement and treated well.  I know that, because I deal largely with labour.  We have men in this country who will do any kind of work for you and give you satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I appeal to members of all Parties to join in one united effort and try to solve these two great problems, housing and emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Davin, in the course of his remarks, invited Deputies from all sides of the House to make suggestions as to how the cost of houses might be reduced, I think I might start my remarks by pointing out to him and to all others concerned one or two ways by which the Government could reduce the cost of houses.</P>
      <P>Deputies are aware that the interest charges on loans were increased by this Government from 2½ to 3¼ per cent. That represents an increase of 30 per cent. spread over the years.  That is a big burden on the cost of houses.  It is one of the means whereby the cost of housing could be reduced.  Reduce the interest charges to their former level, from 3¼ to 2½ per cent., and you will have taken one step towards reducing housing costs.  I hope Deputy Davin and those who think with him will use their influence with the Government to bring about that contribution towards the solution of the housing problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another item that enters very largely into housing at the present time is cement.  Here, again, Deputy Davin and his colleagues might approach the Government with a view to getting them to abandon the policy of putting a tax on Irish-produced cement of 15/-per ton to subsidise foreign importations, to provide employment abroad, instead of either extending the existing cement factories here to meet all our requirements or erecting a new factory.  Claims for a new factory have <Col N="2412" /> been made from many parts of the country, north, south, east and west.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, speaking in Boston some six months after taking over control, is reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of September 22nd, 1948, as saying:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2413" />&ldquo;We can boast of having to our foreign credit assets amounting to $2,000,000,000 in sterling.  Our external debt is negligible and no nation in the world is more credit-worthy. Our national credit is so high at home that all funds necessary for the capital improvement of the nation can be secured from our own people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the situation six months after the present Government took over.  Since then I understand this Government have had difficulties in obtaining the moneys they require for their programme.  What has happened that has altered the situation &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; if they cannot now make a similar claim as to the financial standing of the country?  The Estimates that have been presented to the House constitute, in my opinion, a staggering figure and no matter who says to the contrary, I believe that this is a matter that every Deputy should seriously ponder over.  At the present time there is an outcry all over the country for a reduction of rates.  Here in Dáil Éireann we should set a good example.  The Minister for Agriculture, a few months ago, intimated to the local authorities that they could compel the county managers arbitrarily to reduce the rates.  Why could we not apply the same thing here and set them a good example?  The Minister would then be quite right in appealing to the local authorities but, having first imposed additional charges on them, it sounds ridiculous for any Minister to tell them, without intimating the items on which a reduction could be brought about, that they can arbitrarily reduce the rates.  It simply cannot be done.  You might as well say you can arbitrarily reduce these Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are spending at the rate of £1,500,000 per week.  What is the limit of our resources?  How long can that continue?  When is it going to stop? It is progressively increasing and you can, if you wish to make a point against me, say that this increase has been going on for the past ten years.  During six of those years there was at least a <Col N="2414" /> justification for it.  Undoubtedly, there was a world war, the greatest the world has ever known, when the cost of everything jumped.  In addition, provision had to be made for defence &mdash; it has not to be provided now &mdash; on a vast scale.  In 1946-47, the last complete year of the Fianna Fáil administration, the Estimate was £52,000,000 odd.  This year it is £78,000,000 odd, a 50 per cent. increase in a couple of years.  It is all very fine if the country can afford to continue that colossal rate of expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Deputy in the course of his speech, and I am not going to follow any of the red herrings which he may draw across the floor.  We hear cries of sabotage from the other side of the House when there is any criticism levelled at Ministers on account of their policy.  Have we now reached the stage when it is a crime to criticise any ministerial act?  If those opposite want to look for the source of sabotage they should examine their own consciences.  I am sorry Deputy S. Collins is not here.  In his speech the other night I heard him issue certain threats to the banks.  By doing so he was only following the example of some of his leaders on the Front Bench who have issued similar threats.  Is that the best way, the Government consider, they can get the necessary financial accommodation to enable them to carry on their programme?  I do not think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to follow the arguments put forward by so many other speakers as to the advisability of paying as you go.  I think the Government would be well advised to reconsider the whole situation and, in the interests of the people, ascertain whether it is not better policy to pay your way as you go rather than to borrow.  The attitude of the Minister for Finance seems to me: &ldquo;What has posterity ever done for me?&rdquo;  I think one could retort and say: &ldquo;What has posterity ever done to him that he should unload a burden on it?&rdquo;  Why should we not have the moral courage to face up to our responsibilities now, <Col N="2415" /> as had been done by Fianna Fáil for 16 years, and pay our way as we go?  If we did that we would undoubtedly have the confidence of the general public to whom the Government have to appeal and not of the few so-called financial magnates.</P>
    <P>This Government, in order to get control of the country with the other Parties forming the Coalition, promised very many things.  I suppose it is only honest to admit that at the time they made those promises they had not the faintest hope of being called on to implement them.  They promised, amongst other things, to reduce taxation by £10,000,000.  I can give the quotations if necessary.  Deputy Mulcahy, Leader of the Fine Gael Party, and now Minister for Education, in the course of various speeches said there would be no difficulty at all in reducing taxation.  Several of the present Ministers, notably the Minister for External Affairs, said it was a simple matter to reduce taxation by 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>Another promise this Government made was that of full employment. They could not understand at the time why employment could not be guaranteed for every man with a satisfactory wage which some of them went on to describe as £6 per week.  We were to have Utopia with a change of Government.  A certain percentage of the people in the City of Dublin were deceived by these promises, and that is what brought about the change of Government.  The people in the country, being more astute, were not deceived.  The attractive programme that was put before the people was a promise of £6 a week for every man who wanted work; old age pensions at 26/- a week, for women at 60 and for men at 65 to be further increased to 36/- after five years.</P>

      <P>I think that in future I will only answer through the Chair, because it is obvious that an old campaigner like Deputy Davin is up to his usual tricks.  I can give him chapter and verse for any statement I make. <Col N="2416" /> Deputy Davin is anxious for the quotation. I am quoting from the <i>Midland Tribune</i> of 31st January, 1948. The Minister for External Affairs, speaking at Birr, is reported in it as having said that social services on a similar level to those in the Six Counties could be provided, where women at 60 and men at 65 receive 26/- a week and at the age of 65 and 70, respectively, receive 36/- a week.</P>

Every boy and girl in the country was to be educated up to university standard, free, gratis and for nothing.</P>

      <P>I very rarely interrupt any speaker on any side of the House and, surely, in the circumstances I am entitled to be heard.  Furthermore, I want to warn those Deputies who appear anxious to interrupt me that they are not going to put me off.  With regard to the cost of living, we are told, of course, that we can get all the flour we want at 7/- per stone; all the tea we want at 5/6 per lb., sugar at 7½d. per lb. and butter at 3/3 per lb.  Butter is the latest addition to the &ldquo;grey&rdquo; market for those who can afford it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Immediately on the change of Government there was a whoop of joy from the ranchers of this country that <Col N="2417" /> at last they were being rid of the obligation to produce food for our people. To my knowledge, one of them let out to grass no less than 200 acres.  They were very glad of the change of Government.  Is this policy of the Government one to prepare for the future in the event of any emergency arising?  Fianna Fáil stood for the encouragement of tillage and the production here at home of our own requirements in that respect so far as it was possible to do so.  To-day we are confronted, amongst other things, with an increase in the cost of seeds.  Leading varieties of wheat are costing to-day 115/- a barrel.  The same thing applies to oats and barley and even to grass and clover seed.  There has been an increase since last year of 27 per cent. in the cost of certain of these seeds, despite the many promises of the Minister for Agriculture during the past 12 months or two years.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of employment. In 1947, there was an increase in the numbers employed of approximately 19,000, showing that the work done by the Fianna Fáil Government in preparation for the post-war period was bearing fruit and is still, I am glad to say, bearing fruit.  In 1947, 19,000 additional workers were given employment.  That was the year when we had the greatest spate of adverse criticism from those who form the present Government.  We were told during the election campaign that they had a solution for the problem of emigration. The year 1947 is remarkable for this fact, that possibly for the first time since the famine, the first time in 100 years, when people were free to emigrate, emigration had ceased. Instead of emigration from the country, we had an influx of people into this country of between 7,000 and 8,000.</P>
    <P>Then, in the spring of 1948, we had a change of Government and, unfortunately, the old policy of emigration has been resumed, despite all the promises made by the Parties opposite that they had certain solutions which would put a stop to emigration.  The last speaker and Deputies Davin and Sheehan referred to the necessity for the provision of houses.  Some other Deputies tried to create the impression that during the period of office of <Col N="2418" /> Fianna Fáil they had failed to provide a solution of the housing problem.  On the contrary, there had been a progressive increase in the output of houses from 1932 to 1939, up to the advent of the war.  During the last year in which the housing programme was further developed after the war, we had an output of 18,000 houses.  It will take the present administration a considerable time before they attain that figure.  During the Fianna Fáil regime, no fewer than 143,000 houses were provided. Were it not for the advent of the war in 1939, the continuation of that programme or an acceleration of the production of 18,000 houses per year would have seen the end of the housing problem many years ago.  Like other Deputies, I sincerely hope that this Government will beat that programme. That should be their aim and their ambition.  But, in order to do so, they will at least have to take the steps which I have outlined in my opening remarks to reduce the cost and I see no reason why that should not be done.  I am sure that many Deputies on the opposite benches will agree with me in that.</P>
    <P>I think I have established that during its period of office, despite the adverse criticism to which we have been listening for some time, far from Fianna Fáil failing to implement its programme, it is the one Party in the public life of this country which carried out the programme which it placed before the people.  That is why during its period of office the people as a whole had confidence in it and why it was never faced with the financial troubles which the present Government have had to face.</P>

      <P>This debate on the Vote on Account, in my opinion, has been a rather poor one so far as the contributions we have had from the Opposition are concerned.  From the first speech that we heard from Deputy Aiken, followed by various other semi-serious and jocose speeches, it has become more and more apparent that with regard to this important matter of the Vote on Account the Opposition have not yet made up their minds as to what their attitude is or is likely to be.  So far as Deputy <Col N="2419" /> Lemass expressed an opinion last night, it was to the effect that the Estimates contained in this Vote did not constitute a sum about which he would have any serious trouble.  The same view has been expressed by some other Deputies opposite, such as Deputy O'Grady.</P>
      <P>One of the difficulties the Opposition must encounter in a matter of this kind is that these Estimates represent the implementation by this Government of its assurance to the people two years ago with regard to public expenditure and the rebuilding of this country.  In his first Vote on Account in the early months of 1948, the Minister for Finance stated the view of the Government with regard to this matter when he expressed the view, and it was also the view of his Government, that the wasteful expenditure, which had been criticised for a number of years and which had been indulged in by the Fianna Fáil Administration, should stop.  He expressed that view then and he was immediately criticised by the Opposition.  He was accused of being interested in economy merely for economy's sake.  At that time the Minister further said that, once the mess had been cleared up, more and more money would be required for capital projects for the development of our country.  That view was clearly expressed two years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the policy contained in that view has been carried out and is fully justified.  Wasteful expenditure has been stopped.  We are now reaching the stage when the Government can concentrate on greater capital development here and the spending of more money on the things that will pay us best in the years that he ahead and help us in some way to solve the outstanding problems of unemployment, emigration, bad housing and so on. No Opposition Party with any real interest in its future as a political Party could express any antipathy to that. I suppose this is the most important debate from the point of view of the Opposition.  Yet, we are presented here with the spectacle of Opposition Deputies afraid to commit their Party <Col N="2420" /> to any firm opposition to these Estimates and afraid to attack the Book of Estimates on any principle.  We are confronted with the spectacle of an Opposition Party concentrating merely on insignificant trivial points.  We are confronted with an Opposition afraid to take a firm stand.  I think that line of approach by the Opposition has been typified in particular by Deputy Major de Valera.  Deputy Major de Valera seems to regard verbosity as wisdom.  He spent an hour and a quarter last night and an hour and a quarter to-day winding himself into a cocoon of hysterical questions posed by himself: I simply ask if such and such a thing is wise; I simply ask this and I simply ask that.  Never once did he express his own view or his own opinion. While that type of contribution may fill the pages of the <i>Irish Press</i> for the edification of its readers, it is no real contribution to our deliberations here.  Deputy Major de Valera wonders if it is wise to borrow money to build hospitals or to provide better housing.  In expressing his wonder, he is willing to wound but still afraid to strike.  As a responsible Deputy, I think the very least he could do is to tell us what his view is and the view of his Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Major de Valera, following the line of approach of other Opposition speakers, endeavoured to throw doubt on the Government's decision to invest more of our savings in the solution of national problems.  He, together with other Deputies of his Party, criticised some remarks passed by the Minister for External Affairs some years ago.  I do not think it was necessary to do that.  This Government's policy with regard to the repatriation of our assets has been stated clearly and unequivocally quite recently by the Taoiseach. He stated that it was the view of the Government that there was under-investment at home and that our assets abroad should be used in the development of our country.  The Taoiseach, in expressing that view, committed the Government to the pursuance of a certain line of policy.  Needless to say, the Taoiseach also expressed his appreciation of the fact, and I am sure this fact is appreciated by most Deputies, that that process of repatriation could <Col N="2421" /> not be an immediate one but would have to be a gradual one over a period.</P>
    <P>I take it that the reason for presenting these Estimates under two headings is to enable Deputies in the years that lie ahead to see that that policy is being carried out.  When the Taoiseach made that statement concerning the repatriation of our assets, I noted with interest that there was not a single comment on his speech by any responsible member of the Opposition.  It was perfectly clear that even in relation to a matter of such importance to the country the Opposition was afraid to say clearly and definitely whether or not that policy was one that commended itself to them.  They preferred to sit tight so that, no matter what the consequences might be, they could never be convicted of having held a clear opinion. Their conduct in that particular respect reminds me of their antics 12 months ago in relation to the declaration of the Republic, antics epitomized by their Leader, who expressed the profound opinion that &ldquo;It could be a good thing or it could be a bad thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But it is rather difficult &mdash; viewing that silence of the Opposition with regard to this important matter in the last 12 months, and considering at the same time the highly conservative views expressed by them before they left office and particularly at the time of the passage of the Central Bank Bill through this House &mdash; to understand the speech made by Deputy Major de Valera this afternoon who has, apparently, claimed for Fianna Fáil the discovery of the benefits of repatriating our foreign assets.  I do not understand why, if Fianna Fáil are now so enthusiastic about this matter, they were reluctant to take that stand in the past. It may be that, having held aloof and having been careful not to express an opinion up to this, they now appreciate the benefits that are going to come from this policy and its real significance to the future of this country.  The policy of investing some of the idle money in productive matters in this country is something which has been necessary for a great number of years.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that before Fianna Fáil came into office &mdash; in the days of the first Government here &mdash; the Government which Deputy Major de <Col N="2422" /> Valera has criticised this afternoon &mdash; during the ten years the Cumann na nGaedheal Government was in office, this very process was going ahead and was being put into operation and, in connection with that policy and its execution, a large degree of effort came from the very man who is our present Minister for Finance.  In the days before Fianna Fáil came into office, capital investments of a very considerable nature were made on projects of a productive kind and on projects which have stood the test of time.  It was during those days that the waters of the Shannon were harnessed to give us the Electricity Supply scheme.  It was during those days that the present Minister for Finance who was then the Minister for Industry and Commerce preached the gospel of investing the moneys of our people in a project of imagination and of considerable size so that from that capital investment our people could derive employment and power for many years to come.  When that policy was being carried out the Government of that time met with opposition from the Party opposite.  I think it was Deputy Aiken &mdash; I am sure that if I am wrong in this he will correct me &mdash; who described the Shannon scheme as a white elephant, a waste of money and something that should not have been carried out or considered by a sane Government.</P>

      <P>If it was not Deputy Aiken it was Deputy MacEntee.  That was the attitude of and the view expressed by the Fianna Fáil Opposition in those days.  Despite that, we now have Deputy Major de Valera coming in here to criticise the Fine Gael Party.  I wonder if any member of the Party opposite appreciates <Col N="2423" /> what would have been the position of this country during the days of the emergency if we had not had the Shannon scheme and the sugar factories which also were described in those days as white elephants.  What would have been our position if we had not had any projects of that kind supplying the requirements and needs of our people &mdash; projects commenced by a policy of capital investment such as is contained and envisaged in these Estimates to-day.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies opposite have criticised the division of these Estimates into capital items and ordinary other service items.  It has been suggested that the Government should not borrow money from the people, that is, that the Government should not ask the people to invest money in the items set out in the summary of capital services in this Book of Estimates.  I find it difficult to follow the reasoning behind that view.  I cannot understand why it is unwise to ask people who have idle money to invest that money in building houses for the people of Dublin and for the people throughout the country as a whole.  Why is that unwise?  If that is not unwise why is it suggested that when the Minister for Finance borrows money for that purpose he is doing something wrong? If that is unwise &mdash; as has been suggested by the Party opposite &mdash; it is something that has been the practice in this country and in every other country in Western Europe for many years back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not suppose there is a local authority anywhere in this country that does not carry out its housing programme by borrowing the money for that purpose and it was never suggested that there was anything unwise about it because it is the common-sense approach to a problem of that kind. We hope that the houses we are building in this country to-day will constitute shelter and a source of comfort to generations of our people in the years that lie ahead.  At the same time, the houses which are being built by the authorities will represent a source of income in the years that lie ahead.  I cannot understand the opposition <Col N="2424" /> expressed to capital expenditure of that kind.</P>
    <P>There are, also, other items in this summary of capital services to which, apparently, objection is being taken. I should like to know, if, for instance, it is suggested that the sum of £3,000,000, mentioned in this summary for land reclamation, is being spent on an item which will not be productive and yield a return.  All the other items contained in that summary seem to me to be items from which a clear return can be expected in the future.</P>
    <P>I was rather astonished also to learn from one of the Deputies opposite that they are opposed to asking our people to invest their money in building hospitals and in bettering the health services of this country.  It seems difficult to understand why that objection should be expressed but, as I understand it, it is felt, certainly by one of the Deputies opposite, that the building of hospitals and the bettering of our health services, while they may be good things, nevertheless do not represent avenues of expenditure from which a return can be expected. Apparently it is regarded by Opposition Deputies, or some of them, as a non-productive type of expenditure. In my view while the return may not be seen in perhaps the same way as the return from land reclamation can be seen, nevertheless it is true that a healthier race and healthier men will produce more because a healthier man is able to work harder and his output is considerably higher.  I think it wrong to suggest that the expenditure of money on hospitals and on better health services is an expenditure of a non-productive kind.  Again, under this Government's policy we hope and expect that the hospitals built will be there long after the necessity for them has ceased.  Certainly they will be there for many years to come.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to two other matters before I conclude.  It has been suggested by some Deputies opposite, with reference to the devaluation difficulty last September, that the Government knowing that it was coming, should have acted in some way other than they did act.  Deputy Vivion de Valera spent some precious 20 minutes <Col N="2425" /> of his two and a half hours in posing the question: was it a good thing or was it a bad thing that we devalued our currency with the British last September?  I wonder what would Deputy de Valera have said at an Irish cattle fair if it is his view, as apparently it is, that we should have maintained the nominal value of our pound last September?  What would he have said, in the event of our cattle export trade and our export trade generally, being destroyed overnight?  Perhaps he might have expressed the view then that &ldquo;it could be a good thing and it could be a bad thing.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera referred to that matter.  I should like to deal with another matter which has been referred to quite deliberately by a number of speakers opposite.  It is on the question of borrowing money <Col N="2426" /> for these capital services.  I took Deputy Vivion de Valera as saying that the Government were proposing to borrow this money without making any adequate provision for repayment.  I should like to know what was the purpose behind that statement and for what reason it was made here.  I can only brand that statement as a deliberate effort to interfere with the investment desired and intended in this Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies opposite have suggested in their speeches that this country is not credit-worthy.  It has been suggested that by reason of the fact that two loans have been sought in the last 18 months, in some way the credit of the country has suffered, and that in some way the Government have acted unwisely.  I can only regard statements of that kind, which must be known to the speakers to be untrue, as deliberate efforts to be harmful.  All of us know and every Deputy in the Party opposite us knows, that we have, and have had for many generations now, a surfeit of savings of a nonproductive kind and that there has been, and is now, an urgent necessity for investing the savings of our people in capital projects of the kind intended.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>Deputies will see that the additions required are under four heads, but the two main heads are H and K &mdash; that is to say, the printing and the binding of publications that come from the Stationery Office.  For a long time, on account of the scarcity of skilled labour, it has not been possible to secure the services required.  Latterly there has been a considerable increase in output and that has led to accounts being sent in and a speedier settlement being required.  That refers to sub-heads H and K more particularly.</P>
      <P>With regard to sub-head G, although I made a cut last year in the Estimate I said I would consider bringing it back, paying, as far as the periodicals published in Irish were concerned, the same amount as was paid in the year before.  That is the reason for the additional sum of £2,500.  There is a little saving on the Vote over last year, but that is in respect of the publication of current news in Irish.  There is not much actually in the way of saving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2428" /> The difference in regard to sub-head J &mdash; Miscellaneous Office Supplies &mdash; is due to this, that more machinery is necessary.

      <P>The purpose for which this money is required is to meet increased payments, consisting of a grant of £3,000 to the Irish Tourist Association. The original Estimate of £30,000 for the Tourist Board provided for a payment of £5,825 for the Tourist Association, but during the year it emerged that it was inadequate to meet the needs of the association, particularly the advertising campaign in America, and an additional sum of £3,000 was paid by the board to the Tourist Association.</P>
      <P>Under the publicity scheme adopted by the O.E.E.C. for a joint campaign on behalf of a number of European countries to encourage Americans to visit Europe, a sum of £1,000 is necessary, and an additional sum of £600 to send a delegation to the United States under the E.C.A. auspices.  The national tourist organisations were launched at the end of last year and they adopted a joint scheme of publicity in America.  Under that scheme the total amount which this country is obliged to contribute is $15,000.  It seems more appropriate that this money should be paid from the Department of Industry and Commerce rather than from the Tourist Board.  The amount required for the expenses incurred up to 31st March is £1,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, as the House is aware, a delegation consisting of four persons visited the United States recently under the E.C.A. auspices and the sum which it is necessary for the Department to meet amounts to £600.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is only a token Vote.  As Deputies will see it involves payments under four headings.  The first heading is sub-head H &mdash; subscriptions to certain international organisations. This is the sub-head which I discussed on the other Vote so that I do not think anything arises on it. The second one is sub-head H.H. &mdash; Chicago Trade Fair.  It was decided to hold a trade fair in Chicago under O.E.E.C. auspices from the 7th to the 19th August this year.  It is organised as a joint European exhibition with a view to participation by exhibitors from this country.  The O.E.E.C. authorities have requested the various participating countries to encourage exhibitors to participate in the fair. The Government decided that this country should be represented, but it was found that the cost of exhibiting for any single firm was high, and, consequently, with a view to encouraging individual participation by Irish firms, the Government decided to defray the cost of renting space at the fair for Irish exhibitors, and of providing basic uniform display equipment at an all-in cost of $6.50 per square foot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated total cost of a booth is approximately £1,000, and the Government is putting up £250.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to book with the fair authorities <Col N="2433" /> the total space required by Irish exhibitors.  The space which is booked must be booked in advance and accompanied by a deposit of 50 per cent. of the rental which is three dollars per square foot.  It is anticipated that the Irish participation will include an information bureau in addition to the commercial exhibits.  The Irish participation has not yet been settled.  A number of firms have intimated their willingness to participate, and some others are considering their participation.</P>
    <P>The third sub-head, N (1), is in respect of advances to Mianrai, Teo. Under the Minerals Company Act, 1947, the company was entitled, within a limit of £50,000, to spend money on the development and working of the coal field at Slievardagh.  The original estimate for the current year was £25,000.  As the House will remember, during the course of the debate on the Minerals Company (Amendment) Act which was passed recently it was explained that the original sum was inadequate to meet the increased expenditure which the company felt to be necessary, as a result of the difficulties in working the deposit there. The work proved to be both more costly and more troublesome than had been anticipated.  The additional sum is required to meet the expenses incurred up to the end of the current financial year.  The company expect they will have available the coal-washing plant which they propose to purchase.  Under the recent amending Act, the total advances will amount to the sum of £88,000 &mdash; £50,000 originally advanced under the 1947 Act, and a further £38,000 under the amending Act.</P>
    <P>As regards the last sub-head S &mdash; Appropriations in Aid &mdash; the original Estimate anticipated that the sales of turf during 1949/50 season would yield £355,500.  The sales, however, have amounted to approximately £130,000 and, consequently, the estimate has to be increased by £225,500.  The reduction in the sales of turf is attributed to a number of causes, principally the non-availability of turf during April and May, 1949, and to competition from low priced hand-won turf in some of the western areas.  Probably the main <Col N="2434" /> factor has been the fine weather which prevailed during the present winter and also during the greater part of last spring and, in addition, there were the initial difficulties attending the development of new markets.  It is estimated that the present stocks of turf unsold amount to about 80,000 tons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Keyes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £516,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including Grants to Local Authorities, Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, and Miscellaneous Grants.</P>
      <P>As to sub-head I (1), in the course of his Financial Statement of 4th May, 1948, the Minister for Finance announced that he had decided that for advances made from the 5th May, 1948, onwards, from the Local Loans Fund to local authorities the rate of interest would be increased from 2½ per cent. to 3¼ per cent. per annum, but that it was proposed to alleviate the effects of this increase in the case of housing schemes of local authorities.  It was decided that the adjustment of State subsidies for the housing schemes in question arising out of the increase in the Local Loans Fund lending rate from 2½ per cent. to 3¼ per cent. would take the form of a non-statutory special interest subsidy equivalent to the addition to the loan charges incurred on these schemes from the date of the increase. This special interest subsidy is being charged to sub-head I (1) of the Vote for Local Government but is being shown separately from the statutory contributions towards loan charges authorised under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1949, which are also provided for in sub-head I (1).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £16,000 is, therefore, required to recoup the housing authorities accordingly. <Col N="2435" /> Provision is being made in the Vote for the recoupment in order to preserve the statutory position of the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>As to sub-head I (3) &mdash; Grants under the Housing (Amendment) Acts, 1948 and 1949 &mdash; this Supplementary Estimate is required to meet further expenditure on the payment of housing grants authorised under Sections 16 to 21 inclusive and Section 25 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948.  A maximum on the total amount which could be paid under these sections was fixed by sub-section (2) of Section 26 of the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, at £580,000 and under the Housing (Amendment) Act, 1949, the statutory maximum was extended from £580,000 to £1,750,000.  When the latter Bill became law, a Supplementary Estimate of £250,000 was passed by the House in July last.  At that time, I pointed out that the extra money thus provided would not suffice to meet outgoings for the whole of the remaining portion of the financial year and that a further Supplementary Estimate would be necessary when the additional sum needed to pay grants up to the end of the financial year could be ascertained. The Supplementary Estimate now before the Dáil is for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The present Estimate, in conjunction with the original Vote of £300,000 and the supplementary £250,000 granted last July, represents a total expenditure of £1,050,000.  While the scales of the grants are higher than those paid in the past, the expenditure nevertheless represents a highly satisfactory rate of progress in the building and reconstruction of houses.</P>
    <P>The Housing (Amendment) Act, 1948, was passed in January, 1948.  By the 31st December, 1948, 2,842 new houses had been approved for grants and the amount of the grant had been fully paid in 125 and partly paid in 368 cases.  During the ensuing 12 months 5,924 grants were allocated for new houses, 1,933 grants were fully paid and instalments were paid in a further 2,447 cases.  In regard to the reconstruction of houses by small-holders and agricultural labourers, in the course of 1948, the reconstruction of <Col N="2436" /> 2,022 houses was approved and full grants or instalments were issued in 215 cases.  During 1949, 3,429 reconstruction grants were allocated and payments were made in 1,941 cases. In all, £955,000 was paid under the Housing (Amendment) Acts, 1948 and 1949, in respect of new house and reconstruction grants during 1949 as compared with £119,000 in 1948.  Indeed, this latter figure was almost equalled during the past month for, in February alone, some 850 grant payments, aggregating nearly £117,000, were made.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending the 31st day of March, 1950, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sums required come under several heads, but there are savings on other sub-heads of the Vote which meet the additional expenditure envisaged, with the exception of £10. The first sub-head in regard of which there is an increase is in respect of travelling expenses.  That increase becomes necessary, partly because during the year the mileage rate allowed to various officers of the Department has increased, and is in part due to the fact that when the last Estimate was made the venue of the meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organisation was not determined and it was thought it would likely meet in some place in Europe.  It subsequently transpired that it would be held in Washington and provision in dollars had to be made in that connection.  It is right that the House should know that, whereas under the existing arrangement, the contribution made by this country was $53,000, as a result of representations made to the relevant sub-committee at the conference <Col N="2437" /> last December Ireland's contribution was reduced to $44,500 and we are not without hope that, on a further review which is at present being made, it will be further reduced to $36,000.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (3) relates to the contributions made to a variety of international agricultural organisations to which we belong &mdash; the International Dairy Federation, the International Veterinary Bureau, the International Committee for Control of Colorado Beetle and the International Wheat Council.  A good many of these subscriptions are payable in dollars and that is one reason why it became necessary to increase the appropriation consequent on devaluation.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (4) refers to a grant made to University College to conduct a special investigation into the methods appropriate for the control of potato root eel worm.  Unfortunately, in the Athlone area we had built up a very satisfactory business of growing seed potatoes but, owing to the practice which has grown up of growing potatoes repeatedly on the same land, this pest appeared.  Our certificate, which is internationally accepted, guarantees that no seed potatoes are produced on any land where potato eel worm has been discovered.  The result is that we have been obliged to restrict the seed potato industry, for the time being in any case, in that area.  We are taking steps however, to provide substitute occupation in the form of producing soft fruits for jam manufacture in order to compensate those who can no longer grow seed potatoes for export.</P>
    <P>Sub-head F (1) refers to additional moneys required for the schools and farms.  The principal part is £47,690, which included the purchase price of a farm at Grange.  Grange is about 21 miles from Dublin.  We had a place called Chantilly, near Foxrock, where all pedigree live stock were assembled and vetted prior to distribution through the country.  We held that on a series of leases of a most complicated nature and we paid a substantial rent for it.  It was not a very convenient <Col N="2438" /> place and, in the course of time, it became completely built up.  We wanted a farm where the business of supplying liquid milk to the City of Dublin could be conducted with a view to determining in some measure what the economics of that business were. We wanted a farm where we could maintain a central depot for artificial insemination.  It was the complex of these two considerations that indicated Grange, because one of the essentials for successful artificial insemination is to have a supply of proven bulls.  The difficulty of proving bulls is that you cannot declare a bull to be a proven bull until its daughters have entered their first lactation; and, by the time the first progency of a bull have entered their first lactation, the bull is over five years old.</P>
    <P>Ordinarily in the country farmers do not like having old bulls because they have a tendency to get a bit cross.  Our purpose therefore is, as pedigree bulls are assembled for distribution, to have them recorded at Grange farm, to record their female progeny and to keep a watch on the female progeny out in the country; and, if the records from the country substantially confirm our own records at Grange, we will classify such a bull to be a proven bull and use him in the artificial insemination centres for the three or four remaining years of his useful life. Grange, therefore, is designed to fill three essential purposes and most of the expense will be offset by the saving on the surrender of our leasehold at Chantilly.  This sub-head also makes provision for Johnstown Agricultural College.  The increase there is largely due to the happy success of the soil-testing service which is operated there and which has resulted in the employment of additional staff made necessary by the demands coming in from the country.  We now have three complete soil-testing units and we are in a position to return any soil sample submitted to us within ten days of its submission with the appropriate report.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (5) is the scheme I have referred to as the soft fruit substitute for the seed potato business which we have had to discourage in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2439" /> Sub-head H (2) is the provision we must make in this year for the parish scheme under which it is proposed, where the county committee desires to undertake the work, that the advisory and technical staff of the county committee will be transferred to the Department, together with the services of such agricultural instructors as the county committee may then have in their service.  If the county committee, for instance, has two instructors they will be transferred or seconded to us but the county committee will continue to pay their salaries.  We will ascertain the total number of parishes in the area and to each three parishes there will be allocated a parish agent who will thereafter represent in that area the Department of Agriculture for all its several services, there being maintained, as there always has been in the Department, a staff of specialists on whom the parish agent will call if he finds himself confronted with any particular problem that requires specialist attention for its solution and resolution. Inasmuch as the scheme is not yet under way, I do not propose to dwell unduly on it now as it will be more appropriate to speak comprehensively on it when the main Estimate is being discussed by the House.</P>
    <P>Sub-head K represents a special grant to enable Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann to defray the expenses of demonstrations given in potato silage. We are beholden to Comhlucht Siuicre Éireann for their enterprise in securing the appropriate equipment.  This grant is one for which, in my opinion, we are getting very good value.  That company brought the plant from farm to farm and undertook to boil potatoes in bulk lots for ensiling on the farmers' premises.  Anyone engaged in pig feeding in this country may rest assured that there is no more economic or advantageous method of providing the basic diet of a considerable herd of pigs other than of ensiling potatoes and thereby avoiding all the complications of sprouting in the pit and so forth.</P>
    <P>Sub-head M (14) is a sub-head in which I take some pride because it is the one under which we launched the scheme for the control of contagious <Col N="2440" /> abortion and for the elimination of fluke, stomach worms and hoose in cattle.  In certain other countries no less than three or four attempts were made to initiate a system of universal inoculation of cows and heifers against contagious abortion and every attempt petered out.  Fortunately here, it took on from the very outset.  All the veterinary surgeons, on whose assistance we have so successfully depended, have been working overtime and we have actually distributed 110,000 doses.  I might add that our highest hopes had not induced us to make provision for more than 40,000 doses.  I know this extra expenditure will be warmly welcomed by the House, more especially as I am in a position to tell the House that to my own personal knowledge in two herds where the incidence of contagious abortion was from three to five cases every year for many years past no case of contagious abortion has occurred during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>In regard to hoose and stomach worms, our first venture was in Loophead. We have since pressed forward on those lines throughout the country. I was happy to hear from the parish priest of Bansha the day before yesterday that, whereas losses among calves had been proverbially heavy in that area from this disease, during last winter not one single calf was lost from any of these three conditions in the whole of that parish.</P>
    <P>Sub-head O &mdash; flour and wheaten meal subsidies.  This is a provision made in respect of subsidy on flour.</P>
    <P>Sub-head Q &mdash; This provision is made to enable Messrs. Grain Importers (Eire) Limited to be recouped the loss incurred by them on the disposal of oatmeal imported under the following circumstances.</P>
    <P>The 1947 oats acreage was 826,362, the total production of oats being 652,850 tons.  The annual requirements of the Irish Oatmeal Millers are about 40,000 tons of oats &mdash; sufficient to produce about 20,000 tons of oatmeal. According to a statement furnished by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the oatmeal millers obtained only about 20,000 tons of oats from the 1947 crop and towards the end of that year, the Department of Industry and <Col N="2441" /> Commerce came to the conclusion that, in the circumstances, and in view of a shortage of other cereals, the import of oats or oatmeal was necessary to make up the expected deficiency, that is, approximately 20,000 tons of oats or 10,000 tons of oatmeal.  In view of the high price of Australian oats, the non-availability of Canadian oats, and the danger of oat imports being counted against the allocation of other cereals, Industry and Commerce considered that imports should be in the form of oatmeal.  After consultation between that Department and the Flake Oatmeal Millers' Association, Messrs.  Grain Importers (Eire) Limited were instructed to buy 5,000 tons of Canadian and 4,000 tons of Australian oatmeal.  The quantity purchased was 8,835 tons&mdash;4,973 Canadian; 3,862 Australian&mdash;at a landed price of approximately £50 per ton.  At this price only 3,300 tons approximately were sold to oatmeal millers.</P>
    <P>Owing to the bumper oats harvest of 1948&mdash;880,083 acres; 792,100 tons&mdash; Grain Importers were unable to dispose of the remaining 5,500 tons of oatmeal, in which maggots had appeared, to the oatmeal millers at £50 per ton. Bids were invited from the Flake Oatmeal Millers' Association, who declined to make any offer as they considered that the oatmeal had deteriorated, and was unfit for human consumption. The flour millers also declined to use the oatmeal to the extent of 5 per cent. in the manufacture of flour, because they considered it unsuitable for the purpose.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, so far as the home market was concerned, disposal for animal feeding became the only outlet and the Department of Agriculture came into the picture.  On 21st September, 1948, after discussion with representatives of Grain Importers it was decided to offer the oatmeal to compound feeding-stuff manufacturers at £30 per ton delivered.  On the same day, Finance sanction was sought.  It was mentioned to Finance that there was some prospect of recovering part of the loss from profits on expected barley imports.  Finance sanction was duly granted, that Department proposing at the same time that the <Col N="2442" /> balance of the loss should be recovered by an adjustment in the cost of maize.</P>
    <P>Only 400 tons approximately were sold at £30 per ton, and the balance of the surplus stock &mdash; approximately 5,200 tons &mdash; was finally sold to Belgian and Swiss buyers, maggots and all, at prices ranging from £21 7s. 6d. to £30 per ton c. and f. Antwerp.  The net loss on this operation is liquidated by the appropriations here outlined.  The savings are set out under several heads.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition desires me to do so, I shall go into details on these savings, or if they wish information in regard to any particular one of the sub-heads, I shall be glad to give it.</P>

      <P>Outbreaks of fowl pest occurred in County Kilkenny, in Fethard-on-Sea, and in New Ross.  We immediately proceeded on the most conservative possible basis and took in a huge area of country until we found out where we stood.  We have not yet discovered whence it came but we believe that it was brought in by sea birds who shared the food of fowl that were being fed in the open.  I am happy to say that we have been able to reduce the infected area three times.  We are keeping our fingers crossed and praying to Providence and, if we are fortunate, we should be able to suspend control altogether certainly before the end of this month.  The last time we said that, just a day before we were going to lift control, we discovered one more case.  We thought it wise, therefore, to let 21 days elapse after that case rather than run the risk of allowing it to spread.</P>

He set out the purpose for which this farm is to be used but we do not know how he came to purchase it.  Was it actually on the market at the time?  Was it purchased privately?  Was it purchased through an auctioneering firm?  In what way was this valuation arrived at?  It seems to be a fairly substantial sum.  I am sure that the farm itself is substantial, too &mdash; it certainly would need to be. While the purpose for which it has been acquired may be laudable, I am sure the Minister will agree that we should be given some further information as to the background of the purchase of this place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to refer to the increase in the flour and wheaten meal subsidy, which will cost £850,000 more than the amount voted last year. Deputies will remember the history of this flour and wheaten meal subsidy.  In the Book of Estimates prepared in 1948 the cost of the flour and wheaten meal subsidy was shown at a sum slightly in excess of £9,500,000.  When the Minister for Finance came here with his Budget statement in that year it was on that subsidy that he made what he described as a saving.  It was a typical Coalition saving, that is, he did not provide for the whole of the cost of the subsidy out of taxation that year but proposed instead to average at a level figure for five years.  He justified that device on the ground that the price of native wheat had been fixed for a five-year term and that since the Estimate was prepared an international wheat agreement had been made under which this country was assured of 360,000 tons of wheat at a maximum price of 2 dollars per bushel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the assumption that the maximum price would prevail over the whole period and that the high freight rates then in operation would continue over the whole period, the most the State <Col N="2444" /> would have to pay in respect of flour and wheaten meal subsidy in each of the five years would be £7,100,000.  If he had provided for the cost of the subsidy out of taxation in that year, following the normal financial procedure, then the cost of the subsidy this year according to his calculation, would have been £6,000,000 or £1,700,000 less than the amount actually required.  He told us further that if the cost of wheat in the international market fell below 2 dollars per bushel &mdash; and it has fallen we know &mdash; the average subsidy in each of the five years would be £6,500,000.  That figure assumed that freight charges would remain high.  We know that in fact freight charges have fallen but against that estimated average figure of £6,500,000, we find this £7,700,000.  Surely some explanation is required to the Dáil because it looks very much as if some thing like a confidence trick has been played on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the Grange farm, the farm is one of 506 acres with a house and very good buildings on it. It was known to be, not on the public market, but that the owner wanted to sell it.  I got the Land Commission to tell me what in their judgment it was worth.  I hired the services of an auctioneer who conducted private negotiations and bought the property at the figure mentioned.  I was fortunate to have the consoling knowledge that the property was sold nine months prior to my buying it for £500 more to a cantankerous solicitor, who broke off the deal because of some dispute with the vendor's solicitor.  That information gave me an adequate assurance that the bargain was a good one.  I have no doubt that if the Deputy would honour us with a visit to the farm he would, from his experience, confirm our judgement as to its value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the Estimate for flour, I am obliged to say frankly to Deputy Lemass that the differential of £895,000 is due to a miscalculation of the amount of flour we were going to consume and to the probable cost of wheat in the current year, owing to the anticipation that there would be more imported wheat and less domestic wheat.  If Deputy Lemass is labouring under the <Col N="2445" /> illusion that during last year and this year, this average principle to which he refers operated to reduce the charge on the financial years which have elapsed, he will find that he is making a very great mistake.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate has been rendered necessary by expenditure on materials under sub-head C (2) (1)&mdash;Maintenance of State Forests. For many years past difficulties have been experienced in obtaining adequate supplies of fencing and other materials, particularly rabbit netting. Every effort is now being made to accumulate reserve stock which will be required in connection with the contemplated expansion of planting operations. Mechanical equipment has also been acquired for use on the construction of new forest roads and for work in the State forest nurseries.  Purchase during this year of a bulldozer for road-making work and of six rotary hoes for use in the nurseries has enabled additional work to be undertaken while reducing costs.  In addition, some materials ordered last year did not arrive in time and payment had to be carried over into this financial <Col N="2447" /> year.  It is now estimated that the total expenditure on materials during 1949-50 will approximate £40,000.  Provision in the original Estimate under this head was £25,000; the balance of £15,000 required is being provided in the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made in the Supplementary Estimate for increased cartage and freight costs under sub-head C (2) and extra labour costs under sub-head C (3).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few other matters to which I should like to refer in this debate.  We had Deputy Traynor speaking here this evening on the subject of emigration.  He expressed a view which, I am sure, will be shared by all Deputies, that emigration constitutes a serious problem and a threat to our country's economy.  Having stated that noble sentiment, he went on to declare that this Government had done nothing towards the solution of emigration and that the Fianna Fáil Administration had apparently worked wonders during their period of office.  I would like to remind Deputy Traynor of this fact, that while we agree with the seriousness of the problem of emigration, nevertheless, we on this side of the House are entitled to say to Fianna Fáil that emigration is a problem completely created by Fianna Fáil.  It is well to remember that in the year before Fianna Fáil were first elected to office, for the first time in the history of Ireland more people came into this country than left it and the emigration figure was nil.  Realising that, it is difficult to understand why Deputy Traynor should derive consolation from the fact that when Fianna Fáil left office only some 40,000 persons were leaving this country.</P>
      <P>I think that is a discreditable record. It is something that will always be remembered against Fianna Fáil.  Nobody here can be complacent about emigration and none of us is.  We realise that it is a serious problem, something that must be tackled if this Government is to fulfil its pledges to the people.  It is right to remind Deputies opposite that in 1948, when this Government assumed office, emigration, which had been running at a figure before that of something like 33,000 a year, was in full flow.  In that year some 40,000 left this country.  I am glad to note from figures now available for 1949 that emigration has at last shown a significant drop.  I think the people can take confidence from that drop and will realise that the problem of emigration is now being tackled with determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Traynor did say in connection with emigration that one of the <Col N="2449" /> ways in which it could be tackled is by the provision of industries giving employment in rural areas.  We do not require Deputy Traynor to tell us that. We appreciated it long before he uttered those wise words.  It was because of that belief that the Government asked this House recently to give legislative power to the Industrial Development Authority.  That authority was designed to develop rural industries and to tackle the problem of rural employment, the flight into the towns and the flight from the country.  That proposal was bitterly opposed by Deputy Traynor and his colleagues.  Apparently they are merely prepared to pay lip service to the idea of having industries decentralised through the country.  They will give lip service merely to that, but they are not prepared to co-operate with the Government in their efforts to decentralise industries and give employment to our people.  Despite that kind of opposition, the people do appreciate the progress that has been made, even in the limited time this Government has been in office.  Unemployment has been mentioned by Deputy Traynor and other Deputies.  I think it is right to claim this for the present Government, that there is available to-day in this country more substantial employment than our people have ever had before.  There is more money being spent on capital schemes giving employment over a long period of time than has ever been spent before.  There are more people going into insurable employment than have ever gone into such employment before in this country's history.  In the 25 months during which this Government has been in office the increase in insurable employment is at the rate of 1,000 workers a month, and that is no mean achievement.  It is something that expresses the real progress that is being made by the Government.</P>
    <P>We do not say that that progress represents the high tide of what we desire our achievements to be.  We recognise that there is still in this country that residual unemployed class and that residual drain of emigration that must be tackled.  We merely say that progress is being made towards the solution of these problems.  The <Col N="2450" /> various steps that have been taken by the Government, the schemes catered for in this Book of Estimates, are further steps towards the solution of those problems and we can only hope that the Opposition will co-operate with the Government in that task.</P>
    <P>They have opposed two important steps taken by the Government in the last 12 months.  They opposed the Local Authorities (Works) Act violently in its passage through this House, the industrial development proposition, and matters of that kind which give promise of a considerable return to the people. All these things have been opposed by the Party opposite.</P>
    <P>The land project is being operated throughout the country.  Again, with regard to a project of that kind, Fianna Fáil Deputies have been careful to avoid expressing any view that could be recorded and quoted for or against them anywhere in the country.  They realise that the land reclamation scheme is one that will bring immense benefit to this country.  It is a project of a capital kind from which the people will derive great benefit for generations to come.  I would like to say to the Opposition that if they regard this scheme as a good one, as I am sure they do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I heard Deputy Allen say: &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;  I may take it then that Deputy Allen, representing a rural constituency, is prepared to go on record as declaring that the land project is not in the interests of this country.  I can scarcely believe that Deputy Allen conceived that view himself, and that he gathered it from other members of his Party.  If that is so, it is becoming apparent that some time Fianna Fáil will express that view more openly.  I know that in my own and in other constituencies farmers are not only anxious to avail of the land project but have availed of it, and will do so despite what obstruction may become apparent.  At the same time somebody, some Party, some group in this country has attempted by propaganda to destroy the confidence of the farmers in that scheme.  It has been suggested to farmers about to avail of <Col N="2451" /> it that they would find their land revalued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.F. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We know Deputy Allen's view of the land project. He is against it.  That type of propaganda is going on throughout the country and is damaging the scheme. It is interfering with something that is of great significance to the country. I would like to say to the Opposition that if they regard the scheme as a worthy one, if they think it is going to enable our land to produce more in the years ahead, if they think that by doing that it is going to provide a better standard of living for our people&mdash;if they think as they should think along those lines&mdash;why do they not co-operate with the Government in killing rumours of that kind and ensure that a person who would spread a lie of the kind referred to is prevented from sabotaging the scheme and from frightening farmers from availing of it?  I know that co-operation cannot be expected from Deputy Allen, who apparently is going to preach the gospel in Wexford that land reclamation is something not to be availed of. I hope that Deputy Gorry and other members of the Fianna Fáil Party will ensure that the scheme will not be interfered with or hampered by a person who would spread false propaganda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that damage can be done, and has been done, to a scheme of that nature.  It is regrettable that some people have such a violent personal antipathy to the Minister for Agriculture and the Government that in their endeavour to harm both they are prepared even to harm the country.  That is something which we should not tolerate.  I hope that some time we will get a clear statement from the Opposition as to where they stand.  It is becoming more and more apparent that the Fianna Fáil Party are afraid to declare what their own policy is, and what their view is with regard to many of the great problems which face the country to-day.  The people who <Col N="2452" /> have trusted Fianna Fáil, some of them anyway, have had no lead from that Party, and the members of it are afraid to state what their view is. They have been afraid to declare their policy.  This debate could have been availed of by the Leader of the Opposition and by other members of that Party to make their position clear but it has not been so availed of.  I am sure that, as the debate proceeds, we will hear from different individuals on the Opposition Benches&mdash;because after all they are nothing but a Party of individuals now&mdash;what their own pet theories are.  They will ride their own pet hobby horses, but from the point of view of presenting a consistent policy to the country the Opposition have failed lamentably.</P>
    <P>I want to say, in conclusion, that the capital investments proposed in the Estimates before the House, as well as the manner in which they have been presented, give an indication to the country that the Government appreciates the under-development from which the country is suffering.  The manner in which the financial policy of the Government is disclosed in these Estimates indicates the intention of the Government to invest more money in the country so that the country can produce more.  It is only by doing that, by following that policy consistently, that we can all share a better standard of living.  I think that, for these reasons, the Estimates should have the support not merely of this side of the House but also of the Opposition.  I think that they disclose the considerable progress that has been made by the Government in the interests of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have yet to get any evidence whatever that any people connected with out Party have made any move whatever to sabotage the land reclamation scheme.  We had a mere statement from the Minister for Agriculture the other day in answer to a parliamentary question, but there is no evidence whatever to bear out what he said.  It is quite the contrary. We are always ready to give any help we can to the development of the country.  As has been pointed out, our <Col N="2453" /> objection was to the way which the Fine Gael people objected to every move that we made.  Whenever we spent money, or proposed to spend it, on schemes of this kind, the schemes were always sabotaged by them.  It is because they were at that game that they think we are doing the same. There is no evidence whatever that our Party ever did that.</P>
      <P>I do not know how the scheme is progressing, but the only conclusion that I could come to was that apparently the Minister for Agriculture is not satisfied with the rate of progress and so he had to find a scape-goat, and, of course, his usual scape-goat is the Fianna Fáil Party.  That is the only evidence there is&mdash;that the Minister had to find a scape-goat.  No action whatever was taken by any of our Party or by our organisation that I could ever hear of.  We would not stand for it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Traynor on the question of emigration gave correct figures.  I remember myself that during the time of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government I was in Cobh and I saw people lined up there.  Undoubtedly, a number somewhere in the neighbourhood of 220,000 people went out of the country at that time.  That was a lamentable thing.  In our time, during the period of the war, there was a big exodus of people.  We could not help it.  I would go so far as to say that I would not blame this Government for any emigration that is going on.  The point, however, is that they blamed us for it from every platform in the country.  The Labour Party and all the Parties supporting the present Government said that we were shipping human beings instead of cattle.  There are conditions in the world which do not always make it possible for a Government to prevent emigration.  Every Party is bound to be interested in keeping the people in this country and, if possible, on the land.  Therefore, any schemes put forward by the Government which are calculated to keep people on the land will have our support.</P>

      <P>A beginning had to be made anyway.  We have been told that the Industrial Development Authority is to speed up industry.  If we thought that, we would welcome it. We have, however, the example of the Tariff Commission, which was a device for nothing else but to stop industry. For that reason, we are doubtful about this authority.  We feel that, instead of being a help, it will be a brake on industry.  One thing which struck me when I saw this Vote was that one of the Parties forming the Government stated that it had left its policy in abeyance.  I think that Fine Gael has done that also.  They promised to reduce taxation by £10,000,000.  Instead of that, they have raised it by £20,000,000, so that it is about £30,000,000 more than they promised it would be.  I am not going to weary the House with quotations, but there is one &ldquo;gem&rdquo; here which I shall quote.  Deputy Thomas O'Higgins will be interterested in this, because it was the present Minister for Defence, a near relative of his, who made the statement in 1942 on a Vote on Account for the sum of £13,445,000.  I am quoting from Vol. 85, col. 2415, of the Official Reports for 11th March, 1942.  Here is what he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Experienced men, trained men, men who understand finance in a way I never claim to understand it, have pointed out, in private, what the end result is going to be&mdash;that if the brakes are not put on at some point on the downhill road, the end result, and a fairly near end, is going to be <Col N="2455" /> hunger, famine, unemployment and widespread distress.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Mr. G. Boland Mr. G. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a Vote for £13,000,000.  Now we have a Vote for exactly twice that sum.  I will not accuse the Minister for Finance of being so stupid as to have believed all he said, but he used to maintain that the Fianna Fáil Government should divide every Estimate they brought in by half.  As I pointed out on my Estimate, even though he took that view, the Government had to raise £1 and not 10/-.  At present it happens to be double that amount, because this is a Vote for £26,000,000.</P>

      <P>It is clear that Fine Gael also has put its policy in abeyance. If a sum of £13,000,000 was to end, if the brakes were not put on, in hunger, famine, unemployment and widespread distress, what is going to happen when a bill of over £26,000,000 is presented, or almost twice as much? I do not think, however, we are any more hungry now than we were at that time.  That was in 1942, and prices had risen then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Vivion de Valera was speaking, the Minister for Finance was very anxious that we should not do anything to destroy the confidence of the people so that when he floated a loan he would be able to get it.  That is a matter which we would all be anxious about.  I submit that nothing could possibly cause more lack of confidence in the country than to have two <Col N="2456" /> Ministers advocating different policies, particularly in a matter of finance.  The Taoiseach was quoted by Deputy Aiken the other day as saying, on the day on which he assumed office, that he would see that the principle of collective responsibility was observed in the spirit and in the letter.  If that means anything, it means that, when any member of the Government makes a pronouncement on policy he is speaking for the Government.  When one Minister gets up and says the reverse of what his colleague says, I think there is nothing more calculated to destroy confidence in the country and in the Government. Anything said by ex-Ministers, who are now in the same position as any other Deputy, could not possibly have the same effect as what is said by a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>Last night we had a quotation from a statement by the Minister for Finance on the credit-worthiness of the Dublin Corporation in which he flatly contradicted a statement of his colleague, the Minister for External Affairs.  The Minister for External Affairs, on the 18th October, at some meeting in Dublin of his own organisation, said that the Dublin Corporation was one of the most credit-worthy municipal authorities in the world, that the security of the Dublin Corporation was much safer than the £135,000,000 which the commercial banks held in sterling securities.

      <P>Deputy Hickey is on to the popular cry too.  I shall not pursue the matter further than to ask, when two Ministers contradict one another on matters of this kind and when we have, as we had in this debate, Ministers talking about the desirability of changing the banking system and demanding from us what our attitude will be, as the Minister for External Affairs did, what are we expected to do?  It will not be surprising if the people who have money in the banks are not prepared to hand it over.  But, if they do hand it over, they will want more interest than they might otherwise have demanded.  The Government has a majority here.  Let them bring in their proposals and let us see what these proposals are and then we will be in a position to say what our attitude is.  Naturally, we must see the proposals first.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde spoke here yesterday evening.  I must say he is a thorough gentleman and a rather likeable man.  We were told that he was the alternative to the present Taoiseach.  He, too, attacked the banks.  When a man of his standing, in addition to the Minister for External Affairs, talks in that fashion about the banks and makes half threats, they should come in first to us with the proposals they have in mind.  Let them come in and do that now.  Surely, even Deputy Hickey will agree that it is better to get down to brass tacks and not leave the House and the people in the air.  Let the Government bring in its proposals and we will examine them.  We shall then be in a position to approve or disapprove of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, of course, the lamentable <Col N="2459" /> failure of the Taoiseach to enforce collective responsibility on his Cabinet in regard to devaluation.  A serious decision had to be made and the Minister for Finance made a reasonable statement over the radio as to why the Government took the course it did. Anyone with common sense or experience knew very well that the Government had no alternative.  Despite that, we have the spectacle of the Minister for External Affairs attacking the very policy his Government had enunciated a couple of days before, a policy to which he must have been a party.</P>
    <P>What sort of Government is that?  If he did not agree with the policy, there was an honourable course open to him. All he had to do was to revert to the position of a private Deputy in which capacity he would not have upon him any compulsion towards the collective responsibility that lies upon a Minister. He could have remained an ordinary Deputy supporting the Coalition.  The excuse that was given was that it might put us back into office.  That excuse does not hold water.  What does he do?  He goes away at the public expense to Liverpool a few days after devaluation and he addresses a rotary club meeting there attacking the policy of his own Government and the policy of the British Government in regard to devaluation. I might add that we paid the bill for his trip.  Is it any wonder there cannot be any confidence in the Government? The most fundamental essential of good Government is that there must be agreement amongst Ministers so that when one speaks, he speaks for all.  Ministers should not contradict one another.  If there is contradiction, it only leads to bewilderment, disturbance and lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>I think this matter requires the careful attention of the Taoiseach.  He should insist on his Ministers speaking with one voice on Government policy. He should not allow them to contradict each other.  We have had too many examples of it.  We had the Minister for Finance on the 12th March, 1948, in the Seanad recommending that lorrymen should be allowed to drive lorries on the roads, or use them as <Col N="2460" /> ramshackle buses.  He was immediately turned down by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The Minister for Finance suggested that these lorrymen would show Córas Iompair Éireann how to make money.  Of course, the Minister for Industry and Commerce turned down the proposal and he said that Córas Iompair Éireann was much more important than these lorrymen.  Why should the Minister for Finance butt into the concerns of the Minister for Industry and Commerce?  Transport should be dealt with by the person designated by the Taoiseach for that purpose and not by a Minister who has no responsibility for it.  That goes right down along the line.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs attacking the Labour Court and condemning his own colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce. No Government could succeed if it is run in that fashion.  I do not know how they have managed up to this. There is only one explanation.  They are like ship-wrecked sailors on a raft; they must hang on for dear life, knowing that, if they fall, they are finished. Meanwhile, they are availing of every opportunity to see the world.  If one of them is asked to make a speech in Baltimore or San Francisco he hops over on the next plane.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been somewhat surprised by the observations that have been made by Deputy Boland in regard to this principle, as he calls it, of collective responsibility.  One would imagine that, with Deputy Boland's long experience as a Minister, he would have appreciated what this principle of collective responsibility is.  It is quite a simple one&mdash; that in matters in which the Government have a particular responsibility, particularly in matters that are vested in the Government by law, the Government must act as a collective unit. That is, simply, the doctrine of collective responsibility.  But there certainly is not laid down anywhere that in all matters of public importance that arise every Minister must hold and express the same view.  That is not the doctrine of collective responsibility; that is a doctrine of foolishness.  Every Minister in a democratic Cabinet is entitled, on matters of public importance, where no Government decision has been taken, to express his own views.  Certainly, in the type of Government we have now &mdash; an inter-Party <Col N="2462" /> Government composed of Ministers who are leaders of different Parties holding different views on many matters&mdash;it is essential and in the public interest that those Ministers should express their own views rather than views with which they do not agree.</P>
      <P>The great objection taken to the Government as a whole in regard to this particular doctrine of collective responsibility is that on a matter of monetary policy Ministers have expressed views that do not agree.  Everybody knows how difficult it is, in a country such as this, to bring about a change in monetary policy.  It is an essential part of the machinery, if you like, of bringing about that change, that the people as a whole should be educated.  The only way they can be educated is by considering this matter, by hearing lectures or statements on it and by reading about it.  Only in that way can the people be educated to understand what is involved in a change of monetary policy.  Deputies in the House should remember that whenever any particular politician advocated a change in monetary policy it was always alleged against him that he intended to interfere with the savings in the banks.  That particular form of propaganda was used against persons who advocated a change in monetary policy by the last Government and by speakers who spoke on behalf of the last Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Boland says it is a popular thing to attack the banks and that you get votes by attacking the banks.  My view is to the contrary.  At the present stage of our political development and at the present stage of our political education you get more votes by supporting the bank than you do by attacking them.  I am glad that this whole matter of monetary policy is receiving attention.  I am glad to see a larger number of Deputies in this House expressing the view, as they have expressed it in this debate &mdash; and particularly Deputies on this side of the House &mdash; that there should be a change in monetary policy.  I think that that process of education and propaganda will have to go ahead for some little time yet and eventually a considerable section of the people will realise that a change in monetary <Col N="2463" /> policy will not in any way affect personal savings in the banks or elsewhere. The only thing that I think has been wrong in this propaganda is the attack on the banks themselves. Monetary policy can be changed by an Act of Parliament which will alter the functions of the responsibilities of the Central Bank.  It can be done in that way.  But we must remember that the ordinary banks at the moment have a particular function and particular responsibilities. They are governed and directed mainly in their own interests and it is no particular part of their function to come to the assistance of the State or to come to the assistance of anybody except their own customers or their own shareholders.  I think that that fundamental mistake has been made in the discussions in regard to the change of monetary policy by an attack on the banks which suggested that they were not doing the things that they ought to do.  We have a Central Bank.  That Central Bank is restricted by legislation.  We can enlarge the powers and duties and functions of the Central Bank by legislation and it is only when we do that that we shall effectively change our monetary policy.  Therefore, I am glad to see this process of discussion but I would suggest to those Deputies and Ministers who have been attacking the banks that that is not the solution of the problem and that a little more study and a little more knowledge of the particular subject will show that this change can be effected and that there is no necessity to interfere with personal savings and that there is no necessity for the attacks that have been made on the banks in recent times.</P>
    <P>I have been led into this discussion by Deputy Boland's observations on the doctrine of collective responsibility. So much has been said recently on this doctrine of collective responsibility that we are in great danger of accepting the position that in a Government every Minister has to talk with the same tongue and with the same voice about everything.  Furthermore, if we were to follow Deputy Boland's line of argument, in matters relating to finance nobody would speak but the Minister for <Col N="2464" /> Finance: in matters relating to industry and commerce nobody would speak but the Minister for Industry and Commerce: in matters relating to defence nobody would speak but the Minister for Defence and in matters relating to justice nobody would speak but the Minister for Justice.  Deputies must realise that that is contrary to the public interest.  While we by law give certain duties and responsibilities to particular Ministers, other Ministers or Deputies are not prevented from discussing these matters and expressing their particular points of view in regard to them.  I have often wondered what it was that was wrong with the Fianna Fáil Administration.  If the views that we hear now expressed in regard to collective responsibility were the views held by the Fianna Fáil Ministers while they were in office, then it does explain, I think, to a large extent why Fianna Fáil failed to make the progress they might have made as a Government and as an Administration.</P>
    <P>In this debate we are discussing Estimates for the public services and a Vote on Account which amounts approximately to £26,000,000.  My great objection to developments in regard to Estimates and the Vote on Account in recent years is that while we are seriously discussing this Book of Estimates as the Estimates for the public services for the year ended 31st March, 1951, every one of us knows that the Book of Estimates is not complete. While discussing the Vote on Account this evening we interrupted the debate for one hour to discuss the last of the Supplementary Estimates&mdash;I hope they are the last, anyway &mdash; to last year's Book of Estimates.  Each and every one of us knows that by this time next year we shall be discussing further Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>I think that we ought to have reached a stage in the administration of the country when the Estimates for the public services for a particular year should be reasonably correct, when the Estimates should be as close as possible to the actual amount that will be required for the public services for the year.  Some years ago, even in this House, the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate created a flutter and a stir but now it has become a common <Col N="2465" /> place.  In your envelope from the Clerk of the Dáil every morning, for a month or so before the end of the financial year, you receive sheets of Supplementary Estimates.  I think that some effort should be made to make the Book of Estimates more realistic.  It is not the real thing at the moment.  It cannot be real.  I have not been able to find anything in these Estimates for Córas Iompair Éireann for the coming year, although we know, and we have been told, that at least £1,000,000 will be necessary for Córas Iompair Éireann during the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am endeavouring to make is that the Estimates for the financial year should be within a very small figure anyway of the amount actually required.  I have examined the Book of Estimates as it is and I find it very difficult to see where substantial savings can be made. I know that savings may possibly be made in administration but if one examines the Book of Estimates, one will find that the great bulk of the <Col N="2466" /> millions estimated for, goes back in one way or another to the public and the margin that is left for administration does not leave very much scope for reduction.</P>
      <P>It may be that within the Civil Service itself there is some room for saving.  I notice from the public Press that the Minister has decided to set up a new officer in every Department whose duty it will be to see to the correct organisation of that Department and to the introduction of business methods that will lead to efficiency. I think in doing that the Minister is doing something that should have been done many years ago.  Civil Service procedure may have been all right in the good old days, but Civil Service procedure, as far as we see it in this country and as it has developed over the last quarter of a century, is not the most efficient method by which the business of the nation can be done. Day after day, more and more of the business of the nation is being done by the Civil Service.  It is only right that that service should be reorganised, that methods of efficiency should be introduced and that responsibility should be decentralised so that the work might be done more expeditiously and in fact more efficiently.  In the whole administration of the Civil Service, in most Departments at any rate, there is set up the bottleneck of the secretary as head of the Department. That responsibility of the permanent head or secretary, in some Departments, at least, has led to a bottleneck of the whole business of the Department into that particular office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this new system that the Minister is anxious to obtain by the introduction of these new officers will lead to decentralisation and more efficiency. I think, however, that perhaps the most efficient way of bringing about that change is not in the way that it is proposed to do it.  The selection of particular civil servants and the sending of them on courses abroad to learn business methods is, perhaps, not the best way in which it can be done immediately, and it might be a desirable thing if the Minister were to introduce into these Departments new blood with knowledge of business <Col N="2467" /> methods and with a record of capability and efficiency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am only dealing with the size of these Estimates. They represent a sum of £78,000,000 and that has been condemned as being unduly high.  In examining the Book of Estimates as a whole it is very difficult to find, except possibly in the matter of the administration of all the services, <Col N="2468" /> any place in which there could be a reduction.  I certainly have not been able to find it.  There has been quite a considerable amount of discussion in regard to this new development of separating capital services from other services.  That makes it probably more convenient and easier to understand. We know now that when the Minister for Finance introduces his Budget he has to find £66,000,000.  Between the introduction of the Estimates and the Budget, heretofore, there was always a certain amount of doubt as to how much the Minister would try to find by revenue and how much he would try to find by borrowing.  It is now very clear at an early stage in these Estimates that he is going to find £12,000,000.</P>
      <P>In so far as it helps and is in that way convenient, this departure is welcomed. I think Deputies have, perhaps, paid too much attention to that particular division.  If the division did not take place now we would know all about it in the Budget.  We know now that £12,000,000 is provided for capital development.  In my view £12,000,000 is insufficient for capital development.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows there is another sum still for capital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarCowan" hpid="Captain Cowan Captain Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Captain Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  We have, as has been stated here this evening, the responsibility of endeavouring to end emigration and the responsibility of endeavouring to end unemployment. These two tasks will require very substantial capital expenditure for the purpose of providing employment, because it is only by the provision of employment here that one can reduce unemployment, and it is only by the provision of employment here that one can reduce emigration.  If we are serious in our efforts to reduce either unemployment or emigration we can only do so by means of a plan which will involve substantial capital development, and if I have any objection at all to the policy as announced by the Minister when introducing this Vote on Account, it is that he was unable specifically to say the numbers of persons who would be put into productive employment by means of capital expenditure in the present financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every Party in the House is anxious to see the development of industry; <Col N="2469" /> every Party is anxious to see more employment provided; every Party is anxious to see emigration and unemployment reduced, but we cannot end or reduce those things simply by talking about them.  We can only reduce them and solve these very big social problems by a planned development and that can only be done by the Government.  Now that these expenditures, capital and otherwise, have been segregated, it will be easier in future years to gain a picture of the plans that the Minister and the Government have in mind.</P>
    <P>Two vital matters, as far as the general public are concerned, are taxation and expenditure.  What I am mainly anxious about is how this sum of £66,000,000 will be raised.  The Minister will deal with that in his budget, but it is a problem that concerns nearly every person in the State.  The provision of £66,000,000 is a very large sum for a small community like ours, and if this enormous amount is to be raised from the wrong section of the people then undoubtedly hardship will be caused to the public as a whole.  However, this is not the time to deal with that.  As far as I am concerned I must support the Estimates introduced by the Minister.  I hope that, when next year's Bill comes before us, it will contain within it a very clear picture of the programme of industrial development which is essential and which, I think, every Party in this House would support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>My first criticism of the Vote on Account is at the way in which it is presented&mdash;that is in the segregation of capital expenditure&mdash;but not so much that the expenditure should not be segregated into capital and otherwise.  I want to express my opposition to some of the items which are placed under the headings of capital expenditure.  I take in particular the Department of Agriculture. There are three items there: poultry houses with equipment and so on, farm buildings and land rehabilitation.  I think that the only defence for putting an item under the heading of capital expenditure is that, first of all, it should be an abnormal item not likely to occur again, or that it should be <Col N="2470" /> non-recurrent or that it should bring some return to the State in general. Take this item of poultry houses.  I think Deputies from the rural areas know that the equipment for them has not a very long life.  It does not last more than a few years.  Some of the lamps that they use as poultry equipment are very quickly used up or worn out, and have to be renewed.</P>
      <P>If we take the subsidies for hatcheries that would be a recurrent item.  It will be paid next year as well as this year and the year after.  Unless the Minister can say definitely that these subsidies will only be necessary for a few years to put the industry on its feet, and in that way are not recurrent or abnormal, there is no justification for bringing them under the heading of capital expenditure.  As regards farm buildings, I presume the argument is that if they are provided or renovated it will conduce to greater agricultural production.  Even if we accept that argument, I do not think the Minister can justify putting the whole amount, as he is doing in this instance, into capital expenditure.</P>
      <P>As regards land rehabilitation there are many headings within this particular sub-head.  One could defend probably using capital for the purchase of machinery if one could see clearly that the machinery would be used for a long time to come.  We may admit straight away that any Minister who brings in a scheme of this kind does so in the hope that the machinery will be used, and on that account the machinery can be admitted as a capital expenditure.  But, in strict financing, I do not think we could admit that grants to farmers should be included in this particular instance. We have also a £125,000 for direct labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under this scheme the Minister might have set against that particular expenditure a saving on unemployment assistance or on some other Vote.  In this way he is saving on his recurrent expenditure in order to put it into capital.  We have even the salaries of officials, and included amongst the Minister's officials there are permanent civil servants.  That is an innovation that can hardly be defended, to pay <Col N="2471" /> the salaries of permanent civil servants out of a capital Vote.  These permanent civil servants will be there until the end of their term of office, and there can be no justification whatever for treating their salaries as a capital item.  The same is done in the case of the travelling expenses of these civil servants as well as the item for publicity.  Everybody will admit that as long as the Minister for Agriculture is there there will be a Vote for publicity. It is going to be recurrent but it is treated here as a capital item.</P>
    <P>Taking these three items together I suppose one may say that a Minister who foresees some difficulty in making ends meet when the Budget comes along will naturally put as much as he can aside as capital.  I think that the Minister, if he were really taking a fair and honest view of what should be capital in this instance, would have taken only a portion of these three items.  The total amount is £3,800,000. If he had taken say one-third of that we might not see very much objection to it.  I think it is as much as could be allowed in all fairness.</P>
    <P>The total Estimate in this Vote on Account as presented to us is £78,127,000.  We are all inclined to compare one year with another and to watch the trend upward, year after year, of the total Estimate.  We are inclined to compare the amount now with the amount for the last year before this Government took office.  When we do we find that there is an increase of something over £19,200,000.  It is a very substantial item.  I think it is admitted that we must add to this a fairly substantial increase in the Central Fund Services, so that the increase will be at least £20,000,000 this year as compared with 1947-48.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party promised about that time that, if they could get control of the finances of the country, they would reduce the expenditure by £10,000,000.  They spoke of Fianna Fáil's mad schemes and extravagances and so on and made the promise that, if they got control, the expenditure would be reduced by £10,000,000.  Here we have the result of their administration for two years, and I think we <Col N="2472" /> may take it as a fair sample of the promises made by Fine Gael at that time&mdash;an increase of £20,000,000, instead of a reduction of £10,000,000.  We were supposed to be extravagant when we were the Government and the Fine Gael Party promised to make big savings.  When they got control of the Government two years ago, they did make reductions in some of the Estimates.  The biggest savings they made were in the Army and in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund. We find now, however, that they are both as high as they were in 1947-48, so that the saving made in the Army and the attempted raid on the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Fund were of short duration and we are back again at least to the same expenditure as in 1947-48.  They also set out to make a saving on the short-wave station, but we find that is back again in the Estimates.</P>

      <P>It is not so easy to discuss this Vote on Account as there is such a big amount in it which, I presume, will be borrowed for the coming year.  The Minister did not give us any indication, when introducing the Vote, of what his plans were for borrowing this money or what his hopes were. He did not say, even in a general way, whether he hoped to find this money by borrowing from the public, or by borrowing from funds which would be indirectly under his control, or when it was likely that this borrowing would take place.  It is not so easy to discuss a Vote of this kind in which there is such a big proportion of capital <Col N="2473" /> expenditure when we have not got a clear picture of the Minister's intentions in that respect.  It would have been helpful if he could have given us a clear and frank picture of the situation as he sees it.  But, in the absence of that, we have to do the best we can.</P>
      <P>I should like to support Deputy Cowan on this question of Supplementary Estimates.  As Deputy Cowan said, this practice of bringing in Supplementary Estimates has grown out of all proportion.  I think Deputy Cowan was correct when he said that, if you go back 15 or 20 years, the number and the volume of Supplementary Estimates brought in during the year was very small.  They were only presented in very exceptional circumstances. When I came into this House first, I was on the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and Auditor-General explained the necessity for bringing in a Supplementary Estimate for anything over £1,000, which was regarded as a fair sum at that time, even where it was necessary to transfer it from one sub-head to another.  The Supplementary Estimates at that time were usually of that nature &mdash; merely amounts brought in to correct the Estimate that was made as between one sub-head and another in the various Departments.  But, as Deputy Cowan said, they have grown out of all recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister should impress on his colleagues the necessity for giving a firm Estimate and let us have that firm Estimate when we are discussing Estimates here either on the Vote on Account or on the individual Estimates afterwards, because we do not get an opportunity in this House of discussing the Estimate again.  We only get an opportunity of discussing the particular Supplementary Estimate presented, even though the theory is that the voting of finance is under the control of this House.  It is obvious that there will be Supplementary Estimates introduced.  There is no provision, for instance, for a comprehensive scheme of social welfare and I am sure that Deputies of every Party know that, in view of the promises of the Tánaiste and other members of the various Parties composing the Coalition <Col N="2474" /> Government, this scheme will be brought in and that the money will be necessary.  That will, I presume, mean a Supplementary Estimate before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Another item I found in going through the Book of Estimates was the item for military service pensions. I notice that the increase is only £1,000 over last year.  We have had statements and promises from the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Justice and other members of the Parties opposite with regard to the pensions that are due in all justice to a number of people who did not get military service pensions.  If we are to judge from the Estimate, they have only provided for ten extra pensions of £100 a year or 20 of £50 a year.  Is it that the Act which was passed is not going to bring the great benefits promised, or is it that the Minister for Defence will be coming along with a substantial Supplementary Estimate before the financial year is out?</P>
    <P>If we had time to go through the Estimates, I am sure we would come across a number of instances of that kind.  It is obvious, therefore, that the Departments were discouraged by the Minister for Finance from putting up a large Estimate.  Of course, that has always been the case.  I do not think there was ever a Minister for Finance who did not appeal to the Departments to keep their Estimates as low as possible.  But if the appeal goes so far that Departments are put in the position that they have to say: &ldquo;Well, we will put in this Estimate now, but we shall come along during the year for some more,&rdquo; that is a bad system. That is a system that should not be permitted to grow up.  I think the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for watching these things, should rather appeal to Departments to budget for all their needs now and not come along later with Supplementary Estimates.  We know the very big bill we have to meet for the present financial year in relation to Supplementary Estimates.  I take it that next year there will be a bill of equal magnitude.</P>
    <P>In relation to social services, I would like to refer to the housing of that <Col N="2475" /> Department.  I have a certain suggestion to make.  When I was Minister for Social Welfare I was rather taken with the idea of decentralisation.  I think practically every Deputy has expressed the view from time to time that we should try to divert the population from Dublin to other cities and towns.  I thought it would be both feasible and desirable to have the Department of Social Welfare established in some town or city other than Dublin and, with that in mind, I asked the Secretary of the Department to discuss the matter with the public authority of both Galway and Cork. These were selected because there were sufficient educational facilities available for the families of the officials who would man that Department.  I think the Secretary had a consultation with the authority of at least one of these cities where it was thought that a site would be available for the Department and housing facilities could be provided for the staffs.  I think every Deputy would agree that it would be desirable to divert some thousands of our population from Dublin to Cork, Galway or elsewhere.  I think my suggestion provides a feasible method by which that could be done.  I think it is a suggestion that the Minister concerned and the Government might take into consideration.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has been referred to during the course of the debate is rationing.  Rationing was introduced during the war.  It was introduced because certain goods were in short supply and it was feared that those with money might be tempted to hoard some of the necessaries of life thereby depriving the poor of them. The only fair way to meet a situation of that kind was to introduce rationing. Every country in the world had to do it.  I do not think there is any need for me to adduce again the arguments in favour of it then.  The point is, however, that bread, butter, tea and sugar are still rationed, but the necessity is no longer there.  We are the only country to-day in which rationing is maintained.  It has even been dispensed with in Germany, a defeated country.  We have enough tea, sugar, bread and, we are told, butter to <Col N="2476" /> remove rationing altogether.  Yet, rationing is still with us.</P>
    <P>I am sure that had the Parties now on the Government Benches been told that rationing would be continued long after the necessity for it had ceased, when they were in Opposition, they would have taken a very serious view of it and raised very strenuous objections to it.  The only reason we can see for the continuation of rationing is because there is financial difficulty.  I can imagine the criticisms that would have been made had we, as a Government, endeavoured to do what the present Government is doing in relation to these essential commodities.  The present Government has said, in effect, that there will be a bare subsistence ration of bread, butter, tea and sugar for everybody at a certain price, but the people who can afford to pay more can buy more at a certain price.  I can imagine the objections that would have been raised by the Labour Party if we had introduced that system.  Because it is done by the Coalition Government, with the Labour Party behind it, it is turned into a virtue.  I have heard Labour members say: &ldquo;Why not make the rich man pay more for his tea and sugar if he can afford it,&rdquo; and they gloss over the fact that the poor man cannot get any more because he cannot pay more for it.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for the Government to let us presume, because they do not say it, that there is a financial difficulty in the matter.  If the Government wants to share goods equally with all members of the population, surely it is the duty of the Government to give that share equally to everybody at the same price.  But they have not done that.</P>
    <P>Why is petrol rationed?  Everybody knows there is enough petrol.  I have not met anybody for months who has had any difficulty in obtaining petrol. Yet, we carry on a system under which we are paying civil servants, paying for the printing of books and forms and for sending them out and putting distributors to the inconvenience and expense of collecting these coupons and making returns to the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Outside the 11 or 12 members who constitute the Government, nobody can see any <Col N="2477" /> necessity at the present time for petrol rationing.  I would be very interested if the Minister could give us some reasons why petrol rationing is being maintained at the present time.  I have said that we have enough tea, sugar and bread to drop rationing. We are told that we have enough butter.  In fact, I saw in the paper that we are exporting creamery butter. The Minister for Agriculture is evidently finding some difficulty about a market for butter in Great Britain because we find that the price that Britain will pay us for our creamery butter will not enable the creameries to pay 1/2 a gallon to the farmer for his milk.  There is not a Deputy in this House, I am quite sure, who will say that the farmer is getting too much.  He is not getting more than a remunerative price for his milk.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture came into this House in the Summer of 1948 after a trade agreement had been concluded between the Irish Government and the British Government and, in his recommendation of that agreement to this House, he used words to the effect that we have now got a market at a remunerative price for all the agricultural produce we can produce in this country.  The Taoiseach used practically the same words.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture used these words to convince the Dáil that the agreement was one that the Dáil should vote for.  Naturally the Dáil voted for it when they heard that, amongst other things, in favour of the agreement.  Now we find, when the agreement is put to the test, that the Minister must ask the farmers to take 2d. a gallon less for their milk. Is that a remunerative price for our butter?</P>
    <P>Is it a fact now, as we were told in 1948, that that agreement gave us a market for all our agricultural produce at a remunerative price?  It is quite obvious that it did not.  The result is that we are finding a market for a certain amount of butter, I believe in Germany, and if we have to go to England with some of our butter then we are going to be trouble.  Before we exported butter, as we did a few days ago, surely rationing should have been <Col N="2478" /> withdrawn.  It is all very fine to say, as Government spokesmen will say, that nobody needs more than eight ounces.  If people do not need more than eight ounces, why do we have rationing?  Why do we try to puzzle the people and to deceive ourselves by making a statement of that kind &mdash; first fixing the ration at eight ounces and then, when we are asked to withdraw that, saying that we do not need any more?  Why put people to the expense and the trouble of keeping records and of making returns?  Why make the housewife bring her ration book with her to the grocer?  Why is all this necessary if we are getting enough in eight ounces?  Why not withdraw rationing and cut out these regulations and especially why not stop rationing before starting to export?  I have heard it said in this House by members of the other Parties, as well as by members on these benches, that the primary function of agriculture is to feed our own people.  I do not think anybody will object to that definition. If that is the primary function of agriculture, then let us make sure that everybody has enough butter before we start to export it.  That should apply to everything else, but I think that butter is the only rationed article where we are building up an export business as well.  On that account rationing should be dropped.</P>
    <P>We are told by speakers on the other side of the House that there is a marked increase in the output of agricultural produce.  That is to be expected. The war has been over now for five years.  We can get all the raw materials which are necessary; we can get the fertilisers; we can renew our seeds and we can make progress in certain directions which we could not make during the war.  We can get other necessary materials such as spraying materials which were not in sufficient supply during the war.  We can get machinery and machinery parts which were needed during the war also.  I do not think we should be in the least surprised if we have now got back to the output at least of 1939.  It is possible that we are approaching that point now but it is not surprising and it is all to the good if we are able to exceed it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2479" /> Output, as we all know, is sometimes quoted in volume and sometimes in value.  The value is misleading from the point of view of statistics but not to the farmer because it is the only thing he is concerned with, in a way. If he is getting more cash, he is satisfied. However, from the point of view of statistics and from the point of view of finding out whether our agriculture in general is making progress, we want the volume.  In volume I believe we are approaching the 1939 level.  But in crops, the yield per acre gives us the basis on which to calculate our output. I notice from questions asked in this House recently that in 1949 the yield of wheat and beet was very good&mdash;in fact, I think it was higher than in any year unless we go back to the 1930's&mdash; but that the yield of potatoes and oats was low.  I think everybody will admit that the Minister for Agriculture does not neglect potatoes and oats and that he would be very keen on getting good crops of potatoes and oats&mdash;more so than good crops of wheat and beet. The weather has a big influence and weather conditions, it appears from these returns, are a bigger factor than a change of Government or a change of Minister.  We must keep that in mind when we are comparing figures from year to year.  We may be going along beautifully as we were in 1948, when we had such a good bumper crop of oats and potatoes and when the Minister for Agriculture was priding himself on providing the farmer with the fertilisers to grow these crops and when he was comparing the yields he got with the yields got during the time of Fianna Fáil.  He proved to this House that all that was due to the Coalition policy.  But last year, 1949, with the weather less favourable, the yields went down considerably.  That is a factor in the situation that must always be kept in mind.</P>
    <P>Another point which I think is very important indeed to a Government is the cost of living.  It is a very big problem for every Government in the world, as far as I can see.  I think that most Governments have great trouble owing to the high cost of living and we cannot escape the trouble here. But, in spite of the obvious difficulty <Col N="2480" /> of influencing the cost of living in a very big way, the Minister for External Affairs, when he was seeking election in 1948, saw no difficulty in reducing the cost of living by 30 per cent.  In his speech at Carlow he laid down the points of Clann na Poblachta policy and showed how it would be possible to bring down the cost of living.  That, however, was not done and yet the Minister for External Affairs remains a member of the Government. Deputy Cowan gave us his views on the principle of collective responsibility but I think that Deputy Cowan did not quote Deputy Boland correctly.  Deputy Boland surely did not say that all Ministers should think alike because although we were members of one Party, we often had very long Cabinet meetings and, if we all thought alike, they would not have lasted more than a couple of minutes. It is quite obvious, therefore, that we held different views on various matters but when we took a decision on major policy, we stood together.  If we did not intend to stand together, it was open to the person who objected to resign.  That is the principle of collective responsibility that must be recognised, that once a Government takes a decision on major policy every Minister must stand by that decision or resign. The Ministers of this Government have not observed that principle.  Some of them have condemned decisions that were taken.  The Minister for External Affairs, if he were sincere and honest in his promises to reduce the cost of living by 30 per cent. and if he found that he could not get the Government to agree with him on the measures that were necessary to achieve that, had the obvious course open to him to resign.  He did not resign and we can only conclude that he was not sincere when he made that promise.</P>
    <P>The cost of living has not come down. On the contrary, this Government has adopted the very pernicious practice of putting up the cost of things which do not appear in the cost-of-living index figure.  This Government is not worried about the cost of living; they are worried only about the cost-of-living index figure.  They are looking at it only from the purely political scientific standpoint of keeping that <Col N="2481" /> figure at a certain level but they pile up the cost otherwise.  We have heard other speakers refer to white flour, sugar outside the ration, tea outside the ration and so on.  They have built up a system of this kind, in order to make money to relieve the bill for food subsidies in general.  This is not the only way that the Government is, as it were, collecting money in an indirect way.  They did not admittedly put a penny on the pint or a penny on the ounce of tobacco but they collected money on sugar, tea and flour&mdash;the necessaries of life.  Then they make insured persons, those insured against sickness and unemployment, pay more for their stamps.  They took £500,000 out of the Post Office Savings Bank and put it into Government funds.  In various ways of that kind, they take money from one source and pile it on to another.  Then they piled more money on the local authorities.  The Government pay less now towards home assistance than when Fianna Fáil was in power and the ratepayers pay more.  The Government make savings of that type and if they did not make these savings this Book of Estimates would be showing another £1,000,000 or £2,000,000.  There are various ways of doing those things.</P>
    <P>When every single possibility of income was explored and every single opportunity taken to pile expense on somebody else, when the Minister for Finance had no other way of doing it and the Estimates were put before him he proceeded to say: &ldquo;A lot of this is capital expenditure.&rdquo;  I think myself he made a very arbitrary classification. I mentioned items under agriculture. Housing was mentioned by other speakers.  Housing must go on for years.  It is a recurrent expenditure and there is no justification for putting housing grants down as a capital item.  The Minister for External Affairs in his speech said that no man building a house would finance that house out of his revenue for one year.  Of course not, because a man who builds his own house expects it to last his lifetime, and if this Government were going to build all the houses necessary for our people in one year, then naturally the expenditure would be a capital item.  They are not going <Col N="2482" /> to do that; they are only going to carry out the annual portion of the programme each year.  The same portion will be necessary year after year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <P>The Minister knows very well that this will be a recurrent expenditure.  The Minister for Finance, let us admit, was hard put to it to meet the bill and he had to put as much as he could under the heading of capital expenditure.  He adopted this course of putting on the cover of the Book so much for capital services and so much for other services.  That was probably done so that the comparison of the total this year with the total spent last year and the total of the year 1947-48 would not be so obvious.  An effort was made by Deputies on the other side to take only some of these services and compare them with other years.  That is an unfair comparison but I suppose we must have a little sympathy with a Minister who has to resort to that type of subterfuge in order to mask the truth.</P>

      <P>Listening to the speeches that have been made during the past few days, some of which occupied nearly two hours, it is evident that many Deputies do not realise or are unmindful of the fact that there are thousands of men, women and children throughout the country who are ill-fed, badly clothed and compelled to live in slums and hovels or so-called homes of that type.  We all saw the activity and the energy that was displayed by a number of Deputies who brought in bundles of Dáil reports to quote speeches that were made by other Deputies from 1932 until the last <Col N="2483" /> general election, as if they counted now.  These Deputies have very little realisation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy must not forget, when in November, 1947, he walked up that gangway in order to prevent old age pensioners from getting an increase in their pensions.  Those Deputies who have shown all that energy and so much excitement here for the past few days do not seem to realise&mdash;indeed, they seem to be quite unmindful of the fact&mdash;that there are men and women working and drudging in field and factory and in their homes endeavouring to exist on wages that are scarcely sufficient to give the bare necessaries of life to themselves or to their wives and children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the Deputy in the way he deserves to be dealt with.  Deputy de Valera came in here yesterday and gave us a lecture for nearly an hour.  I really felt I was back in school again.  He said the people who were talking glibly about financial matters should study the Banking Commission Report.  He mentioned also that some people were talking nonsense about external assets and told us that we could not have our cake and eat it.  I would like to say to Deputy de Valera or anybody else who talks in that strain that that kind of talk is only good enough for political infants.  He talked about our banks and said that the banking system in this country was the soundest in the world.  So well it may, as long as the <Col N="2484" /> banks control the money and credit of this country and so long as they are allowed to dictate to the past and present Government their economic and social policies.</P>
      <P>Probably I will be able to convince some Deputies as to the type of sound financial system we have.  During the 15 years from 1926 to 1940, inclusive, the ten banks in this country earned a net profit of £22,486,009 on a paid up capital of £9,062,000.  In other words, they made more than double the paid up capital in profits during those 15 years.  Now we will come to later years. In the nine years from 1941 to 1949, inclusive, these banks made a total net profit of £10,841,710.  That means that in 24 years they have made £33,327,719 in profits alone on a paid up capital of only £9,062,000.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder our banking system would be regarded as the soundest in the world when we have these results following the exploitation of the Irish people?  It would be very interesting to find out what are the reserves in those banks and the total value of their property and assets.  Last night Deputy de Valera said that some of us were talking without conviction or experience.  Of course, we are all irresponsible fellows.</P>
      <P>The Cork Corporation floated a loan in 1939 for £250,000 at 4 per cent. at par.  I happened to be Lord Mayor at the time and some of us were instructed to come up to the credit corporation to see if we could get the money.  We did come to the credit corporation and interviewed the chairman, Mr. Colbert.  We informed him of our mission and he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Very well, I will give you £100,000 at 98½ at 4 per cent.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I had to inform him I was one of those who did not agree to pay 4 per cent. on money for building houses for the workers.  I would not agree to any more than 4 per cent. at par.  He said to me:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You will not get it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>At that time we had the financial agreement and I pointed out that in view of what had taken place did he think one could find a better investment than in corporation stock.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2485" />&ldquo;That is true, but they are paying 7 per cent. for it in Abyssinia.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the system we have in operation in this country, and we are paying that gentleman so much a year for looking after investments in this country.</P>
    <P>What was the result of the whole thing?  Not a solitary shilling did we get from the credit corporation.  We then tried the hospital trustees.  Deputy Cosgrave was the senior member for Cork and he was asked to accompany us on our visit to the hospital trustees. We discovered that the Secretary of the trustees was in a bank in College Green.  We interviewed him and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We would be pleased to put our money in corporation stock, but if we were to take it from where it is and transfer it to corporation stock we would be suffering a very severe loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We eventually fell back on issuing a loan to the public but, having floated the loan at 4 per cent. at par, we did not get as much as a solitary shilling from any of the banks in this country. Some 17 months previously the Cork Corporation floated a loan at 98 at 4 per cent. and in less than ten hours more than three times the amount required was subscribed.  Some of the banks subscribed £20,000, and insurance companies subscribed £12,000, but in order to give everybody a portion of the stock, we cut them down.  Later, when the housing loan was floated, not a solitary shilling did the bankers give.</P>
    <P>Can Deputy de Valera or anybody else here deny that it is about time that that system ought to be controlled? Deputies on the opposite benches were in office during the period to which I have referred and that was the time when these bankers were able to dictate policy to them.  I say it is about time that system was changed. I hope every Deputy will read Deputy Esmonde's speech yesterday.  I was sorry to hear Deputy Boland saying that the Deputy was talking about the banks for the sake of popularity.  I suggest that Deputy Esmonde was possessed of great moral courage to speak as he did yesterday about the banks <Col N="2486" /> and the country's credit.  I hope many people will read his speech.</P>
    <P>It is very dishonest&mdash;that is the mildest way of putting it&mdash;to accuse any member of the House or any person outside it of being an enemy of the country if he talks about the need for a change in the control of our money and credit.  I say that type of thing is most dishonest.  We also had that type of jargon of accusing persons of using the printing press and frightening people with the statement that if you interfere with the financial position of the country you will create a crisis.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Childers speak here yesterday.  I am quite satisfied that he realises the need for a change.  All his trouble appears to be the fear of a change.  I am quite satisfied that there are Fianna Fáil Deputies who know well that there is need for a change, but there is this fear that is paralysing them.  It is the greatest enemy to progress that we have.  I am surprised that Deputies in any part of the House should be afraid to tackle the question of our right to have charge of the money and credit of the country.  The money and credit should be a social instrument of the nation.  I do not care what Government we have, but as long as a Government in this country is subject to the dictates of the speculators on the money markets, what chance can there be for it to carry out its programme of industrial development.</P>
    <P>I wonder why there should be the fear of attacking this problem. Deputy de Valera surprised me when he talked about the fear of doing anything.  Let me quote another instance.  Some months ago the Cork County Council looked for an overdraft of £180,000.  A deputation from the Council called on the banks in Cork and asked that they should get the overdraft at the same rate as was being paid for local loans.  Of course the banks could not agree.  The result was that they had to pay 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>At the December meeting of the Cork County Council the council proposed to borrow £280,000 for the maintenance of roads.  A question was asked about the terms on which they could get the loan.  The county manager said the average length for <Col N="2487" /> such loans was about ten years.  He went on to say that on that basis the repayment of principal and interest for the first year would be £39,200, and that this would be reduced by £1,120 in each subsequent year.  What did that work out at?  Perhaps Deputy McGrath will agree when I tell the House that I am now talking about the cost of money.  Over the ten years it worked out in this way, that on that £280,000 the banks would have got £61,600 on the use of money which was required to keep and maintain the roads in the County Cork.</P>
    <P>In view of facts such as these, is it not a good and desirable thing that the Minister for External Affairs would attempt to educate public opinion so that there might be a change in that situation.  Would there be anything wrong if Deputy Aiken, when he was Minister for Finance, went down to Cork and tried to educate the people there that some change was necessary? The moment that anybody talks about finance to-day the Press in the country and the vested interests put up their hands and say: &ldquo;Do not touch it, that is only for experts&rdquo;.  I suggest that the time is ripe for this Government to review the question of financing housing and other essential undertakings. That will have to be done if we are to build the houses our workers require.</P>
    <P>We should come down to realities. Deputy de Valera asked me to come down to realities.  Is there anything wrong in asking that we should use our money without having to pay such heavy interest charges for the purpose of providing houses for those who are producing the wealth of the country? As regards the provision of houses and electricity and other requirements of the people, why should this Government be at the mercy of the financiers? I saw in the paper on Monday last where we had to pay 15/- per ton by way of interest to produce sugar for our people.  I am quite satisfied that the majority of those who get that 15/-in the form of interest on the money which they give to run beet factories, never soiled their hands in the growing or the saving of the beet crop.  Is <Col N="2488" /> there any reason why we should pay 4 per cent. to the bankers so that we might be able to cut turf for our people?  I claim to have as great a sense of responsibility for the man who has a £5 note or £1,000 in the bank, and I am as anxious to safeguard his rights as anybody who is trying to prevent me from having this question of money and credit tackled.  I say it is time for the Government to tackle the whole situation.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the House when the Central Bank Bill was going through.  Deputy de Valera was Taoiseach at the time.  I asked him then what was the good of bringing in a Central Bank Bill when he was giving no power to that institution.  Do Deputies realise that the Central Bank cannot take £1 on deposit?  Yet, this same Central Bank has £43,000,000 invested in English securities for which they are receiving a little over 1 per cent.  But we have to pay 4 per cent. for the money we require to carry out many necessary undertakings and 3½ per cent. for the money we require for housing.  These are matters to which the members of this House should address themselves instead of quoting past history or in making vindictive speeches across the House.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister for Finance that I am prepared to support his Estimate wholeheartedly because there are many things to be done and the more investment of money there is in the country the better it will be for the whole people. Great issues are facing us.  We do not know what may face us as a result of the financial position across the water. If there is to be further devaluation of the pound in Great Britain how will it affect us?  Is there any other country in the world that would allow £43,000,000 of its money to be subject to the outside control of another country, especially in view of the fact that we are only getting a little over 1 per cent. on it, while we have to pay 3½ per cent. and 4 per cent. for the doing of necessary social work at home.  Our heroes were not afraid to challenge the most powerful empire in the world.  They did not measure the cost of the sacrifices that they were prepared to make.  Why should we <Col N="2489" /> be afraid to face the money bags and the financial interests of this country in order that we may serve our people and give them the standard of living that they are entitled to.  Are we not ashamed that we can give only 17/6 a week to the old age pensioners and smaller sums to widows?  The fact is that we are not able to do more because we have not the moral backing and courage to do what is necessary according to our Constitution. The sooner we deal with these matters rather than be spending our time in trying to score political points the sooner this nation is going to take its place amongst the nations of the world.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants an immediate answer I can tell him now. The funds of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union are all invested with the municipal authorities of this country.  Those who have responsibility for the funds have no voice in what interest is being paid because they must be invested in gilt-edged securities.  Let me say also that the organisation offered £50,000 free of interest during the emergency to the country, and when it did so it found very little response in that direction from any other organisation, bankers or otherwise.</P>

      <P>What I am concerned about is that there does not seem to be much worry here about how many millions are piled up.  The Rake's Progress still goes on.  The Minister for Agriculture endeavoured to give orders to the local authorities this year when he told them that the <Col N="2490" /> county manager can reduce the rates, and if the county manager does not reduce his estimate for the rates they should sack him.  That was the statement of Deputy James Dillon, the Minister for Agriculture, which he sent to every county council and which was published in the Press.  Having a Minister of that kind in the Cabinet, you would expect, if collective responsibility means anything, that he would have brought his influence to bear and said: &ldquo;This amount can be reduced. and if it is not reduced we will sack the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have had wild statements made here and accusations thrown out which lead me to believe that one Minister over there does not know who the other Minister is.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach yesterday said that the Fianna Fáil Government were going to spend £11,500,000, I think it was, on new buildings for the Oireachtas. I have a fairly good memory, and I was wondering from whom I heard that statement about these new Oireachtas buildings before.  Suddenly I remembered and I went to the Library to look it up.  In case anybody has any doubt as to who got the brainwave for that, I am going to give the quotation from Volume 97, column 1027, of the Official Reports, of what Deputy James Dillon, the present Minister for Agriculture, said.  When I heard of this new move about the capital expenditure services, I knew whose brainwave that was, also.  This is what the Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;This is a time when we should mobilise credit and use it boldly and resolve, if necessary, to repay it over the next 100 years.  The extension of credit should not deter us from embarking on bold schemes at the present time, always provided that they are good schemes.  As a start in that direction, one good thing would be to build a new Oireachtas, and it would prove to be an economy in the long run.  We are eternally patching and tinkering with these buildings in order to make them adequate to fulfil the functions of an efficient Parliament.  It is common knowledge that half the Deputies cannot find accommodation in which <Col N="2491" /> to write a letter.  Even the Ministers' rooms are inadequate and they have not proper facilities.  We are trying to get our meals in a restaurant which is built on top of the boiler house and in which no person could sit in the months of August and September. The permanent officials are obliged to sit in cramped quarters up at the top, and their teeth are made to chatter with the noise of the machinery in the basement, because we are trying to dislodge a beetle through the medium of a vacuum cleaner in the roof.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Where was that beetle?  Already he has been after the Colorado Beetle. Only an hour ago we gave him £1,600 for chasing that beetle out to Colorado.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I understand that the roof is now infested with beetles and that it shall have to be rebuilt.  Of course, some facetious individuals will possibly say that we ought to transfer all our activities into the Musuem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think it is grossly unfair, after all the charges that have been levelled against the Fianna Fáil Administration that they should be charged with having that brainwave.  It was evidently the product of beetles in the roof or bats in the belfry.  Charges like this have occupied the House for the last few days.  When Deputy Hickey speaks of financial matters I have a certain amount of sympathy for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to know how much of this £12,000,000 is going into productive industry or how much of it into non-productive industry.  I shall quote my dearly beloved friend again as reported in the Official Reports for Wednesday, 4th March, 1942, column 2277.  When I read this I thought it was yesterday that the Minister for Agriculture was speaking on this Vote.  On that occasion the Minister for Agriculture said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It would not have mattered so much if the Government confined themselves to robbing the Treasury, but, in addition to robbing the Treasury, they are borrowing right, left and centre, wherever they <Col N="2492" /> could, to finance the various &lsquo;cod&rsquo; schemes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reminds me of what is happening here.  Apparently, we will be borrowing right, left and centre to the extent of £12,000,000 to be expended on various &ldquo;cod&rdquo; schemes.</P>
    <P>In regard to industry, I am anxious to know when there is going to be any extension of an industry in this country or any effort made to start any new industry or to take up the plans and proposals that were ready when the Fianna Fáil Government left office, and work on them.  If the Government want any advice on the matter, I have no objection to giving it to them.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce would take a trip to Cobh, he would see at Haulbowline on the wall of the general manager's office blue prints for changing that steel industry over into oil, which would mean, according to the opinion of the general manager, a 15 per cent. reduction of the cost of producing iron and steel in this country.  They are lying there since November, 1947.  The Minister should also be aware that when that industry was in course of preparation first, plans were made for various extensions and, amongst these extensions, were the making of block and corrugated iron.  He should be aware, also, that there is not one lb. of corrugated iron made in this country. That is an industry awaiting development. According to the estimates given to me by the general manager of Irish Steel, he could find employment there for anything up to 200 more able-bodied men at a decent wage if the industry was extended to manufacture some of the things that we are now importing.  The plans were laid when this Government went out of office.  I hope that some of this £12,000,000 will go into expanding that industry and providing decent employment there for our own people.</P>

      <P>That is just what I would expect.  My complaint is that the money is not being devoted to that purpose.  I think it would be much better to invest it in an industry such as that rather than invest it in the reclamation of land at £25 an acre, land to be sold subsequently to the Minister for Lands at his valuation of £4 per acre.  That is where £3,100,000 of this money is going.  When the last Government was in office we had schemes for the drainage and reclamation of land, but under our schemes a grant of 75 per cent. was made available and the farmers concerned were responsible for the other 25 per cent. What is the scheme now?  Where will the scheme start and where will it stop?  The scheme was introduced some 18 months ago with a flourish of trumpets.  Last month I asked the Minister for Agriculture how much fertilisers and lime had been put out in Counties Meath and Monaghan, the two counties in which the scheme had been put into operation.  The reply I got&mdash;I think it was the shortest answer ever given by the present Minister for Agriculture in this House&mdash;was the one word: &ldquo;None&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;None&rdquo;.  Now, there is very little use in starting to drain land 15 or 16 months ago and letting it lie ever since without a lb. of fertiliser or a barrel of lime.  But that was the answer given by the Minister for Agriculture.  I am very concerned with the condition of affairs in our principal industry, agriculture.  It is rather amazing that prior to the present Minister taking office, speaking on the Vote on Account on the 5th March.  1942, at column 2279 of the Dáil Debates, he charged the Fianna Fáil Government with having ruined the land of this country by producing wheat on it.  At column 2278 he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the end of ten years of Fianna Fáil, 500,000 acres of Irish land under wheat produced not the 500,000 tons of wheat that it would have produced ten years ago, but 210,000 tons.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said the land was ruined.  He said <Col N="2494" /> it would not produce wheat now</P>
    <P>&ldquo;because like every other institution of this State, the land has been impoverished by the Fianna Fáil Party, and bad as the yield was last year does any farmer dare to prophesy what the yield will be this year?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1942.  Fianna Fáil continued its compulsory wheat scheme right up to 1948 and I heard the Minister bumptiously boasting that he got over a ton an acre for every acre of wheat grown in the country.  He forgot all about God and the weather. They did not come into the picture at all.  The extraordinary thing is that the only advertisement issued by the Minister's Department last year was an advertisement advising the farmers to grow wheat, despite the fact that he told us the growing of wheat in this country in peace time was</P>
    <P>&ldquo;pernicious cod for which we are paying in this hour of crisis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said that in 1942.  Having gone through the whole gamut, having started off with a flourish of trumpets and advised the farmers to grow oats, when the harvest came there was no market.  But he did not worry as to whether or not there was a market and he created such uncertainty in regard to it that, lo and behold, in this little island of ours we have to-day to send away out to the Argentine for feeding oats purchased with hard-earned dollars.</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not providing the money here, I wonder where the £2,250,000 is going to come from to pay for Cuban sugar to take the place of the 9,000 to 10,000 odd acres of beet which the Minister has succeeded in preventing from being grown in this country.  As a result of his actions, we have to pay £500,000 in dollars more to the foreigner for that quantity of sugar than we would pay to our own farmers here to produce it. We hear talk of production.  Surely the first job in this country should be the production of our own food.  Surely, at a period like this, when there is a reduction in the value of our sterling assets and of our sterling, this is not a time when we should be sending abroad for materials and foodstuffs that can be and should be produced here. That is one of the items.</P>
      <P>My authority for that is the public statement made by the general manager of the Irish Sugar Company and published on the 23rd February in the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  He said that the price we were paying for foreign sugar was £12 a ton more than what he was selling sugar produced by our Irish farmers for.  That is only one item.  An increase of 24,000 acres of beet in this country would fill that gap. A recommendation was sent to the Government for an increase of 4/6 a ton in beet last year, and was turned down by them.  Now they have to give more to the foreigner than they were prepared to pay to their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Defence was the acting Minister for Agriculture&mdash;when our Minister for Agriculture conveniently left us&mdash;and it was he who <Col N="2496" /> succeeded, luckily enough, in getting rid of the oats.  When you come to examine the estimates you find that we paid £4,801,000 for foreign maize that year.  It was thrown in here to help the farmers to sell their oats.  I do not know what the policy is that is going to leave our principal industry in this country in the position that you have employed on the land to-day, as compared with the day those gentlemen opposite took up office, 21,000 less people.  A total of 21,000 have fled from the land since the inter-Party Government took up office.</P>

      <P>They might be going to work on the £80 an acre estate that the Minister for Agriculture mentioned a few days ago&mdash;£44,000.  Perhaps the Minister for Agriculture might be able to induce them to take up work on it.  In this country each farmer with a holding under £35 valuation has something around £3 a week as his total income over the 12 months of the year, while any labourer in any kind of employment can get from £4 7s 6d to £5 a week.  What will be the position while that state of affairs exists on the land or anywhere else?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mark you, what happened in regard to sugar this year and what happened in regard to oats and what happened the other day that sent the Minister to Amsterdam for the spuds will create a condition of affairs in this country where you will find yourself back again, not dividing up the holdings with the Land Commission, but bulking them all into one ranch, because there will be no one to work them.  That is caused solely because of the absolute uncertainty of the position at the present time.  Each thing has been attacked in turn and wiped out; I will not say that was done maliciously, but it has been done.  The last thing that has been wiped out is the old cow.  There is now an economic war against the old cow.  I have been a member of this House for the past 23 years and when I think of all the red herrings on collective responsibility I wonder what <Col N="2497" /> is the collective responsibility that drove nine farmers, who directly represent the farming community, into the lobby last week to vote against the farmer getting an economic price for his milk.  Collective responsibility!</P>

      <P>I should like to call the attention of the House to the fact that, in this Estimate, the subsidy on fertilisers is completely wiped out and, as a result of that, you have an increase of £2 a ton on fertilisers, in spite of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture told us that the cost would not be increased.</P>
      <P>Going through these Estimates, you will find that in the Department of Agriculture alone, there is an item of £27,000 for increased salaries.  That from the Minister who was going to reduce expenditure by doing away with inspectors.  We thought there would be a reduction of nearly £500,000 in the Estimate for Agriculture, seeing that all the inspectors who had been annoying the farmers were going to be dispensed with.  However, there is an increase of £27,000 for increased salaries and an increase of £19,000 in travelling expenses&mdash;I suppose to enable the Minister to go to the Argentine for oats and to Amsterdam for the &ldquo;spuds&rdquo;.  The result of all this is to be seen in the rising cost of living.  If the Minister for Defence had gone down to Cork last week, he would have found that potatoes were costing no less than 3/- per stone.</P>

      <P>That is all right, but the fact remains that that scarcity has been created through the uncertainty of the markets.  It is now reacting on the heads of those who refused to take the good advice given by Deputies from these benches.  I wonder whether it would not be far more advisable for the Dáil to set about a complete examination of our position in that line.  Every day one opens the paper, there is talk of war and more war and once you create a condition of affairs in which you are going to be short of essentials, <Col N="2498" /> especially of essential food, you place yourself in a position in which there is no hope for you.  I doubt the wisdom of exporting dollars to America for wheat or anything else that can be grown in this country.</P>

      <P>I knew I had something to tell the Deputy.  There is no one gladder than I am that he has reminded me of it.  He is a godsend to me.  I am quoting from the Official Report of the Dáil for the 7th May, 1947, column 2248:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to improve the standard of living of the people in the Gaeltacht, the Minister for Agriculture is arranging to carry out experiments in the concentrated production and marketing of glass-house crops.  The scheme roughly is to get a minimum of 100 farmers to erect glass-houses covering one-fortieth of an acre each in an area sufficiently concentrated to justify the running of a central plantrearing and packing station and to have the crops grown and packed under the best technical supervision. The importance of promoting glass-house production on the small holdings in the Gaeltacht can be appreciated when it is realised that 40 tons of tomatoes per acre can be grown under glass on land that could not produce ten tons of potatoes per acre.  The Minister for Agriculture intends also to help the extension of poultry-keeping in the Gaeltacht.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was a statement made by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Aiken, in this House in his efforts to promote the Gaeltacht glass-house and poultry schemes.  Deputy Rooney, in the old days, before he found that he was hogtied and shackled, used to be worried about tomatoes and the price his unfortunate constituents were getting for them.  I am wondering why Deputy Rooney has not said a word now about the complete absence from this huge bill of £78,000,000 of one penny piece for the poor old tomato grower.  I knew Deputy Rooney in his earlier days and I thought he would make a bit of a scrapper, but he seems to have lost his vim.  That is another <Col N="2499" /> item that has completely disappeared from the Estimates.</P>

      <P>We had a lot of talk about housing.  I have noticed from time to time that certain claims have been made in connection with housing by the present Government.  Lest they should get any idea of making any of those claims in my part of the world, I want to say here, as the chairman of a housing authority, that the only limit that we would place on housing in the south Cork area would be a limit of people to occupy houses.  Each county councillor or member of the board of health was requested to come to that meeting with a list of applicants, and I was prepared to guarantee to him that there would be houses built for every one of the applicants.  That guarantee was carried out.  It does not matter whether it was a Fianna Fáil Government or a Fine Gael Government or a mixum gatherum that was in power.  So far as the housing needs of the people in east Cork were concerned, they were looked after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall have to be very brief in my remarks, seeing that the Minister will intervene in the debate at a quarter to 11.  I came into this House under the impression, like a lot of other Deputies, that Fianna Fáil were rather slow about their policy of national development&mdash;that they had neglected it&mdash;and, having listened here to the debate for the past three days, and particularly to the contributions that came from the benches opposite, I am convinced in that belief.  I am also convinced that not alone did they fail to push ahead with national development, but they are now, as an Opposition, prepared to retard any advance that this Government tries to make.  The time is so short that I must get down to the facts very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here yesterday the Minister for External Affairs asked two specific questions of the Fianna Fáil Party. He asked them, first of all, what stand were they prepared to take on the question of the repatriation of our external assets, and the second question that he asked them was, had they or had they not a policy in connection with the control of our finances.  I listened carefully to the rest of the speakers on the opposite benches since then&mdash;and the debate is now about to conclude&mdash;but so far we have not got any two members on the Fianna Fáil benches to give the same version of <Col N="2501" /> the policy they have in mind either on the repatriation of external assets or on the control of our own finances and currency.</P>
    <P>I wish to welcome the new departure in the presentation of the Estimates, the separating of capital expenditure from the ordinary, or what I would consider household expenditure from year to year.  In the coming year this Government is prepared to expend over £12,000,000 on capital development.  In the last year of office of Fianna Fáil the amount shown in the Estimates for capital development was less than £2,000,000.  A Government that wants to put a policy of full employment into operation must be prepared to indulge&mdash;if you can so describe it&mdash;in a policy in which capital development plays a large part and capital expenditure will be of a productive nature.</P>
    <P>Last night here Deputy Lemass really let the cat out of the bag so far as Fianna Fáil are concerned in dealing with items such as afforestation, land reclamation, hospitalisation and housing.  He maintained that the money expended on the development of these services should come out of current taxation, and he said the reason the present Government was prepared to ease the burden on the people by lengthening the time for the repayment of the money on these development schemes was that posterity would have no votes in the next election.  That, in a nutshell, is the key to the Fianna Fáil policy for years past.  They pursued a policy that would, in their opinion, give returns in the next election and put them back into power, but they forgot that there were other generations coming after. Surely to God there is nobody on the Fianna Fáil benches so foolish as to think that an intensive programme of afforestation could bear immediate fruit for the purposes of an election?</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate any Government that has the foresight and the courage to start a programme of afforestation when that Government can never hope to achieve, within its own lifetime, the credit, by getting <Col N="2502" /> votes at a general election, for putting that policy into operation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the mentality that the Minister spoke about here last night in connection with afforestation.  I hope that mentality has gone for good.  He said that there existed a viewpoint that money spent on afforestation was not wisely spent; in other words, that it was foolish to lock up money in afforestation because the benefits of afforestation would not be seen for a number of years.  That, to my mind, proves that Fianna Fáil had no notion of pursuing an intensive afforestation programme and it is no harm that they are now on the far side of the House, because they will not be able to prevent that programme from being carried out.</P>
    <P>Now, there was a good deal of talk last night on the question of our sterling assets.  I listened to Deputy de Valera, Senior, explain his views. He said it was nonsense to talk about repatriating those accumulated assets which made us one of the few creditor nations of the world.  Then he posed the question: is that a bad position? His question reminded me that, not so very long ago, he posed the question as to whether or not it was a good thing to repeal the External Relations Act.  He always poses questions and never gives an answer.  He asked: is that a bad position, and for himself he answered: &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We had, he said, a compulsory saving in the purchase of goods.  Maybe we had, but we also had a compulsory flow of emigration as a result of that policy, and if Deputy de Valera and Fianna Fáil think it is a better policy to have our external assets frozen, as they were in Britain, while our young people have to go abroad as a result of that policy, they are welcome to pursue that policy.  Deputy de Valera went on to say that in time of danger they would attempt to get them back.  I wonder can Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass make up their minds as to what they want.  I intend to give a quotation from a statement that was made several years ago.  I leave it to the House to decide who made the statement.  The <Col N="2503" /> answer to the question is a six-marker. This was the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A creditor nation, our foreign assets are mainly in Britain.... We are now in the position that we are unable to utilise them as we would wish....  For many years our economists have been preaching about the value of these assets. They measured the prosperity of this country by the rise and fall in their value.  There was a Maginot Line mentality about them which prevented a sounder financial policy for the country from developing.  If, instead of these immobilised sterling assets, we had real tangible assets in our own country&mdash;factories, machinery, buildings, stores of goods how much stronger we would be?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That was a statement made by Deputy Lemass which appeared in the <i>Irish Press</i> on the 1st February, 1941.  I invite Deputies to compare that statement with the speeches which we had yesterday from Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McQuillan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give another quotation from Deputy Lemass which appears in to-day's issue of the <i>Irish Press.</i>  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Just before the outbreak of war he was given responsibility for making preparations against the war.  One of the matters that naturally arose for our consideration was the means by which we would finance imports from the dollar area while a war was in progress.  It naturally occurred to them to transfer funds in the Central Bank to the dollar area.  That, at the time, would have had serious consequences on the international value of sterling, and, in any event, it would have been a rather difficult operation to conclude.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last few lines of that quotation we have the key to Fianna Fáil policy on the repatriation of our external <Col N="2504" /> assets&mdash;that the problem was too difficult to tackle.  I think that the speeches made by Deputy de Valera and Deputy Lemass in this debate were a complete contradiction of the speech made by Deputy Lemass on the 1st February, 1941.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of this extra money for capital development is to put as many of our people as possible into full employment.  It is an accepted fact that full employment is a necessity in the world to-day if we are not to have another slump such as the one we had in the 1930s.  In October and up to December of 1947 a group of five leading economists, men of world fame, submitted a report to the United Nations' Organisation in which they stated that another slump such as that of the 30's was avoidable only by a policy of full employment and every member of the United Nations was pledged to that policy.  Here in Ireland, if we hope to get that policy put into operation we must have control of our own finances, and, for once, let us copy the British in something that can be really useful for our own country.  Mr. Morrison, a member of the British Government, expressed this view recently:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We shall control the financial forces to keep up our employment and raise production.  We must, therefore, have control over imports and exports of capital.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That statement was made by a leading British statesman.  I think there is nothing wrong if a leading Irish statesman makes the same kind of remarks about finance in his own country and says it is time that we in Ireland take control financially as well as politically.</P>
    <P>I do not want to refer in detail to the remarks that were made by Deputy Childers whose main fear, in connection with taking control of our own finances, appeared to be that it would make the breach between the North of Ireland and the South bigger.  In other words, he was trying to cause the same trouble that he caused when the repeal of the External Relations Act was under consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2505" /> I presume the Minister for Finance wants to conclude.  On that account, I am prepared to forego, much as I dislike it, dealing with other aspects of the repatriation of our sterling assets, and with the policy of keeping as many people in productive employment as we would like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the third day that we have been debating the Vote on Account.  The debate has roughly gone on two lines.  We had the people who tried to discuss, in a serious manner, what very definitely is the new development that has been accomplished this year, and on the other hand the Deputies who could not refrain from bringing it down into the arena of Party politics.  Most of the lengthy speeches that were made were from those who, of course, decided that that would be the best way to treat this development.  I want to have it regarded as a new development.  I cannot say that it is entirely novel, but, as I said in my opening speech, for years it was the practice when Budget time came to make certain subtractions for things that were to be properly met by borrowing, and not to be taken from the taxpayer in a particular year. We have enlarged the scope of that considerably.  I would rather have it regarded not as a measuring up, so to speak, of the number of items now being taken in this way, but by the fact that, deliberately, we have set out here on what I think is a new line of policy.  We are trying to create a bigger amount of public investment, and we want that to run along with private investment; but we think there is a great field of very wide scope, and of very many things, for which investment, either directly by the State or in some way under the persuasion of the State, is required&mdash;something that the ordinary private investor will not do.  I do not think there is much objection to that, except the Party ones that have been made, as a principle, and even when the items that are segregated here in the £12,500,000 sum have been analysed, I do not think there is anything in the way of serious objection <Col N="2506" /> to what it is proposed to make the subject matter of borrowing.</P>
      <P>I have already quoted one remark made by the Taoiseach at the Institute of Bankers meeting on the 19th November last.  I want to enlarge on that quotation, because it showed the policy that we were developing.  It was, I think, the first important public occasion upon which that policy had been given a direct voice and we regard it as definitely being an important point&mdash;the development of the financial and economic resources in this State.  The Taoiseach said on that occasion:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Public finance in the past has been mainly preoccupied with the annual Budget, although this covered no more than a fifth or a quarter of a country's economic activity.  To-day, however, it is generally recognised that to discharge fully its economic responsibilities the Government must budget not primarily to allocate a certain part of the nation's finances to public purposes, but must also ensure that the resources of the nation are utilised in the way which can best advance the interests of the community. The community has to be considered not merely as taxpayers but as producers and consumers as well, and the level of the national income may be regarded as the best indicator of economic progress.  The Government can best influence the community's prosperity by a sound budgetary policy and by investment. As long ago as 1936, the late Lord Keynes declared that the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the headline set last November.  We are following out that in this Book of Estimates, to be followed still further when the beginning of May comes and the House hears the ordinary Financial Resolutions.  We are not going to budget hereafter primarily to allocate a certain part of the nation's finances to public purposes. We are going, as far as we can manage it, to ensure that the resources of the nation are utilised in the way <Col N="2507" /> which best can advance the interests of the community.  We take the test that the best indicator of economic progress will be the level of the national income and we accept it that the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.  Is there anybody here who will query any one of those four items I took from that paragraph of the Taoiseach's speech? Apparently it is going to be accepted unanimously.</P>
    <P>We see the application of that in this volume in which £12,500,000 is going to be devoted to certain capital services.  We found an agriculture that never was very well developed and which had been wasted by over-cropping during the war period.  Looking back over the statistics of production since the State was founded, although the volume of agricultural production increased here and there, I think it is true to say, as was said in evidence before the Banking Commission, that the volume of agricultural production has hardly increased in this country since about 1880, and it was certainly on the decline during the war period.  The land of the country was in no state by itself, and without aid from the State, to come to the point where we would get the increased production required.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, we found a terrific back log here so far as housing was concerned and public enthusiasm mingled with public anxiety, one with regard to the progress which should be made and the other with regard to the progress which was being made in catching up on these arrears.  We had the astonishing statement made by Fianna Fáil to-night that if this country decided to build all the houses required, about 100,000, this year, that would be capital development, but, if divided over ten years, it would not be proper capital development.  That is the economic advice we get from the Party which formed the Government for 16 years.  That back log must be caught upon.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is a pretty bad arrear in connection with school <Col N="2508" /> buildings.  There are some buildings, I understand, still being used as schools in this country which were converted from Church property uses as far back as 1816.  The Department of Education have a programme with regard to making good, not making entirely good, but making good to some extent the terrific arrear there is with regard to school buildings over a period of five years.  Are all these school buildings, as well as all the houses and all the development of land required, to be done from the resources that the citizens, through taxation, can provide in a year or five years?</P>
    <P>In the Seanad, on the 12th January, 1949, Senator Professor O'Brien said, as reported in the Official Report for the 12th January, column 564:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I cannot help feeling that the right way to approach this subject of agricultural credit is not by loans of money from the banks to farmers but by subsidising farmers and enabling them to obtain in a subsidised way, either by way of grant or loan, the particular type of fixed or working capital which falls in with the Government's agricultural programme. When it comes to the question of how these loans and subsidies are to be paid for, I suggest to the Minister that there is a very strong case for borrowing to pay for a great many of these loans and subsidies.</P>
    <P>Taxation in this country is already as high as the country can stand, and I think that a programme of agricultural production of this kind is essentially a productive investment.  It is a productive investment in the sense that, sooner or later, the national income will be raised as a result of the investment. It is not self-liquidating. The debt created will be dead-weight debt&mdash;with that I agree&mdash; but the fact that a debt is a dead-weight debt does not necessarily mean that it should not be incurred.</P>
    <P>There again, I would like to try to correct a false impression which is still very widespread in relation to the Banking Commission report. The Banking Commission report, <Col N="2509" /> which referred with disapproval to a good deal of the dead-weight debt which had accumulated at the time, has frequently been quoted as an expression of opinion by the Banking Commission that debt which is dead-weight should never be incurred in any circumstances whatsoever.  I would like to draw a distinction between productive dead-weight debt and unproductive dead-weight debt, and the real criticism of the Banking Commission regarding the dead-weight debt which was being accumulated in 1938 was that a good deal of it, at any rate, was unproductive in the sense that the assets which were being created by it were not earning anything in return. I think that investment in the improvement of Irish agriculture is the most productive type of investment which the Government could encourage, and I think that debt of that kind, which may be dead-weight debt in the sense that in the first few years the taxpayer may have to find the interest on it, in the long run will yield abundant return.  Therefore, I do suggest to the Minister that in discussions with his colleagues he should advocate borrowing rather than taxation for his agricultural programme.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>That is a dead-weight comment.  At any rate, that is the professor's own statement.  Deputy Derrig thinks he knows more about Professor O'Brien's mind than the professor does.  If he thinks the professor's mind in 1938 was the one we should be guided by, I take this.  Let us judge this on our own.  Is investment in Irish agriculture good or bad? Is it something we should borrow for? Do we think we will get a return in the end?  Do we think that the level of production will be raised by as much as the annual cost over a number of years of the investment proposed?  I personally think it will be raised to <Col N="2510" /> that extent and in that hope the main bulk of the House, I think, join.  That deals with a considerable part of this amount of £12,500,000.</P>
      <P>Another part of it is housing.  Housing for the people comes under two of the headings in the Local Government Vote, No. 38, part under the Gaeltacht Services Vote, all the money that is in Vote No. 71 and in the Transition Development Fund.  I cannot understand how at this stage of this country's history anybody has been found in this House to say that it is not right to borrow for housing. If it is not right to do so, we have been doing it since 1932.  Why should we turn our backs on what was a programme approved by everybody, even the financiers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;since the State was founded?  The amazing conclusion came this evening, after all the varied arguments made on the point, from the ex-Minister for Agriculture that, if we wanted to build the entire 100,000 houses, it is good capital development proper for borrowing, but that if we build 10,000 a year for ten years, we ought to finance it from the taxpayer. That is the height of folly or the depth of folly to which people can be driven by listening to the arguments from the Front Bench opposite.  We have been borrowing for housing&mdash;is that acceptable? What is now being changed? Nothing, except that there is a recognition of the tremendous task which lies ahead, and, after appreciating that, there is simply this idea of letting the people know clearly what is proposed and giving them a figure, so that they can segregate these items under the different heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will it be accepted that forestry is an investment over a long period and that we should not finance it out of annual taxation?  In fact, it is years since the whole of forestry was so financed.  It is not any new principle that is being adopted in regard to it, but merely that it is proposed to spend more money on afforestation and therefore the debt accumulated under <Col N="2511" /> this heading will be greater and the amortisation will have to be borne in an increasing way as the years go on. I could go through all these items, but I do not think that more than three people at any time have concentrated in their condemnation of any one of these items.</P>
    <P>There is apparently a mistake with regard to the item listed as No. 10. It is under No. 10 heading, F. and G., and that is simply because these two sums are found in a Vote which has been misnamed from the beginning. They are two relatively small items&mdash; urban employment schemes and rural employment schemes, and I think it is the newspapers more than Deputies which have been misled by the fact that they are so named.  I am glad in a sense that they were still in that Vote, although they will be transferred out of it next year, when this change was made, because they do mark a difference.  Deputies will notice that in respect of these we have put after each of the two items, in brackets, the words &ldquo;sanitary service works&rdquo;.  In other words, it is such part of these moneys as is devoted to the sanitary services appropriate to housing that we tie in with housing and consider to be as proper for borrowing as housing itself.  For years, that has been carried as an employment scheme.  We want to mark the difference.  For years, that has been the system&mdash;an endeavour here to get the people more fully occupied at whatever their occupation may be, with some under occupied for a number of years in the main industry of the country, agriculture, and some out of employment over the years.</P>
    <P>It has been the hope to try to get these people who are out of employment for the whole or part of the year occupied at patching, at relief schemes, something that has been described as being on the lines of the old famine schemes of digging a whole in the ground and putting the earth back again.  We feel that we are doing something in even transferring these away from the heading of employment schemes and putting them under the heading of development work.  We <Col N="2512" /> associate that development with house construction and tie it on to that, and nobody need have any fear that anything that counts as merely a relief scheme will be allowed to come into this scheme of capital appropriations. That is the programme or at least part of the programme.</P>
    <P>Last year, on the under-the-line services ordinarily detailed in the White Paper published just before Budget time, we showed that we were making provision for the expenditure of about another £12,000,000 on things like electrical works, telephone works and certain other matters, the details of which will no doubt be known.  I cannot see that under-the-line sum at anything less than £16,000,000 this year and that is to be added to the £12,500,000.  It is quite likely that in this year there will be spent something short of £30,000,000 on these capital development schemes.  There seemed to be a certain amount of consternation when I answered a Deputy last night and said that, so far as we are concerned, that is going to go on for years, until we recover the productivity which we think there is in this country and until we have caught up with these arrears, both in housing proper and school buildings, and until we have attended to these other items so far as it is appropriate to attend to these over the years.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary not to have all these done at the same time.  I have no doubt that this programme, when we come to deal with it in the months ahead, will be seen to require an ordering, that these particular items will have to get one priority over the other.  There will be required a very careful watch to see that there is not too great a demand upon either the manpower or the money power in the country and it may be&mdash;this, I think, is the fear which has been most often expressed in this House&mdash;that the spending of these sums might cause a very serious increase in the inflationary pressure which, I think, is still around. If that did happen, it might be that these schemes would have to be put in some order of priority, some postponed, and some even deferred until a <Col N="2513" /> later year, but I have no real fear or anxiety about that happening.</P>
    <P>We have heard from the report of the Central Bank that inflationary pressures are still here.  That cannot have been any surprise to Deputies opposite because for the past six or seven years that same warning has been sounded, but it is useful to have the warning and the danger must always be feared.  It would have to be the endeavour of this Government&mdash; colleagues of mine, I hope, will assist me in it&mdash;to see, as I say, that these schemes will not crowd too fast, one upon the heels of the other, as to make any disorderly advance which might cause the inflation which is definitely to be feared to become a real menace.</P>
    <P>I have been asked here whether there is the money around to finance all these.  Again, I think there is. Some Deputies seem to think&mdash;founding it on a figure mentioned incidentally in the Central Bank report in respect of a particular year&mdash;that once we went beyond a draw of £24,000,000 a year, we were getting into danger. It must be recognised that there is a great field for private investment and it would be a very bad thing indeed if what the State intends to do this year were to stop to any great extent the money that ordinarily the private investor wants to put into reproductive schemes in the country.  I should imagine that the amount of money that has been spent for years past on all sorts of projects, both new matters, reconstruction, repairs and everything else, has been of the order of £70,000,000 a year, and there has been no appreciable change, no change for the worse, in the finances of the country.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in so far as the balance of payments is any test, last year, in which a very big amount of capital money was expended, was one of the most successful years we had.  The balance of payments which in 1947 had been running at almost £30,000,000 of a deficit, had been changed to something short of £20,000,000 in 1948 and was less than £5,000,000 in the year just ended.  This country can accommodate itself easily to that situation, when all <Col N="2514" /> these sums of money were being made available, between public and private investment, for whatever was required, I have no doubt that the money is there and is available up to what we require as capital.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the argument here turned on whether we could get this money or whether some new procedure would have to be devised to get it.  I hope that, when the Deputies on the other side read the debates of the last couple of days, they will recognise they have not done the country much good by their comments.  I said, when opening, that while these projects will be financed in the beginning by a draw on the American Counterpart Fund, arising from American benevolence, I will also finance them out of certain other funds in my hands and eventually hope to get money from the public by borrowing. The only comments that drew were of a scandalous type from members of the Opposition.  Reference was made several times to the fact that the second loan this Government attempted to get from the people had not drawn the full amount.  The people who said that should have remembered their own history.  They had not a very good record about getting money when they approached the public.  They had one catastrophic approach to the public, but it did not stop them from going again.  What happened last year will not stop me from attempting to get the public to subscribe.</P>
    <P>When people did mention the fact that the loan was not filled last year, the second one, they should have remembered the very restrictive conditions which, very deliberately, this Government put upon its attempt to get that loan.  We asked the banks not to look for money abroad; we asked the banks not to create, by way of overdraft or otherwise, credit for that loan.  We made it known to them&mdash;and they appreciated the fact&mdash; that the main endeavour was to get from the people surplus savings which we thought, if we got into a loan, we would not leave any longer as purchasing power in their hands.  As the days of the week in which that loan was on offer went on, the banks made an approach to my Department to know <Col N="2515" /> whether now we would let them subscribe themselves and part with part of their funds, or let some of their customers become subscribers.  We asked them not to do it.</P>
    <P>Conditions may change next year. Those who spoke so casually of it should remember that I said all these things and was quite frank with this House in explaining what happened and what the result had been.  If Deputies on the far side of the House had any real hope or belief that they were ever again, or shortly, to occupy these seats, they would not have spoken in the last two or three days as they did speak.  We can take the depths to which they have sunk as some evidence of their own appreciation of their future.  They should at least help the country, and should not try to create scares.  If they have any criticism to pass on the items in this Estimate set aside as proper for borrowing, they should have argued those points.  I asked that that should be done.  I do assert that very strict tests were applied before any item got into that tot of £12,000,000.  I wanted these matters publicly discussed, because in the end it is public opinion we have to live by, and if public criticisms showed that the items put into that tot cast doubt on the whole scheme or part of it, we would have to modify the scheme or abandon it altogether.</P>
    <P>Into this question there then came the whole matter of our attitude as Deputies, the attitude of certain Deputies in different Parties and even certain conflicting attitudes towards the banks.  I was glad to hear in the end Deputy Peadar Cowan make the comment that he thought that even people who regarded the present situation of financing as bad were wrong to launch any attacks on the banks as institutions.  I want to underline that. I think it is wrong.  I personally think nobody could be satisfied with the situation that exists at the moment.  At the same time, we must see that we get the arguments properly made before the people as it is only when we have educated public opinion and they have a proper appreciation of what we <Col N="2516" /> do, that we can get public support.  It is not the banks that give the support, it is the people whose money is in the banks, and so it is the people we have to get on our side.</P>
    <P>I was amazed last night when Deputy Vivion de Valera thought fit to criticise a speech I made in the Seanad on the 26th October, 1949.  Nearly the whole issue of the Seanad Debates for that date was given up to a motion on the monetary policy of the State.  My own remarks, which were not very lengthy, are given at column 129. Deputy Vivion de Valera thought it was proper to pass on as my attitude towards banks the type of comment I had passed on the Dublin Corporation. I asked him to read what I had said and to point out to what he took objection.</P>
    <P>He read what I had said, but I never heard the objection.  I have a feeling that he was confused and that he had never read that speech before, but had merely read a comment upon it, a comment which is to be found in the columns of the <i>Irish Times</i>, proceeding from a correspondent who is certainly very fast qualifying for a high place in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  There is a talent there for misrepresentation that I thought I would never find in any paper other than the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I had commented upon a remark that had been made outside.  The comment was, &ldquo;The view has been expressed recently that the Corporation of Dublin could stand as the most credit-worthy corporation in the world.&rdquo;  My remark on that was, &ldquo;Without at all wanting to depreciate the standing of the corporation, I doubt if that phrase is a good one.  I doubt if they are that.&rdquo;  Is there anybody who does not understand what I meant by that&mdash;that it was hyperbole to say the Dublin Corporation was the most credit-worthy corporation in the world.  But, the political correspondent of a newspaper said that I had said that the Dublin Corporation was hardly credit-worthy.  I again ask Deputies opposite to agree with me that that type of misrepresentation is only usually to be found in the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>I thought the Deputy was referring to what Deputy McQuillan read, which was entirely from Deputy Lemass in the <i>Irish Press.</i>  However, there is the comment that I made.  What is wrong with it? Why was that singled out for some sort of criticism here last night?  I merely want to use that, by the way, to ask people&mdash;I am not being very bumptious in this&mdash;to read that debate.  There is a good deal of comment in that debate &mdash;quiet comment&mdash;about the banks, by people who objected to the banks.  I think there are many people in that Assembly who have as vehement objection to the banks as Deputy Hickey expressed here to-night.  They did not express themselves that way, though. They got their views across.  Will anybody disagree, or will they disagree violently, with what I said towards the end?  I did say that there had been two sets of inquiries into the banking system in this country.  I referred to the Banking Commission that had been presided over by Mr. Parker Willis and established when Mr. Cosgrave was Leader of the Executive Council and, acting on the report of that commission, there was the Currency Act, 1927, passed.</P>
      <P>That Currency Act and all that it meant was vehemently assailed by people, two of whom afterwards became Ministers for Finance.  We were told we had tied ourselves to sterling, that it was a millstone around the necks of the people and so on, and so forth.  Then the people who talked that way came into power and Deputy de Valera, as Taoiseach, set up a new commission and that commission reported.  Two sets of Governments, two sets of inquirers and, in the end, you have the 1927 legislation and later the Central Bank legislation.  I was in favour of the 1927 legislation.  I may remark I knew very little about it.  It was not my job at the time.  I was against the Central Bank legislation because I thought it was, as Deputy Hickey said to-night, establishing an institution without very much power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2518" /> I did not think there was much good in doing that.</P>
    <P>In any event, the banks were inquired into in the most objective way by two groups of people established by two different governmental groups. The legislation was brought into a Dáil Éireann which had changed its Party complexion, and the two pieces of legislation were passed which established the banking situation as we have it.</P>
    <P>Many years have gone since the second Banking Commission reported. Even at the time when the second Banking Commission reported, there was a good deal of hostility to the report.  The legislation was put through here by the Party majority.</P>
    <P>I think there are certain things that it would be meet and proper to inquire into with regard to the banks.  I met them recently over the matter of the loan for the Dublin Corporation. I have spoken of that in this debate and what I said is to be found at column 132.  I there said it was wrong to blame the banks because they did not take the popular view of housing.  I said, as Deputy Cowan said here to-night, that they were institutions with a particular purpose and objective.  You could not ask them to have a particular outlook.  That is not their business. I was speaking, so to speak, for the banks on that occasion.  I had not entered into the negotiations that I did, in a very close and intimate way, take up later, and I was expressing what I thought to be the banking attitude.  I do not think I would say as much in the banks' favour if I had to make that speech again, since my experience of them at the end of November.  Still, I do not go to any point of attacking them.  They have money entrusted to them.  They think they have a certain job to do.  They get that money under peculiarly difficult circumstances, due to the old-time habits of the investing part of the people here.  I have heard the comment made&mdash;without saying where it came from, I put it forward as an explanation of the difficulty&mdash;that people here who own moneys, people who in the end become the possessors of savings, have not, in this country, acquired the direct habit of investment, particularly of long-term investment, <Col N="2519" /> that better educated people financially have in other countries.  They have not got the habit.  They have not the experience.  The whole history of this country is against that type of thing.</P>
    <P>The banks get money from people who will not themselves invest directly either in long or intermediate term investments, and the banks, taking the money believe they may be called upon suddenly to repay all the money they have in their possession, that is just put in on deposit receipt.  For that reason, they say, they must invest in such a way that allows them, at a moment's notice, to realise whatever the investment is, and be able to pay it back.  They can give good reasons for that viewpoint of theirs.</P>
    <P>Of course, two things have to be done with regard to that.  The first thing is, we must try to educate the people that it will be for their own betterment to get more money by getting a bigger interest rate if they invest over a long period.  That might be a long process, and in between we have to look at the situation. That situation as we know it is this, that, no matter what the theory may be about customers running into banks, crowding in and demanding back their deposits, we know that does not happen.  We know there is what Professor O'Rahilly has called a statistical regularity with regard to the movements of people who put money into banks, and at what point they want to draw them out.  While some degree of liquidity is essential, our banks have been driven by history and the habits of the people to adopt an amazing preference for liquidity that you do not find anywhere else in the world.</P>
    <P>That, added to one other thing, puts the banks in the position we find them.  That other thing is that there is no immediate market here.  There is no market for, say, Government shares or for the stock of local authorities. There is in nearly every other country.  There should be such here. In any event, these stocks should be freely marketable and the banks themselves should assist in that process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2520" /> I believe that if the banks were relieved of their fear arising from what they think is their obligation to their customers, we would have the banks as willing agents to get this country into a proper lending system.  You will not get the banks to come along that road by attacking them.  You will not get any good out of a lot of the speeches that have been made here in the last two or three days.  We must let the banks see that we do appreciate the stability that they have brought to the country.  I think it has been overdone but still it is stability in that type of institution.  We have got to let them see there is another viewpoint and, if necessary, the State may have to step in in some sort of intermediary way so that the customer can always have his liquidity preference fully explored and exploited and the banks can have the security of a Government backing in case the banks have to do something that the banks think their relations with their customers do not allow them to do.</P>
    <P>I think these matters will have to be explored with the banks.  At the moment, certainly, it appals me, when I think of the approaches I may have to make to the public quite soon and the approaches I would like to make to the public quite soon, to find the number of people who, while hitting as they attempt to hit at the banks, are in the end annoying the investing public.  I would like the House to leave out of their calculations hereafter what used to loom so much in these discussions in Parliament long ago, the old bogey of international Jewish finance.  I doubt if it is here.</P>
    <P>There is also the bogey of the un-national person who is trying to put a brake on national development.  I doubt very much whether any person is deliberately trying to close down on national development.  There has also been a lot of talk about the banks being dictators.  They are not.  They are trying to do a particular task as they understand it.  That runs counter to the views most Deputies would have, I think, but that they are dictating or attempting to dictate I deny.  The dictators are the people, and if the people cannot be got to give <Col N="2521" /> their money to the banks to invest in a short term way or a long term way what are we to do?  I hate to think of the future if these circumstances develop, but at the same time it is not one in which we would be without resources.  It is the investment side of the banks which is important. Questions about links with sterling could be left over to a later date, but the investment system is one which we shall have to tackle.</P>
    <P>In that connection Deputies on the other side of the House have anguished themselves with talk about the public embarrassment which there is over the fact that the Minister for External Affairs does not talk the same financial language as myself.  I have yet to meet anybody outside the ranks of the professional politicians who is worried about that.  Nobody is worried.  Have we got to the stage in this country when, on a matter which may be an important point of policy when it is decided, we cannot have freedom of speech?  Have we got to the stage when men, just because they join the Government circle, must all, as one Deputy said, when they go out of the council chambers speak the same language? If anybody thought that that was our policy I could imagine public confusion and embarrassment.  I have my own difficulties regarding the intimate association which is forced upon me with financial houses, but I do not find myself embarrassed to the point of confusion by anything which has been said either here or outside during the past six months.  It is good for people who run financial instituttions to know that there are other viewpoints than those which I express and even I am not expressing myself with the fullest of freedom when I approach them.  One gets into intimate association with such institutions and there has to be a certain approach.  I do not find myself weakened entirely but rather I find myself strengthened by some of the things&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the serious side of the debate there is very little else I have to say, but a certain amount of politics was dragged into this.  Deputy Aiken, for instance, was very alarmed about inflation. Deputy Lemass is not so much alarmed.  I suppose that that is because Deputy Lemass was convinced a year ago that deflation was on the way.  I do not think that Deputy Aiken ever agreed with that and they both made speeches publicly&mdash;I do not say that there was public confusion as a result because I do not think anybody bothered about what they said.  Deputy Lemass, with that sort of guttural emphasis which he employs when people who know him know that he is only chancing his arm, said that from all the signs we were passing out of period of inflation and passing into a period of deflation.  I do not think I am misquoting the Deputy.  Deputy Aiken was as strong in reading the signs as in his fears that inflation was not passed.</P>

      <P>If I am asked I will say, the signs having been read for me, that there is inflation still around and it is a matter to be carefully guarded against.  It has been there at least since February, 1948, but I do not think that there have been any signs of inflation breaking out in prices, which, of course, is where inflation is to be apprehended.  Capital development having gone on while inflationary prices were around, we will still continue <Col N="2523" /> while trying to read the signs correctly as they appear and we will attempt to close off and relax pressure if it should appear to be dangerous.</P>
      <P>Right through the debate, of course, Fianna Fáil had to enjoy impaling itself on the question of whether or not taxation has been reduced.  I am told here that it has not.  I asked Deputy Lynch, I think it was, did he agree&mdash;because if he did not I could send for the Order &mdash;that certain beer and tobacco duties had been taken off early in 1948.  They were, of course.  I asked was it accepted that that cost the revenue and benefited the taxpayer to the extent of £6,000,000 a year.  I gather that that is accepted.  If there is any objection or if proof is required I can send for the Finance Act to show that 6d. came off the income-tax last year and that other reliefs were given which amounted to £7,200,000 in the full year.  I do not think that anybody denies that the tax did come off and that the effect is a relief of £7,200,000.  In addition, there will not be any denials that the old-age pensioners' and widows' and orphans' funds have gone up by about £2,500,000. The cost of the Civil service has gone up by £750,000 and the cost of a number of civil pensioners, teachers, Guards, etc., with certain increases in Army pay and Garda pay, add up to an additional burden of another £750,000 to the State.  Facing it it must be admitted that at least £7,250,000 relief has been given and if I had not, under the sway of my colleagues and on my own initiative, decided to give these extra benefits to teachers and Guards, Army and Civil Service, as well as the increase in the tea ration which cost something like £460,000, we would have another £4,000,000 to use for the reduction of taxation.  That is £11,000,000 of economies that were achieved.  People tell me that there has not been any reduction in taxation and yet admit that those things have happened.  It is something which is nearly a modern miracle.</P>

      <P>A tremendous sum of money.  May I make the Deputy a present of that?  Having taken 6d. off the income-tax I took in as much money as if I had not.  But the 6d does mean something.  It is a reduction in taxation.  There is more income around as a result of that reduction and I am getting some of the fruits of that income.

The people know whether or not they are enjoying more prosperity.  The people know whether or not they are living in a more prosperous time.  The people know whether or not production has increased.

      <P>The other political arguments advanced were advanced in the main by Deputy de Valera, the ex-Taoiseach.  I must say he was rather pathetic the other day when he was talking about all the White Papers he had in relation to his policy.</P>

      <P>The one that really ought to be published, so that the people will at least know what is inside <Col N="2525" /> it, is the one about tuberculosis.  The ex-Taoiseach was able to distinguish it by the fact that it had a beautiful cover on it.  According to the ex-Taoiseach all these White Papers contained the foundations of our policy. And then he wondered why it was they got beaten.  I do not suppose for a moment the ex-Taoiseach will accept me as a guide on that matter.</P>
      <P>Now, he went to election under the most shocking conditions for himself. In October, 1947, he went to the country and made a speech which led the <i>Irish Times</i> to produce a heading, a heading which was not a misrepresentation on that occasion: &ldquo;The Taoiseach Tells Why Wages are to be Pegged.&rdquo;  That was part of the policy. The people read that.  A little later they saw this pamphlet from the industrialists, in whose favour the excess corporation profits tax had been remitted. It may have been a hasty conclusion, but they did jump to the conclusion that the last Government had gone over to the &ldquo;money-bags&rdquo; and had gone away from the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1947 also Deputy de Valera, speaking as Taoiseach, dealt with the problem of emigration.  He said it was a most important question but that, when they had done the best they could do, the drift from the land to the town or abroad would continue.  He added that there was no other way for it; there had been that steady trend since the famine and it was perhaps a tendency that could not be stopped.  In the same speech, he said that agriculture was our great industry.  This was after 16 years in office.  He came to that conclusion at the end of 16 years in office.  He said it was a problem and the consistent decline in the numbers engaged in the basic industry related to the question whether there was any solution to it or whether it was a natural decline.  He said that if anybody&mdash;I remember the pathetic appeal &mdash;could advance a plan for agriculture, they would be glad to consider it.  The ex-Taoiseach then went to the people telling them that wages were to be pegged, telling them that he did not see how he could stop emigration and that agriculture was declining.  He added that nothing could be done about <Col N="2526" /> it and, rather pathetically, remarked that if anybody would give him a plan, he would accept it.</P>

      <P>That is a quotation from a speech.  He said he would be glad to consider it.  Does not that present all the appearance of a person who finds himself at the end of his tether, and certainly at the end of his programme.</P>
      <P>The other night Deputy de Valera said that this scheme with relation to capital development ought to be strongly and vigorously examined in this House; but he said it was not for him to do that because he was not, so to speak, in favour&mdash;I do not know whether it was of progressive development by capital expenditure or deficit financing, since he mixed both up.  But, anyway, he said he could not do it.  He was skipping 16 years.  He had a programme. He said at one time that the cost of government in this country had doubled by 1931.  He said that the British Government, which was a spendthrift Government, according to him, had been able to govern the entire country on £14,500,000 a year.  He said the Cumann na nGaedheal Government had put the bill up to £25,000,000. Apparently, the Deputy wanted to reduce it again to the late spendthrift Government's standard.  He came into office in 1932 and, year by year, the cost mounted steadily.  He complains bitterly now because we want to put £12,000,000 into capital works.  Every one of these works has been scrutinised. I do not know that any of them have been dislodged from their position in that Book.  Deputy de Valera wanted to float a loan for £11,500,000, but at the last moment he funked doing it, for the large-scale destruction of the City of Dublin and the erection on the ruins of a new Parliament House and new offices for the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>Because I will produce it.  The Minister for Finance in those days&mdash;I think it was in the year 1935&mdash;put the matter clearly before the Government.  At that stage it was only a £3,000,000 scheme:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Apart altogether from the question of the immense cost involved, of which the minimum has been shown in paragraph (6), various considerations of great political, social and municipal importance arise in any approach to the conception of parliamentary and Government buildings in any one area of the City of Dublin.  Before any such scheme becomes acceptable to the general public which will have to pay for it, and to put up over a number of years with the disturbance which it would necessarily involve, the Government would have to win the support of the Dublin Corporation, which would be vitally affected, and to gain the approval of the growing body of town-planning opinion and of the professional associations interested in such a project.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The document goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One effect of putting the scheme into operation would be to postpone inevitably the solution of the problem of the housing of the working classes.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And the scheme was <Col N="2528" /> rejected as a £3,000,000 scheme.  It boiled up again in the year 1944.  It lay for nine years and then it came forward again.  It went to a committee and a draft Bill was prepared and draft resolutions for this House.  The scheme had then got to the point:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;This figure of cost must be purely conjectural, but the following should be taken as an indication of the size of the project: acquisition and compensation for residents, £2,500,000; demolition and site clearance, £500,000; building costs, £7,500,000; furniture and equipment, £1,000,000.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was objected to by Deputy de Valera not on the grounds of what it would cost or that it might be a wrong thing to ask people to subscribe to it by way of loan.  He did not ask whether that housing drive was going to be productive or not.  What was his objection? It was that too many places would have to be excepted from the Merrion Square scheme.  It was too much to ask the public to pull down Holles Street Hospital, the Marie Reparatrix Convent and a few other places like that.  It was felt that the public would not stand for it.</P>

      <P>There is no decision in that book taken by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government about that. Deputy de Valera did not like the thought of wiping out Holles Street Hospital, a couple of churches, the Marie Reparatrix Convent and so on. He then directed the Board of Works architects to a scheme in the park under which a good many of the houses flanking the river from Kingsbridge would be wiped out.  The park was to be built up and the places where these buildings were to be demolished would be given in substitution for the provision of the amenities for these palatial buildings to house the Oireachtas and other offices.  Peculiarly enough, that happened to be an £11,500,000 scheme.  Those people who are now sitting on the Opposition side of the House and who are so critical of this £12,500,000 scheme for productive work did not then bother, in connection with the £11,500,000 scheme, on the grounds of cost.  They bothered when they said the resolutions were prepared and the draft Bill was in order, but when the Deputies would not agree to it.  It was postponed and then it was resurrected. Deputy de Valera cannot think that that was what lost him the votes of the people&mdash;because they knew nothing about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry we have no opportunity of asking for some explanation in regard to some of the matters referred to in the Bill.  I think it would be well if we had some information in connection with the American grant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is exactly the same section as appeared in last year's Act in regard to the counterpart <Col N="2534" /> fund and the loan except that we had to get a new section this year in regard to the money that is given this year by way of grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a special account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We must keep it in a different account because there are certain obligations attached to it. We may have to pay out a certain percentage for the transport of goods, and the American Government may ask us to devote certain grants to certain purposes.  We have to have these moneys in a different fund from the Loan Counterpart Fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This money that you get by way of loan goes into the Central Bank?  Does it all go to the same sort of account?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>One, the loan, will be called a fund and the other, the grant, will be called a special account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The money first of all goes into the Central Bank and then it is transferred to the Counterpart Account, under the control of the Minister for Finance.  I want to distinguish between the two things.  It first of all goes into the Central Bank and then it is transferred to the Counterpart Fund out of which the Minister can borrow.  Have we got a parallel in the case of the grant?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There are certain conditions attached to the grant for which we have to make provision.</P>
