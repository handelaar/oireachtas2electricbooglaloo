    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health).</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I reported progress last week, I had been dealing with the new health boards and certain aspects of their administration, with particular reference to the variety of classes designated for health purposes and the kind of means test applied in respect of each category.  I sought to demonstrate that the income limits fixed, especially in respect of applicants for medical cards, were utterly ridiculous and bore no relation whatsoever to either the present cost of living or the average wages of workingclass people.  When this muchlauded new health scheme was first mentioned we had reason to believe that we would have a choice of doctor, the abolition of the dispensary system as we knew it, and a greater liberalisation in the means test applied in the case of medical card holders.  We had reason to believe also that only the income of the main bread-winner would be taken into account and that it would be possible for many more of our workingclass people to qualify for free health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who believed this would be the evolution have been utterly disillusioned. The system is still class-ridden. The odious means test still applies, but with a new vengeance.  The income limits are ridiculously low.  No attempt has been made to achieve uniformity of application.  No attempt has been made to convey to the public generally what their eligibility is under these means tests.  There is much confusion, <Col N="2165" /> anxiety and, worst of all, hardship. These means tests and these ridiculously low scales for eligibility purposes should be cast aside altogether and we should have a health service which would rid the people of the fear and anxiety which now prevails.</P>
    <P>The income limits vary from authority to authority.  In the south eastern region the lower income group may be granted a medical card if the combined incomes of the husband and wife do not exceed £15 per week.  In respect of single persons living at home the income limit is £8 per week.  If that single person is living away from home the income limit is £10 per week.  With dependent children, it is £12 per week. An allowance of £1.25 is allowed in respect of each child under 16.  A small allowance may be made in respect of rent paid over £2 per week and some regard may be had to travelling expenses incurred.</P>
    <P>In the eastern region the income limit is £16 a week, with more or less corresponding concessions.  In other regions no income limits have been fixed at all yet and the old system applies, the old system of a doubtful yardstick applied by the executive officer, related to the old poor law system, as to whether a person was unable to provide health services from his own industry or other lawful means. Indeed, that system seems to me to be somewhat the fairer of the two because of the ridiculously low income limits stipulated.</P>
    <P>To demonstrate the absurdity of these figures and to show that they bear no relation whatsoever to the average incomes earned by working-class people, I consider it necessary to place on the records of the House now the average industrial earnings of the vast majority of workers; these earnings will demonstrate clearly that the incomes fixed by the executive officers in the various regions are in many instances only half as high as the average wage prevailing and much lower than the vast majority of wages earned.</P>
    <P>I will quote now from the March, 1972, edition of <i>Trade Union Information.</i> I will quote the industrial earnings for men and women in Irish industry in September, 1971.  The source of the <Col N="2166" /> information is the quarterly industrial inquiry of the Central Statistics Office, the validity of which can hardly be challenged.  The average weekly wages for the following categories of workers prevailed in September, 1971: bacon factories, £24.86; meat slaughtering, £26.26; milk products, £23.96; fruit and vegetable products, £26.55; grain milling, £28.20; bread and biscuits, £27.28; sugar, £31.31; chocolate and sugar confectionery, £29.62; distilling, £26.48; malting, £35.66; brewing, £34.64; mineral waters, £26.34; tobacco, £31.71; woollen and worsteds, £22.88; cotton, etc., £22.60; rayon, nylon cordage, etc., £24.57; hosiery, £24.97; tanning £24.35; glassware, pottery, £27.64; cement, structural clay products, etc., £28.36.</P>
    <P>The average male rate for the month of September, 1971, was £27.11 and the average female wage was £13.12.  Since then there has been an increase.  The balance of the 13th wage round of approximately £2 has been conceded and we are now negotiating the 14th round.  The conference on that important issue will take place next Saturday. I hope there will be agreement and that we can look forward to a further minimum of £2 more all round, so that you can add approximately £4 to the figures I have given.  You will see clearly how utterly ridiculous is the yardstick applied in present circumstances. It seems to me that the incomes limits fixed are so low as to deprive large sections of people from securing medical cards.  All the evidence is that medical cards are being withdrawn wholesale on the tests at present applying. Clearly, it will be more and more difficult, and I am sorry that the Minister is to some extent responsible for this by his intimation on various occasions that in the new situation the number of medical cards should not increase. This is being taken by CEOs as a directive, explicit or implicit, to get tough in respect of medical cards and apply more stringent tests, as indeed they are doing, and all the evidence of this is there to be seen.</P>
    <P>It is a very worrying situation that more working-class people should be deprived of free medical services and drugs.  In forcing them into the second <Col N="2167" /> category of insured persons under the Social Welfare Acts again we have the odious means test applying in respect of the provisions of medicine, so that in my opinion the situation has worsened considerably.  I deplore this and hope there will be serious re-thinking on the matter.  Clearly, what we desire is the extension of medical services to all workers, especially insured contributors, without any payment, but based on their insurance stamps.  I firmly believe that our proud, hard-working people are quite prepared to pay the extra amount for their insurance stamp for such coverage, and want to eliminate the fear, uncertainty and hardship, all factors which are increasing rapidly and which the new situation is creating.</P>
    <P>The insured contributor already pays 15p extra for his insurance stamp for health services; we might go a little further and if necessary increase that. Nobody would begrudge paying extra for the extension of the service and so set aside what is simply the continuation of the poor law system.  The old means test still applies: the submission of wage scales, investigation by home assistance officers, the interrogation at the door in the family home which is deeply resented, the withdrawal of cards, the difficulty in securing drugs and medicines and again the means test so that unless one is involved in expenditure of over £3 per week one gets no relief in respect of medicine and drugs.  This bears no relation to the very fine code of welfare and health services applying in Northern Ireland.  This odious system of ours is not conducive to winning over our brothers and sisters in Northern Ireland who cannot be expected to come willingly and knowingly into a system of this kind.  It is disgraceful that this system should continue, a pale shadow of the kind of health services the late Donagh O'Malley outlined in this House and elsewhere.  All that he proposed has come to nought and the people have been brazenly deceived in respect of what their entitlement would be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is down-grading <Col N="2168" /> this country.  Health statistics for the people in the North are almost exactly parallel to those here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be as healthy but that is by accident rather than design.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not by accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite satisfied there is no comparison between our health services and those in Northern Ireland.  For instance, one can get drugs in Northern Ireland on the payment of 2s or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>People get them here also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Here one does not get them at all unless one goes through a vicious and rigid means test of a most humiliating kind.  There is no comparison. I ask the Minister to instruct his officials to liberalise this means test and rid our people of the fear and uncertainty at present prevailing.</P>
      <P>Commenting on the establishment of health boards I said that no great change had taken place, that they had achieved nothing that the county councils could not have achieved if they had been allowed to continue their responsibility for health services.  Their establishment has created a void; there is a sense of aloofness; people feel remote from these large bodies and the central authority.  Public representatives feel out of touch and the county councils feel they no longer have any effective say in the disbursement of the money provided for the health services. Consequently, there was reluctance on the part of many county councils to meet the health demands last March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The county advisory committees could correct all that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Were it not for the intervention of the CEOs and the compelling case they made at county council meetings, in my opinion the health demand would have been seriously challenged and might well have been refused in many instances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a feeling that the functions of the health boards have been usurped not so much by the Minister <Col N="2169" /> but by the various teams of experts called in to advise on health services. The McKinseys, the Buchanans and the Fitzgeralds are now dictating policy in respect of future trends and there is a growing feeling that, despite the best intentions of health boards to better the services, it is the will and desire of the experts which will prevail.  If that proves to be the case it seems that the whole future of the regional health boards will be put in serious jeopardy.  It is well known that much that is contained in the McKinsey, the FitzGerald and the Buchanan reports is not in keeping with the best interests of the Irish people.  The Minister is very impressed by these policies and we see evidence of his desire to have them pursued and implemented. Many recommendations are at variance with public representatives' wishes and the real needs of the people.</P>
    <P>As an example, there is evidence in the FitzGerald report of a desire to regionalise hospitals to an extent which would involve the closure of many hospitals throughout the counties. This is particularly true in regard to my own constituency of Tipperary. If the FitzGerald report were to be implemented in its entirely it would mean that every hospital in the county, north and south ridings, would be closed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely untrue. There would be a change of function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that these would be utilised as community health centres.  The Minister says they would be utilised.  We could never stand for that nor would our people.  Such a proposal will never be implemented. We have sacrificed too much to build up our hospital services to allow anybody, any outsider, so to speak, to dictate their future use or eliminate them altogether.  Public indignation would not permit that to happen.  If the Minister contemplates such a policy I believe the crunch will come if the views of public representatives and the people are not heeded and acted on and the health boards, as we know them, would be finished.  These health boards must be seen to operate democratically with fullest co-operation and consultation with public representatives <Col N="2170" /> and the people at large in their areas. Any attempt made to impose policies drawn up by what I might term, with respect, foreigners, in a purely impersonal and superficial way in a manner which we believe to be inimical to the best interests of the Irish people will not be tolerated.  So far as we in Tipperary are concerned we intend to hold on to our hospitals.  No one is going to downgrade them or close them up or transfer them to other usages of a medicore kind such as community health centres.</P>
      <P>Talking of hospitals, we as public representatives are very proud of our hospital services.  We have sacrificed a lot to maintain them.  They are institutions which are well equipped, well staffed and providing a great service for our people.  This is also true of the private hospitals in our respective areas.  The private hospital has proved to be an essential part of our health services.  They meet a great need and I want to be associated with those in the House who paid tribute to the voluntary work of all those involved in these hospitals.  No words of mine could adequately express the feeling of pride and respect I have for the magnificent work the religious orders are doing in these private hospitals. Without them I wonder what would be the position at all in respect of the treatment of our aged, of our young, of our mentally and physically afflicted.</P>
      <P>However, the situation in respect of our private hospitals in Clonmel, from which I come, has worsened considerably of late.  It was extremely worrying for us to learn some months ago that one of our oldest hospitals, over 100 years old, known as the Cottage Hospital in Clonmel was obliged to close due to financial difficulties.  That relatively small hospital, containing from 11 to 17 beds at a pinch, was highly respected and much availed of by the people of Clonmel.  It catered for the sick poor of our town.  It was a small, select and homely place availed of by our people and by the medical profession as well.  It provided excellent treatment and its closure was a serious blow to our town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this matter at the regional health board meetings and made the <Col N="2171" /> most compelling case I could for the intervention of the board for the continuation of this hospital, but all my best endeavours failed to convince the executive of the board generally that they should take action to save this grand little hospital.  It was regarded by the regional health board as being too small, not viable.  Despite that, I am very pleased to say that this building which is now closed for a number of months may be re-opened for hospital purposes as a result of the interest taken in it by a lady from abroad in the nursing profession.  I look forward to the day when the Cottage Hospital will re-open, but this is no thanks to the health board or to anyone on it, because when they were asked to help they failed to come to the rescue.</P>
    <P>However, the situation in relation to another hospital is disturbing.  We have had the starting news in Clonmel that the Medical Missionaries of Mary Hospital there is likely to close.  The Medical Missionaries of Mary have been in Clonmel a long time.  They have provided a magnificent service for the people, especially in caring for the aged, the geriatrics.  They have done herculean work, which has been deeply appreciated.  If this hospital is allowed to close, the loss will be grievous.  The wonderful work of the Medical Missionaries of Mary is well known throughout the world.  That wonderful woman, Mother Mary Martin, is renowned throughout the world for her work of mercy in caring for the sick poor in so many countries.  The hospital in question is a large hospital by Clonmel standards.  It contains some 53 beds.  Its loss will be irreparable. The hospital has become an essential, integral part of our health services. What will the sick, the infirm, the incurables do in the event of the closure of the hospital?  Clearly, where they cannot be cared for at home, there is nothing for them but the county home.  There is no prospect of their being accommodated elsewhere.  The other hospitals in the town are the county maternity hospital where people can be retained only for a few weeks <Col N="2172" /> at the most, and a private home, St. Anne's, which is relatively small.</P>
    <P>The closure of hospitals is a dangerous trend.  There is also the closure of another small home at Kilsheelin, known as the Gurteen Home, again, admittedly, a small home but it has provided comfort, shelter and friendship for the aged of Kilsheelin for perhaps over 100 years.  The closure of this home involves the provision of alternative accommodation.  There is a marked reluctance on the part of people to go to the county home.  I do not wish to reflect on county homes as such.  I know them to be excellent hospitals, wonderfuly run and providing every comfort and medical aid that is required.  There is an ingrained dislike, an ingrained fear, sometimes teror, in the minds of Irish people of having to go to the county home.  As a public representative I have always experienced this marked reluctance, a refusal, to go to the county home.  This is not to say that some of our finest people have not been or are in county homes.  It is impossible to eradicate an attitude, which derives from bad times long past and best forgotten.  Despite the excellent improvements that have taken place, the reluctance to go to county homes remains and is likely to continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister will agree with me that the era of the county home system as we knew it should be ended.  The desirable thing is to have local homes where people would be cared for among their friends and relations and the provision of sufficient money for the care of the aged in their own homes for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this matter of the closure of private hospitals in my area, in Clonmel in particular, I would ask him to ascertain what has gone wrong. Are these closures due to spiralling costs, lack of adequate subvention from the health boards and the Department of Health?  An investigation should be carried out as to the reasons for these closures which affect the health services provided for the people I represent. The Minister will agree that it is deplorable that there should be loss of <Col N="2173" /> bed accommodation and loss of skills, expertise and training involved in the departure of the nurses associated with the Cottage Hospital and of the nurses and staff associated with the Medical Missionaries of Mary.  This order have a wonderful tradition of nursing.  They are essentially a missionary order.  It may well be that they feel that their services are more urgently required elsewhere in this sad world than in Clonmel.  We rejoiced at their coming to Clonmel.  We are proud of their attainments.  I hope we respect them in every way.  We will be deeply saddened if we lose them.  Their departure will be deplored.</P>
    <P>I know that the health boards are interested in the situation which arises from the proposed closure of the Medical Missionaries of Mary Hospital at Clonmel.  The CEO and the staff are interested.  I would urge the Minister to interest himself in the matter and to appeal to the order to defer closure pending a full investigation as to what can be done to retain the hospital to serve the needs of our people.  I hope the Minister will intervene so that this valuable service may continue.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of hospital closures must be a source of worry to the Minister and to the Department. If this proves to be a national trend it will be disastrous.  In the past 12 months we have had the closure of the Cottage Hospital, of the Gurteen Home and now there is the possibility of the closure of the Medical Missionaries of Mary Hospital.  This is an extremely worrying situation.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of the State to aid, stimulate and co-ordinate the efforts of such grand voluntary bodies, not to supplant them or allow them to go to the wall because of lack of assistance. These hospitals served the people for a long number of years.  Most of them, like the Cottage Hospital, survived the vicissitudes of a century of war and depression, of turmoil and depression. They survived two systems of government in this country, the British system and the Irish system.  It is an indictment of us and of the present system that such closures should come in our time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2174" /> I hope I have said sufficient on this important matter to convince the Minister and the Department of the need to address themselves to the problem. There is a proposal for the provision of 100 beds in geriatric unit at the Union Block, Clonmel, the west wing of St. Joseph's Hospital.  That is in the pipeline. The only hope now is to expedite by all means at the Minister's disposal approval of plans and sanction of the necessary money for that project. I need not elaborate any further on the growing need there is for hospital accommodation for our aged and sick especially in the Clonmel area.</P>
    <P>There is a scheme for home help but we have not seen any evidence of this in my area.  I hope the Minister can do something about seeing that this help is forthcoming in the various localities throughout the country.  There is need for people to keep an eye on old people who are living alone.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given the first grant this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that but we have not as yet seen any evidence of the disbursement of that money.  I appreciate there was consultation with the various bodies regarding the type of assistance that can be provided but, as yet, we have been unable to secure any financial aid where one or two old people are being cared for in their homes by relatively poor families at great personal sacrifice.  We must appreciate how much more it would cost to keep those people in our various institutions throughout the country.  We should be generous in regard to financial aid for those people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain progress has been made in regard to facilities for our mentally handicapped and it would be ungracious of me not to acknowledge the help which has been given.  St. Cormac's school, Cashel, is doing excellent work but needs extensions and other assistance particularly as regards transport to convey the mentally handicapped children to this school every day.  There should be better liaison between the Department of Health, CIE and private transport <Col N="2175" /> people so that the hardship of those children having to walk or cycle part of the way could be overcome.</P>
    <P>There is great difficulty in providing institutional treatment for the mentally retarded.  I know of an unfortunate child aged seven years who is a problem child and for whom no proper institutional care has been provided. This is probably like very many other cases in the country of disturbed children. Despite the efforts of this child's parents he cannot be controlled.  He has been involved in a long litany of larcenies and is clearly a compulsive thief.  He will steal bicycles, money and anything that comes to his hand. He has been continually in trouble with the police and is a source of great embarrassment to his family.  He has been taken to the Garda barracks and interrogated on many occasions.  The people in our local health clinic know he is mentally disturbed and it is a matter of astonishment to me that a child like that cannot be provided for. If he does not receive immediate help, he faces a life of crime.</P>
    <P>Despite his age, this child is being used as a front for adult criminals in the district in which he lives.  The child is not responsible for his actions.  Last week his mother told me that she had locked him into his room.  He has been beaten and disciplined in the strongest fashion but it is of no avail.  When he was locked in his room recently, a garda called and told his mother he wanted to take him away.  She protested and said that he had been confined to his room for so many days. The garda insisted and when he came back with the child he was able to prove that he had broken out of the house and was guilty of a further theft of a sizeable sum of money, much of which had been recovered.</P>
    <P>I appeal for action in cases of this type.  I am sure there are many adults in prisons in this country because there was no one to plead regarding their mental condition when they were young.  They later turned out to be criminals.  Any psychiatrist could tell us that there are many people in St. Patrick's, Mountjoy, Portlaoise and Limerick who should not be <Col N="2176" /> there.  I know of some of them who are mentally disturbed, who had treatment in mental hospitals, who had suicidal tendencies who, in fact, slashed their wrists and took overdoses of drugs but when they came to court on a charge of theft or violence or, perhaps, using a knife there was no doctor or social worker to say that there was a mental history there. Those people are still being treated as criminals.  This is a serious indictment of our health services.  I am prepared to submit the name of the child I have referred to to the Minister.  I ask him to deal with cases of this kind. We cannot allow homes to be broken up because of children like this.  We cannot allow a child of such tender years to be so abused by society as this one is.  Surely we must not do as we did with the rest of them, treat him as a hardened criminal and throw him into jail and every time he comes out and is convicted again lock him up again.</P>
    <P>Had any of the people to whom I refer&mdash;and this is borne out very graphically in the report on the reformatory and industrial school system which was issued recently&mdash;been given the proper medical assistance and institutional treatment at a younger age they would never have embarked upon a life of crime.  This report was presented to the Minister for Education. I am sure the Minister for Health is aware that it places great emphasis on the duties and obligations of his Department.  In the summary it states categorically that administrative responsibility for all aspects of child care should be transferred to the Department of Health and that responsibility for the education of these children should remain with the Department of Education.  Perhaps the Minister might be kind enough to tell me how he feels about this report and whether he is prepared to accept this recommendation in regard to the involvement of the Department of Health.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister has read the report and knows that <Col N="2177" /> it calls for his assistance time and time again.  It suggests that the child care division of the Department of Health should be responsible for industrial schools, reformatories and remand homes, and that deprived children, retarded or mentally handicapped children and physically handicapped children, should be the responsibility of the Minister.  It also suggests that the administrative structure of the whole child care system should be the responsibility of the Department of Health.  I am pleased about this because I know the Minister is a sincere and conscientious man.</P>
      <P>Marlboro' House is a serious indictment of the Department of Education. It has to be seen to be believed. I hope the Minister for Health and the Minister for Education will agree on what should be done about it.  It is not good enough to say that the Minister for Education has not yet reported.  This is disgraceful.  This report has been out for some considerable time.  I appeal to the Minister for Health to take the initiative and to accept the recommendations of this committee and implement them with the least possible delay.</P>
      <P>I do not want to take up the time of the House unduly but there are one or two other matters to which I should like to advert which have been a source of anxiety to me.  I appreciate that hospitals must try to ensure that all outstanding debts are paid promptly. The provision of hospital and specialist services is basically an act of mercy and money should not be the criterion.  I was surprised when a friend of mine, who has been a resident of Dublin for some time, approached me with a rather sorry tale about a hospital bill and pressure which was put on him to pay outstanding accounts. This is a man with a wife and seven school-going children.  His unfortunate wife has a long history of physical and mental trouble.  She has been in several hospitals: St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, St. Patrick's Hospital, James's Street, and Mercer's Hospital.  I need hardly say what a handicap this has been to the unfortunate man and his young family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disconcerting aspect of this <Col N="2178" /> matter is that, despite genuine efforts on his part to settle a rather large hospital bill, by his standards, he met with nothing but disdain, silence and contempt.  The matter came to a head recently when a very insulting letter was issued to him, in my opinion a threatening letter, from a debt-collecting company in this city, obviously engaged by the hospital for this purpose. I deplore the manner in which this problem was dealt with.  The demand from the debt-collecting company in respect of treatment at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital, Cappagh, would frighten anyone.  It was intimidatory and threatening.  Moreover, it would dissuade an unfortunate patient from availing of any further treatment.  This kind of tactic is not in keeping with our hospital traditions.</P>
    <P>In capital letters it says: &ldquo;Protect your credit and it will protect you.&rdquo;  It goes on: &ldquo;You are running right into trouble by ignoring this obligation. Sometimes legal action is taken to collect an account, action which could have been avoided with the debtor's co-operation.  To avoid such action, please either pay the above balance and make acceptable arrangements for settlement, or state your reason in the event you do not regard the full bill as a just obligation.  If you continue to ignore requests for a friendly disposition of this claim you yourself must accept responsibility for future procedures.  Your prompt action may avoid unnecessary expense.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This man assures me he has been in touch with the people concerned, he has asked them for an interview and has received no reply.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that hospitals should adopt this procedure for the collection of debt.  This man is not a professional man; he may not be entitled to a medical card, but his unfortunate wife, with her long history of mental and physical illness, surely should be entitled to a medical card towards the end of her days.  The hospital bills in this instance amount to £140 or £150.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that such insulting and frightening letters should not be written in matters pertaining to health.  They are not conducive to speedy recovery and tend to discourage people from availing themselves of further medical treatment which I understand is urgently required in this instance.  Neither are such tactics in keeping with the principle of mercy which is involved in the whole matter of hospitalisation. It should be discountenanced by this House which should insist that a more humane approach to matters like this should be adopted instead of engaging debt collectors who are known to be intimidatory and ruthless.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to try to improve the position in regard to the training of nurses here.  It is sad to find so many young girls with leaving certificates, all most anxious to become nurses, having to go to England and elsewhere for training because of lack of facilities at home, because of the limited number of places in our hospitals here.  This is a reflection on our system.  I know of hundreds of girls who applied for training in a hospital in my region but there were few vacancies available.  Many of them are now being trained in various parts of England.</P>
      <P>I therefore ask the Minister to take urgent steps to extend the training facilities for nurses.  This job can be done only in the proper environment with proper staffing and equipment, and an extension of the facilities is urgently required so that as many as possible of our girls can be trained at home.  In my area there are as many as 50 applicants for every place available. Girls have a great interest in nursing and we should do our utmost to train them at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to bring to the notice of the Minister people's anxiety about lack of training for the <Col N="2180" /> deaf and for children and adults with speech defects.  I understand a report on this subject is being awaited and I urge the Minister, if he can, to expedite matters.  I do not know if the Minister has responsibility for this, but I am particularly concerned with facilities for the education of the deaf and for children with speech defects. I understand there are few facilities in this field and perhaps the Minister in his reply will give me some hope that there will be better opportunities in the future for such children.</P>
    <P>We have the continuing problem of being unable to find doctors for certain isolated areas.  I appreciate there are difficulties.  I have in mind the town of Mullinahone which has had no resident doctor since November, 1970.  There is an excellent residence in the town and it is difficult to know why someone cannot be got to take up the position.  I understand there is a doctor ready and willing to act there and I wonder whether the Health Board have discretion to appoint that man rather than resorting to the usually long process of having the Local Appointments Commission fill the post.  I should be grateful for any assistance the Minister can give me in this matter.  It is necessary to fill the appointment urgently because people there have to go six or seven miles to the nearest doctor and both medical cardholders and the middle income group are living in fear and trepidation by day and by night.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Chliders Mr. Chliders">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chliders</NameTxt>
      <P>A distance of seven miles is regarded as reasonable.  Indeed all over the world the distance is far greater.  When the choice of doctor scheme begins on 1st October the health board will be examining the whole position in the Deputy's area. They will consult with us and they can make certain adjustments if they want to.  They will have another look at the situation on 1st October.  I would point out to the Deputy again that seven miles is not regarded as an excessive distance either here or in any country.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to say much more.  I understand the Minister is now taking responsibility for the administration of home assistance.  I do not know how long it will be under his aegis because I understand the Minister for Social Welfare has plans for the amalgamation of home assistance with the social welfare services.  I hope this will materialise very soon because the system as we know it is an odious one derived from the Poor Law days.  There was no privacy, no comfort for applicants, no right of appeal in regard to the amounts of money doled out.  I hope it will revert to the Department of Social Welfare and that we will have a more comprehensive and humane code of legislation, with a different philosophy and system which will ensure that the humiliation and degradation in seeking and securing home assistance will be ended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In many areas home assistance officers work for the health boards.  As the Minister for Social Welfare has indicated in this House, the question of home assistance is being examined at a very high level as to its future character, whether it should be be a national form of home assistance or whether there should be changes in the method of administration.  I cannot reply to the Deputy except to say that I am not taking over the provision of home assistance cash.  That is quite certain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clarification. The Minister will hardly blame us, as members of the various regional health boards, for assuming he was largely <Col N="2182" /> responsible in that there was a specific request from someone&mdash;perhaps the Minister or the Minister for Social Welfare&mdash;to have home assistance merged with the health boards.  In fact, most health boards have taken over the administration of home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is getting confused about the matter. We want to make sure that whatever the future of home assistance, whoever is in charge of it in the local areas will work in co-ordination with the GPs, public health nurses and the voluntary organisations to make sure that they work together and that the needs of people in other areas are known.  That is what I am keen about. That will remain whoever is in charge of the payment of home assistance and however it is administered in the future.  I am sure the Deputy would agree with me on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a desirable concept and it is one I support.  However, it is a pity that there is so much evasion about responsibility in this matter.  I take it that it is primarily a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare and it is my hope that he will seek to bring in the appropriate legislation to deal with the many anomalies and hardships for which the system has been responsible for far too long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week a Deputy spoke for four and a half hours.  I should like to see some arrangements made whereby Deputies who propose to speak for a considerable time should give some indication to the House. This would be a considerable advantage and would be welcomed by Deputies who do not propose to speak at length.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his officials on the work they have done.  I should also like to thank the people who operate the health services, particularly those in religious orders who are entrusted with the care of patients.  In introducing his Estimate, the Minister introduced a valuable social document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much progress has been made with regard to our health services and the Minister referred to the reduction in <Col N="2183" /> mortality rates in respect of many diseases.  This shows that the policies the Department are pursuing are worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In particular, I welcome the change made in Dublin city recently regarding the abolition of the dispensary system and the introduction of the choice-of-doctor scheme.  The latter is working successfully.  It is a boon to people who hitherto had to spend many hours in the waiting rooms before they could see the doctors. Hitherto it meant that doctors could not give the detailed care and attention that might be necessary.  All these matters are rectified in the new system.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to problems arising out of the new scheme and he drew attention to the high level of prescriptions.  With the co-operation of the professional people and the officials who are administering the scheme this problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the enormous cost of the health services, particularly in relation to the burden on ratepayers.  The Minister should make an inquiry into the wholesale price of drugs and medicines.  I am told that the retail profit margin is low but it is suggested that the wholesale prices of the drugs and medicines are disproportionately high.  I would ask the Minister to deal with this matter in his reply.</P>
    <P>I am especially concerned about the problems facing geriatric patients in Dublin.  As a public representative I have experienced the greatest difficulty in getting a patient into some of our hospitals.  I refer in particular to St. Mary's.  There may be staff or accommodation problems there, but the fact remains that it is exceedingly difficult to get a patient into the hospital.</P>
    <P>When I was speaking on the Supplementary Health Estimate, I welcomed the establishment of the Eastern Health Board.  This is working satisfactorily and I wish to pay a tribute to the Minister, his officials, to the medical profession and to all those associated in administering the service. They have made a significant and valuable <Col N="2184" /> contribution and their professional approach has been welcomed by public representatives.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the evolvement of St. Kevin's into St. James's Hospital and the establishment of a board for that hospital.  It will help to raise the status of the hospital and will be of benefit to patients who must go there for treatment.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the relaxation in regard to the granting of medical cards in the city.  The new scheme which was adopted at the last meeting of the Eastern Health Board was given a fair amount of publicity.  Certain guidelines were set out which are now public knowledge and which should be of assistance to people seeking medical cards.  Greater publicity should be given to the limited eligibility scheme that has come into operation so that people would be aware of what benefits they are entitled to under the scheme.</P>
    <P>My main purpose in rising to speak on this Estimate is to draw attention to the need for a new hospital in the North-East Dublin region.  This is a rapidly developing area.  It consists of a vast sprawling landscape of mostly unplanned housing estates and some shopping facilities but, unfortunately, there is a sad lack of other community facilities, particularly hospital facilities. As Deputies will be aware the area stretches from Fairview to Howth, to Ballymun and to Artane and it has a population of 200,000 people.  There are no maternity or children's hospital services in the area.  This is a serious reflection on our society.  The lack of a children's hospital causes much inconvenience to mothers who must take their children to the only children's hospital on the North side, that is, Temple Street.  Anybody who has ever visited Temple Street will be aware of the overcrowding in that hospital and of the long delays experienced there. Women from, say, Howth, would have to make a journey of eight or nine miles to that hospital.  This causes great inconvenience both to the mothers and to the children concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from the Rotunda hospital and a number of small nursing homes, there are no maternity facilities on the North side of the city.  The South side <Col N="2185" /> has the new Coombe hospital.  The official attitude to the provision of hospital services appears to be to downgrade these human needs.  Statements made by the Minister in dealing with the FitzGerald Report are evidence of this.  Unfortunately it appears that the Department of Health have adopted an inflexibility that has no place in our advancing social services.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out, too, that there are opposing views in the medical profession on the economy scale factor in hospital planning, to say nothing of such factors as convenience, <i>et cetera</i>.  I was a member of a deputation of a number of responsible people from the North-East Dublin area who, about two years ago, met officials of the Department of Health to put forward a plea for hospital facilities in the area.  We were received courteously but so far we have no evidence of any moves being made to provide these facilities.  I appeal to the Minister to give consideration to the planning of some general hospital facilities for this region.</P>
    <P>In support of my case I can tell the House that within recent months a committee representing various organisations in the area has been formed. They are engaged in research into the whole problem and it is very likely that in the near future their findings will be submitted to the Minister. Perhaps when he is replying, the Minister will let us have his views on the general lack of facilities in North-East Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>At last we are catching up on Estimates.  At least we know that we are discussing current Estimates.  Any Minister would need great patience and endurance to have to listen to Estimates for his Department being discussed within three or four months of each other.  As the House is aware we discussed in March the Estimate for last year's health services but I have no intention of going over all that ground again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large area of agreement between what the Minister is doing and what I think should be done in the provision of health services but <Col N="2186" /> there are other areas and other aspects of his policy with which I disagree. When I criticise, I hope the Minister will understand that I am doing so because, in one way or another for a long period, I have been associated with the provision of health services so that naturally I have certain views but views which may not necessarily be the same as the views of the Minister.  My intention at all times is to be helpful and I am as anxious for progress in the field of health as is the Minister.</P>
    <P>There is considerable alarm at the cost of the health services.  I know that the Minister is alarmed at the rapidly rising costs of the services.  Of course, the services are improving.  Certainly they have improved in the region with which I am familiar.  One of the criticisms I have regarding that particular region is that there is not sufficient anticipation of the growing need for services and of the vast expansion that is taking place in the area.  I am thinking in particular of the hospital needs and health centre needs also.  I shall say more on that later.</P>
    <P>I think most of us agree with the Minister's policy that because institutional services are costing about two-thirds of the total moneys expended on health services, this is the area where we must try to save.  There are various ways in which we can save in this area.  First of all, we must do everything possible to keep people out of hospital.  Much can be done in this regard.  The form of the health services is conducive to people going into hospital. I am thinking of the middleincome group.  At a cost of 15p per week, or £7 per year, they are entitled to full institutional services.  If these people are kept out of hospital and receive services at an outpatient department they have to pay.  There is pressure on local practitioners to put people into hospital because people know that they can get these services free when they are actually in hospital.</P>
    <P>A serious look should be taken at this position.  The spokesman on health for this party advocated last March that consideration should be given to providing the necessary expenditure to bring in the people described as the <Col N="2187" /> middle-income group.  At present 30 per cent of the population are covered for full health services.  They are covered for institutional care and the ordinary service of the doctor at home and for whatever the doctor requires. It was estimated that the service was costing somewhere in the region of £7.5 million or £7.8 million.  That covered 30 per cent of the people.  If an additional 60 per cent of the people were added to give cover for 90 per cent of the population, the additional cost would be, it is estimated, £15 million or £16 million.  There might be quite a considerable saving having regard to the number of people who could be kept out of hospital.  Hospital accommodation and care cost considerably more now.  A strong case can be made for the Minister and his Department examining this matter carefully.  I do not know how the extra expenditure could be covered. Perhaps it could be covered by direct taxation or partially by insurance and taxation.  Few people in the middle-income group can afford to pay heavy hospital charges and they would be glad to bear some little additional cost in order to cover themselves.</P>
    <P>Under the voluntary health insurance scheme there is a tendency for people to go into hospital because they are not covered for services outside hospital.  The VHI scheme should be examined carefully to see whether this difficulty could be overcome.  Another service which keeps people out of hospital is the domiciliary care and home help services.  Many people are in institutions but they could be in their own homes or in much cheaper accommodation adjacent to their homes if housing, home help and district nursing services were improved. It would cost much less to keep people in this manner than to have them in institutions where they do not belong. They receive the best of care and food in the institutions and they are kept clean, but they still do not belong there.  If these people could be brought back near their own homes they would be interested in what was happening around them.  Every effort should be made to develop the home help and domiciliary nursing services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> I know that this is the Minister's policy.  My only criticism is that the schemes are not progressing fast enough.  Before the FitzGerald Report was issued, the Dublin Health Authority were surreptitiously providing home help on a limited scale.  They were doing this mainly through the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Little Sisters of the Assumption who were doing such work at full stretch over a very long period.  Perhaps we do not make full use of the nursing contribution that these religious orders make in various areas.  When the sisters build a convent, as I know they have done in one case, they can give a nursing service to a considerable area around them.  Such work should be left to them; there should be some arrangement between them and the health board so that the sisters would provide the nursing cover over that area, with assistance from the health board.  The sisters do not work office hours or shut down at 5 p.m.; they give nursing care and assistance at the times most needed.  They know where assistance is needed.  Nobody is better equipped than they are to provide it.  This city and this country owe these orders a deep debt of gratitude for the work they have done over the years and the enormous comfort they have provided for people in great difficulty.</P>
    <P>The health charges are enormous. Every step must be taken to keep these costs down and to ensure that they are equitably distributed among the various sections of the people.  The Minister's policy is proceeding along these lines and I could not agree more with it.  We should have a better development of the local health centres in the Dublin areas where we have a big concentration of population.  Every possible diagnostic and investigatory service and equipment should be provided for the medical practitioners in such areas.  The medical practitioners who were working from these centres prior to the choice of doctor scheme have a right to use the health centres. Every doctor operating in a locality should have accommodation in these centres, if they are large enough, if not, the centres should be enlarged.  They should also be enlarged to accommodate dentistry in all cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2189" /> Reference has been made to the FitzGerald Report.  No doubt this report has its good points but I am afraid, as some people have said in criticism of it, that there seems to be inflexibility in regard to it.  The Department do not seem to be able to depart from that report, which was written by a number of eminent consultants. These consultants were certainly thinking of their own working conditions, something which would have had priority in their minds.  They were ensuring that at the top level, where the most complicated cases had to be dealt with, all the equipment and accommodation necessary should be in the regional hospitals which they spoke so much about.  There will have to be a couple of such places in the country, but they would not be my priority.  I hold fast to the idea that 85 per cent of the work required can be done at local level.  The concentration in the first instance should be on upgrading the local hospitals and providing a better service.  I accept the view that we can no longer continue with the idea of one surgeon or single consultant in a hospital.  That is not enough.  People will not continue to provide this service any longer.  There were individual surgeons who worked like slaves.  The people had extraordinary confidence in them.  There was good reason for such confidence. However, these men had no home lives.  They were dedicated people.  We have examples without number all over the country where these men give this extraordinary service, much of it at very charitable rates and much of it free.  That situation must be improved. The least one should have in any hospital is two such consultants.  That would reduce to a minimum the number of persons having to go to the expensive institution where you must employ the scarce resources of skilled personnel and expensive equipment. Therefore, it is there the concentration should be and should have been in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It may be that the regional hospital idea was picked out of the FitzGerald Report but it has certainly annoyed many people and they are resisting it. The more resistance that develops the more difficult it will be for the Department <Col N="2190" /> to get a gradual changeover in the user of certain institutions without giving the impression that these are being downgraded.  Nobody wants to see downgraded a local institution which has provided a reasonably good service over the years.  I, in common with others, was very disturbed at the fight put up to keep Mallow Hospital in existence.  Where you have a situation in which all the local people and all concerned with the provision of health services in the area come down on the side of retaining the hospital, improving and upgrading it, it is a dangerous thing for a Minister to say: &ldquo;No, I shall have none of it.&rdquo;  This is the same Minister who is always saying: &ldquo;I shall have the fullest possible consultation.  The local committees must be consulted and what they say must be taken into consideration.&rdquo; What does that mean if after an overwhelming vote to retain the hospital as it stands, the Minister says &ldquo;no&rdquo;?  I am a long way from Mallow but we all saw this argument in the papers.  I do not think a Minister is doing his job, or a Government doing its job, if all the people over a wide area say: &ldquo;We want this institution retained&rdquo; and the Minister says: &ldquo;No. That would not be reasonable because we shall have a top-class institution 25 or 35 miles away.&rdquo;  The people must be heeded in a democracy.</P>
    <P>I had much disagreement with the Minister on certain aspects of the 1970 Act when it was going through the House and I disagreed violently with the idea of health boards.  I could not understand how you would have three apparently autonomous bodies working alongside each other without undue overlapping and administrative difficulties arising.  I know the Minister was handed a readymade Bill when he changed over to the Department of Health and told to put it through the House.  He did it very ably, but he certainly did not attempt to explain how this could be an efficient administration. I think he could not see it, and the proof of that, and that he could not know how it would work effectively or efficiently, is that he has brought in McKinsey who has been almost constantly employed since the introduction of the 1970 Act trying to explain <Col N="2191" /> to the Minister how it will work.</P>
    <P>The last assignment given to McKinsey has been to tell the Minister and the Department how Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional health boards can be launched.  The Minister, in commenting on this, says it is consistent with the advice given in the Devlin Report, that it represents the devolution of authority from the Department to the Minister and that is what he wants.  Many people would call this a confidence trick.  I do not want to do so because the Minister is a hardworking man and I think he is sincere in what he is trying to do.  This does not represent the devolution of authority; in my view it represents the concentration of power and authority in the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Take Comhairle na nOspidéal.  When the Bill was going through the House most of us looked on the Comhairle as perhaps a necessary and desirable body where you would have uniformity in regard to the qualifications of consultants of all sorts and in regard to the number necessary and desirable in the various institutions.  There was very little resistance to Comhairle na nOspidéal but it now emerges as a very different body from the one we spoke about then.  The Minister now gives it very wide functions and says he will take the necessary steps to ensure that it is a prestigious body&mdash;I think that was his description&mdash;with all the powers required to do its job.  It will advise on hospitals throughout the country and will, as far as I can see, direct the co-ordination of hospital services, decide on the use of hospitals and decide whether a hospital should be kept open or not in the last analysis.</P>
    <P>Mark you, the Minister appoints the whole Comhairle, all 23.  He appoints the chairman and vice-chairman and the executive.  As I see it now, the executive will either be composed of civil servants or seconded civil servants on whom he will have his thumb from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  There is nothing wrong in a Minister having an advisory body.  Perhaps every Minister could do his job better if he had an advisory body of people, perhaps currently in practice and up-to-date in their ideas. <Col N="2192" /> We know that if people go into the Department as advisers they stay for life. I am not criticising them but there is the tendency, I suppose, not to be &ldquo;with it&rdquo; and not to give the views of the people actually doing the job. Much can be said for an advisory body but there is no point in misleading the people here and throughout the country and pretending this represents devolution of authority.  It is nothing more than a pretence and we should recognise it as such.</P>
    <P>Comhairle na nOspidéal now seems to be emerging as the top body in this structure.  It seems they tell the health boards the areas in which they should be operating and how they should go about it.  They are the Minister's mouthpiece.  The health boards then, will have to carry out what I would describe as the dirty work.  There is a good political reason for setting them up.  The Minister for Health knows, and his predecessor also knew, that if we set out to follow slavishly, as the Department appear to be doing, the recommendations in the FitzGerald Report, this will cause an uproar throughout the country because of the downgrading of hospitals, the closing of hospitals and their change of use. No Minister wants to be in the position where he can be directly hammered for what is happening.  It seems that we have the same situation here as we have in regard to CIE, the ESB and all the other semi-State bodies where the Minister can disown responsibility and refuse to answer questions in the House.  That is all wrong.</P>
    <P>These bodies are taking over from the Department work for which the Department of Health should be directly responsible.  I never saw any objection to discussing matters with the Department of Health because you realised you were with the people who had to make the decisions.  In the setting up of Comhairle na nOspidéal and the regional hospital boards we are setting up further protection for the Minister and the Department.  We are setting up another extremely expensive machine and another set of officers alongside the health board officers who will overlap.  There will be a great amount of friction if this thing is not carefully done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2193" /> I can see a need for an advisory body to the voluntary hospitals and to the health boards for their own hospitals. It is amazing that these advisory boards were not there long ago and that this lack of co-ordination has existed for so long.  The Department of Health have no function if they cannot do this.  We have many examples of one institution being half used and the next one being overused because we had no co-ordination in regard to accommodation and the potential existing in the hospitals run by the local authorities and those run by the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>I believe that the health boards could adequately provide this co-ordination without setting up another body.  The Eastern Health Board had gone a long way towards co-ordinating the work of the voluntary hospitals and the hospitals run by the health boards and the health boards themselves.  We all know of the setting up of St. James's Hospital Board where you had a membership of 50 per cent from the health board and 50 per cent from the Federated Dublin Hospitals.  I am confident that this combination will upgrade that hospital substantially.  I hope the board of St. James's Hospital will be facilitated in every way to get on with the job.  If they cannot do this you will have a lot of disillusionment and many disgruntled people who would otherwise work very hard to improve the health services in this region.</P>
    <P>We should be realistic about the federated group of hospitals and we should no longer talk about them as seven hospitals which will be integrated in St. James's Hospital.  You will have three hospitals fully integrated.  You will have Sir Patrick Dun's, the Royal City of Dublin, and Mercers.  You will not have the Meath, Steevens or the Adelaide.  These institutions should be allowed develop in their own separate ways wherever development is desirable. Development work should not be held up by telling them that they will be integrated into St. James's Hospital. They should be permitted to provide adequate services before their boards lose interest.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister <Col N="2194" /> saying that he will consider carefully any proposals put up to him and that he will try to establish the extent to which these separate institutions should be developed.  The teaching link with Trinity College comes into this and that cannot be disregarded.  There would be some difficulty if the link with Trinity College was to be transferred to St. James's Hospital.  This is something which can be overcome and which can be arranged between the medical schools.  As well as a large hospital in St. James's we will also need those other hospitals to provide a very high standard, for which they should be equipped.</P>
    <P>You have the board set up in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital where you have the three voluntary hospitals and the members from the Eastern Health Board working together. Deputy Timmons spoke at some length about the great need for hospital services on the north side of the city.  I know the Department intend to develop good hospitals here, that very shortly the necessary reconstruction work will be done in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital, that 120 beds will be working effectively there and that we will have a suite of theatres and the back-up services.  We will also have a few wards into which patients can be transferred when recuperating.  This will give a sizeable unit.</P>
    <P>There was a promise given, when this work was started, that as soon as the 120 beds were functioning the board would be allowed to proceed on the planning of the much larger general hospital unit of perhaps up to 500 beds, that in the meantime some assessment of the position would be made in the Department and that somebody from the Department might work with the team planning the new hospital unit.  I hope the Department have not postponed their intentions too long because many top level consultants have agreed to work in the James Connolly Memorial Hospital and I would hate to see their interest waning.</P>
    <P>I now want to refer to the great shortage of maternity service on the north side of the city.  The James Connolly Memorial has again come to the aid of the Coombe but it is a stopgap <Col N="2195" /> arrangement.  We are providing accommodation there in a 40 bed unit for post-natal cases to relieve the overcrowding at the Coombe but this will not work for very long.</P>
    <P>The Department do not need further evidence of the fact that in the Connolly Memorial Hospital there should be set up a viable maternity unit.  There is vast expansion in the area in which it is situated, and it is unsatisfactory that services should be provided on an agency basis in it for maternity cases.  There should be a complete unit for which the hospital board would have full responsibility and not have divided responsibility between the two institutions.  It does not work and will not work.  It provides relief and the hospital board were pleased to provide that relief.  I want to impress on the Minister that it is an emergency relief and should be regarded as such.  He should direct the planning of a complete maternity unit there.</P>
    <P>In relation to the hospital in Blanchardstown, a good local health centre is badly needed and there has been agitation and demand for such a centre over a long period.  A vast population is building up.  The logical place for the health centre is the hospital grounds, where the general practitioners in the area could work in close association with the hospital and would have the use of the diagnostic and investigatory facilities there. This would be consistent with the FitzGerald Report and is what was demanded, namely, that there would be close association and integration.</P>
    <P>For far too long the general practitioners have been working in isolation, with no assistance whatever.  It is deplorable that in an aspect of the health services where 85 per cent was being provided there was so little done to assist them.  I would encourage this development.  I would like to bring the local practitioners into the James Connolly Hospital at every opportunity. I would like to see cover provided for some of the consultants there on occasion so that they would be able to see at first hand the progress of their patients.  There is a great opportunity for development along these lines and <Col N="2196" /> such development should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I have made the case that the health boards were of themselves adequate to deal with this type of co-ordination and the kind of work that it is proposed the hospital boards should be involved in.  In addition to the developments I have just described in the two institutions I have referred to, there were the developments that took place in the most diplomatic way. People from the health board, principally officers of the health board, were invited to take up positions as board members in the voluntary hospitals.  This is the type of development we want.  There was no friction, no difficulty.  The suspicion and distrust that existed between the voluntary hospitals in the region and the health board hospitals and the health board itself have been disappearing rapidly.  I would deplore anything that would upset that development.</P>
    <P>The same applies in the appointment of geriatricians.  Two geriatricians have been appointed in the north side on a basis of complete co-operation and co-ordination between the voluntary hospitals and the health boards. This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>There is another reason why this body is not only superfluous but dangerous.  It is concerned only with institutional services and the level and size of the institutional service required depend entirely, or to a large extent, on the development of domiciliary nursing, home health, housing and all the other services to which I have referred.  They are at present the responsibility of the health board.  If you separate those two things, how can you get them working as they should work?  If you have two separate bodies dealing with various aspects and overlapping how can they work?  I should like to comment on the Minister's statement on this, which does not seem to make sense.  He said:</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that the health boards could not, on their own, achieve full co-ordination of the hospital services, for two reasons.  The first was that the pattern of the eight health board areas does not allow sufficiently for the <Col N="2197" /> fact that the influence of the major hospital and teaching centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway extends beyond the areas of the health boards where they are situated.</P>
    <P>I say, &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;  That is no explanation to me as to why the health boards or a combination of health boards could not do the job, because the co-ordinating links can be very easily established.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>The second reason arises from the fact that about half of all the hospital beds in the country are in voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Again I say &ldquo;So what?&rdquo;  I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>Even if the health boards were otherwise suitable, they could not be regarded quite as the appropriate bodies to co-ordinate the activities of the voluntary hospitals and those of their own institutions: participation by the voluntary hospitals in this co-ordination was regarded as essential.</P>
    <P>Nobody else regards it as essential. None of the persons involved in the provision of health services, outside the Department, regards it as essential. It is regarded as something that is extremely dangerous and it will be more dangerous in view of the fact that the Department and the Minister are not prepared to listen to recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Minister employs McKinsey and says that this is the most expert firm of consultants.  I agree that it is. The Minister comes into the House before they report back to him and before they have time to make their recommendations.  If the Minister tells the House the whole truth&mdash;I have no reason to believe that he will not&mdash; he will tell us that McKinsey will not recommend, and could not recommend, the health boards.  The directive to McKinsey must be: &ldquo;Tell us how we can set up this organisation.  We have it in the Health Acts.  Tell us how we can work it.&rdquo;  In my view they will quietly come back to the Minister and tell him that he is in a jam, that the whole concept was crazy <Col N="2198" /> but that, as he has employed them to indicate how it can work, they must set out to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>In this respect, I would draw the attention of the House to my statement of 22nd July, 1971 (Dáil Debates, columns 2363 to 2365): We are indebted to the voluntary hospitals for the services which they have rendered in the past and we are confident that they will continue to play an essential part in our health services.  I think, however, that it is fair to say that all concerned, including the voluntary hospitals, recognise that in a modern hospital system separate units cannot be given the resources to act in isolation.</P>
    <P>Everybody agrees with that.  I ask, why did not the Department say that long ago and take the necessary steps to bring about this co-ordination directly? If we had an inspection service they would know what was going on and they would know that this was a field in which they should have been working.</P>
    <P>Since Comhairle na nOspidéal is being set up as the prestigious body why are they not let do the full job? Why is it necessary to set up a third body?  We do not know where it will end.  We do not know whether we will have a fourth and a fifth body if we are not careful.  The various health boards were asked to consider this recently.  This is described as consultation but it is consultation without any reaction to the result of the consultation. The Eastern Health Board stated strongly that this was an unnecessary and superfluous body but it is in the Act and, like the tide, it cannot be kept back.  It must come into existence in some form.  It can be given a certain amount of useful work to do in an advisory role and a consultancy role on certain aspects of hospital management and development.  We must not have overlapping with a lot of difficulties arising at administrative level between the health boards and the hospital boards.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board put forward the very sane suggestion that it was unnecessary to set up another <Col N="2199" /> separate expensive administration.  In the Eastern Health Board area we have 55 per cent of the population and about 76 per cent of the total bed complement. They suggested that the CEO of the Eastern Health Board should also be the chief executive officer of the hospital board and that a programmes manager from each of the other three health boards should be involved in the Dublin hospital board and perhaps three secretary managers from the voluntary hospitals and one or two officers from the Department.  These would be people who had other jobs and who were involved up to their tonsils in the provision of health services. This would provide a co-ordinating link and we would not have one authority going in one direction and another authority going in another direction.</P>
    <P>This was regarded as a very sensible recommendation but the Minister &ldquo;downed&rdquo; it early on in his statement and said that it was unacceptable. He said:</P>
    <P>Some health boards questioned the timing for the establishment of these bodies and suggested that the proposed regulations be deferred for some years, until the new administration under the health boards had settled down.  The Eastern Health Board also suggested that the administration of the Dublin Regional Hospital Board should be tied in with that for the health board.  As regards the timing of the establishment of the new bodies, I do not think it would be wise to wait.  To do so would leave a hiatus, as it would be difficult to maintain adequate continuing machinery for co-ordination between the hospitals of the health boards and those of the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>This machine was working already. I am very sorry the Minister is not here and I hope he will read what I am saying.  These bodies were working already on this job of co-ordination and, in my view, working very effectively.  They were not disturbing anybody.  The Minister has given this House an assurance that he will not interfere unduly with the work of the <Col N="2200" /> voluntary hospital boards and that they will maintain full independence.  He came back to this time and time again. If we are to have this co-ordination we must achieve it in a diplomatic way.  This job was going on by invitation and by getting the voluntary hospitals to see that the health boards had something to give them and that, working together, they could do far more far better than if they were not working together.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Neither could I accept the proposition that the health board personnel should also act to provide the administration for the regional hospital boards.  In my view, it will probably be better that the personnel administering the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal, should be seen to be independent of both the health boards and the voluntary hospitals, but of course acting in close association with them.</P>
    <P>Why is this independence necessary? They are all doing the same job.  We are all trying to achieve the same end, that is, to provide better institutional services, better health services all round.  If this job is given to three bodies, we will have three bodies working in opposite directions to a considerable extent.  We are creating unnecessary friction.  The recommendations made by the Eastern Health Board were extremely sensible and should have been accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The health boards were asked to comment on finance, personnel, management and the executive of the regional hospital boards.  Under the heading of personnel the Eastern Health Board said that it was agreed that the function of the regional hospital boards governing the number of hospital personnel should be exercised only through the appraisal of estimates prepared on the PPB principle.  This is planned programme budgeting for those who might not know what it is all about.  They said that under this arrangement there would be the least delay in recruitment and the least interference with forward planning of staff requirement and that the absence <Col N="2201" /> of conciliation and arbitration machinery to deal with pay disputes was noted.</P>
    <P>If the hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal are to decide the exact number who should be employed, how will it be possible for health boards to plan five years ahead unless they can also plan for the recruitment and employment of the necessary staff to deal with the programme? This is consistent with the Devlin Report recommendation.  When it suits the Minister to accept what is consistent he accepts it and when it does not he throws it out.  He quotes it when it suits his purpose.  We feel that there is an unnecessary interference and an unnecessary restriction, that there should be a budget and that, within that budget, an immense amount of freedom should be allowed to either the voluntary hospital boards or the health board concerned with the running and development of voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that it is not possible to get the Minister to step back from the edge of the precipice because untold harm will be done if the health boards are wrongly launched.  This would be a great pity because there is no doubt that immense changes are taking place in the health services and that there is a great deal of criticism of these changes.  There is criticism of the fact that the people who are providing the money have little or no say in the development of the services.  I am surprised and disappointed that it has not been possible to get the Minister to see that there was wisdom in the recommendation of the Eastern Health Board in an area with 55 per cent of the population and 76 per cent of the beds.  They are not listened to and yet we hear talk about the fullest possible co-operation.  I will leave the setting up of these bodies with the comments I have made.</P>
    <P>I would appeal again for rethinking on this whole situation particularly in regard to the personnel who will be involved in the executives of these organisations.  As far as we are concerned, regional hospital boards are a new concept and we do not know whether they will work.  Some of us are <Col N="2202" /> completely satisfied it is a wrong concept if they are set up in this way and if we do not appoint people to their secretariats who will be in a position to go back to their jobs after a period when they will have been seen to be interfering unnecessarily with the programme and when it has become clear that these organisations never should have been set up.</P>
    <P>I had meant to comment on a number of points in the Minister's speech.  I made some notes here and there but I am afraid I am not referring very much to them.  We have all had a surfeit of discussion on the health services in all their aspects this year but the point that is current and causing serious concern to me and to many other people is that which involves the regulations before the House for consideration, approval or disapproval. They certainly have my disapproval.</P>
    <P>There was reference early on to health charges and conditions for eligibility. Deputy Timmons said that in the Eastern Health Board we recently issued guidelines for eligibility.  In the circumstances they seem to me to be reasonable enough so long as we retain a means test but it is my considered view that the time has come to remove this means test as to 90 per cent of the people.  While we are waiting to do that, it is good that we have these guidelines so that public representatives, and others to whom so many unfortunate people come, will know the yardstick that has been used and how it is being used.</P>
    <P>I want to say something about the health charge for emergency cases.  The Minister will recall that before the 1970 legislation public representatives had the right to allow an emergency health charge, so to speak, to somebody in dire hardship.  The degree to which that system was abused was very small.  Indeed, I was not aware of it being abused to any worthwhile extent in the Dublin region.  It was extremely useful and I could count the number of times I used it on my fingers, and I represented a very densely populated area of working-class people.  Nevertheless, it was a mistake to take it out because nothing has taken its place. You can have an extreme hardship <Col N="2203" /> case which will take a month or six weeks to be caught up with in present circumstances.  There is, therefore, a great need for another look at this matter with a view to reintroducing something like it at local level because the authority now responsible for health services are no longer local.  At local level somebody should have the power to say: &ldquo;This is a hardship case and until a full investigation is made relief must be provided.&rdquo;  It is always a mistake to do away with something until you have something else to take its place.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say on the health services.  I wish to ask the Department to look at the overall health service concept and to say it is a job for one organisation and not for three.  I can see a limited function for the hospital boards but I should like to hear the Minister openly say that it is to be an advisory body instead of talking about a devolutionary body.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Many aspects of our health services have been covered in the course of this debate so far and it is not my intention to cover that ground.  From other speakers to whom I have listened I got some information and I also got it from the statement supplied to us.  One point is that between 1948 and 1972, which roughly covers my period as a public representative, the cost of health services has increased by 1,500 per cent.  The figure given for 1948 is £5.7 million and in the statement now before us for 1972 it is £86.550 million.  This, of course, is likely to be increased before the year expires because Supplementary Estimates may become necessary.</P>
      <P>Let us take this year.  According to the Minister's statement the cost of the services increased by £13 million and for a country with 2.9 million that is a sharp increase.  Has the quality or has the volume of services increased proportionately, taking into account the declining value of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said the volume increase was 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he must set <Col N="2204" /> himself down again to this percentage increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect he will be back.  In any case, the number of people engaged in the administrative side and the numbers engaged in other incidental work are extremely large and have expanded during the years. Having reached 1972, and this volume of expenditure, one would think complaints would not be necessary, that they would not exist.  However, public representatives have many complaints regarding the implementation of the services in their varying spheres.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton again and again mentioned the McKinsey Report and the advice given in that report.  I have commented on the advisability of employing outside people to tell us what to do.  With so many people employed in the Department of Health, many with medical and other qualifications, and considering also the numbers employed in local authorities, it amazes me that we are not deemed capable of submitting a report on the improvement of health services without going to this company.  I do not wish to cast a reflection on them&mdash;according to the State they are deemed to be infallible. We must get McKinsey to tell us what to do with the health services, with CIE, and so on.  I wonder would the Taoiseach think of handing over the administration of this Parliament for a year to McKinsey.  Having regard to the tendency shown by the Government, it would not be surprising if that did happen.</P>
      <P>I am not dealing with this matter in a flippant way because it is serious.  It is my opinion that in our public service and in the country there are men and women capable of giving the kind of advice the Minister needed with regard to the health services.  I do not like this idea of farming out business to outside companies or consultants; this could be done better at home.  I pay little heed to reports from McKinsey. So far as their report on the health services is concerned, my appraisal would be different from that of Deputy Clinton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2205" /> I intended to have a little fight with the Minister for Health on this Estimate. I have respect for him and I do not doubt his integrity but he is not doing what he should do.  He is the last person in the Government I would like to criticise but I must fault him in this matter.  In 1969 he introduced a Bill which was passed by the Dáil although it was a measure for which I did not have much admiration.  The measure consisted of 86 sections and one would be bound to find some useful sections in it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Deputy knows that legislation may not be criticised on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that, but this is a major question.  I am saying that what is happening is unconstitutional. A section was put in that is of vital importance to many people&mdash;I refer to the mentally and physically handicapped who reside with relatives and friends.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for a disabled person's allowance in the Health Act which was introduced around 1954 set down that family or household circumstances must be taken into account by the determining authority, the local health board or health officer.  To my mind that should have been revoked and frequently I pleaded in the House for its revocation and at last I thought I had won.  Section 69 of an Act passed two years ago&mdash;a measure which was signed by the President and which is now an Act&mdash;should be applied, but parts of it are not being applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be in conflict with regulations but this is a matter in which I am interested and later I will develop the reasons for my interest. Section 69 states that a health board shall provide for the payment of a maintenance allowance to a disabled person over 16 years of age where the person or his spouse, if any, is not able to provide for his maintenance. Under that section a disabled person's application would be determined in the same way as an application for a non-contributory old age pension is <Col N="2206" /> dealt with by the Department of Social Welfare.  In the case of an uncle or an aunt living with relations, instead of the household income being taken into account, his or her own income is taken into account, and in the case of a married couple the income of the spouse is taken into account.  As a result of the non-implementation of this section, many people who are living with their relatives are being denied an allowance to which they are legally entitled under section 69 of the 1970 Act.</P>
    <P>I have inquired from the Minister for Health his reasons for not implementing this section.  He gave his reasons and I am sure he was quite straightforward about them.  He indicated then that it would take more than £4 million to implement that section&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Official Report will indicate that in the course of the Minister's replies to Parliamentary Questions six or eight weeks ago he mentioned a figure of £4 million.  I am not in any way reflecting on the Minister.  It is very difficult to retain figures in one's head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of the services is between £4 million and £5,500,000.  The extra cost would be £1.25 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not a person who would try to mislead the House.  While he holds convictions with which I would not agree I regard him as being a man of integrity.  He would be the last Minister in the Government on whom I would reflect. My case is that the Minister should find this £1.25 million I am pleased to learn that the figure is less than what I took to be on hearing the Minister's statement.  This £1.25 million should be given to incapacitated people so that they might have some independence. Ultimately I am sure that instead of being a loss, this amount may be a gain because the cost of maintaining a person in a district hospital is now more than £30 per week.  If allowances were paid to incapacitated people the <Col N="2207" /> necessity for transferring them to local hospitals would be eliminated and there must also be the consideration that these hospitals are overcrowded.</P>
      <P>Section 69 must be implemented. Disabled persons are entitled to receive allowances.  We must help such people and now when State money is flowing so freely in other fields, it is difficult for any public representative to justify to disabled persons the non-implementation of section 69.  If the Health Estimate had not come before the House at this stage I had intended writing to the Minister personally on this matter.  In so far as possible I wish to bring the Minister's attention to certain matters which he may have overlooked. I know it must be very difficult for one man to be <i>au fait</i> with the complex health services.</P>
      <P>One aspect of the health services which I expect the Minister will rectify without delay is the question of incapacitated wives who are not deemed to be eligible for a disabled person's allowance by reason of the fact that, according to the regulations, their husbands are obliged to maintain them.  To illustrate my point I shall quote a letter in a few moments that was sent to me from the Cork Health Authority.  This case concerns a man and his wife both of whom qualify medically and financially for a disabled person's allowance.  The Department of Social Welfare when granting benefits to an adult allow him or her an allowance in respect of the spouse but in the case of the disabled person's allowance there is no provision for allowance to be paid to the spouse.  Therefore, the position is that the amount paid to a man and his wife, both of whom are incapacitated, is £4.40 per week unless they can get a supplementary allowance by way of home assistance.</P>
      <P>I shall quote the letter to which I have referred.  The officer who wrote it told me that it is a factual appraisal of the present situation.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy Murphy,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to your recent representations regarding payment of a Disabled Persons Maintenance Allowance to Mrs. ...  These allowances <Col N="2208" /> are payable to persons who by virtue of a disability are prevented from earning a living by carrying on their occupation appropriate to their qualification and ability.</P>
    <P>Married women are consequently not granted these allowances as they are not normally engaged in gainful employment and consequently are not deprived of making a living by their disability.</P>
    <P>Mr. .... was recently granted a disability allowance of 80s per week which is the maximum that can be paid to him.  It is regretted, however, that the Health Authority is unable to approve of an allowance to Mrs. ....  She may, however, be eligible for Home Assistance and consequently an application should be made to the Home Assistance Officer for consideration of her case.</P>
    <P>That letter illustrates the position much better than I could illustrate it by talking here in the House.  In this case, although the wife is much more incapacitated than is her husband, she cannot be paid an allowance.  If the Minister wishes I can let him have a copy of the letter.  I was amazed that such a regulation was in the circular issued to local health bodies.  It is about time that it was removed.  It is wrong in 1972 that because a person was never employed and had no stamps she should be unable to get a disabled person's allowance.  The Minister should change that regulation immediately. This regulation is similar to a number of other regulations.  It sets out the position concisely.  It should be changed.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the medical card system.  This subject has been dealt with by other speakers.  Deputy Clinton said the limits of pay allowed in Dublin were adequate.  They are not adequate in Cork.  There is a limit of £16.50 for man and wife and an allowance of 75p is made for each child. These figures are unrealistic because of the cost of medical advice and of medicines nowadays.  On my way to Dublin this week I met the mother of nine children whose husband's income is just outside the limit.  She has been told that a medical card cannot be granted because the income limit is <Col N="2209" /> rigidly laid down in the regulations.  I do not like rigidly in regard to the administration of the Health Act. Regulations should be changed.</P>
    <P>A family may suffer from illness of one kind or another.  They should qualify for a card, or at least the person in the family suffering from the illness should have a medical card.  I know that in the case of a few ailments this applies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that there is a hardship clause in the Bill.  If a woman with nine children is just outside the limit and has fairly continuous need of medical services, she can get a card from the CEO on a hardship basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister mentioned that.  I will take this news to the person concerned.  There is sometimes difficulty confronting applicants for medical cards in disclosing their medical problems to lay people such as the assistance officer or a public representative.  We should not have a system under which a person has to disclose ailments to a lay person in order to avail of the hardship clause. People do not like discussing their medical history with lay people.  If Mrs. X called on me and said she had been refused a medical card while suffering from a certain ailment, is there any regulation under which such information could be sent to the county medical officer or the offices of the health board without that person having to disclose to me the actual illness?  People do not like talking to public representatives about their illness.  I do not see why a person should have to tell the local assistance officer about some family trouble or complaint.  It is completely wrong. Is there any way this can be avoided? The best method of avoiding it would be by direct communication with the county medical officer's office to which one could send the medical certificate necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should bear this point in mind.  The numbers of people covered by medical cards as a result of the recent revisions have diminished. The figures of £16.50 income and 75p. for each child are not realistic.  It is <Col N="2210" /> very hard to fix a guideline.  Deputy Clinton spoke of guidelines and of how advantageous they are.  One family may have £20 per week and a similar family £24 per week, but the second family may be a lot less comfortable. We must bear in mind the cost of medicines.  It is impossible to get anything in a chemist's shop without an average charge of £2.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consult the health boards again with a view to getting a reappraisal of the figures set out for eligibility for medical services. The system should be liberalised.  It is too rigid at present.  It is too easy to say: &ldquo;Your income is £20.50 but to qualify for a medical card it should only be £20.30.  Therefore, you are out.&rdquo;  That kind of approach should be abolished.  Changes should be made. I may refer again to this medical card problem because so many people feel aggrieved about it.  I have put my views on the assessment for eligibility before the House and before the Minister.  I ask the Minister to take cognisance of such views when replying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the admission of adult patients suffering from acute conditions appropriate for treatment in a general hospital no distinction is usually made in the utilisation of available medical and surgical ward accommodation between adults in different age groupings. The question of a percentage of such beds being made available for aged patients does not therefore arise. If what the Deputy has in mind is the percentage of general hospital beds actually occupied by aged patients at a particular time I would refer him to the <i>Dublin General Hospital and Geriatric Study</i> by Bourke and Coughlan, published by the Medical Research Council in 1966, and to the care of the aged report published in 1968.</P>
      <P>In relation to institutional care the report on the care of the aged recommended that provision for the aged should be made in four main types of accommodation:</P>
      <P>(a)  General hospitals (acutely ill patients);</P>
      <P>(b)  geriatric assessment and rehabilitation units (to determine the needs of the patient) (usually associated with general hospitals);</P>
      <P>(c)  long-stay units (chronic illness);</P>
      <P>(d)  welfare homes (frail, ambulant patients).</P>
      <P>The policy recommended to health boards is to step up the assessment and rehabilitation facilities and the provision of welfare homes for the ambulant aged who are not able, even with assistance, to fend for themselves in the community, but above all to develop community services through social service councils.  The provision of 35 welfare homes for the aged over a period of three years should relieve the burden imposed upon general hospitals and homes for the chronic sick in relation to the demand for geriatric beds.  Many of the proposals in the Report on the Care of the Aged are being implemented.</P>

      <P>Turnover tax and wholesale tax are payable monthly in one sum by registered persons on their total receipts from sales of taxable goods to unregistered persons. A breakdown of the amounts paid by reference of particular commodities is not required and, accordingly, the precise amount of tax collected in respect of newspapers and periodicals is not available.  However, from the statistics of home production and imports, and making allowance for exports, it is estimated that the yield from the two taxes on newspapers <Col N="2219" /> and periodicals in the period 1st January to 31st May, 1972, is £750,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually what is proposed at the moment in relation to the newspapers and periodicals is that they would come in at the lower rate of 5.26 per cent.  This will mean a loss to the State of £1.3 million so they will be better off under VAT than they are under the existing wholesale and turnover taxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>To comply with the provisions of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Act, 1935 an order was made by me on 14th December, 1970, fixing 75 per cent as the percentage of the milling quotas which flour millers were required to mill in the form of home-grown wheat in the cereal year commencing on 1st September, 1971.  In accordance with the usual practice this percentage was reduced by order made by me on 12th June, 1972, in order to bring it into line with actual millings in the current cereal year.  The use of home-grown wheat in the flour grist in the present year is at the rate of 75 per cent which represents 59 per cent of the flour milling quotas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me if these orders are of any value in view of the fact that they are made retrospectively, on the basis of what has happened, and do not represent in any real sense a directive to the millers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The flour milling quotas are generally a bit on the generous side in order to allow, in the first place, for an element of competition as between millers and, in the second place, naturally, to ensure that there is sufficient wheat available for flour milling.  The important point as far as the wheat producers are concerned is to ensure that three-fourths of the grist consists of native wheat and that condition is being met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <P>My Department is at present considering what steps will be needed to implement this directive, which has to be observed as from mid-April, 1973.  Our existing agricultural advisory and education services are, however, already well geared to deal with many aspects of the directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the service on which this directive is most likely based is that of the Netherlands, where there are 171 advisers specially and exclusively assigned to give socio-economic advice and that if we are to provide an equivalent service we will need to start training people immediately so that they will be available to give advice on the necessary scale from April, 1973?</P>

Really, what it amounts to is giving advice, in our case, to farmers who may decide to retire from farming because of age, and matters of that kind, and in this way there may be a need for some <Col N="2229" /> specially trained people and for specialised training for the general staff.

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Minister for Local Government has special machinery available for helping to secure cover for persons who have been refused cover or who have been quoted a premium so high as to be tantamount to refusal and any cases of difficulty in getting cover should be referred to him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware of difficulties being encountered by motorists in obtaining insurance cover because of more stringent assessing rules; and whether he is satisfied that such difficulties are not responsible for the increasing number of uninsured cars on the road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of difficulties being experienced by certain motorists in obtaining insurance cover because of the more stringent underwriting practices which have been adopted by some insurance companies following adverse claims experience on motor insurance.  I must accept the right of companies to impose reasonable additional loadings on premium rates in cases where the risk involved is greater than normal.  I am not empowered to compel a company to underwrite a particular risk, but, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the Minister for Local Government has special machinery available for helping to secure cover for people who have been refused cover or who have been quoted a premium that is tantamount to a refusal.</P>
      <P>Although I know there has been an increase in prosecutions for uninsured driving, I am not in a position to say whether there has been an increase in the number of uninsured cars on the road, or how great the increase may be.  Driving a car without insurance cover is highly irresponsible and not to be excused by difficulty in getting cover.</P>

The Irish insurance companies have been consulted in connection with this examination. I am confident that accession will not be detrimental to the interests of the Irish insurance industry.  Without more precise information on the particular costs which the Deputy has in mind it is difficult to give an estimate of the effect of membership on insurance costs but I have no reason to believe that membership will result in an increase in these costs.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I will take Questions Nos. 36 to 39 together.</P>
      <P>The principal reason the ages of prisoners are significant is that persons under 15 years of age may not be committed to prison and persons between 15 years and 17 years of age may be committed to prison only if they are certified to be unruly or depraved.</P>
      <P>Under section 123 of the Children Act, 1908, it is a matter for the court to establish in such manner as it thinks fit the age of a person who appears to it to be under 17 and it is not a matter for me to comment on how it discharges its duty.  The governor is both authorised and required by law to accept prisoners committed by court order.</P>
      <P>There are no persons under 15 years of age in custody in Mountjoy Prison. There were three persons under 16 years of age in custody in Mountjoy Prison on the night of 18th/19th May, 1972, when a riot occurred in the prison.  Garda investigations are proceeding in regard to the disturbances which took place, criminal proceedings are likely to be instituted and it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>
      <P>In the 12-month period ended 31st May, 1972, a total of 49 boys and 16 girls under 16 were committed to Mountjoy Prison either on remand, awaiting trial or on conviction.  Of these seven boys and three girls were in custody for longer than one month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that reports appeared in the papers recently where a window was broken in a certain street and the man who was repairing the damage during a period of six hours claimed he did not see a foot patrol in that time?  Further, is the Minister aware that a burglar alarm was ringing in another street from midnight until 9 a.m. but a foot patrol did not appear on the scene in that time?  There are not sufficient police in the city of Dublin to give effective protection to people and property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>These supplementaries appear to be considerably broader than the original question.  As I have made clear in the House on numerous occasions, during the last few years there has been a considerable increase in the number of police stationed in Dublin, and that is a continuing trend.  The fact that foot patrols may not have been available in a particular area at a particular time is not to be taken as suggesting that no police were available at the time in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Garda inspectors, in common with the other ranks in the force, have greatly benefitted from the improved conditions recommended by the <Col N="2246" /> Conroy Commission.  Various claims for further improvements are at present being dealt with under the Garda conciliation and arbitration scheme.  Proceedings under the scheme are confidential.  If any offers made in the course of the conciliation proceedings are not accepted, the inspectors have the right to have the matter determined by arbitration.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in the Dáil some time ago, arrangements are being made for a substantial increase in the number of inspectors.  I expect the selection of sergeants for appointment to the new posts will be commenced shortly.</P>
    <P>I assume, however, that the Deputies are referring to specific reports which appeared in some newspapers last week alleging that many Garda inspectors were on an unofficial &ldquo;goslow&rdquo;, particularly in Dublin.  The Commissioner has had these allegations checked by senior officers in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and he also consulted the Representative Body concerned, which includes elected representatives of inspectors. The Commissioner has assured me that the allegation is wholly untrue and without foundation of any kind. I mention without comment that the first of these newspaper reports appeared on the very afternoon of the concluding day of the ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Garda Síochána and was given considerably more prominence than the report of the ceremonies themselves.</P>

The tender has been accepted for this housing scheme.  All that is required is sanction for the loan.  What type of consideration do you have to give to that?  The plans and everything else are in order.  The tender has been accepted but the council cannot commence a scheme without approval for the loan.

In consequence I am aware, generally, of the extent to which housing authorities are implementing the recommendation of the interdepartmental committee on the care of the aged that at least 10 per cent of their housing programmes should be provided as special housing for elderly persons.  A record is not, however, maintained in my Department of the numbers of dwellings for elderly persons included by housing authorities in each of their normal schemes, and it would not be possible, without involving an inordinate amount of staff time, to assemble details of such provision for each housing authority.  Broadly it is estimated that in recent years about 9 per cent of the dwellings in building proposals coming before my Department were of a type suitable and mainly intended for rehousing elderly persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would reiterate the points made in my earlier reply that the housing needs of elderly persons in rural areas are being met to a substantial extent by the provision of prefabricated, demountable <Col N="2258" /> and mobile dwellings, of which over 1,700 have been provided over the past five years and that additional numbers of elderly persons are rehoused indirectly through the operation of approved schemes of letting priorities.</P>
    <P>In general, I am satisfied that housing authorities are responding well to my appeals and that the provision that they have been making for rehousing elderly persons is not unreasonable having regard to other urgent housing needs.  They have not, as yet, adopted a uniform practice of putting a minimum percentage of old persons dwellings in every sizeable scheme.  I must leave it to the individual housing authority to decide how many special dwellings to build and where they are to be provided.  I hope that local authorities will inspect the prototype dwellings to which I referred in my earlier reply and that they will be encouraged by this example to make more uniform provision in their schemes for elderly persons&mdash;and, indeed, for small families generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well that I have been encouraging local authorities, as I indicated in my reply, to provide a certain percentage of houses for the accommodation of elderly persons.  It is up to each local authority, having assessed the needs of the area, to draw up plans for providing <Col N="2259" /> adequately for those needs.  Such plans are put before the Department. I will continue to encourage local authorities to give consideration to the needs of this particular category, as well as to the needs of other categories in need of rehousing.</P>

The exercise of these powers is primarily a matter for each local authority concerned but in regard to fire risks, I asked all local authorities by circular letter in May, 1971, to take steps to ensure protection against outbreaks of fire in potentially dangerous buildings, including flats and bedsitters.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. McMahon</b> asked the Minister for Local Government whether he will introduce proposals for legislation to enable schemes for the purchase by council tenants of their houses to have regard to the valuation of the houses at the date of the commencement of the tenancies, to the number of years of occupancy by each tenant and to the total amount of rent already paid in respect of each such house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The statutory provisions governing the sale of local authority houses to tenants require sale prices to be based on the market or replacement value of the houses.  These prices are reduced by a discount of 3 per cent for each year after five during which a purchaser has continuously been tenant of any local <Col N="2261" /> authority dwelling, subject to a maximum discount of 45 per cent for houses which are not in a built-up area.  The discount is 2 per cent and 30 per cent respectively in a built-up area.  These terms are designed to conform with the principle that in disposing of any property held by them in a corporate capacity on behalf of the local community, local authorities are obliged to sell at a fair and reasonable price. The fact that 70 local authorities have so far made schemes covering more than 60,000 houses and that already over 12,000 of these have been or are in the process of being purchased by the tenants indicates general acceptance of this principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that the question is in relation to the council houses in County Dublin?  The fact remains that although the purchase scheme which the Minister has approved was brought into operation in October, 1971, only two people out of many hundreds in the county have availed of this scheme.  Under this scheme Dublin County Council are selling houses in Tallaght at £3,325 which cost £2,320 plus the fact that the tenants in these houses have already paid over £1,000 and some of them up to £1,200 in rent in the meantime. I consider this to be a great injustice to these people.  They are not being encouraged to purchase their houses under the scheme.</P>
      <P>Further arising from the Minister's reply today and last Thursday, he said he had no power to vary the price in an approved scheme during the period for which the scheme was valid.  I do not agree because he has already varied the price in relation to houses at Stillorgan for Dublin County Council.  The tenants now on strike are looking for better terms and surely he could consider approving a scheme giving them better terms so that they would have the opportunity of purchasing their houses?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally, there is not an undue delay in paying these grants after the Department has been notified of the completion of the work.  Since 4th April, 1972, the procedure for dealing with the payment of most types of grant has been simplified and administrative checks have been reduced to a minimum.  However, there has been a big increase in recent months in the number of cases maturing for payment, and this has given rise to inspection <Col N="2265" /> delays in some individual cases in certain areas.</P>

      <P>Twenty-three &ldquo;minor&rdquo; water schemes submitted by Waterford County Council have been approved by me since January last.  The value of these schemes is £51,000.  A remaining group of nine proposals submitted by the county council at various dates between April, 1970, and March, 1971, have not been approved by me.  Eight of these schemes, ranging in cost between £100 and £700, are of the type which it was indicated to the local authority on the 8th February last, should not be a charge on the public capital programme.

As indicated in my reply to Question No. 80 on 24th February last, the integrated design for the Dundrum and Clonoulty group water supply schemes caters for more than 500 houses, covering more than 80 miles of pipeline.  In view of the magnitude of the joint project, detailed examination of the design was essential. The design has been informally approved by my Department and Tipperary (SR) County Council, subject to the use of increased pipe sizes to enable the schemes to be integrated with the Dundrum regional scheme. The additional cost involved in complying with that requirement is being examined in my Department before an approach is made to Tipperary (SR) County Council to make a special contribution to the group.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a question on 27th April, 1972, responsibility for enforcement of the law relating to the dumping of refuse, as laid down in the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, rests with the local sanitary authority concerned.  The problem appears to be that of difficulty in identifying offenders rather than one of deficiency in the law.</P>
      <P>I have asked sanitary authorities to review their refuse collecting and dumping arrangements and facilities with a view to discouraging dumping and also to clear away dumped material lying in unauthorised places.  I understand that steps to combat the problem are being taken by the local authorities in the areas mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not intended that the supplementary provisions voted exceptionally for this scheme last year should be repeated.  The allocation made to Donegal County Council represents its full proportionate share of the provision for the current year. Increased provision has been made for amenity schemes this year and grants totalling £14,722 have been notified to local authorities in the county.</P>
      <P>Road Fund grants to the council have been increased by £60,700.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While it could be said that there were exceptional circumstances which warranted the provision of approximately £120,000 last year, there has been no change in the circumstances since then and therefore the reason for taking it away is not apparent.  Further, how does the allocation for this year compare with that for the year before last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision made last year, as I have already explained, arose out of the making of an employment period order, depriving certain single men of payment of the dole during a certain period, which released additional moneys, some of which were provided to increase the local improvements scheme.  In that way, it was possible last year to double the allocations in the western counties.  On the other question the Deputy has asked, in the year before last, Donegal was allocated £50,000 and this year the allocation is £55,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I draw the attention of the Minister to what I said in regard to there being no change in the circumstances this year as against last year?  Whatever may have been in the Government's mind by way of requiring additional money to take up the slack left by the disappearance of the <Col N="2278" /> employment period order, single unemployed men were not employed additionally last year.  This is well known to the Minister.  That is why I say no change in circumstances has taken place this year as against last year.  In other words, there is no reason why there should have been a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was also the other reason, that there had been a great backlog of applications building up and the doubled allocation in the counties which had experienced this acceleration in the number of applications, and slowness in dealing with them, allowed for many of those schemes being cleared well in advance of the time they might normally have been cleared if allocations had continued at the level at which they had been applied in the previous five year period.  At the same time, I support strongly the good work done under the local improvements scheme.  I will keep the situation under review for the rest of the year and see how things are developing.  I hope this may not be the final allocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he would take into consideration that the backlog if anything is increasing due to the demand for those very useful schemes and in anticipation of a continuance of the high level of allocations of last year, the Donegal County Council and, I am sure, other local authorities, felt constrained to set up a special organisation to deal with these more effectively.  That organisation which was brought into being is now on the point of expiring for want of necessary money.  I would ask the Minister to take these two points into consideration in making further allocations.</P>

In practice, however, considerable delays beyond the contractual period arise in many cases.  These further delays arise because of production difficulties, industrial disputes, difficulties experienced with sub-contractors, delays in completing buildings, <i>et cetera</i>.  Contracts for the supply and installation of switching equipment for new exchanges are placed following consideration of competitive tenders which are invited from about 12 firms, but so far only the five firms named above have been successful.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in respect of applications for telephones which are delayed, a very common reply given by his Department is that equipment for the particular exchange has been on order for some time and has not yet been installed? This delay seems to be a major factor in regard to people not getting their telephones installed.  Will the Minister have another look at this whole issue <Col N="2285" /> to see if we are adopting the right procedures in regard to getting this switching equipment and if we are ordering the necessary equipment in time?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Two sets of regulations governing the control of interference with reception of radio and television programmes have been made and are in force, namely S.I. No. 108 of 1963 which deals with interference caused by small electric motors and S.I. No. 223 of 1963 which concerns interference caused by ignition apparatus forming part of an internal combustion engine.  Further regulations are in course of preparation to govern control of interference caused by industrial, scientific and medical equipment, but because of the complexity of the matter it may be some time before these are ready for issue.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to prevent all interference. The most that can be hoped for is to reduce it to a level which will permit enjoyable reception of the home programmes.  The signal strength from distant stations is usually below what is necessary for good reception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2289" /> In general, the co-operation of the manufacturers and of the electrical trade continues to be received in ensuring that equipment liable to cause undue interference to radio and television reception is not placed on sale and in arranging to have suppressors fitted in instances where interference has been caused by a particular type of equipment.</P>
