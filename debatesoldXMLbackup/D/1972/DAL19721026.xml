    <Title>European Communities Bill, 1972: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>My main concern in addressing myself to this Bill is to ensure that there is the maximum participation in decision-making in the Community by directly elected democratic representatives.  My main criticism <Col N="212" /> of the EEC as it exists is the weakness of the democratic voice in its decision-making.  There are a number of institutions through which a democratic voice can take effect.  Some are weaker than others so far as their democratic content is concerned.  The first one which was adverted to last night by Deputy de Valera was the Council of Ministers.  He attached very great importance to preserving the present powers and functions of the Council of Ministers.  He claimed it was directly responsible to the national Governments who were directly elected by the people.</P>
      <P>I think his thesis was faulty in some respects.  While I do not deny that there is a definite obvious democratic content in the fact that they are Government Ministers of the various countries sitting around a table, there is the difficulty that members of Parliament seeking to check the activities of their Ministers who are on the Council are at a significant disadvantage.  This arises from the fact that one does not know what line the particular Minister has taken on a particular issue.  One does not know what line he will take on any future issue.  The discussions are confidential and therefore the degree of control which one can exercise through national Parliaments on Ministers in the Council is not very significant due to the secrecy of the discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is further attenuated by the fact that these discussions by the Council of Ministers can often be very lengthy. There are all-night decision-making sessions.  It is quite clear from this that if the Council of Ministers are, as they are at the moment, effectively locked up in one room and told to take a decision and not to leave until they have done so, there is very little opportunity for referral back in the course of the decision-making to their own Cabinets, let alone to the national parliaments.  Clearly the democratic voice which can be expressed through the Council of Ministers is not very strong due to the secrecy, and due to the fact that decisions must be taken at a single sitting.  Simply to say that leaving the Council of Ministers as it is preserves a valuable democratic <Col N="213" /> voice to my mind is not fair.  We need other institutions.</P>
    <P>The second existing institution which provides for a democratic voice in the Community is the European Parliament. I am not at all satisfied that this provides an effective democratic voice. It is important to recognise that the powers of the Community Parliament are essentially consultative.  They are consulted on directives.  There is no compulsion in any discussion on the Council of Ministers, who make the final decisions, to accept the views of the Parliament.  Therefore, to a significant degree the debates are unreal.  It is worth noting in passing that many people say, and Continental commentators say, that the most significant power of the European Parliament is that it can put Parliamentary Questions to the Commission and have them replied to.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting the length of time it takes to get a reply.  In normal circumstances in this House we can certainly get a written reply in four or five days.  In the Community Parliament, so far as I know, it takes at least a month to get a reply to a Parliamentary Question.  The Commission have the power to say unilaterally: &ldquo;We cannot reply to that this month.  We will put it off for another month.&rdquo; There could be delays of two, three or four months in getting answers to important questions.  Quite clearly that greatly reduces the democratic potency of the Parliamentary Question in the European Parliament as distinct from the form it takes in this Parliament.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Members must be in Brussels, or wherever the Parliament or its committees are sitting, for one-third of the year or more. This time will probably be added to by the journeys to and fro.  Plane connections may not be as suitable as they should be, with the result that about half of the year will be spent by members of the European Parliament away from their constituencies. This is more remarkable in this country than it is in Continental Europe because of the distance between here and wherever the Parliament is sitting.  Therefore, those members will not be very close to their <Col N="214" /> constituents and they will not be open to the sort of informal contact with their constituents which is, perhaps, the most effective way in which Deputies can learn about issues and bring them forward here.  It is not through meeting formal delegations that democracy really has its effect; it is through a Deputy moving around his constituency and hearing people talking, very often hearing casual remarks, that he learns of an issue which is important and which may become of great concern.</P>
    <P>If the members of the European Parliament have to spend half the year away from their constituencies, and perhaps the rest of the year sitting in this House trying to maintain their seats here by making some contribution in the National Parliament, their response to public opinion in their constituencies will be much less than the response of other Members of the House to the feelings of their constituents. Under our system of election, proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies, there is always the possibility that, if a man is elected to the European Parliament, another member of his own party will be working away in the constituency and he may be able to undermine his position by his greater presence in the constituency.</P>
    <P>This will mean that members of the European Parliament will be at a significant disadvantage.  They will be faced with the choice of either doing their job properly in Europe, which means being away for a good deal of the time, in which case they run the risk of losing their seats at the next election, or of not doing their job in Europe and staying at home and trying to hold their seats, in which case there is hardly any point in having them in the European Parliament. This is further aggravated in the case of Ireland because we are further away from where the European Parliament will meet.  Therefore the democratic voice of Ireland expressed through the European Parliament will be greatly decreased.  We must find some way around this.  I will come to the ways in which we could do it later.</P>
    <P>At this stage I am establishing the <Col N="215" /> weakness of the Council of Ministers as a democratic voice, due to the secrecy of their deliberations, and due to the fact that very often decisions are taken at one sitting without the possibility of a referral back.  I am also demonstrating the weakness of the European Parliament as a democratic voice: first, because it is consultative essentially; secondly because of the delay in getting repiles to Parliamentary Questions and, thirdly, because in the case of Ireland Members will be away from their constituencies for a long time, will lose contact and therefore will lose effective democratic representation.</P>
    <P>In regard to Ireland more so than in regard to the other countries, there is a very strong case to be made for having Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann very closely involved in the Community legislative process, and able to influence as far as possible the decisions of the Irish member on the Council of Ministers, and able also, because of the fact that debates have taken place here, to put forward ideas to the Irish representatives in the European Parliament thereby giving them greater material on which to proceed.  Clearly 144 minds are better than ten, and better than one in the case of the member of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to get as many minds as possible to concentrate on the EEC draft regulations and draft directives which are coming before us, so that the Irish Minister on the Council of Ministers, and the Irish members of the European Parliament, will be as well informed as possible on opinion in Ireland and will have the benefit of as many ideas as possible.  It is important that we do not approach this matter as we approach many other legislative proposals, as a partisan issue.  The Irish Minister will have much to gain from hearing the views of the Opposition on issues of this character.  It will strengthen his position considerably if, in relation to a particular proposal, he is able to point not only to his own opinion that a particular aspect of it is undesirable but also to the opinion <Col N="216" /> expressed by all parties here.  He would then go to the Council of Ministers in a much stronger position to demonstrate the danger of any particular proposal from the Irish point of view.</P>
    <P>It is vital that provision be made for consultation to the maximum degree with this House in relation to Community legislative proposals.  The only provision in this Bill for such consultation is an extremely weak one.  This is my strongest criticism of this measure.  There is no need for the provision to be so weak and we could greatly strengthen the voice of this House in regard to EEC legislative proposals without in any way endangering our membership of the European Community.  I am frankly surprised that the Government, who traditionally have claimed to be more concerned with sovereignty than the other parties in this House&mdash;a claim I dispute&mdash;should be the people to introduce safeguards for Parliament in regard to EEC legislative proposals significantly weaker even than those being taken in Britain and a great deal weaker than the safeguards possible.</P>
    <P>I would have expected that the protection of the Oireachtas from the point of view of the EEC legislative proposals would have been much stronger than those in Britain because of the traditionally expressed views of the Government party.  It is disconcerting, to say the least of it, that they should be so much weaker.  I find this difficult to understand.  The only provision here in regard to regulations is that they will take effect immediately but their effect will lapse unless they are confirmed by a decision of the Oireachtas within one year.  This is a very weak position indeed.  First of all, we will be asked to discuss a <i>fait accompli</i>.  We will be given a list of regulations already in force in the country and asked to either approve or disapprove.  There will really be no question of disapproving and the whole debate will, therefore, be quite unreal. To illustrate my point, there is a list of regulations here which, by this particular Bill we are putting through at the moment, we are making effective. How many of the contributions in the <Col N="217" /> debate so far have been related to discussing Directive 69/77 of 4th March, 1969 amending the Council Directive of 7th July, 1964 laying down detailed provisions concerning transitional measures in respect of activities of all self-employed persons in manufacturing and processing industries falling within ISIC Groups 23-40? Not one speaker referred to it.  There was no discussion on it.  Why? Because it is a <i>fait accompli</i> and there would be no point in discussing it. Wherein lies the alleged safeguard then?  The Government are proposing to give us an opportunity of discussing after the event EEC legislation which has already been put into effect in the form of a regulation by the Irish Minister.  That will certainly not be worth very much.  I am surprised that this Government, who claim they are the upholders of sovereignty and who have cavilled over phrases in order to demonstrate their minute concern with the preservation of sovereignty, should now be prepared to bring in a Bill here practically devoid of any safeguards. There should be written into this Bill provisions with regard to consultation with the democratically elected representatives of the people who sit in this House.</P>
    <P>I would divide these safeguards into two stages.  First of all, in regard to regulations and directives in draft form submitted by the Commission to the Council, it is essential that there should be full discussion of all proposals in advance of any decision being taken by the Council.  There must be a discussion on the draft.  That would be the most meaningful discussion of all because we would be expressing an opinion on something which has not yet been decided and our view would then be made known by our Minister to the Council.  That is of paramount importance.  There is no provision in this measure to give effect to that.</P>
    <P>The second stage at which we should discuss is when a directive or a regulation has been decided on by the Council.  Again, there should be an opportunity to discuss such regulation or directive, its implementation and the form of its implementation here.  That will be important in regard to directives <Col N="218" /> because it is only in regard to directives that there is no direct applicability of the Community regulation here and there is a possibility of the Irish Government interpreting the directive in a certain way when it comes to implementation.  There is need for opportunity for discussion at that level, need for discussion on Government interpretation and implementation. The House must be brought in at that stage in relation to directives.  At the earlier stage, when we are discussing drafts, there will be an opportunity for the House to discuss not only directives but also regulations which, once decided by the Council of Ministers, will become directly applicable here.</P>
    <P>The practice adopted by the Government should be as follows: once a draft regulation or a draft directive is published it should immediately be laid before the House and attention drawn to it in the same way as attention is drawn to various Government orders.  It should also be made available in an English translation.  I have a criticism to make of the present draft regulations and directives.  They are available in French only in the <i>Journal Officiel</i> in the Library.  Some Members have a facility in French.  I can read French; I cannot speak it very well, but the bulk of Members can neither read nor speak French, and it is not much use having material down in the Library which is available only in French.  I know that if ever I wanted a particular directive I could go to a Government Department and they would probably provide me with an English translation of it.  But that leaves it to me to discover that there is something of significance in it and then to go and get an English translation.  That is not a great safeguard from the point of view of most Members of the House, because if they do not read French they will not know if there is anything of significance in it and, therefore, will not ask for a translation.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious failing and if the Government are concerned about the preservation of the powers of this House in regard to legislation which is <Col N="219" /> going on now and will continue to go on right up to the 1st January in the Community, and if they want their views, which are going to be expressed through the agreed procedures for interim consultation, to reflect the democratic voice in this House, they must make all those directives available in an English translation for Members of this House so that they can put forward their views in whatever way is open to them.  What I have proposed is that any draft proposals should be laid before the House and placed in English translation in the Library.  I would then propose that every month a day should be set aside in this House on which the Government would not seek the approval of the House on these directives but have a motion taking note of the proposals which have been introduced, and at that stage circulate prior to that debate an explanatory memorandum setting out broadly the proposals which have been made in the intervening period and giving Deputies an opportunity of expressing themselves on those matters.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, there should be a committee of members which would, prior to that debate, also go into the provisions of those directives and publish an independent report on the draft directives and the draft regulations which would also be circulated to Deputies, so that Deputies would be able to discuss the draft directives and the draft regulations, first of all, with the possibility of going to read them in English translation in the Library; and, secondly, having before them the Government's interpretation of their effect; and, thirdly, having before them the interpretation of their effect as expressed by an independent committee of the House.  In that way we could have a meaningful debate.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, at the end of that debate it could not and should not be possible for this House to tie the hands of the Irish Minister who was going to the Council of Ministers.  The Council of Ministers would cease to be effective if the council members could not take decisions on their own account.  Therefore, the motion discussing these draft regulations should <Col N="220" /> only be a &ldquo;take note&rdquo; resolution. However, the Ministers would have the benefit of a debate in which Deputies of all sides and of all backgrounds could contribute on one day each month.  I do not think that one day each month is asking too much.  We have been told that this is the most momentous decision for 40 years in this State.  If it is all that momentous and if accession to the EEC is all that important to the community this facility should be made available so that this House would be able to express its view&mdash;and this is the important point&mdash;prior to any decision being actually taken.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the question of matters which have already been decided and what is the best way of involving this House in deciding how a particular proposal which has already been adopted by the Community in the form of a directive will be implemented in this country and the Government's interpretation of this.  Section 3 of the Bill proposes that this should be brought into effect by means of a regulation.  It says nothing whatever about legislation.  It says:</P>
    <P>A Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect.</P>
    <P>On page seven of the Taoiseach's speech he says:</P>
    <P>Some are more important than others and it may be that it will be found desirable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Nobody says by whom.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in particular cases to implement by statute Community legislation which might not be directly applicable.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be possible to introduce legislation even though section 3 only makes provision for regulations.  However, I would think it better if after the words &ldquo;A Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect&rdquo; section 3 went on to say: &ldquo;or section 2 of this Act may have full effect by means of legislation.&rdquo; But that may not be necessary.  I come to the more important point in <Col N="221" /> the Taoiseach's speech in which he says that it may be that it will be found desirable to have legislation instead of just regulations.  Who is going to decide?  There is no provision here for a committee of the House or for the House to decide whether legislation will be necessary.  The Government will decide.  Everyone knows the Government want the minimum inconvenience. They do not want discussions at great length in this House. They want to shuffle everything through as quickly as possible.  The civil servants do not want to be bothered coming in here to advise and getting involved in issues when everything is already tidied up and all that is needed is a regulation.</P>
    <P>What is proposed here is that it be left to the Government, the very people who do not want debates in this House, to decide whether or not there shall be a debate.  To my mind it is essential that the decision as to whether or not a particular directive will be implemented by legislation or by regulation should not be in the hands of the Government, at least it should be in the hands of a Dáil committee if we are not actually going to lay down precise criteria in this House whereby it would be decided.  I said earlier I felt it was necessary that there should be a committee of the House which would present a report on all draft regulations and directives which have been published to facilitate an open debate here in the House one day each month.  I think that same committee which, to my mind should have a majority of Opposition Members&mdash;but that is not essential&mdash;should be the body to decide whether or not a particular directive shall be implemented by means of regulation or by means of statute.</P>
    <P>There is another point in regard to these regulations.  Not only are the Government to arrogate to themselves the power to decide whether something shall be done by regulation or by statute but they are, in relation to these regulations, providing a more diminished power for this House to check the contents of these regulations than even exists with regard to <Col N="222" /> regulations which are laid before us in the normal way at present and, of course, there is a great deal of complaint about delegated legislation and the fact that there is not, effectively, much opportunity for these documents to be discussed by the House.  While a Member may get an hour to discuss a matter if he raises it within 21 days, the amount of reading involved and the problem of having to watch every regulation makes it difficult for any Member to avail of that power.  That power is difficult enough to exercise but the check which the Government propose to introduce here is much less.  It is not sufficient for one Member to &ldquo;cop on&rdquo; to what is in the regulation and get the matter raised.  According to my interpretation of section 4 (2) it is necessary that the majority of Dáil Éireann decide that a particular regulation is defective and should be discussed. How, in God's name, would one get a majority of Dáil Éireann? The Dáil has, first of all, to be in recess for this to happen.  Suppose I got an idea that a particular regulation contained something which was not very good and wanted to raise the matter.  I would have to go on a pilgrimage around the country and try to get a majority of Deputies to sign a motion asking for the recall of the Dáil to discuss it.  Most Deputies would not want to come back when the House was in recess; they would be quite happy doing work in their constituencies.  Even if they agreed with me they would not want to come back to the Dáil to discuss some niggling point, as they saw it.  It is just not practical.  If an Opposition Deputy was going around he would have to get a number of Government Deputies to sign something which they would know would inconvenience their Minister and which would cast a reflection on his sense in making the regulation.  The protection in section 4 (2) is laughably ineffective. I cannot understand how a party who have prided themselves on being the protectors of Irish sovereignty could bring such a ridiculous proposal before the House.</P>
    <P>I believe that we should at least have the provision that a decision as <Col N="223" /> to whether a particular directive will be implemented by means of regulation or of legislation shall be taken from the Government and handed over to a committee of the House who will decide whether a particular matter is sufficiently important to warrant legislation, which will allow for a complete full-dress debate, or merely for implementation by regulation.  If it is decided that it is to be done by regulation the existing procedure should apply, whereby if any one Deputy wishes he can have the matter raised within 21 days and he is given an hour in which to have it discussed. Even that is inadequate because one has to be prepared to have the regulation annulled completely in order to have it raised.  One must have a motion to the effect that it be annulled. It should be sufficient for a Deputy to be prepared to put down a motion seeking to amend a regulation in a particular respect to get him an open discussion on the regulation.</P>
    <P>It is quite possible within the Community regulations and within the spirit of the EEC to have a much greater role for this House in the legislative process of the Community.  I have made a number of proposals whereby this can be done.  I hope the Government will listen to them.  I cannot understand why the Government have sought to restrict debate on European legislation in this House to so great an extent.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister tell me by what criteria it is decided at the Council of Ministers or at the Commission or wherever it is decided, whether a proposed measure will be implemented by a directive, which gives considerable leeway to the national Government in regard to implementation, or by a regulation which puts the matter directly into effect in the countries concerned?  I understand, for instance, that the Community had before it last March four proposals in regard to farm reform; three of them were in the form of directives and the other one in the form of a regulation.  The three in the form of directives were: one in regard to retirement pensions for farmers, one in regard to a farm modernisation scheme, which is similar <Col N="224" /> to the small farm incentive bonus scheme, and one in regard to socioeconomic advice and training for farmers.  The other proposal was in regard to producer groups.  For some reason, the Community decided that the first three should be in the form of directives while the fourth one, which was equally important as far as I could see, should be merely in the form of a regulation which would be directly applicable and which Governments would not have an opportunity of varying or interpreting in regard to its implementation.  What criteria are used in deciding whether particular proposals shall be implemented by means of a directive or by means of a regulation?  Are there any fixed criteria of which this House could have knowledge or is it purely a matter of administrative convenience for the Commission?  If it is, there is something at fault.</P>
    <P>Is it possible for the Council of Ministers to make a decision on a particular matter without a draft proposal having been published in the <i>Journal Officiel</i> prior to that decision?  Is there a provision whereby it must have been published in the <i>Journal Officiel</i> a certain reasonably long period prior to the decision being taken to give an opportunity for views to be expressed, or is it possible for the Council of Ministers simply to decide in the middle of a session that it is desirable that a decision should be made on an issue, that it can make that decision and that can become binding without a draft of the decision having been published in the <i>Journal Officiel</i> prior to the decision?  It is essential that every decision taken by the Council of Ministers should be on the basis of and in relation to the subject matter of a proposal which has been published a reasonable time in advance in the <i>Journal Officiel</i>, thereby giving an opportunity to this Parliament and other Parliaments, and interested groups concerned, to express their views to the Ministers prior to the decision being taken.  Perhaps this is an unreal difficulty; perhaps it never happens that decisions are taken other than by this procedure.</P>
    <P>I think this is also important.  I should like to know more in regard to <Col N="225" /> what Deputy de Valera spoke about, the democratic voice expressed through the Council of Ministers.  I can see that a decision by the Ministers on a proposal by the Commission has a significantly greater democratic content than a simple decision by the Commission itself without reference to the Ministers because the Commission are not elected by anybody, whereas the Council are Ministers of elected Governments.  I should like to know by what criteria it is decided that a particular EEC regulation shall take effect by a unilateral regulation being made by the Commission without reference to the Council and in what circumstances is it necessary that that regulation should go through the procedure of being published in the <i>Journal Officiel</i>, be submitted to and decided by the Council thus giving an opportunity for discussion.</P>
    <P>I know that draft directives and regulations are published in the <i>Journal Officiel</i> which affords an opportunity for their discussion but I am told that by the time a proposal is actually published the Commission have more or less made up their minds on it, that the matter has been examined in great depth, and that what has emerged is effectively very near to a compromise between the interests of the various states.  Is there such a thing as a working document which could be published and which exists at a much earlier stage in the decision-making process at which stage, perhaps, the delicately-balanced compromise has not been reached which is finally expressed in the published document in the <i>Journal Officiel</i>?  If that is the case and if there is a working document giving some inkling of what is proposed and if it is in any way published, that also should be laid before the House by means of the procedure to which I referred earlier so as to give the House an opportunity to express itself on the, shall we say, raw proposal and not on the finely-balanced compromise which emerges in the form of a published draft directive in the <i>Journal Officiel</i>.  Clearly, if it is a finely-balanced proposal which is finally published it will be much more difficult to upset and, therefore, the discussion <Col N="226" /> in this House will be much less meaningful than it would be if we were discussing a raw proposal where there was great possibility of change. I ask the Minister to ensure that when the debate for which I am hoping on draft regulations does take place in this House any working documents which might lead to draft directives should also be drawn to the attention of the House and Members given an opportunity to express themselves on those also.</P>
    <P>In the Bill before us we have a long list of regulations, decisions and directives.  I should like to know how these regulations will be brought into effect.  Have the Government decided that the Bill in itself will do this? Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>From the 1st day of January, 1973, the treaties governing the European Communities and the acts adopted by the institutions of those Communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that everything we have here in this long explanatory memorandum with its lists of regulations shall be directly applicable in this State from the passage of this Bill?  Or does it mean that when this Bill is passed the Government will have to make regulations implementing each one of these proposals?  Or does it mean that the Government will not have to make regulations implementing what are described as regulations but that additional regulations will have to be laid before the House in the normal way implementing the directives?  Have the Government decided that some of these directives shall, in fact, be again brought before the House even though they are in this explanatory memorandum in the form of actual legislation?</P>
    <P>May I draw the Minister's attention to the proposals on farm modernisation which I have already mentioned? These are already the subject of great debate in the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and people are not sure what they mean precisely.  I think there is a case that these proposals should not become effective <Col N="227" /> simply by passing section 2 of this Bill and that they should be again brought before the House in the form of legislation which would actually implement them.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that these proposals will, as far as possible, again come before the House in some cases as regulations and in others as actual legislation so that they can be discussed in detail.</P>
    <P>Clearly, we are not discussing all these proposals at present and yet, on the face of it, we appear to be putting them into effect.  What we are discussing are the broad principles of Community decision-making but not detailed regulations.  These detailed regulations require to be discussed and I think a separate opportunity must be provided for their discussion.</P>
    <P>I am not a practising lawyer and do not know much about interpretation of statutes but it seems to me there will be a certain problem of interpretation. We have a list here of Irish Acts which will be affected by Community law.  We are told in regard to the Restrictive Trade Practices Acts, 1953 and 1959&mdash;to take an example which may not, in fact, illustrate my point&mdash; that Community provisions will affect the following: provisions relating to the carrying out of investigations into practices which have as their object the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.  Will there be difficulty in interpreting precisely where the Community legislation stops in effect and where you must revert to Irish legislation to find what is the law on a particular subject? Unless each one of these statutes is specifically amended to delineate precisely the extent to which the Community law changes existing Irish statutes you will have the possibility of differences of opinion as to whether a Community provision applies in a particular area or whether it is just the Irish law.</P>
    <P>Is it possible that this difficulty could be overcome by specifically amending these Acts to the extent that they are changed by Community regulations? Clearly, it will be very difficult for lawyers to decide, if you have two bodies of law both operative in the <Col N="228" /> country at the same time, where one stops and the other begins.  Again, I would emphasise that I am speaking as somebody not practising law and, perhaps, that is not a real difficulty.  I suppose that if it is a difficulty it has been discovered already in the Community countries.  I should like to know how the Minister proposes to get over that difficulty.</P>
    <P>That is really all I want to say except to ask the Minister to find some very significant improvement on the provisions expressed in this Bill for consultation with the House in regard not only to existing EEC decisions but also, more importantly, in regard to draft EEC decisions.  It will strengthen the hand of those Irish Ministers who are on the Council of Ministers to have the view of their own Parliament behind them, to hear aspects explored which they or their civil servants and advisers might not advert to but which Members of the House who are directly in touch with the people would advert to.  I would ask the Minister to convey to the Government the need greatly to improve the provision for democratic participation through this House in Community decision-making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a two-pronged debate because the Taoiseach said in his speech yesterday that we are dealing with the European Communities Bill and also dealing with the motion for the Approval of the Treaty of Accession.  I should like to make a few points in regard to both of these matters.  I will take the Bill first because my remarks follow on what Deputy Bruton was saying.  I share a lot of his concern about how this will work in practice.</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Bill gives extraordinarily wide powers to a Minister to make regulations and it gives stupendous effects to those regulations on our domestic law.  Subsection (2) says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations under this section may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister making the regulations to be proper for the purposes of the regulations (including provisions repealing, amending or applying, with or without modification,  <Col N="229" /> other law, exclusive of this Act).</P>
    <P>It will be the Minister's subjective decision because there is no provision whatever for parliamentary debate or for the Minister to take advice from any objective source.  By a subjective decision of the Minister our domestic law could be vastly changed.  This is something which is contrary to the whole concept of parliamentary democracy.  I appreciate the practical need for having some type of power to enable the Government to implement Community legislation as part of our domestic legislation.  I respectfully suggest that what is proposed in section 3 and the powers contained in subsection (2) are completely wrong in that they go contrary to the whole traditions of our democracy and our traditional procedures.</P>
    <P>As the Bill is drafted, the ministerial regulation could be used to achieve amendments unduly wide and not strictly applicable to the question of implementing a Community piece of law.  One can answer that by saying that the Minister will not do it, that the Minister will use his powers strictly as intended by the Act, purely to implement EEC law, but how do we know that?  It might suit a Minister to take advantage of the very wide power he has here to make regulations which contain such incidental, supplemental and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister.  It would be a grevious temptation for any Minister to have that power and to look at the body of legislation in effect under his Department and to see some particularly thorny piece that may be inhibiting his bureaucracy.  It would be a tremendous temptation to draft the regulation to remove that particular thorn even though it might not directly or indirectly arise from the implementation of European law.</P>
    <P>The Minister's powers enable him to repeal, amend and apply, with or without modification, other law. The Minister, by regulation, could completely upset the whole legislative structure of his Department without recourse to this House at all.  The Taoiseach in his speech indicates some worry on this aspect of this Bill.  On <Col N="230" /> page 7 of the circulated text he used the expression:</P>
    <P>....our courts will be the ultimate safeguard against any attempted use of the section in excess of the powers conferred.</P>
    <P>When we consider the powers conferred it would not be possible to exceed them because they are already excessive.  Consequently, I fail to see how the courts can be a safeguard.  If a ministerial regulation is brought before the courts on the grounds that it exceeds subsection (2) of section 3 it will be a judge with a very analytical mind, indeed, who could find something in subsection (2) that did not permit the Minister to do what he had done, when we consider that subsection (2) says that the Minister may make regulations containing incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister and that the regulations may include provisions repealing, amending or applying with or without modification, other law, exclusive of this Act. I presume &ldquo;other law&rdquo; means European law at that stage.  It is futile to say that the courts will be the ultimate safeguard against any attempted use of the section in excess of the powers conferred because the courts, having regard to the wording of the section, in my opinion, will be unable to find it has been exceeded, it is so excessive in the way it is drafted.</P>
    <P>It is altogether wrong and quite contrary to the whole tradition of Parliament that the Executive in the person of the Minister should be given such wide powers.  I concede that the very entry into Europe means some blunting of the sovereignty of Parliament but I do not think it was intended that it should be blunted to the extent provided in the section.  We must have some regard to the traditions of Parliament and to the idea of Parliament being master of its own affairs in drafting legislation and the way to do that is to consult Parliament in the implementation of European legislation, consult Parliament through a committee. This is what Deputy Bruton was suggesting and I would support him fully on this.  There will have to be some parliamentary procedure devised <Col N="231" /> so as to take away from the Executive the vast power that this section gives. This is essential and it is vital that this should be done.  The Bill as drafted, as far as I am concerned, is completely unacceptable because an unconscionable Executive could run riot with it.  We have no guarantee that the men who will occupy such posts in the country in future will be men of conscience, men of awareness of the demands of parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>Section 4 purports, I think, to be a safeguard in the sense that it requires regulations to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas.  Otherwise they would cease to have effect.  But, this confirmation is to be made not later than the end of the year following that in which the regulations are made.  So, we could have a situation that regulations made by the Minister in January, say, of 1973 would stand until they were confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas in December, 1974.  They would have had two full years of operation and if they were unjust or harsh or suffered from any other defects, nevertheless, they would have been part of our law for two years and presumably anything done under them would remain legal. The confirming Act of the Oireachtas would have to have an indemnifying clause in it.  If an Act of the Oireachtas is not passed, the regulations will fall.  Nevertheless, they would have had two years of life and, having regard to how wide they could be, these two years could be fatal.  The regulations fall unless they are confirmed by Act but that Act may take two years to pass or unless the regulations merely revoke wholly regulations previously made.  The wording used makes one think that the revoking of regulations is not important but regulations which have the effect of wholly revoking earlier regulations could, in themselves, have tremendous consequences.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 4, if it is meant to be a safeguard against abuse by the Executive of its powers under section 3, is not a proper safeguard. The only safeguard is the light of day <Col N="232" /> and the only way the light of day can be thrown on ministerial activities in this context is <i>via</i> a parliamentary committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton raised the point regarding the certainty and availability of the law.  For practitioners and litigants alike it is essential that the law be available and that it would be obviously certain to practitioners of law.  If we have a situation where our domestic law is changed, if it is amended by semi-secret Ministerial regulation, it will make life extremely difficult for practitioners and it will lead to an unjust situation for litigants and citizens.  In addition, it will run completely contrary to our legal tradition. This could be cured if there were some kind of parliamentary committee where these things could see the light of day and where their exact implications and effects could be spelled out in documents and debate which would be available to the legal profession and the general public.</P>
    <P>In the memorandum which was issued, it is stated in connection with the Road Transport Acts that there are Community provisions affecting the Acts.  They are provisions regarding the liberalisation of licensing requirements for certain types of transport. This is a subject which has been a thorny one in the Irish context having regard to the monopoly of CIE. In enforcing that monopoly CIE have waged war on private transport operators but here we have Community legislation which it appears will affect our transport system.  I am not sure about this because, as Deputy Bruton has pointed out, if I want to be quite sure I should have to read French and I might misinterpret because my French might not be good enough.  We have no way of knowing how, in this instance, this piece of Community legislation will affect us.</P>
    <P>The Government owe it to this Parliament and to the country to ensure that whatever system is devised it will mean that the law at all times, even if it is amended by European requirements, will be certain and will be available easily to the public.  It is a basic principle of our legal system that ignorance of the law is no excuse, <Col N="233" /> that every man is expected to know the law.  That might be a commendable enough principle at the moment when the law is available and people know that this is so, but if we are going to get into this massive administrative law this principle could be the cause of tremendous hardship. As drafted, the Bill does not ensure that the law will be easily available and certain.  To my mind, it is a Bill which has a great capacity to do harm and until it is amended by including within it some provision for Parliament as a watchdog I should not like to see it being adopted by the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We are also being asked to approve our accession into Europe.  In his opening speech the Taoiseach indicated that the referendum vote indicated an overwhelming endorsement by the people of the Government's decision that Ireland should join the EEC and, at the end of that sentence, he added, &ldquo;and their approval also of the terms of accession which had been negotiated by the Government.&rdquo;  The people had no choice if they wanted to enter Europe and, although we showed by our votes that we did want to enter the Community, it does not follow that we approved completely the Government's terms of accession.  However, they are the terms that were negotiated and we have to live with them.</P>
    <P>Personally I am very pleased that the decision to enter Europe was taken by such an overwhelming majority because I think that in our future life within Europe we can find cures for many of the ills that beset us politically and, I suppose, to some extent economically.  The chief ill that has beset this nation&mdash;it was also an ill which effected Europe for many years &mdash;is an excess of nationalism.  Nationalism as pursued in Europe led to world wars of an outrageous magnitude and, as pursued in this country, has led to a fantastic and horrifying amount of hatred and suffering.  As a political doctrine it must be abandoned.</P>
    <P>In this country it has been equated with republicanism but I think there is a vast distinction to be made between them.  Nationalism has been <Col N="234" /> pursued here for its own end, not as a political philosophy that would grant us independence and give us the means to improve our lot.  People have forgotten that political doctrines should have some end and they are now being pursued for their own sake.  That is what has happened here.  That is not to say that in going into Europe we must abandon our nationality and I should like to draw a distinction between nationalism and nationality.</P>
    <P>I consider our nationality to be our separateness, our particular identity&mdash; our Irishness, if that does not grate.  I see no reason why we should abandon that or be forced to abandon it or why the environment of Europe should cause any lessening of it.  The nationality of a nation, its characteristics, language, mode of dress, its customs and cultures, very often are formed by the physical environment of the nation.  Because our physical environment is so distinctive in relation to Europe I think we will always remain a distinctive people and our essential nationality will not be blunted.  I do not fear anything on that score when we enter Europe.</P>
    <P>Within countries one can see distinct regional differences.  For instance, the Scot is a different person from the Cockney, the Donegal farmer on 20 acres differs from the man in Kilkenny who has a few hundred acres but they are members of the same country and have not lost their nationality.  I do not see why Irish people should lose their individuality because they enter Europe.  If the uncontrolled chase of narrow sectarian nationalism from which we have suffered for so many years can be ended by going into Europe, to my mind that is a definite benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One way in which this archaic, violent and disgusting political doctrine of nationalism can be ended is <i>via</i> the regionalism which is proposed as part of the European concept. I was very pleased that the communiqué issued after the recent summit conference indicated that the pursuit of the regional policy was to <Col N="235" /> have a high priority and that funds were to be made available to put it into effect.  I am disappointed that our Government are not ready as of this moment to take advantage of the Community's leaning in the direction of regionalism.</P>
      <P>We have known for a long time now that one of the attractions of membership was the help we could obtain in bringing up the less favoured parts of our country to a higher standard, but there has been no central direction to produce an overall plan and to say to the European Community: &ldquo;This is our problem. This is how we want it solved.  You give us the help.&rdquo;  There has been no overall guidance to produce that plan. We have the IFA concerned with the small farmers in the west.  Macra na Tuatha have made many studies of the problem.  The Agricultural Institute is aware of the problem.  All the county councils have development teams working on it.  There are regional industrial areas with half-formulated plans for their areas.  We have the Scully Report.  All these activities are all vaguely groping towards the same end, that is, to produce a coherent policy to save the west.  &ldquo;To save the west&rdquo; is a hackneyed phrase but that is what they are after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yet, at the top there has been no person of imagination or initiative prepared to co-ordinate all this effort into a coherent overall plan.  Consequently we will lose valuable time in taking advantage of the opportunity in Europe to improve our regions.  It is a pity but, at the same time, there might be a benefit if we could look anew at this question of regional policy.  Bearing in mind that one of the aims of the EEC is to blunt this idea of nationalism, if at this stage we were to produce a regional policy which would deal not merely with the western part of the Republic but would take in the entire province of Connacht, the counties of Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan, Derry, Tyrone and Fermanagh and produce a regional policy for that area, which is homogeneous in the sense that it is <Col N="236" /> poor country, we would be doing a tremendous amount towards implementing in our own country the European spirit which wants to disregard national boundaries.</P>
    <P>We would be presenting a packet to Europe which would have within it the possibility of ending the Northern conflict and a packet with that possibility in it must at this stage be most acceptable to Europe.  To produce such a packet, to produce a regional plan covering parts of Northern Ireland and parts of the Republic, will require an imagination and an energy and an initiative which I think our Government are not capable of producing. This is a glorious opportunity to solve what seems at the moment to be an intractable problem.  I should dearly love to see the solution coming on those lines because the solution to the North is to be found in terms of bread and butter.</P>
    <P>If the quality of life and the standard of living&mdash;they are two different things&mdash;can be improved over an entire region of Ireland, the national boundary, and the actual physical boundary of a customs post, and having to get out and present yourself to a customs officer will disappear, and to drive from Monaghan to Clones will be the same as to drive from Monaghan to Armagh.  If we can achieve a situation where there is no actual customs boundary we will have gone a very long way towards achieving the end of Partition.  I use that in the sense of the end of Partition, I suppose, in a nationalistic sense.  If it can be ended peacefully through economic means our entry into Europe will be well worth while.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity now which would be eagerly accepted in Europe, and in which Britain would be anxious to co-operate, an opportunity of a type that could lead to untold beneficial results.  As I say, it will require a lot of imagination and energy and I do not know if our Government are prepared to provide the lead to achieve that end.  The basics are there with all these voluntary organisations and local authority organisations, and a certain amount of Government effort so far has gone into analysing <Col N="237" /> and studying the problems of the west.  This could be expanded and a coherent overall plan produced to embrace not merely the west but parts of Northern Ireland which lie naturally with it and which have the same problem.  Then we could anticipate a time when Partition would have disappeared through force of economic circumstances.  The real meaning of Europe would then begin to be felt in this country.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Government have any plans at all for taking advantage of the move in the Community towards implementing a regional policy.  Having regard to the personality of Europe it is not enough to parade ourselves as the weak man of Europe, the sick man of Europe, and adopt this attitude of deontas or the poor mouth which one meets so frequently in this country.  My experience of the continental European personality is that, while selfish might be too strong a word to use in relation to it, there is nothing to be got for nothing.  One must make a case for oneself and the tougher one can make that case the more respect one will achieve.  This opportunity was lost in our address to the summit conference.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects of the European Community which affect us more than others: the regional end of it and the democratisation of institutions. As a small country it would suit us to have these institutions, and particularly a European Parliament, elected by direct suffrage.  We are marking time on that and that is a pity.  We should have identified ourselves with the Dutch viewpoint and looked for early universal suffrage in Europe.  Again, it would be an advantage to us having regard to our internal problems.  What we want to see is the diminution of this doctrine of nationalism for the sake of nationalism, without in any way lessening our national identity.  One way of achieving that would be direct elections to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>If we want to put forward a point of view I venture to suggest that it must be put forward vigorously and energetically. Likewise with our views on regional policy, we want to get in there <Col N="238" /> and claim our share of it.  We must go in, not looking for it because we are a poor country on the western edge of Europe and cannot help ourselves, but demanding it as Europeans and as equal partners in the European Community. We must demand it with the backing of a coherent and imaginative plan which will catch the imagination of the Community.  A plan which crosses the Border in this country is one which I venture to suggest would be guaranteed to do that and, indeed, would be received with a sigh of relief and would get every encouragement towards early implementation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I repeat that the Bill, as drafted, gives outrageously wide powers to the Executive to change our domestic law and the only way to meet that situation is to provide for a parliamentary committee to sit and survey ministerial action taken here to implement European law.  I welcome the accession of this country to Europe in the hope that that accession will rid us of the many political ills from which we have suffered as a result of a blind pursuit of nationalism for nationalism's sake.  I have no fear that our accession will have any adverse effects on our nationality. That is a distinction I want to make and it is on that note I conclude.</P>

      <P>This Bill sees us on the first stage of entry into Europe following on the referendum.  Previous speakers have made clear the approach of the Labour Party and our attitude to this Bill.  We made clear after the referendum that our position would be one of constructive contribution and, while this Government remained in control, we would criticise where criticism was deemed necessary and attempt to get the best possible deal we could in the situation of EEC membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, this Bill poses a number of dangers to what has traditionally been accepted as the sovereignty of this Parliament.  Regulations and edicts emanating from without this country will be operative here and superficially there appears to be an abridgement of the powers of <Col N="239" /> this Parliament in that new situation. It is possible that the electorate at the time of the referendum appreciated the reality of the situation, appreciated that power has been slipping imperceptibly away over the years, slipping away to London and to other large countries, where vital decisions affectting the future of the politically free part of this island were taken, outside the jurisdiction of this Parliament. With that viewpoint, this Bill might appear to give a formal gloss to a situation which has been developing over many years.  There is a loss of independence and this may well have been one of the underlying feelings of the electorate at the time of the referendum and this may have been one of the reasons for the large vote in favour of entry.  There may have been a desire to end the kind of sham existence which suggested that we had conditions of full freedom here when, in fact, the economic pillars of that political freedom were daily crumbling away.</P>
    <P>We could take two views of this particular Bill, neither mutually exclusive. We should, of course, look for institutions in the EEC sensitive to the needs and demands of ordinary people and our policy as a member must be to develop such institutions.  We must bring an end to institutions which simply suit the bureaucrats and the officials.  Any large organisation inevitably tends to foster institutions which suit the managers and the administrative cadres.  We must take on the more difficult task of developing democratic institutions which reflect the needs of ordinary men and women in the countries constituting the Community. If the Dutch have played a great part up to now in the struggle for democracy within the Community it will also be our especial task to ensure that in future the institutions of the Community are made more democratic because that is in the vital interest of every small country and particularly of our country.</P>
    <P>The Community must be made answerable to the needs of the ordinary people.  If we do not succeed in this development, if the European <Col N="240" /> Parliament is just another replica of the Strasbourg Council of Europe, useful though that may have been, we shall be faced with failure.  We do not want the European Parliament to become just another venue for periodic meetings of &ldquo;Old Boy&rdquo; parliamentarians from the various Parliaments in Europe.  We want an effective European Parliament, one with a say in the decision-making of the Commission, one truly in the position of a legislature working with the executive, one with that kind of a relationship with the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is of vital importance that the European Parliament should so develop. There is little evidence&mdash;this Government do not give much evidence of thinking&mdash;of a really thoughtful approach to what this Government described as the challenge of the EEC. I would like to see evidence of greater seriousness in regard to the importance of developing a real European Parliament and part of that seriousness will be exemplified in the way in which we fill the positions in the European Parliament.  It must not be somewhere one can get away from it all.  We will know the outcome when we see the various groups, the quality of the people selected.</P>

      <P>The Minister is leaving all this behind him and so, perhaps, he can smile.  More of us could smile, perhaps, if we were leaving this unhappy country for four years.  Those of us who must remain behind are anxious that this Government should be very seriously concerned indeed about the proper development of the European Parliament, very anxious to ensure that it flourishes and develops because it will be the basis upon which to build the other democratic institutions.  If these changes are not made then the big <Col N="241" /> cartels, the big companies which control and are such a decisive element in the Community, will continue to exercise the real power.  They have their methods of communication. They have no need of institutions. They do not need a democratically developing Parliament and democratic institutions.  Their phones are in good working order.  Their board-rooms know exactly what they wish to do and they desire no development in the Community as such.  There is a very real possibility&mdash;and it would be foolish to ignore it&mdash;that the EEC, in the years ahead, may prove to be simply a way of easing or rationalising the work of these large companies in the European countries, to be a means of easing the work of American companies, that all the talk of a Europe which would give a new political life to the various peoples of Europe may have been mere froth, the reality being something quite different.</P>
      <P>If we do not get these institutions based on a democratic suffrage sensitive to the needs of ordinary people, I doubt if we shall get a regional policy.  I see an intimate connection between the development of democratic institutions and the development of a regional policy which will in turn serve the smaller countries, which will serve human needs in the smaller countries with their underdeveloped regions.  This is something that our various delegations, all parties in this House, must be concerned about.  The idea of democratising these institutions is not something airy-fairy or academic.  It is concerned with the vital needs of this country in the EEC. If the Community fails to develop in these directions, then it follows that some of the essential needs of this country will not be served by membership of the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Dáil itself must develop its regulatory powers.  In its work and in its procedures it must not remain stagnant as at present.  It must so develop its work that we can, as a Parliament, efficiently supervise the multifarious regulations and orders that will be coming here in the future. It is doubtful if our present method <Col N="242" /> of working here can be continued if this Parliament is to function properly in the new situation.  Can we as a Parliament, on our number of sitting days, hope to get through the amount of work properly and efficiently, or will we become a mere county council in the sense that all of these edicts will pass over our heads to be endorsed by the Executive?  That is another fate that could befall this Parliament.  It need not necessarily happen but it could happen.</P>
    <P>We have shown very little sense of desiring to see this Parliament improve its working.  The late Seán Dunne and a few more of us in the Labour Party three or four years ago sat down and looked at the working of this Parliament.  We passed on the results of our work to the Government and they suffered the usual fate: a committee was set up.  That is the procedure in this House for muffling constructive suggestions, to set up a committee.  Once a committee is set up the solution evades everybody.</P>
    <P>There is a committee sitting, as we know, and it has certain proposals to make.  I hope there will be the political will on the part of the Government to see that some changes are made either by development of the committee system or in some other way, but in any case to ensure that this Dáil will be able to expand its activities, so to arrange its work that it can play a responsible part in looking over the various items that come from the Commission.</P>
    <P>However much the Government may in domestic politics, in by-elections or in the various constituencies, suggest that there was something particularly disloyal, something particularly heinous, in the attitude of the Labour Party in the recent referendum campaign, we would reply at all times that the role we played in that campaign was important for the future of Irish democracy.  What a comment it would have been on our parliamentary life, on our democratic institutions, if the only opposition to be mounted against our entry into the EEC was the opposition of the various underground organisations, or organisations with no representation in <Col N="243" /> Parliament! What a commentary that would have been! How would the citizens have felt outside who held genuine misgivings about membership, who genuinely thought the Community would develop in a direction which would not be in the interests of this country, as, indeed, the Community may develop?  It would be a very rash man indeed, who would say that benefits must automatically accrue to this country from membership.</P>
    <P>Our approach of saying that we did not believe that the negotiations had truly given us the best bargain, that a better bargain could have been struck, was one that at least provoked people to think, and let me say that provoking people to think in that referendum campaign was an audacious endeavour but an important one nevertheless.  We made it abundantly clear from the start that once the people had decided, the Labour Party would loyally abide by that decision of the sovereign people in the referendum. And we have abided by their decision as we do now in regard to this Bill.  We still voice our misgivings&mdash; who would not with our Government? &mdash;and hope that the Government will ensure that we exploit membership of the EEC to the full advantage of this country, but we will not in any way obstruct the passage of this Bill by voting against it&mdash;we will be voting for it&mdash;because we accept the will of the people.</P>
    <P>Therefore it is dishonest and deceitful of the Government to suggest that because we raised a question mark, queried the advisability of entering the EEC during the referendum campaign, that forever afterwards a mark of disloyalty, a mark of unreliability, should be attached to the Labour Party on the whole matter of the EEC.  We shall play a full part in defence of our people's interests in the EEC.  If this party is ever in partnership with any other group in a Government we shall work the institutions of the EEC fully for the benefit of the people.  It is dishonest political huckstering to suggest that a coalition Government or an inter-party Government, including Labour, would in the future be somehow <Col N="244" /> unreliable on the EEC issue.  That may have been good enough for spokesmen of the Government party in the past.  I hope it will not be in the future.  I hope we shall hear no more of that kind of ridiculous charge.  The Minister is leaving this country later on for the wider, more sophisticated pastures of the European mainland, and I am sure in summing up the debate he will, in anticipation of that more mature role which he hopes to fill, dispel the foul rumour from some members of his own bench that the Labour Party would be anything other than excellent servants of the people in ensuring that the possible gains of EEC membership flow back to the people.</P>

      <P>On a point of order. I did not want to interrupt Deputy O'Leary while he was making some peculiar remarks.  During his concluding remarks he said that, in the absence of the Labour Party's opposition during the campaign in relation to EEC membership, the only other bodies that would be anti-Common Market would be underground organisations. I do not think it is fair that Deputy O'Leary should refer to organisations such as the Common Market Defence Committee as an underground organisation, and would he withdraw the remark?</P>

      <P>This is, of necessity, a very technical Bill and possibly many people were disappointed by the Taoiseach's opening speech in which he dealt with practically nothing but technicalities, but we must remember that in the original set-up of the EEC there were a great many technicalities to be circumvented. These institutions are now in existence; whether for the good or ill of this country is something on which there is a variation of opinion, but it is essential that we should adopt all these existing institutions.  We are stepping on to a moving bus and we must move with it.</P>
      <P>Our Minister for Foreign Affairs will shortly be leaving the political life of Ireland and taking up a very important post in the EEC.  He will, I am sure, accept the fact that he will then become an international civil servant. It would be a mistake for Deputies, or the people of this country generally, to imagine that he will be able to flog the Irish question and nothing else.  He will be an international civil servant and my experience of Europe is that international bureaucracy is stronger than national bureaucracy.  It will be a help to our members of the European Parliament, however, to have there an Irishman who has been a parliamentarian and who has had to wade through the red tape of bureaucracy in the negotiations which he conducted. In my opinion he conducted them well.  He had to wade through the red tape of international bureaucracy to establish the case for his own country. I would ask him, knowing that he will be an international bureaucrat, not to forget this little island.  I am sure he will not.  Coming from the wilds of Clare, I am sure he will always have a weak spot particularly for the problems of rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EEC when it was set up was a bureaucratic institution.  It had to be, because there were so many amending laws to be made to bring each country into alignment and to establish the system as it exists.  The impression has been created, and perhaps there is a certain foundation for it, that the European Parliament itself has very little say. <Col N="246" /> That may or may not be.  Quite a number of the members were Members of Parliament and quite a few of them were in Foreign Offices.  I want to stress to the Minister that there is always the risk when one gets into a bureaucratic group and takes the advice of bureaucrats that one will stop thinking politically.  Although the Minister is becoming an international civil servant I would request him still to think politically as far as possible.</P>
    <P>We are a small country.  The drafting of the voting system in Europe enables the smaller countries to have a big say and to be in the position that they cannot be entirely out-voted by the big countries.  Therefore, I think it is unfortunate that Norway has taken the decision it has taken.  It was a free and open plebiscite and the people were entitled to take that decision but it has, to a certain extent, weakened the arm of the smaller countries.  There is one smaller country less in the group.  My experience is that you achieve everything in Europe by pressure groups, by organisation and by discussion behind the scenes. Although we may not have a great number of votes from the point of view of elected representatives at the European Parliament, at the same time we are in a position to discuss things with other countries.  I have had considerable experience of the Council of Europe over a period of 12 years.  I have always found that to achieve something you must get a big power to back you.  You always find that there is a divergence of opinion between the big powers and by acting as a small pressure group you can establish your point by assuring one or other of the big powers that you will support them in whatever they may require.  Therein lies the power of the European Parliament.  The Commission are not entirely in control. They are governed by the over-riding legal bodies and also by the fact that whatever matter is being discussed it is the Ministers from the countries concerned who are there and it is the function of those who go to the European Parliament to stress the point of view to the Minister concerned.  They should be in a position to brief the <Col N="247" /> Minister on the thinking going on within the Community.  I make these remarks to show that we are not a small country that will be over-run by the bigger powers.  We are in just as strong a position as any other country and we are in a position to make our case fully to the last letter of the law.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that it has been in recent years only that the European Parliament have been given any authority or have been listened to at all.  So much legislation had to be got through, so many institutions set up, so many countries blended into a homogeneous unit, that the European Parliament have not been in a position to force their views, as they should be, as they are the elected representatives of the many countries concerned, on the EEC as a whole. That day is passing now.  The establishment the EEC has set up is on firm ground in spite of the fact that economists predict from time to time that the EEC is going &ldquo;bust&rdquo; and that other people predict there is no longer unity of thought in the EEC. Actually the EEC has been a vital force not only in European politics but in world politics.  I would hazard a guess that in the rather disturbed defence situation in the world the EEC, consisting of nine countries, will be a very powerful force, a force that will play a very large part in the continuity of peace.  In other words, instead of the situation in which what will happen in remote parts of the world rests entirely between America on one hand and Russia on the other with China gradually butting in now from the background, the EEC with 280 million population rising in the not too distant future to 300 million, will have a vital say and must be considered in any major decision by the great powers.</P>
    <P>There may be people in Ireland who feel that by joining the EEC we shall be rushed into a world war.  I cannot accept that.  By joining the EEC we shall be entirely free to take a national decision and only this Parliament can decide whether we become involved in hostilities anywhere. But at least we shall belong to this strong group and be absolutely privy <Col N="248" /> to discussions going on in relation to disputes and upheavals in different parts of the world.</P>
    <P>On the matter of financial alignment with the EEC, I understand that the Government, on the grounds that we are joining the EEC, intend to introduce the value-added tax forthwith.  I should like to point out that Italy was 11 years in the EEC before she opted for VAT and that Britain, which we seem slavishly to follow in everything they do, are not introducing VAT in the immediate future.  It is difficult to know when they will introduce it; I do not think they have made up their minds yet as to when they will do so.  Also, when we enter the EEC we want to be sure that we are fully competitive with all the other countries.  By that I mean that we can export on a comparable basis with them and that our costs of production will not be higher than theirs.</P>
    <P>We have an enormous tourist potential totally unrealised so far and traffic should increase by about 100 per cent in the first couple of years of membership because of what we have to offer.  But if we put a tax around our necks which will raise the cost of living and increase the prices of those things the tourists will expect to get, if not cheaper, at least at prices comparable with prices in their own countries, the effect will be serious.  One must advise the Government to have second thoughts on value-added tax. Our petrol prices at present are very nearly the highest in Europe.  In my early days here we had the lowest prices in Europe.  I think we are now third in Europe as regards the cost of petrol. The prices of such things as alcohol and tobacco which previously were lower than in other countries have now reached a high level.  By introducing VAT when it is not obligatory to do so&mdash;we could go into the EEC with our turnover tax which is bad enough and our wholesale tax and nobody would say a word to us&mdash;we are following an entirely mistaken policy on the part of the Government.  It will alter the whole complexion of the country.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the attraction for tourists here is that in a sense we are different from any other country.  We are <Col N="249" /> entirely personal; we have small farmers and shopkeepers and people living on moderate means and a way of life quite different from that in other countries in the western world.  We shall wreck that, in my opinion, by introducing VAT.  We shall drive out of existence the country store and the small shopkeeper even in this city will disappear and we shall present a different image which will not help us in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I was glad to hear from Deputy O'Leary on behalf of the Labour Party that they fully accept the implications of the EEC.  I have a very strong suspicion that their spokesman on Foreign Affairs was always in favour of affiliation with Europe.  I may be mistaken but that is my impression gathered from his speech.  The benefits that will accrue to this country are enormous. Fundamentally, we are an agricultural country and the benefits fundamentally will come to agriculture.  If our agricultural industry is strong and completely solvent, if stable markets are guaranteed this country will prosper and progress.  The great curse of Irish agriculture in the past 50 years or more was that we had only one market and we had appalling fluctuations in prices of as much as £20 for a beast.  This will end.  Although the major part of our agricultural exports in the EEC will still go to the United Kingdom we shall have alternative markets and that very fact means that we are not dependent now on British buyers.</P>
    <P>If we go into Europe we must be fully European.  I have always found that there is a tendency for British parliamentarians, with whom we have numerous ties either by relationship in some cases or in trade and so on, to attempt to say that Ireland and the UK should think alike.  They will tell you that this is something common to both countries and that we should think and work alike on it.  I am a descendant of parliamentarians&mdash;we were not disbarred by Catholic emancipation&mdash;and all of my predecessors served in the public life of this country and long experience has taught me that a British parliamentarian never approaches an Irish parliamentarian <Col N="250" /> unless he wants something for his own country's good but this is not always for the good of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have many friends and wellwishers in Europe but they will not hand us everything on a plate.  We can play a full part there.  I believe a new era is opening for this country and I think, small though it is it will be able to play a vital part not only in Europe but in the political history of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate has been useful and practical.  Perhaps on Committee Stage we may be better able to argue how the Bill meets the needs of the situation and the problems raised by legislation which must be implemented and the amount of that legislation, at the same time giving control to this Parliament to an adequate and appropriate extent over measures taken here.  I say &ldquo; to an appropriate extent &rdquo; because Deputy Ryan based all his arguments against the facts of the situation that a Government with a majority in this Parliament, whatever Government it may be, can get through Parliament any measure it wants.</P>
      <P>This is true of any legislation and not just true of ministerial orders which may be adopted each year.  So that the legislation before the House now does not change in any way our system of majority rule in the Parliament and I do not think it would be desirable that it should do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it was a practical debate and the first point I take from Deputy O'Leary is that the Labour Party have through their spokesman here very clearly indicated that their present position dates from 11th May, the decision of the people, and that there is absolutely no looking back or no hesitation about their total commitment to making our structures here function in the context of European membership. The public decision would seem to make it unnecessary for us to argue the pros and cons of membership of Europe.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan said last night that we are not hearing about the benefits now.  It is my experience in Government for <Col N="251" /> about 13 years that once a decision is made all the arguments for it disappear and you have to deal with the arguments against it that persist.  But, all the arguments for membership of Europe still stand up and the alternatives which faced the public last May are so clearly different&mdash;the alternatives of being outside Europe or being a member.  The advantages and disadvantages can easily be listed again. There is no change in them.  I am not going to go into them but it would be doing a disservice to the public for any representative to suggest that the decision made by the public was the wrong one.  Once the public make it, it is the right one anyway.  I am as fully convinced as ever I was&mdash;now I have less anxiety because the decision is made&mdash;that the future of this country lies in membership of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is to deal with European legislation and how it is to be applied here.  The discussion gave rise, naturally, to how the European initiators of legislation can be influenced by this Parliament.  If I could take the matters to be dealt with by the Bill first, we should have definitions. A regulation of the European Community is one which applies to the whole Community; it is not for decision by any of the national Parliaments whether to apply it or not.  Last year about 90 per cent of the regulations were to do with the day to day running of the common agricultural policy.  The vast majority of them would have little interest for most Members if they were being passed in this country.  So that these regulations are not to be influenced by discussions in the Parliaments.  The directives of the Community are to be applied in the member States by whatever method the national governments or Parliaments choose to adopt and it is these directives which are concerned in the ministerial regulations which will be made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>I might go further and say that many of the directives can be implemented by administrative action alone, require no consultation here in any case, and many others will, I expect, <Col N="252" /> be able to be implemented by the Minister under existing legislation here under powers already given to the Minister by the Oireachtas.  And in some cases, as the Taoiseach has indicated, we will wish to implement directives of the Community here by Statute that will go to the House in the normal way of decision-making here.</P>
    <P>I could not forecast how many ministerial regulations will be required in any one future year.  These are regulations to implement what is left after we have excluded all I have spoken of.  It will depend on the volume of proposals coming from the European institutions and the number of these proposals on which the Council of Ministers make decisions. We feel that the number of ministerial regulations needed to be made in the near future will be about 70, that is, to give effect here to existing legislation in the Community.</P>

      <P>I am talking about ministerial regulations which will need to be made by Ministers here.  Before the Deputy got in I was making definitions. One of the problems about the matter Deputy Cruise-O'Brien raised was how do you get the Parliament involved.  The very first question for somebody who has sat through the whole debate is, how do you get individual Deputies knowing what we are talking about to each other and the definition I made at the beginning was of a regulation of the Community as distinct from a regulation made by a Minister here to implement Community directives.  The trouble is with the definitions.  I will start again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Call what the Minister does here an order, if you like, but he will be making regulations so as to implement the directives of the Community. The Community regulations themselves have direct application in the whole Community without the action of any Minister.  I say that last <Col N="254" /> year there were 2,900 regulations in the Community and there were 410 directives.  These 2,900 regulations have direct application in the six countries of the Community.  If we were a member they would have direct application here.  Of the 410 directives, these have to be translated into law in the individual countries.  Some are administrative and can be done without any ministerial regulation or order.  Others could be done under existing laws because the Minister has the power under existing laws.  In the case of others, we might decide to make a Statute here to implement them and the rest would be for ministerial regulation. This is where the word &ldquo;Regulation&rdquo; comes in the second time.  Our estimate is, without fixing it because it is something we know we do not know, that once you get over the number of regulations a Minister requires now for the period of entry, an average year would see about 20 ministerial regulations brought to this House.  It is a fairly small number of regulations.  I have a figure of statutory instruments under existing legislation. In 1971, there were 350 instruments of that nature brought through here.  So, we will have 20 extra in relation to the Communities.</P>
      <P>On the safeguards, the section which provides that the ministerial regulations will cease to have effect unless they are confirmed by Acts of the Oireachtas not later than the end of the year following the one in which they were made gives a very strong safeguard because it means the ministerial regulations will lapse if the Oireachtas does not pass them.  It allows for debate but, as Deputy Ryan has pointed out, there will have to be a majority decision situation.</P>

      <P>They will.  The directive is to implement a certain legislative matter, choosing one's own way in doing it.  The Deputies are afraid the Minister may choose a way that is undesirable. It was on that point that the Taoiseach said that there would be access to the Courts to challenge if the <Col N="255" /> Minister took powers he should not take.  However, we will have an opportunity on the other stages of the Bill to argue this matter.</P>
      <P>It is accepted by the House that the work that would be involved, in addition to what the House is doing already, would create a situation which would prevent the House from functioning if we tried to do it through the normal procedures.  It has been suggested that we might have a committee and the matter was mentioned by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach referred to a committee in Germany which was set up for the purpose of vetting Community legislation.  However, there was such an enormous volume that even that committee has become incapable of sorting it out.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out that the number of Community documents which have a political content is small. They mostly deal with administrative, day-to-day functions.  For example, 90 per cent of such documents last year dealt with the common agricultural policy.  We must try to ensure some way of ascertaining the items that have a political content.  I might mention that the Taoiseach has invited the heads of the other parties and whoever they might wish to have with them to sit with him and try to find a way of getting this House in a position to deal with these matters.  It is not a matter of not wishing the House to be in on the picture but to devise a method whereby the House might deal with these matters without bringing the business of the House to a halt.  I do not know what will be the outcome of the meeting. We are entering it with an open mind seeking a solution of the problem but in the meantime, as has been pointed out, Question Time, Questions on the Adjournment, Private Members' Motions and the normal procedures of the House are available in addition to the debate every two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think when Deputies spoke about methods of dealing with these matters and of the restructuring of the House they were thinking of the Community regulations which are directly applicable and in which this House would <Col N="256" /> have no decision.  At the present time in theory Members sent to the European Parliament would be involved in this matter but it is possible that the stage of development of the European Parliament and its powers are not sufficiently developed to make people here satisfied that there is adequate democratic control over regulations.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that people who go from here should be well acquainted with these matters and give their attention to the European Parliament and this requires that in some way they be protected in their home constituencies. The proportional representation form of elections here doubles the risks for any man who may leave his constituency for a considerable length of time even though he may be doing valuable work in Europe.  This would be an inhibiting factor in the minds of many Deputies who would be capable and willing to take up the role of having as big an influence as possible from the democratic base on the decisions made in Europe.</P>
    <P>The initiatives for regulations and other legislation comes from the Commission and the Commission is now being formed.  The appointment of each member will be by the European governments and there will not be any conflict with regard to his interest in his own country.  He will have to keep in close contact with the Government of his own country and I expect that the political appointments in the Commission will bring a new element of political consideration into the initiating process.</P>
    <P>The decision-making will be by the Council of Ministers.  Like every other country we will have one representative in that Council.  The present method of decision making by the Council is that they do not take any decision that is contrary to the vital interests of a member country.  Having regard to the present stage of development of the powers of the Parliament and our experience of it and since all our energies will be taken up with adjustment, from our point of view a most satisfactory arrangement at the present time is to have the powers with the Council of Ministers in which will <Col N="257" /> be one member of the Government here who will be responsible to this Parliament while he is Foreign Minister.</P>
    <P>It is an interim situation.  Along the way we can see the development of the European Parliament in which the Commission would be subject to the democratic process at some stage but we must travel that road first and create interim structures.  The interim arrangement which exists is adequate and suits the position of this small country.  In the long run, the development of the institutions in the Community are much more important for a small country than for a large one. The Taoiseach's support of this development and the strengthening of Parliament at the summit reflects our policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the other parties have given any thought to the setting up of structures.  From speeches that have been made here one would think it is entirely up to the Government. Members of the Dáil and Seanad must do a great deal more reading than has been done up to now.  Sometimes when people say Ireland will have to work harder they think it applies only to manual workers.  Everyone in the country will have to give more thought and do much more reading and studying of all these matters than they have done up to now.  What the Government can do to help in this regard is to make documentation available to Deputies. We hope that in time we will be better acquainted with definitions of directives and regulations, and where the process can be influenced whether through the Government in this Parliament, through the Foreign Minister or the Irish Members of the European Parliament.  We will require individual Deputies to study in greater detail all these documents.  Having said that I should like to say that for the past three years I have had a committee in the Fianna Fáil Party helping me in my work as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  It is an EEC committee really. I do not know if the other parties have done that.</P>

      <P>From our point of view it is a very effective basis on which we could extend the consideration of the political implications of membership of the European Communities.  If the other parties want any lessons on this, I am sure the chairman of our party committee would be able to give advice.</P>
      <P>Having said that I think the parties should set up structures of their own. I want to repeat that the Taoiseach wants to meet the leaders of the other parties to get down to dealing adequately with this problem.  I was glad to hear Deputy Cruise-O'Brien saying he saw the necessity for the Executive decision-making process not to be interfered with.  This is a problem too. We have to so adjust ourselves as to make it possible to make decisions and sustain action while bringing Parliament into full consultation.</P>
      <P>That is the practical part of what I have to deal with.  I did not intend to make a speech about Europe.  What is quite clear from this seat now is that some Members here are going into Europe with the idea that it is an unchangeable bureaucracy which will be making decisions and against which we will be battering our heads.  We will, of course, like the British, the French, the Germans and all the others, have to accept rules of general application within the area confined by the treaties signed in the Communities. Perhaps more than others, with so much new in our own country, in our own State, we should be considering what new structures could be set up in the world in this evolution of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Summit shifted from the economic bureaucratic idea to a Europe of people, a Europe built for the benefit of its citizens.  Entering into Europe we should be thinking in a more positive way of how we can so structure it as to preserve to the fullest extent liberties and individual rights while improving the standard of living.  Again, all these are aims set out in the Treaty of Rome.  We can have a very special role to play in making sure that Europe, as it develops, <Col N="259" /> will be something new in the world and something worth working for.</P>
    <P>At present it is hard to raise enthusiasm for a loyalty to Brussels. There is no conflict in my mind between our national loyalties, our parish loyalties, the loyalties we understand, and our well-being within the European Communities.  It is for us to find for our people, and for other people, reasons why individual people should feel a loyalty to Europe as a concept.  This requires a great deal of imaginative thinking and a great deal of dedication to finding a role for Europe in the world and finding a personality for Europe which will please the individual citizens of the nine countries now involved.  We might be specially placed to contribute there.</P>
    <P>To get back to the Bill, I hope that on Committee Stage we will be able to find a way to bring the democratic process of this Dáil into consideration in the decision making which has to be done by this country in consequence of the decision of the people to join Europe.  Perhaps before the taking of Committee Stage the leaders of the two other parties may have made their contact with the Taoiseach and have had their first meeting about how later consultations in relation to European legislation can be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £87,067,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending <Col N="261" /> on the 31st day of March, 1973, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
    <P>The net estimate for Social Welfare for the current year as set out in the Estimates Volume is £87,067,000.  This represents an increase of £11,818,000 over the original estimate for the year 1971-72.  The amounts shown for 1971-72 against the different subheads of the Vote include the additional provision for that year made by way of Supplementary Estimate, and are therefore not comparable with this year's figures.  We will need a Supplementary Estimate later this year to provide for the cost of the rate increases and other improvements following from this year's budget.</P>
    <P>The figure of £87,067,000 which I have mentioned is the amount which the Exchequer will have to provide for the social welfare services.  To arrive at the total expenditure on these services it is necessary to take into account expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund, the Occupational Injuries Fund, <i>et cetera</i>.  On this basis, and applying the new rates of payment, total expenditure is running at a rate of about £170 million a year. As the increased rates of payment arising from this year's legislation will not operate for the full financial year, expenditure in 1972-73 will not reach this figure; it will in fact be about £154 million.</P>
    <P>The main reason for the increased expenditure in 1972-73 as compared with 1971-72 is that the 1971 budget increases are payable for the full 12 months in the current year as against eight months and six months for assistance and insurance services respectively in 1971-72.  I do not think it necessary to go through the figures for the different subheads of the Vote, particularly as these will fall to be increased by a Supplementary Estimate to allow for the 1972 budget increases. If Deputies have any questions on the specific provision under any subhead I will, of course, give them the information they require as far as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> It may be helpful to Deputies if I make some comments on our social welfare system generally.  In developed countries it is accepted that nine major benefits should be provided by the social security system.  These cover sickness, invalidity, unemployment, old age, widowhood, occupational injury, maternity, family allowances and medical care.  The last-mentioned service is the responsibility of the Minister for Health, but the other eight are provided for in the social security system administered by my Department.  On the insurance side we have unemployment, disability, maternity, marriage and occupational injuries benefit together with retirement, invalidity, widows' and orphans' and old age contributory pensions.</P>
    <P>On the assistance side we have old age and widows' and orphans' non-contributory pensions, deserted wife's allowance, unemployment assistance and children's allowances.  In addition we have other services which are not generally available elsewhere, such as free travel, free electricity, and free television licences.  Accordingly, it must be accepted that we have broadly as comprehensive a spread of services as any other country.  While our insurance coverage is not as wide as that found in many European countries, we cater under our assistance schemes for those not included under social insurance.</P>
    <P>I have frequently expressed the hope that it will be possible to abolish the existing limit of £1,600 for insurability of non-manual workers and thus bring all employees within the scope of compulsory social insurance.  The question of covering the self-employed against certain contingencies is a matter which is also being considered.  This raises a number of issues in an economy like ours where the proportion of self-employed is relatively very high.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, having regard to some Dáil questions on social security over the past few years, that certain Deputies are still under a misapprehension in relation to the matter of social security in the EEC and in particular in relation to our position on entry.  I have tried to clarify the position in reply to questions and in the course of <Col N="263" /> debates, but perhaps it would be useful to summarise the position once more.  In the first place there is no uniform system of social security operating throughout the area comprising the EEC.  Each member country has its own system, which it is free to develop in the directions it considers most appropriate to its own circumstances.  Thus we may find in one country a particularly well developed family allowances scheme, in another the emphasis may be on pension schemes, and so on.  It follows that there is no European standard to which we will be obliged to conform on entry.  The fact, however, that we will be part of a community of nine nations working in collaboration in the field of social policy will undoubtedly foster a tendency towards harmonisation, if only as a result of each member studying and learning from the others' arrangements.  The Community has adopted regulations dealing with the social security of migrant workers.  These are binding on member states and will of course apply to us.  I explained the provisions of these regulations in detail in the course of the debate on membership of the EEC in March last.  Briefly, the purpose is to ensure that when a person moves from one country to another he carries with him his acquired rights to social security and will, therefore, not be at a disadvantage because of migration. So far as Irish workers are concerned these provisions will, in general, be much more favourable than the existing reciprocal arrangements.  To take one example, children's allowances are not covered at all under the existing arrangements, whereas under the EEC regulations the allowances will be paid by the country in which a worker is employed even though his children may be resident in his home country.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have legislation each year to give effect to improvements in our social welfare schemes affords the House regular opportunities for debating social welfare policy. The frequency of these debates may, however, tend to prevent us from realising just how appreciable are the <Col N="264" /> advances made over a long period.  For instance over approximately the last ten years major new schemes have been introduced covering contributory old age pensions, occupational injuries insurance, invalidity and retirement pensions, allowances for deserted wives, allowances for incapacitated pensioners and others over 70, free travel, free electricity and free television licences.  The duration of unemployment benefit was extended from 156 to 312 days, the minimum age limit for entitlement to widow's non-contributory pension was removed and payment in respect of dependent children was extended to all such children where it had previously been confined to two.  There were many other improvements in the schemes, all designed to remove hardships that came to light in the course of the ordinary day-to-day administration.</P>
    <P>These extensions and improvements in the services, together with the regular increases in rates of payment, have naturally brought about a spectacular growth in expenditure on the social welfare services.  In 1963-64 total expenditure, including administration, came to about £45½ million, of which the Exchequer met just over £31 million. For the current year it is estimated that total expenditure, including the cost in this year of the latest increases, will be approximately £154 million, of which £96 million will fall on the Exchequer.  Total expenditure has thus grown by about 238 per cent between 1963-64 and 1972-73.  It is significant, too, that the rate of increase has accelerated in recent years.  Between 1963-64 and 1967-68 expenditure increased from £45½ million to over £68 million, an increase of 50 per cent, whereas the increase of £85½ million between 1967-68 and the current year represents an increase of 125 per cent. Total expenditure as a percentage of GNP increased from 5.4 per cent in 1963-64 to 7 per cent in 1971-72.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the cost of the assistance services is borne by the Exchequer, while employers, employees, and the State contribute towards the cost of the insurance services.  Of the total income of my Department 19 per cent comes <Col N="265" /> from employers, 16 per cent from insured persons and slightly over 63 per cent from the Exchequer.  The balance comes from investment income and from certain local authorities.  Of every £1 spent in the year ended 31st March, 1972, 30.6 pence was spent on old age, blind and retirement pensions, 16.8 pence on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, 17.4 pence on disability, marriage, maternity and treatment benefit and invalidity pensions, 13 pence on children's allowances, 14.1 pence on widows' and orphans' pensions, 1.3 pence on occupational injuries benefit, 2.3 pence on miscellaneous services including deserted wives' and old age (care) allowances, and 4.5 pence on administration, including the cost of services rendered by other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>In the year 1971-72 civil proceedings for the recovery of arrears of contributions were initiated in 355 cases.  Decrees were obtained in all cases which came for hearing in that period.  In the same year prosecutions for offences were commenced against 142 employers.  Of the cases heard in the year, convictions were obtained in 134 instances.  Fifty-seven persons were prosecuted for fraud in relation to social welfare payments, the most common type of fraud relating to claiming unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance while working.</P>
    <P>The Department is a member of the International Social Security Association, an organisation with members in 100 countries throughout the world. Officers of the Department attend periodical meetings of the association and take part also in the work of the Council of Europe as members of committees of experts dealing with social security.  Membership of organisations such as these is, in my view, very valuable in enabling us to keep abreast of developments in social security throughout the world.  I have myself taken part in a number of meetings of Ministers responsible for social welfare matters and have found them of much benefit.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that Deputies have the opportunity of discussing social welfare matters each year <Col N="266" /> when the Bill implementing budget improvements is before the House. In addition, we have a Supplementary Estimate each year to provide the money required for these improvements. Accordingly, it is hardly necessary for me to go into greater detail in explanation of an Estimate which I am certain Deputies will be prepared to accept.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed with the lack of information in the Minister's opening speech because this Estimate is the only real opportunity the House has of discussing the problems of the poorer sections of our community. For far too long social welfare recipients have been neglected.  There is one specific matter I should like to emphasise.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>I have frequently expressed the hope that it will be possible to abolish the existing limit of £1,600 for insurability of non-manual workers and thus bring all employees within the scope of compulsory social insurance.</P>
      <P>This is overdue.  It is almost 20 years since an inter-Party Government issued a White Paper on this particular matter.  Because of the present rampant inflation and because of wages chasing prices there are people now moving outside the limit of insurable employment.  This creates a problem for them.  I welcome the Minister's decision in this.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to our social welfare benefits in the context of the EEC.  There is a certain amount of confusion.  There are people, particularly small farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance or what is commonly known as the small farmers' dole, who are under the impression that once we go into the EEC on 1st January next they will lose these benefits.  I am glad the Minister has referred to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has also said that in the context of the EEC we do not have to harmonise our social welfare benefits with those of other member <Col N="267" /> States.  Surely there is an obligation on us to ensure that our benefits will compare favourably with those of other member States.  In regard to children's allowances, old age pensions, contributory and non-contributory, there is a wide gap to be bridged.  Therefore we cannot ignore social welfare benefits in the context of the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>I said at the outset that this is an opportunity to discuss the problems of the less well-off sections of the community.  I wish to draw the Minister's attention to some complaints I have received.  Such complaints have been raised time and time again but no action seems to be taken.  The maximum non-contributory pension is £5.15.  If a book is recalled for investigation, weeks go by before the book is reissued and it takes as long again before arrears are paid.  In one case where a book was recalled a person in receipt of a non-contributory old age pension had to wait for ten weeks before the book was reissued. This is unfair and I cannot understand the reason for it.  I know there can be some difficulties but nothing would justify taking that length of time to investigate a case and keeping an old age pensioner without any income during that period. I have heard from other Deputies of cases where people had to wait longer, in some cases even for months.  The allowance is small enough and therefore it is necessary to have it paid weekly.  I would ask the Minister to investigate this in order to alleviate some of the hardship.</P>
    <P>When people with a business or a farm come to the age of 70 years they often wish to make a normal family settlement.  Application is made for an old age pension and I have seen a number of applicants turned down because the investigating officer is suspicious that the settlement is made for pension purposes.  This should not arise.  We should be encouraging people who own farms to transfer them to members of their family.  In many cases people will continue as owners of a farm for far too long.  We should encourage them to transfer the <Col N="268" /> farm because this will lead to better farming, in the first instance, and will benefit the family considerably.  I know the pension officer, under the Department's regulations, has to say in his report that, in his opinion, it is for pension purposes, but under question by the pension sub-committee of which I am a member he will agree that it is natural to have these family settlements.  I hope the Minister will take note of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>There are many problems in connection with our social welfare benefits, the greatest being that the amount is totally inadequate.  If we are realistic about solving this problem it is necessary to determine once and for all the amount that is necessary to keep a person in existence for a week, because this is the only guideline for providing adequate social welfare benefits.  There is no doubt that the reform of social welfare is far too low a priority.  It is a terrible state of affairs that people who have given a lifetime of service to the State should be asked to depend on such a meagre allowance. Social Welfare is the one thing that has not kept abreast with the rising cost of living, not to mention the standard of living.  For example, in the year 1965-66 the non-contributory old age pension was £2.30; the contributory pension was £2.62½.  Today the non-contributory pension is £5.15, and the contributory is £5.60.  Could we stop for a moment and ask by how much the cost of living has increased since 1965-66; how much have we bothered to examine the cost of living for these people?  One has only to think of the various items of food.  Take meat, for example.  By how much has it risen since then?  Such small items as potatoes have risen by over 100 per cent since 1965-66.  Apples, cabbage, all kinds of food, have risen from 120 to 143 per cent.  Have we increased the benefits to those who are in receipt of social welfare by that amount?  The greater part of the income of those in receipt of social welfare benefits is spent on food.  They cannot afford the luxuries of life.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is necessary to establish what it would take just to keep a person in existence for a week.  Surely <Col N="269" /> nobody should have an income of under £10 a week at present?  This is necessary if we are to treat with Christian charity people who have given a service to the country.  We know that it costs between £10 and £13 a week to keep a person in an institution. We have not yet realised that many people, because of the inadequacy of their incomes, are forced to go into our already overcrowded institutions.  Because of the way we have treated our old age pensioners and others we have added to this problem of overcrowded institutions.  This is what we must avoid.  We should increase allowances so as to enable and encourage people to look after the aged at home.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in a number of voluntary organisations dealing with the aged.  These organisations provide recreational facilities, meals on wheels and many other things for these people. Great credit is due to them.  They got very little assistance or encouragement from the State or from local authorities until recently.  In my own town there are associations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, geriatric societies and people who are in charge of meals on wheels.  If it were not for the service given by voluntary organisations many more of our aged and infirm would be in institutions.  It is necessary to determine a national minimum income so that we will not have people on the poverty line.</P>
    <P>We have heard much from Government Deputies and Ministers, and I think there was a White Paper issued by the Inter-Party Government some years ago on the question of reducing the qualifying age for old age pensions. This would be very desirable but I would be far more concerned with dealing adequately with those who are in receipt of pensions at present.  I would not widen the net and commit more people to a lower income even though it probably is necessary to reduce the qualifying age.</P>
    <P>There have been fringe benefits provided for pensioners which are very much appreciated.  They were overdue. I refer to free travel, free electricity and television licences.  Many pensioners <Col N="270" /> have television and travel more than they would otherwise do because of these concessions.  This is helping those people in a small way.</P>
    <P>We have heard about pay-related benefits.  I am sure the Minister will be introducing a Bill in the House shortly to deal with this.  It should not be delayed. It is very desirable to widen the net and accommodate more people in social insurance.  I refer to self-employed people, particularly to farmers. This is very necessary.  As far as unemployment assistance for small farmers is concerned, whoever drew the boundaries must be crazy.  The poorest part of my constituency is omitted and the people there are not entitled to unemployment assistance. The Minister should review the areas.</P>
    <P>Home assistance is something that must be changed.  It is a demoralising thing.  I do not want to condemn home assistance officers.  They are doing a good job although some of them are probably not sufficiently trained.  If a mother of a family suddenly becomes a widow she does not qualify immediately for widow's pension.  It takes some time before her case is investigated. The widow must go along to the home assistance officer and look for home assistance until such time as the Department have investigated her claim and granted her a widow's pension.  This is demoralising.  The same applies to children of a widow who qualify under the free boots scheme and the free milk scheme operated by the local authority.  I cannot see the justification for making children submit themselves for examination to qualify for free boots.  Why not pay them an allowance so that they could buy boots rather than have to go to a home assistance officer.  This creates second-class children in our schools and playing fields and it should be got rid of immediately.  It belongs to a different age.  We should be more sophisticated and more Christian in our approach to people who are in need.  The Minister should tackle this immediately.</P>
    <P>We were informed that there would be a reorganisation, an integration of the home assistance officers and the officers investigating claims. <Col N="271" /> You can have a situation where the pension officer investigates an application and because the amount provided by the Department is not sufficient the home assistance officer must go along some time later to investigate the same case.  If people qualify for rates relief the rate collector carries out a somewhat similar investigation. Surely this is not necessary? Surely the fact that people are old age pensioners or in receipt of social welfare benefits should be sufficient to satisfy the county manager or the rate collector that they are entitled to a remission of rates?  Thousands of cases are investigated by three different officers.  These are the poorest people in our community and to be subjected to such investigations is an embarrassment to them.</P>
    <P>This reminds me of another matter, which I heard the Minister mention when he introduced his previous Estimate, and it is something I feel strongly about.  Admittedly, as long as the present system remains cases will have to be investigated by the pensions officer.  We accept this.  On our pensions committees we have ten or 12 local people passing judgment on the applications and claims of their neighbours.  If somebody is not satisfied with the committee or the amount awarded to the applicant there will be a full investigation and the applicant's means and the family settlements will be thrown open to discussion.  I have heard these matters discussed in pubs.  I think it is time these committees were abolished.  The Minister should examine this matter. There should be some buffer between the Department and the applicant, some system under which the applicant's means would not be discussed in public.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>In the case where an applicant has reached the qualifying age for a pension and the question of means is in dispute between the applicant and the Department's officials, there should be some system by which the applicant could get a hearing with an official or an appeals officer present to examine the case and by which the applicant or somebody selected by <Col N="272" /> him, a solicitor or otherwise, would be present to give evidence or handle the case.  I do not agree with the pension committee system.  These committees have no function beyond examining and ascertaining means. The pensions officer will attend meetings if requested to do so.  As one who has attended almost one meeting per month since I was elected to Cork County Council I say this.  If the pension officer brings in his recommendation, can the committee change it? They can discuss it with him but it will not be altered.  To my mind the committee has no function and has no power to change the decision that is already made even by bringing new information to light.  My experience is that the pensions officer will not change his recommendation.  He is obliged to open the file and discuss with the committee full details of the applicant's means and family settlements&mdash;a daughter getting £1,000 and, perhaps, a son getting £2,000, and so on, how the farm is distributed &mdash;and this is recited for the benefit of the applicant's neighbours.</P>
    <P>There should be a much more sophisticated method of determining what an applicant is entitled to get. Perhaps it could be by means of an oral hearing with an appeals officer present.  They do it behind closed doors in any case.  If an officer makes a recommendation and if the applicant appeals the decision is made behind closed doors and the applicant takes whatever amount is given.  Could the Minister examine this position and suggest some alternative?  This is something that should have been done long ago.  The views I am expressing are the views of many members of committees.  I think this is a matter of urgency and I should like the Minister, when replying, to say if he has any suggestions.</P>
    <P>We have different groups of people &mdash;this may not be entirely relevant&mdash; including politicians talking about reunification which is very desirable but we are asking people in the Six Counties to accept a much lower standard of living.  I think the children's allowances are three or four times greater there than what is paid <Col N="273" /> here.  By these allowances you could provide more benefits for a section that would derive great advantage from them, the younger people.  The children of today will be the men and women of tomorrow.  Children who grow up in neglect and poverty will be a liability.  Families here are twice as large as they are in Britain and where children are in want and undernourished they will not be able later on to contribute to the State to the same extent as children who grow up in plenty.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances should be increased considerably immediately. This would benefit the weakest section of the community.  Do we realise the cost of bringing up a family?  I think we do not realise the cost of young children, their clothes and shoes and the many demands they entail for the widow with three or four of them on an income of less than £10 per week. It is impossible to make ends meet with the amount provided.  In my experience in the majority of cases it is the mothers who draw the children's allowances and where there is an irresponsible father, or an alcoholic, if the children's allowances were raised considerably it would help the homes and particularly widows rearing families under most difficult circumstances. I hope the Minister will tackle this problem which is a long-standing one.</P>
    <P>I have seen a number of employers who do not stamp cards for employees but I have never seen a prosecution. I have known workers who found when they applied for benefit that their cards were not stamped.  I have made representations to the Department and I got acknowledgments but I have never been informed whether the employer was compelled to stamp cards or not.  Not long ago resolutions were passed by at least two local authorities in County Cork bringing this problem to the notice of the Department.  If employers get away with not stamping cards it is wrong. They should be compelled to stamp workers' cards.</P>

      <P>I have known a few of them and I am waiting for action to be taken.  I have not seen it taken and I have waited for the most of 12 months.  If it is discovered that an employer has not stamped cards, is not a year a long period before the offender is brought to court?</P>
      <P>It is the Government's job to try to create more wealth in the country and, having created it, it is also their job to see that it is equitably distributed and that the weaker section should benefit more.  The situation is rapidly developing that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed by the amount of information the Minister has given us.  Admittedly, Deputies have an opportunity when the Budget is introduced to discuss social welfare payments. One regrettable aspect of the Budget is that payments passed in April do not reach the beneficiaries until the following October and in some cases the following January. This aspect of the Budget should be examined in view of the fact that by the time the increased payments are received the benefit has been eroded by the increases in the cost of living which have taken place in the meantime. I do not understand why the poorer sections of the community are treated in the way they are.  It should be realised that there are problems arising out of social welfare which must be solved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather like Deputy Creed, I am afraid I must start by saying that I do not find the information supplied in the Minister's introductory statement to be adequate.  His speech illustrates the degree of self-satisfaction, complacency, existing not only in the Cabinet but in the country in regard to social welfare and social security.  Why should the Minister's speech be so brief?  I could legitimately ask for an explanation as to why notes made available by the Minister to Fianna Fáil Deputies in relation to this Estimate are more extensive than was the Minister's speech to the House.  One must protest and seek from the Minister an explanation as to the circulation of private notes to individual Fianna Fáil Deputies <Col N="275" /> through the Fianna Fáil Whip's office. I would ask if this is in accordance with the best traditions of the House.</P>
      <P>In the case of the Estimates for the Department of Transport and Power, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, notably, the Department of Health, the respective Ministers traditionally provide every Deputy with background notes and information.  I must strongly protest that on this occasion it would seem that background notes and information on the Department of Social Welfare have been circulated through the Fianna Fáil Whip's office to Fianna Fáil Deputies only.  I do not want to pursue that matter further beyond asking the Minister at this stage to clarify the position.  I shall not be able to conclude my contribution until next week as the debate will be adjourned at 2.30 today. I should like to have the maximum possible information before concluding my speech.  I do not in any way hold the staff responsible for this matter.  This is a piece of Fianna Fáil practice which should be questioned here and now.  I would ask the Minister directly if I also as Labour Party spokesman on Social Welfare, may have a copy of these notes.</P>

      <P>I gather that other notes have been made on that matter. I am talking specifically about social welfare.  We are entitled to protest at this practice.  In Britain it is the practice to circulate to all Members of Parliament detailed background information. Here the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Health and the Department of Transport and Power provide such information for Deputies and we get a volume of background information each year from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  I would hope that this matter would be cleared up between now and next Thursday or Friday when discussion of this Estimate is resumed.  I intend to raise the matter again.  All Deputies are entitled to receive the same basic information from Departmental sources.  I make that point by way of illustration of the inadequacy of the Minister's four- or five-page contribution to the House.</P>
      <P>I am gratified that the Minister has dealt with the question of our social security system on our entry into the European Economic Community.  I agree with a great deal of what he says but I would go much further.  It is quite correct that the treaty does not specifically provide for harmonisation of social security systems and that, accordingly, our membership would not entail any direct obligation being undertaken by us to modify our system. As a statement of fact, that is supportable. However, we must have regard to the long-term implications of our accession to the EEC in regard to the harmonisation of our social security system with the systems operated by the other eight member States.  The resources of the European Social Fund will be available to us to assist in the expansion of our retraining and resettlement schemes, under the Department of Labour.  I would hope that under a restructuring of Government Departments the European Social Fund would come under the ambit of a Minister for Social Affairs.  I hope that we would no longer have a Minister for Social Welfare as such, which is a rather outdated concept, to say the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also to take into account <Col N="277" /> in the context of EEC membership the implications of the Protocol concerning Ireland signed by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Hillery.  This Protocol calls on the Community institutions to use all the financial means at their disposal to assist us in achieving our policy of economic development.  In that context I would avail of the financial resources of the Community institutions to enable us to develop further our social security system.  I place the broadest interpretation on the Community protocol.  I have been quite critical of the content of the protocol and I regard it as rather nebulous in its attitude towards this country.  The Taoiseach and Deputy Dr. Hillery accepted it too readily without amendment to give it more teeth.  We should avail of whatever financial assistance is forthcoming to us arising out of the protocol in order to improve our social security system.</P>
    <P>During the referendum campaign the Government were extremely careful to point out that there was no direct obligation on this country to harmonise our social security system with that of the EEC.  Nevertheless great play was made of the fact that social security benefits were higher both in Britain and in the EEC and we would, therefore, in this country be expected to receive a much higher share of the benefits.  Between now and the next general election, which I presume will be next May, some of the extremist propaganda of the EEC referendum should be put to the test in the context of restructuring and modernising our social security system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today that there is no uniform system of social security operating throughout the area comprising the EEC.  I agree with him on that point.  There has been a little too much loose talk in fashionable social security circles about the wonders of EEC social security.  While we must level up and broadly bring our social security system into context with the EEC, I agree with the Minister that the complexity of their systems is not appreciated in this country.  The Minister this morning warned us in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="278" /> It is very difficult to make comparisons in regard to the social security system in this country and those in the EEC countries.  It is extremely dangerous for any politician in any country to make any kind of sweeping generalisation about the EEC social security systems.  This is well illustrated in a document which the Department forwarded to me at my request, the EEC publication, comparative tables of the social security systems in the member States, the sixth edition of July, 1970.  It was quite evident from a cursory examination of that document that as yet there is no harmonisation between the systems in the different countries of the Six and it is likely that there will not be in the Community of the Nine.</P>
    <P>It must be pointed out to the policy formulators in the different political parties in relation to social security in this country that the social security systems of the Six and of the Nine have all grown up independent of each other.  The principal point of comparison is that they have spent and are spending vastly more money and vastly more of the gross national product than we are in the sphere of social policy.  I detected a note of pride in the Minister's voice when he assured us that the total expenditure on social welfare in this country as a percentage of GNP had increased to 7 per cent in 1972 from 5.4 per cent in 1963-64.  If one takes Luxembourg, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands into account one finds that they are spending between 14 per cent and 17 per cent of GNP on social welfare.  The statistics for 1969-70 show that at least 13 per cent to 16 per cent is spent and we are in the region of 7 per cent.  Therefore, it is necessary that we should spend an increasing proportion of our GNP on social security.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he states that comparisons are extremely dangerous to make, generalisations are extremely dangerous to make and also comparisons in relation to GNP expenditure are extremely dangerous to make.  While a lot of statistics are available in this country and in the EEC in relation to social security expenditure, <Col N="279" /> a great deal depends on what one is talking about.  There are so many qualifying footnotes in relation to the social provisions of the Six that only the propagandists are inclined to discard them when talking about social security in the EEC.</P>
    <P>We have an advantage in this country which many of the EEC countries do not have.  We tend to have a national system of social security.  It is highly inadequate and rather outdated and I would say that it is suffering from the old age of one political party running it for 15 years.  I would not care to live in Italy where they have six different national bodies responsible for different aspects of national insurance.  In France I believe they have three different systems of national insurance.  Many countries have individual, separate systems entirely for individual, occupations.  The mining industry, for example, has a complete system of its own.  Therefore there is no universally operable system within the Six and very little of what I would call centralised administration. We in this country at least have the benefits of that and I do not think we should be unduly apprehensive about learning a great deal from the Six or the Nine or Eight. I do not think we should be unduly apprehensive about trying to harmonise our system with that of the Six and we would be undertaking a far more fruitful political exercise if we were to attempt to harmonise ourselves in the first instance with Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>While I will deal more extensively next week with the subject, I want to make one comment on it and to use the phrase quite deliberately that it was total, sheer and brass hypocrisy on the part of the Taoiseach when he suggested in <i>Der Spiegel</i> that there would be very little difficulty in harmonising social security in the Republic with that of Northern Ireland in the context of a united Ireland. For international neck the Taoiseach deserves the prize of the year in relation to making a specious statement of that nature.  It is very important to point out that in the context <Col N="280" /> of national unity, the cost to Britain of maintaining its existing social security levels and benefits in the North means that they would have to continue a payment of about £100 million a year, leaving aside our up-levelling social security contributions in the Republic. In the 1971-72 financial year, financial transfers from the UK to Northern Ireland alone in relation to health services amounted to £20 million, in relation to family allowances and supplementary benefits, £37 million, in relation to transfers to national insurance funds, £15 million and towards additional unemployment premiums, £10¾ million.  Taking these items alone, they total almost £83 million in transfers from Britain, just to give Northern Ireland its current British standard of social security. Does the Taoiseach seriously suggest that we take over that almost £100 million?</P>
    <P>Then we have the cost of raising the Republic's social security benefits to UK levels which are operative now in Northern Ireland.  This has been estimated by the most authoritative, the most conservative and most rational economist and social quantifier in Britain and Ireland as being not less than £140 million a year.  I would like to know where the Taoiseach proposes to find the £240 million per annum to bring about the elimination of what one might call the major social barrier as between North and South in the context of a united Ireland.  Even the most cursory glance at the current situation shows that if the Republic were to do that as of now we would have to raise taxation in this country by not less than 6s in the £ overnight. That is on current levels of taxation. It would represent a 30 per cent rise in our tax burden as of now and I do not think anybody wants to see taxation running at a level of 50 per cent of our gross domestic product as our rates of taxation are high enough at the moment.  The Taoiseach is trying to play a kind of three-card trick by saying that we will pay more in the Republic, that Britain, of course, will have to pay more and not only will Britain have to hand over the Six Counties but she will have to pay a <Col N="281" /> bloody fine, fat sum of £50 million to £100 million for the privilege of handing them over.  All that means is that we are living in a kind of Fianna Fáil cloud-cuckoo land.</P>
    <P>Family allowances in Northern Ireland are twice what they are in the Republic.  To quote a personal example, recently I met an unfortunate ex-internee from Long Kesh who is now living in Dublin and living here because, being an ex-internee, he regards himself as having a death warrant out for him after his release if he dares return to Northern Ireland. He is a man who was involved in the civil rights movement on the streets and had nothing whatever to do with either the Provisional IRA or the Official IRA.  He is a young Belfast man, a leader of one of the rent strikers, who is now in Dublin working for £26 or £28 a week.  He has children's allowance for his three children in Dublin.  The family are coming to live in Dublin.  When it dawned on him after an hour's discussion I had with him in relation to what children's allowances he would get&mdash;exactly what I am getting; I think it is somethings over £4 a month&mdash;and when he discovered that he would have no supplementary benefits allowance, no supplementary benefit on unemployment assistance, if he became unemployed in Dublin, no general domestic assistance in terms of assistance towards payment of rent and so on he had a few caustic things to say about the Republic of Ireland and about national unity.  He is an Irishman who did 12 months in Long Kesh, because of his entirely legitimate civil rights activity &mdash;I draw that distinction in his case&mdash; and was imprisoned by Brian Faulkner, being one of those unfortunate Irishmen who did not think he was going to be interned&mdash;most of the boys who knew got out quickly enough&mdash;and on that basis when I discussed a united Ireland with him, he was not thinking in the terms in which the Taoiseach spoke.</P>
    <P>These are the hard realities of Irish life today and certainly there is a great need for explicit discussion in this community not merely in terms of Ireland and entry into the EEC, but <Col N="282" /> Ireland in the context of the people living together not just in reconciliation and peace, not just in the context of not murdering one another but in the context of sharing equal standards of living and equal standards of social benefits.</P>
    <P>Therefore I suggest that while considering the role of Ireland in the EEC the House must also address itself to the problem of harmonising our social security system with that of Northern Ireland and Britain, and I would point out to the House regarding the financing of our social security system that the State provides here more than two-thirds of the cost compared with less than half in the United Kingdom.  This is one of the greatest difficulties facing us in the matter of financing social security in the context of EEC membership where the percentage provided by the State varies from 7 per cent in the Netherlands to 22 per cent in Belgium and Germany&mdash;a notable difference of which we must be aware.</P>
    <P>In France and Italy the State bears two-thirds of the cost of social welfare and in Belgium the employers bear half the cost.  In Germany and the Netherlands the employers bear two-fifths of the cost.  In the United Kingdom the figure is 25 per cent.  Employers in this country, roughly speaking, bear 16 or 17 per cent of the cost.  That is a wide disparity between Ireland and the other members of the EEC. In the long term we will have to ensure that such major disparities are levelled out and that there is harmonisation as between employers' and workers' contributions.  It is an important point, one which we tend to ignore.</P>
    <P>I very much doubt if any serious consideration of a long term nature has been given by the Fianna Fáil Government to modern trends in the social security field in the EEC.  I do not think there has been any serious discussion on this matter and I am appalled by the prospect of Deputy Brian Lenihan being Minister for Foreign Affairs and presumably having liaison with Deputy Hillery in regard to such domestic Irish matters because I do not foresee anything good coming in the context of revamping or modernising our whole area of social administration, <Col N="283" /> particularly the social security system.</P>
    <P>They are the question marks I have facing this Estimate.  Now that we are entering the last year of this Dáil I do not think it is good enough just to get the classical Fianna Fáil attitude of sitting on those benches saying: &ldquo;Let us hold tight until March or April. Jack will make sure the old age pensioners will get 50p or 75p which will not be payable until October&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That has been the extent of Fianna Fáil social welfare policy.  It has evolved and revolved around that kind of social concept and they have been lucky that the Irish people have had confidence in that kind of approach during the past 15 years.  It amazes me that anybody could have confidence in that kind of attitude.  I have seen no effort on the part of a Fianna Fáil Government to get to grips with major defects in our social security system.</P>
    <P>In this respect I would make one point very forcibly.  I have been reading through what one might call the Department's production on social welfare and I think it is ironic that the only serious contribution made since the last world war was by the late Deputy Norton in 1949 when in a white paper he brought in a national system of social security.  In the last 15 years of Fianna Fáil Government not one white paper, green paper or explanatory memorandum of any content has been introduced by the Government outlining their views on modernising, or on a planned development of our social security system.</P>
    <P>When the debate is resumed I intend to outline the various areas where deficiencies have been manifest. The senior staff of the Department of Social Welfare through the years must have felt that they were there merely to administer a system which has changed only by alterations in the rates of benefits immediately after budgets.  That has been the only progress made in this field.</P>
    <P>The contribution of the Minister on this Estimate is an indictment of Government policy in the past 15 <Col N="284" /> years.  I am not quite sure which portfolio Deputy Hillery will assume in Brussels but I hope they do not fob off on him that of administration. There has been a sad lack of that at home.  If he has the fortune to be allocated the Commissionership for Social Affairs he will have to light a fire under his colleague at home, Deputy Brennan, so that he will not be going off to Brussels burdened with the current futile system of social welfare in Ireland, a totally inadequate system in terms of fellow EEC members, inadequate to come to grips with the problem of poverty in our community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made about the announcement in relation to these three small specialist units in the London area.  I understand that St. Peter's is a specialist unit in the field of urology, St. John's in dermatology and St. Mark's in diseases of the rectum and colon.  The announcement deals with arrangements in regard to post-graduate medical education in London and was made by the University Grants Committee, the University of London and the Department of Health and Social Security.  The proposals deal with the rebuilding of the units in association with major teaching hospitals associated with particular medical schools.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for medical teaching, under-graduate and post-graduate, in the London area involve a complex of inter-relationships developed over a long period of time. What has emerged is not paralleled in this country and we do not have here specialist post-graduate institutes similar to the three units named.  As I am not clear what message the Deputy sees for us in these particular changes I suggest that he might write to me setting out his views more fully; it is too complex a matter to deal with satisfactorily by Parliamentary question and answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Deputy refers to emergency accommodation. I am satisfied that the acute hospital facilities in the Dublin area are adequate to meet the demand for the accommodation of patients of all age groups requiring urgent admission.  In the case of institutional care for the elderly the demand for accommodation is greater than can be accommodated in the facilities under the control <Col N="293" /> of the Eastern Health Board.  That board have under consideration the provision of additional accommodation in welfare homes.  Overall, the institutional provision for the aged in public and private homes in the greater Dublin area is very substantial, exceeding the guideline figures suggested in the report on the care of the aged.  The development of improved domiciliary support services in the Eastern Health Board will be a highly significant factor influencing the demand for institutional care.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister give us any details of the welfare homes in the Eastern Health Board region?  For instance, what are the numbers they are expected to accommodate, the numbers they have accommodated to date and how they compare with areas in other health board regions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Care of the Aged Report, 40 beds per 1,000 of the population are required for institutional care.  In relation to this, Dublin city and county will need 2,640 beds but there are about 4,500 such beds in Dublin city and county.  Apart from St. Brendan's and St. Ita's Hospitals the Dublin Hospitals Board have about 1,400 beds in their own Dublin geriatric units.  They also maintain patients in private homes either by way of capitation grant or by way of the making of block grants to the homes.  As the Deputy should know, the Dublin Regional Hospital Board will have to make recommendations as a matter of priority to complete the assessment and rehabilitation process that has begun already in St. James's Hospital.  They will have to assess the need for geriatric cases but, as the Deputy knows also, there is a huge potential demand for domiciliary care. This care can be developed only by voluntary organisations with the statutory grant that I am now providing, that is, £300,000 for the care of the aged and home help.  This is a complicated procedure requiring complicated investigation and I could not possibly go into it in detail on the occasion of a reply to a Parliamentary question.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that St. James's Hospital in Dublin is unfit for 200 elderly patients. It constitutes a fire hazard as well as everything else.  The programme for the provision of care for the elderly is quite inadequate.  The grants and allowances given to those who care for such people are not sufficient and the Minister and his colleague should consider increasing them.  Even then they would cost less than the amount required for hospital accommodation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the question relates to homes providing residential accommodation for old people or other persons not requiring active institutional treatment.  While this type of accommodation is provided very largely in homes conducted by the health boards, a relatively small number of eligible persons choose to <Col N="297" /> reside in private homes, and in such cases health boards may contribute towards their maintenance.  The current rate of contribution is, in general, £7 a week.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the costs of maintaining the health board institutions this rate of contribution is not unreasonable, but will be examined in the normal course of review of health costs. Amendment of legislation or regulations will not be necessary.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has any particular home or homes in mind which, in his view, present special features and will get in touch with me I shall be glad to look into the matter further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>Health boards have the necessary authority under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, and section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that health boards have availed themselves of these powers.  In regard to the boarding out of elderly patients, two health boards in particular, the Eastern and the Midland Health Boards, have pilot schemes in operation and as regards the power to give assistance to bodies providing services for the aged, my programme for the development of voluntary community services clearly indicates that such financial assistance may be granted within certain generous limits without any prior reference to my Department.  The amount available for the latter purpose in the current financial year is £300,000.  The scheme is explained in <Col N="298" /> a leaflet which was prepared in my Department last year.  I circulated copies of that leaflet to Deputies with the documentation in regard to my Estimate earlier this year.  For the Deputy's convenience I am sending him a further copy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will increase the allowances to all hospitals now caring for the aged in view of the very high cost of maintaining these patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Most old people receiving institutional care are maintained in homes run by health boards, and the full running costs form part of the board's expenditure.</P>
      <P>The majority of voluntary institutions caring for the aged receive capitation payments from health boards. These payments are related to the actual costs of maintenance as ascertained from annual accounts.</P>
      <P>In respect of a relatively small number of private homes catering for old people who exercise an option to be maintained in them, a contribution of £7 a week in general is paid by health boards towards costs.  Having regard to the costs in the homes run by the boards themselves, this is a reasonable figure, allowing for normal receipts from private sources.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy has in mind any particular institutions, perhaps he would get in touch with my Department about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the hearing aid service operated by the National Rehabilitation Board for health boards, the standard hearing aids available are adequate for the needs of most persons availing of the service.  I understand, however, that there are certain hearing defects, relatively few in number, for <Col N="299" /> which a hearing aid would not be of any assistance.  Also in a small number of adult cases a special type of hearing aid is required, which is supplied by the National Rehabilitation Board with the approval of the health board concerned. I am not aware of any such case in which the approval of the health board was not forthcoming.  If, however, the Deputy is aware of a particular case in which it is felt that an alternative type of hearing aid to that available from the National Rehabilitation Board is needed, my Department will be prepared to look into the matter on receipt of details from the Deputy.</P>

      <P>All decisions necessary for the discharge of the statutory services for which the health boards are responsible fall to be made by the health boards or their chief executive officers, subject to the statutory regulations and the directives and guidelines currently in operation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="302" /> I have seen the article referred to regarding the proposed payment of compensation by the German manufacturers of the drug thalidomide.</P>
    <P>Parents of children with defects arising out of the use of thalidomide could avail of a full medical and rehabilitation service which was provided within the framework of the Health Acts and thus avoid any undue financial hardship in the provision of such facilities for their children.</P>
    <P>Specifically, the National Rehabilitation Board made arrangements for the provision of specialised artificial limbs and appliances, training for children and parents in the use of the appliances and for schooling where special facilities were required. A vocational assessment, training and placement service was also provided by the board.</P>
    <P>In May, 1970, following confirmation by the Department of External Affairs that an offer of compensation by the German manufacturers of thalidomide applied to Irish children born with defects attributable to the drug, my Department issued advertisements in the Press inviting parents and others in charge of such children to furnish particulars of the cases to my Department for transmission to the representatives of the manufacturers. The 84 claimants who replied to the advertisements were also advised by my Department of the details required by the firm as evidence in support of claims.</P>
    <P>My Department subsequently arranged for the translation into English of German documents relating to claims and circulated the translations to the claimants concerned and assisted in the formation of a voluntary association of parents involved in claims on behalf of their children.</P>
    <P>While the responsibility for pursuing individual claims rested with the particular persons concerned, the Department of Foreign Affairs, through its embassy in Bonn, have been keeping in contact with developments in the matter.  I understand that the present position is that the medical assessment of cases is still proceeding.  It is not expected that these assessments will be completed until the end of the current <Col N="303" /> year.  It is understood that in the meantime no payment of compensation will be made&mdash;either to German or Irish cases&mdash;as the compensation will be apportioned in accordance with the degree of deformity suffered.</P>
    <P>My Department are considering in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs what action might be taken to assist further the Irish claimants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the harmonisation of the social security system expected under EEC conditions will involve a movement towards a common method of financing medical health services generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Treaty of Rome does not impose specifically on member states the obligation of harmonisation of their social security systems.  Indeed the Treaty reference to this subject envisages harmonisation arising from the functioning of the Common Market.  More recent thinking within the Communities reflected the view that harmonisation of social security systems in the Communities should develop concurrently with the development of economic and monetary union, a view to which concrete expression is given in the European Summit communiqué in which it was stated that &ldquo;The Heads of State or of <Col N="305" /> Government emphasised that they attached as much importance to vigorous action in the social field as to the achievement of the economic and monetary union.&rdquo;  At this stage, it is impossible to say if harmonisation will lead to common methods of financing medical health services generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what is the general pattern of the health services in the Community at the moment?  Is it private or public?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would take me an hour to describe that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the major emphasis is on providing private health care?  Over 50 per cent in all the EEC countries is devoted towards private health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That is an over-simplication. It is an enormously complex matter.  I have already said to the House that some people quite genuinely wanted a complete insurance system here.  In countries where insurance was started for health purposes on the most elaborate basis, it was found quite impossible, psychologically and practicably, to charge the people with insurance premiums that would cover hospital care and so there proceeded to be enormous subventions from the State for hospital care.  The practice varies from country to country as between insurance, taxes and rates of one kind and another.  I would say that it would take a great number of years before one could have a complete harmonisation in relation to the method by which people pay for their health services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Britain has a system in which only 1½ per cent of the insurance paid by people&mdash;or is it 2½ per cent?  &mdash;goes to health services, and the rest is paid entirely by general taxation.  That is in contrast to a number of European countries who <Col N="306" /> have a combination of insurance, federal aid, local state or regional aid and property taxes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The registration of overseas doctors is governed by the provisions of the Medical Practitioners Acts, 1927 to 1961.  Broadly speaking the situation as regards doctors who qualify outside this country is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Medical practitioners registered in the British Medical Register&mdash; other than those registered as foreign or Commonwealth practitioners&mdash;are entitled, on application to the Irish Medical Registration Council and on payment of the prescribed fee, to be registered in the Irish register.</P>
      <P>(2)  Medical practitioners registered in countries or states with which the Government have entered into an agreement for mutual recognition of registration between the two countries are also entitled to registration.</P>
      <P>(3)  The Medical Registration Council may grant temporary registration to suitably-qualified persons where they are satisfied that the applicant is, or intends to be, in this country temporarily for the purposes of employment in a hospital or other approved institution.</P>
      <P>(4)  The council may also temporarily register, in a register of visiting post-graduate medical students, suitably-qualified foreign practitioners for the purpose of obtaining a post-graduate medical qualification in this country, but only until this post-graduate qualification has been obtained and for no other purpose.</P>
      <P>Anyone, whether Irish or not, who obtains a recognised medical qualification in this country is, of course, fully entitled to registration here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certain amendments of the Medical <Col N="308" /> Practitioners Acts are being considered at present, including a provision that would give the Medical Registration Council power to register fully suitably-qualified and experienced individual doctors from foreign countries, subject to certain conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the negotiated terms the scheme will become due for a joint review by my Department and the medical organisations on 1st October, 1973. In the interim period nothing in the terms will operate to prevent both sides agreeing to any adjustments to it.  At this stage, with the scheme in operation outside the Eastern Health Board area for less than one month, it is too early to anticipate what adjustments, if any, may be necessary.  I should say, nevertheless, that aspects of the operation of the service in the Dublin area are at present the subject of discussion between my Department, the Eastern Health Board and the medical organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>That among other matters is being considered.  There is the question of an appointment scheme in a certain area, and there is also the question of whether there will have to be an educational programme to try and reduce the enormous numbers of people who come needlessly to the doctor in certain areas, sometimes as a matter of tradition.</P>

This country's accession to the EEC involves the introduction of measures controlling the marketing of branded pharmaceuticals and regulating the use of additives in food processing.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Draft directives relating to freedom of movement of opticians in the EEC have been before the Council since 1969.  As the drafts were prepared on the basis of the then existing situation in the six member states they will necessarily have to be amended to take account of the situation in the enlarged Community. My Department has maintained close liaison with both Bord na Radharcmhastóirí and the Association of Ophthalmic Opticians and has submitted to the Council, in agreement with these bodies, a formal request for consultation in the matter.</P>
      <P>Until the final form of the drafts emerges it will not be possible to say with any absolute precision what the implications for Ireland will be.  In the consultations with the Community an important objective will be to ensure that the directives will not, in their final form, create any undue difficulties for Irish opticians.</P>

The grants payable to the Medical Research Council from the Hospitals Trust Fund have been increased from year to year, as funds permitted, from £109,928 in respect of 1968 to £147,800 in respect of 1972.  An application has very recently been received from the Medical Research Council for an increase in the amount of the grant payable.  This application is being considered in my Department at present.  I might add that the Medical Research Council have also received grants from some other sources, including some private business interests.</P>
      <P>Apart from these grants to the Medical Research Council, grants were also paid from the Hospitals Trust Fund in recent years to the Medico-Social Research Board and the grants increased from £10,000 in 1968-69 to £75,000 in 1971-72.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the dental services provided by health boards for eligible persons, general anaesthesia, when required for treatment purposes, is administered, not by a dentist, but by a medical practitioner who is normally a specialist anaesthetist.</P>
      <P>I understand that under the dental benefit scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare for insured persons, though general anaesthesia may be administered by a dentist, it is administered in the majority of cases by a specialist anaesthetist engaged under the terms of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am aware, it is customary for dentists in private practice to engage experienced or specially qualified anaesthetists to administer <Col N="314" /> general anaesthesia when required for dental treatment.  The arrangements in such cases are, however, the responsibility of the parties concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, persons with full eligibility and those with limited eligibility are entitled to free in-patient and out-patient hospital treatment for all conditions. Most persons fall within these categories.</P>
      <P>As regards drugs, medicines and appliances for those needing treatment outside hospital, persons with full eligibility are entitled to their requirements free of charge while persons in the limited eligibility category are entitled to partial assistance where the cost exceeds £3 in a calendar month.  In addition, under section 46 (8) of the Health Act, 1970, the chief executive officer of a health board can, on hardship grounds, deem any person whose income brings him outside these categories to be a person with limited eligibility for the aforementioned services.</P>
      <P>A disabled person's maintenance allowance is payable in cases of need to chronically disabled persons over 16 who are not living in institutions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In the re-organised general medical service all former permanent district medical officers who have remained in the scheme have been guaranteed a continuation of <Col N="316" /> their existing conditions including a minimum salary.  Similar guarantees for a minimum of 2½ years have been extended to former temporary district medical officers with at least two years' continuous service at the commencement of the scheme who continue to reside and provide a service in districts outside a town of 5,000 population.  I assume that the Deputy has in mind an extension of the latter arrangement.</P>
      <P>The main reason for the limited guarantees to former temporary district medical officers is to encourage the doctors concerned to continue to reside and serve in rural areas.  In the light of experience of the operation of the scheme it will be open to a health board to continue indefinitely such guarantees where they are necessary to ensure that a district is adequately served by a general practitioner. I do not accept that there would be any justification for the grant of similar guaranteed conditions to former temporary district medical officers living in large towns even where they may be serving a rural area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report to which the Deputy refers.  It related to a statement made by an officer of my Department in which he was not referring to the cost of the health services in general but specifically to the cost of medicines prescribed in the Eastern Health Board area for persons entitled to free family doctor services.  The figures given were annual estimates based on the actual figures for the operation of the new general medical services scheme during the period May to July last.</P>
      <P>I would like to take this further opportunity to express my concern at the high rate of usage of medicines in the Dublin area revealed by these figures. It is, of course, directly related to the excessively high demand for free general practitioner services in the city and is a problem which is the subject of continuing discussion between my Department, the Eastern Health Board and the medical organisations.</P>

      <P>The fixing of income standards for the issue of medical cards to persons in County Wexford is a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board.

      <P>If the Minister does not agree that there is grave hardship I say respectfully he does not know his job.  Would the Minister quote, and if he does not I will, the means test that is imposed in order to qualify for a medical card?  Is he not aware that a single man who has over £8 does not qualify; that a man, with a wife, who has £15 or over does not qualify; and that a man with a wife and four children does not qualify for a medical card if the gross income&mdash;that would be the father's wages&mdash;is over £20 per week?  That means that after deduction of social welfare contribution of £1.20p, trade union fees, travel and rent, there is very little for the man with which not alone to pay doctors and to pay for tablets and medicines but with which to buy food and pay for other household expenses as well.  Does he believe that a man with a wife and four children who would have, say, a takehome packet of £17 should then be asked to pay for a doctor and pay for the various prescriptions?</P>

That indicates that there cannot be any very gross distortion in relation to medical cards <Col N="321" /> in Wexford, but I should say to the Deputy that the chief executive officers will be engaging in the re-examination of the limits for health cards some time in the course of the next four months and they will take into account any relevant factors in relation to hardship such as are mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>(b) The total cost of the study of which the report referred to by the Deputy is a part, is estimated at £45,000; the cost will be paid out of public funds.</P>
      <P>(c) The McKinsey report in question is not a document in which there would be widespread public interest.  Copies were supplied to those who are directly concerned in the subject matter of the report, and for others copies of a summary of the report have been provided. The expense involved in making the report available for public sale would not be justified in view of the limited demand.</P>
      <P>(d) The report would be of interest only to some Members of each House and the expenses involved in providing a copy for each Member would not be justified.  To facilitate Members who are interested copies were placed in the Library.  Of course, Members who are also members of one of the regional hospital boards would have received a copy of the report in that capacity.</P>

      <P>With your permission, A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together. Forty workers in the construction industry were recruited in July-August last for work in Germany under private arrangements between an Irish firm and a Dutch national resident in Hamburg following an advertisement inserted in the Irish newspapers by the latter.  Certain requirements regarding employment of foreign workers in Germany, viz., possession of a visa and work permit were not fulfilled and the workers found themselves illegally in the country.  The Irish Consul-General in Hamburg, who was approached by some of the workers after their arrival, was in touch with the responsible German authorities, who indicated that in the circumstances action against the workers would be limited to deportation which the Consul-General was informed was the minimum action open to the authorities.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 66, 67 and 68 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a full exposition of the Government's position on this question at my recent meeting with the President of the United States and his <Col N="331" /> Secretary of State.  I am satisfied that all levels of the United States Government are now fully informed in the matter, particularly in the wider policy context.</P>
    <P>I await the response of President Nixon who has undertaken to give the matter his personal attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is to be commended on his success in having met the United States President. Could he give us any indication whether he got any firm commitment from President Nixon?  Pious platitudes to the effect that the President will take a personal interest in this matter are not much use at this stage. Did the Minister seek any commitment from President Nixon or did he get any evidence that President Nixon might intervene in a positive way in this issue?  Did he get any commitment from him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy will accept that there is no question of pious platitudes as far as I am concerned. This has been a very long and difficult road.  We have now placed the matter in the hands of the President of the United States and I think we will have to await his decision on the <Col N="332" /> matter.  Anything we say at this time would not necessarily help the situation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether he has any plans to improve cattle shipping facilities to Britain and Europe; and if he will make a statement on the recent difficulties regarding the shipment of cattle to Italy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The extent and frequency of the shipping services provided for the conveyance of cattle is a matter primarily for the initiative of shipowners and other commercial interests concerned, in the same way as shipping services for the carriage of goods, vehicles and passengers.</P>
      <P>Cattle services to Britain are, at present, provided by privately-owned shipping lines and by the Irish Livestock Transport Company, formed in 1970 by the B &amp; I Company and British Rail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this consortium, which has two representatives of the cattle trade on its board, was to ensure the continued availability on an economic basis of adequate facilities for the shipment of cattle to Britain.  In setting up the consortium, the two companies envisaged that their joint services would continue in operation up to 1975, with the option to extend <Col N="335" /> this period for a further five years if, after review, this seemed warranted.</P>
    <P>Despite the extensive shipping and lairage facilities provided by the consortium, it has not, to-date, been supported adequately by the trade and the needs of exporters of cattle to Britain are being met to an increasing degree by the private shipping operators. The latter now handle the major portion of cattle traffic to Britain, with the result that the facilities and vessels of the B &amp; I and British Rail are very much under-utilised and the numbers of cattle handled by the consortium fall well below the minimum level at which operations would be financially self-supporting.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I Company and British Rail have informed the Government Ministers concerned, both here and in Britain, that they are undertaking a radical review of the whole future of their cattle-carrying services and the matter is being further examined. No changes will, however, be made without full consultation with the Government Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>The shipment of cattle to Continental Europe is conducted entirely by private shipowners and exporters, and there is no involvement by the B &amp; I Company.  No complaints of shortage of shipping for cattle to Continental destinations have been received in my Department.  However, there are no regular scheduled livestock services to the Continent, and as a result, some instances have arisen of delays to shipments of individual lots of cattle to Italy.  I also understand that arrangements have been made by some of the interested exporters to charter a number of vessels to cater for future planned exports to that country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether in view of our forthcoming entry into EEC and the vital importance of having adequate transport services with the mainland of Europe, and particularly in the light of the unpleasant experience we had this year in regard to the Rosslare-Le Havre car ferry which cost the tourist industry a considerable <Col N="336" /> amount of money, he would not agree that it is vitally important now that a two-stage shipping company, the B &amp; I and Irish Shipping, should be geared to ensure that there will be adequate freight and passenger services between Ireland and the Continent and that this is vital to our future in EEC?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has all been settled in regard to passengers and freight but the question relates to cattle which is a different matter because of the heretofore indeterminate nature of cattle shipments to the Continent, but if the situation develops as it appears to be developing, certainly what the Deputy suggests is feasible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether any public inquiry will be held into plans respecting large scale alterations of Dublin Port; whether his Department have examined the present study produced by Dublin Port and Docks Board; and, if so, with what result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 to 77, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The studies on the long-term development of Dublin Bay published by the Dublin Port and Docks Board are intended to provide an informed basis for examination and discussion about future development of the port.  The board have indicated that they would welcome the views of the public and interested parties on studies and that such views would be taken into consideration before they would decide on any formal plan or plans which would be appropriate for submission to the planning authorities. In these circumstances, the question of job opportunity contingency plans does not arise at this stage.  I would point out, in any event, that general responsibility for the promotion of industrial job opportunities rests with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the emergence of a development plan it would be open to the Dublin Port and Docks Board to seek permission to provide facilities for <Col N="338" /> specific projects that may arise in the short term and any such request would fall to be considered under the provision of planning and harbours legislation.  In this connection, the board have applied to me for a harbour works order to authorise the building of embankments and reclamation, necessary for a proposed oil refinery.  I understand that the promoters of the refinery have sought planning permission in accordance with the provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  Any question of an inquiry would fall to be determined under the provisions of that Act.  No action on the making of a harbour works order will be taken until after a decision has been taken on the planning application in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 to 81, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Bord Fáilte that they estimate that in 1972 visitors will number 1,387,900 and will spend £62.3 million here.  The figures for 1971 are 1,692,000 visitors and £71.4 million.  When account is taken of visitors who spend less than one day here and passenger receipts, the forecast total tourism revenue for 1972 is £87.9 million a fall of £12.9 million on the 1971 figure of £100.8 million. The 1972 figures are based on passenger returns and the board's surveys of passengers.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte estimate that in the nine months ended September, 1972, tourist numbers were 952,000 as against 1,211,000 in the same period of 1971.  These do not include Northern Ireland tourists as it is not possible to estimate them other than on a yearly basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, prospects for tourism here in 1973 will be influenced to a great extent by the situation in Northern Ireland.  Bord Fáilte are preparing to launch a determined and ambitious promotional programme for each of their market areas based on the assumption that the situation will improve in Northern Ireland. Their programme will involve advertising schedules in Britain, North America and on the Continent which will compare favourably in volume with previous programmes.  A new range of literature for the British, American and German markets will be available.  The board has introduced in the British market a guarantee on the quality of Irish holidays offered and have appointed public relations consultants for Britain.  The board intend to increase significantly, in co-operation with Irish and overseas carriers and other sectors of the tourist industry, the number of travel writers, radio and television units and <Col N="344" /> travel agents who will be brought from all markets during the coming months to experience for themselves the holidays to be offered to tourists in 1973.</P>
    <P>In France, where Bord Fáilte already has a joint advertising campaign with Aer Lingus, a similar campaign will be operated with Irish Shipping Ltd. to mark the re-introduction of the direct Continental car ferry service.</P>
    <P>In new business areas in Europe, Bord Fáilte are co-operating on advertising in Scandinavia with Scandinavian Airlines and Aer Lingus and are mounting similar operations in co-operation with Aer Lingus in Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, Spain and Austria.  In addition, a new promotional booklet for these developing markets in Europe is being produced jointly by the board and Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>At home, Irish people will again be encouraged to &ldquo;Discover Ireland&rdquo; and it is Bord Fáilte's intention to develop strongly this section of the tourist industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that it is difficult to make any definite forecast about the 1973 season, could I say to the Minister that the most successful form of advertising, publicity and promotion appears to be the bringing in of travel agents, tour operators and particularly travel writers from the various countries? I understand that Bord Fáilte has started to do this.  Could the Minister say whether or not it is the intention to continue doing this?</P>

While it will be some time before the board will be in a position to effect a comparison between 1972 and 1973 prices, Bord Fáilte are satisfied from discussions with individual hoteliers over the past few months that the hoteliers are very conscious of the need to keep prices as low as possible.  Hoteliers, in fixing their prices for 1973, approached the revision of their 1972 prices with extreme caution but had, however, to take into account increased costs since their maximum prices were last settled in October, 1971, and anticipated cost increases in 1973.</P>

In fact, if there is not the extension of the briquette market to justify the erection of a briquette factory we can by investing capital provide a further power station which can give more employment than the briquette factory.  It is in this area we are now investigating the matter.  I feel this is a far more fruitful area, the provision in addition to the one we are commissioning before 1976, of a third station in this very area because of the tremendous demand for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>The Transport Act, 1964 (Section 6) Order, 1969, provided for payment to CIE from 1st April, 1969, of an annual grant of £2.65 million to meet the board's estimated revenue losses during the ensuing five year period. This grant has, however, proved to be seriously inadequate.</P>
      <P>The board's net deficit has increased from £3.234 million in 1969-70 to £6.171 million in 1970-71 and £6.493 million in 1971-72.  Supplementary Exchequer grants of £2.98 million in 1970-71 and £4.464 million in 1971-72 have been voted for CIE by Dáil Éireann in order to keep the board in funds.  In the current financial year, the total provision for subsidy for CIE in the Vote for my Department is £6.15 million, i.e. £3.5 million in excess of the statutory grant of £2.65 million.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the McKinsey Report on CIE indicated that the rapid deterioration in CIE's financial position was due mainly to inflation and to the growing competition from private transport.  The consultants found no scope for immediate significant savings.  Major savings which they did envisage and which would involve some contraction of rail services would take about five years to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, CIE estimated that their losses in the current financial year would amount to almost £9 million.  To reduce the burden on the taxpayer to more reasonable proportions, the board submitted proposals for increases in fares and rates with effect from 4th September, 1972. These proposals are at present under consideration by the National Prices <Col N="355" /> Commission.  Until the commission's recommendation is available, I cannot say what action will be taken on the CIE proposals.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the board's subvention of £6.15 million for the current financial year will be inadequate and consideration is at present being given to the measures necessary to deal with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals and recommendations in the Fletcher Report may be divided into three broad categories as follows:</P>
      <P>(a) Long-term recommendations or suggestions of a technical nature for consideration in relation to future ESB policy in such fields as inter-connection with other systems particularly in the context of a nuclear station, marketing strategy, pumped storage schemes and fuel policy.</P>
      <P>(b) General recommendations for a new financial regime for the ESB, which would require legislation.</P>
      <P>(c) Short to medium term recommendations aimed at possible reductions in costs.</P>
      <P>An examination has already been made of the short to medium term recommendations aimed at possible cost reductions and to the extent that these recommendations can be implemented, action has already been taken or is in progress.  I must say, however, that no cost reductions can be expected under this head which would measurably affect the price of electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="357" /> The long-term recommendations are at present under study.  The recommendations relating to a new financial regime would not result in savings to the community.  They would, if adopted, simply involve transfers and counter transfers of costs between the ESB, the Exchequer and local authorities.</P>
    <P>The general conclusion to be drawn from the report is that subject to certain areas in which corrective action has or is being taken, the ESB is operating efficiently and that the scope for cost reductions in the short-term is minimal.  In these circumstances the cost of supplying electricity must be met by the consumers and the price of electricity must be determined accordingly.  The only alternatives to this are to transfer part of the cost to the taxpayer or to make the ESB insolvent.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case in question, in which the man concerned was not paid unemployment benefit for ten days in May last during which he was in England accompanying his invalid wife on a holiday.  The refusal of benefit arose because he was not regarded while absent abroad as satisfying the fundamental condition for title to unemployment benefit which requires a claimant to be available for work.  Indeed, from the circumstances of the case as then disclosed, it seems questionable whether the person was available for work at home before and since that absence; however, I am glad to say that this aspect need not be pursued as he has now transferred to a retirement pension with effect from 5th October.  Retirement pension gives him a financial advantage as compared with unemployment benefit and is, moreover, payable abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the EEC regulations concerning <Col N="361" /> the social security of migrant workers, which are to come into effect for this country from April next, a person in receipt of unemployment benefit here who goes to and registers for work in another member state of the Community will be entitled to continued payment of his benefit for a period of up to three months.  I do not propose to take any steps which would confer title otherwise to unemployment benefit in respect of temporary absences abroad; the fundamental condition of availability for work must be maintained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should much prefer not to give a figure than to give a wrong one, and as the Deputy knows, having done his home work, all the estimates attempted have been wide of the mark.  The schemes in the two areas are not comparable.  I have been asked a question about what our social welfare payments would have cost had they been at the same rates as in Northern Ireland.  That was easy because we could take only the schemes we had and compare them with their counterparts in the North.  There they have employees, they have self-employed and unemployed, all qualified for benefits of a different type. Then the question of supplementary benefits comes in.  If I were to take the last census figures, how am I to know the number to whom benefits will apply in any particular sector? Widows' pensions alone would not be comparable because they have to pay for 26 weeks, there is an age limit of 40 years and there is a lower rate and a higher rate.  Here we pay at the same rate at any age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am accepting that the schemes are not comparable and it is because of that that we are trying to reach a figure of the cost of levelling up.  Does the Minister not agree that it is entirely dishonest for him and the Taoiseach not to admit that <Col N="364" /> the figure would not be less than £150 million?

In common with all other Deputies I received a copy of that report and the accompanying questionnaire.  The matter has not been the subject of formal representations to me in my capacity as Minister for Social Welfare, but in any event I would point out to the Deputy that my Department would not be the appropriate Ministry to deal with such matters.  It is concerned with the formulation of policy in relation to social security and social assistance and with the administration of various income maintenance services designed to meet the loss of income from such causes as, for example, unemployment, sickness, invalidity, occupational injuries and desertion.  In this field it has already taken the appropriate statutory powers to enable it to make suitable alternative arrangements for the payment of children's allowances and that portion of any other benefit which is payable in respect of dependants in cases where the recipient neglects or fails, for any reason, to make provision for his wife and children.</P>

      <P>Non-contributory pensions are subject to a means test and in accordance with the statutory rules for the calculation of means all income in cash, with certain specified exclusions, which a person may reasonably expect to receive is assessable as means.  Statutory pensions and increases therein come within that category. Consequently, adjustment of non-contributory pensions payable by my Department becomes necessary following the granting of increases in statutory pensions.  There are, of course, provisions which ensure that such adjustment cannot bring about a reduction in non-contributory pension which is greater than the increase in the statutory pension.  I do not accept that as a consequence the pensioners concerned receive no cost of living increase, since non-contributory pensions, in common with other social welfare benefits, have been increased annually by amounts which have more than compensated for increases in the cost of living.</P>

      <P>Wages are a factor in assessing eligibility only in the case of non-contributory pensions which are subject to a means test, the purpose of which is to ensure that the available money goes to those whose need is greatest.  It would clearly be inequitable to make an exception of the earnings from any particular occupation, such as traffic warden, in a matter of this kind.</P>

The position is that the man received holiday pay for the first seven days of that period and was due to resume the employment on 4th September, 1972, which, in fact, he did.

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that AnCO, in discharge of its statutory responsibilities under the Industrial Training Act, 1967, intends to institute legal proceedings against employers who fail to pay the levy due under the various levy/grant schemes. Such action will be taken only after other means have been exhausted. AnCO hopes that legal proceedings will be necessary in a limited number of cases only.  It is not possible to give the number of such cases at present.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is aware that the levy/grant system adopted <Col N="390" /> for training schemes in industry in England will be abolished and replaced with a system of grants without levies in order to encourage industries to provide better training schemes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The latest British Government announcement on its industrial training proposals indicated that the levy/grant system is not being abolished but that the system is being modified in the light of experience.</P>
      <P>The measures required to improve industrial training in Ireland should be considered primarily in relation to our own needs and not by reference to changes in Britain.  Apart from differences between the two countries in industrial tradition and nature and scale of industry it should be borne in mind that the levy/grant system has been in operation in Britain for over seven years, whereas it has been applied in this country for a short time only.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the latest annual report of AnCo which gives information on the valuable results which have followed from the introduction of levy/grant.  In my view the levy/grant system should be given a fair trial over a reasonable period.  It will, of course, be kept under continuing review by AnCO and my Department and, if necessary, modifications will be introduced in the light of practical experience.</P>

      <Col N="394" /> NOTE: In the year 1971 certain changes took place in the basis of establishing eligibility for redundancy payments.  As from 3rd May, 1971, the income limit for compulsory insurability under the Social Welfare Acts of non manual workers was raised from £1,200 to £1,600 per annum.  As from 1st September, 1971, (a) the period of continuous service the same employer to qualify for redundancy payments was reduced from four to two years, and (b) the period of cover after ceasing to pay redundancy contributions was extended from two to four years.  The figures for 1971 and 1972 are, therefore, not fully comparable with those for earlier years.</P>

      <P>The EEC Commission proposal to which the Deputy refers was listed in the edition of the Official Journal of the European Communities, No. C. 127 dated 28th December, 1971.  The proposal was subsequently adopted by the Council as Regulation No. 858/72 on 24th April, 1972.  This regulation provides for the conditions under which applications for aid from the European Social Fund will be addressed to the commission and the conditions under which decisions to approve or reject such applications will be notified.  The regulation also provides for the manner in which payments will be made from the fund, for supervisory checks on expenditure financed by the fund and for annual reports by the commission to the Council on the activities <Col N="395" /> of the fund together with the estimated evolution of expenditure. Essentially, therefore, the regulation is a procedural document and we shall, of course, follow the procedure laid down as from our entry to the Community in January next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the main provisions and implications for Ireland of the draft EEC directives C. 34, 7. 4. 1972 and C. 34, 7. 4. 1972 of the grading, packing and labelling of dangerous substances; and the consultations thereon entered into by his Department with interests in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing basic document in the matter referred to by the Deputy is a directive of the EEC Council dated the 27th June, 1967, dealing with the approximation of provisions under law, regulation and administrative procedure relating to the classification, labelling and packaging of dangerous substances when these are marketed in the member states of the community.  The objects were to eliminate impediments to trade and to provide a measure of safety for the public.  The directive classified the substances under eight board headings and detailed the substances in a lengthy annex.</P>
      <P>The directive required member states to take all necessary measures to ensure that the dangerous substances, as classified and detailed, would not be marketed unless there were certain specified standards of packaging together with labelling giving information as to the name, origin and dangers attending the use of the substances with the consequential risks.</P>
      <P>My information is that the directives referred to in the Deputy's question are still in draft form and have not yet been approved by the Council.  They propose some additions to the list of dangerous substances and some modifications in the case of certain solvents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated, the matter is essentially one of the approximation of procedures within the Community. <Col N="396" /> In due course I shall deal with the matter, if appropriate, by way of regulations under the Dangerous Substances Act.  In accordance with the provisions of that Act, I shall publish notice of my intention to make any regulations that may be involved and thereby give persons who wish to make representations an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to add that we have a two year transitional period within which to comply with directives of this kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that it would be more effective if he were to have a discussion on the draft directive while it is still in draft form with the interests concerned. so that his viewpoint at the Council of Ministers when a decision is finally reached would reflect Irish interests?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible all right, but I do not anticipate any difficulty in view of the fact that we have just passed our own Dangerous Substances Act which enables us quite readily to provide for what is required by the directive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed regulation provides that labour relations in a member state of the EEC would generally be governed by the law in force within that state.  The regulation provides, however, that foreign workers from member states, may elect, under certain conditions, to have their own country's labour laws applied to them rather than those of the host country but nevertheless many important basic laws of the host country would still apply to the foreign worker.</P>
      <P>The general implication for Ireland of the proposed regulation is therefore that foreign workers employed in an Irish subsidiary of a company with headquarters elsewhere in the Community would be subject to Irish labour legislation unless they elected to be subject, with certain exceptions, to the labour legislation of their own country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising out of the bank closure in 1970 and its aftermath a serious accumulation of work occurred in the Paymaster General's Office resulting in delay in furnishing statements of receipts and payments to Departments. These statements are necessary for the preparation of Appropriation Accounts.  Statements were, however, issued to all Departments simultaneously but I understand from the Comptroller and Auditor General that at the date of his report some seven accounts had not yet been received by him.  Some of these were not received until March.  Because of this and other delays in printing and proofreading, the Comptroller and Auditor General was not in a position to submit the printed version of the Appropriation Accounts to me until 13th September, 1972.  The accounts were presented to the Dáil on 15th September, 1972.  I have, however, taken the necessary steps to ensure that the work of issuing statements of receipts and expenditure to the various Departments has been brought up to date and I expect all 1971-72 accounts to be submitted <Col N="402" /> to the Comptroller and Auditor General by the statutory date of 30th November, 1972.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I follow that reply.  Am I correct in believing that, although the statement of receipts and expenditure issued at the same time to all Departments, some of them were able to get their replies back in time while others failed to do so and failed rather miserably? I think the Department of Justice was one such Department.  Could the Parliamentary Secretary indicate why there were some Departments which defaulted while others were able to meet the deadline?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot do that, but the answer is clear enough; the ones that were not in in time were Votes Nos. 17, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25&mdash;that is the Stationery Office, the Office of the Minister for Justice, the Garda Síochána, the Prisons, Courts, Land Registry, Registry of Deeds and Charitable Donations and Bequests.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the suggestion that since the introduction of the computer in the Revenue service inaccurate and unintelligible notices are issued by inspectors of taxes to taxpayers.  Every reasonable precaution is taken to make the notices as accurate and as informative as possible but, as with any operation involving hundreds of thousands of cases, mistakes may occasionally occur from time to time. The Revenue Commissioners and their inspectors of taxes take immediate steps to remedy any mistakes as soon as they are discovered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the accepted policy that there should be only one assessment for each taxpayer, and this policy continues to be implemented to the greatest possible degree. The issue of more than one notice of assessment cannot always be avoided where, for example, a taxpayer has two sources of income, one an employment where the tax is required by law to be collected by deduction <Col N="404" /> from the income and the other a trade or profession which is chargeable by direct assessment under the rules of Schedule D.  This is particularly so when the income chargeable under Schedule D is substantial and there might be delay in determining the exact amount of such income.  In these cases the notice of the assessment in respect of the Schedule D income shows, for the information of the taxpayer, the amounts of the allowances and reliefs granted against his income from employment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals referred to concern the harmonisation of the structures of existing customs and excise duties on a number of products. These proposals are contained in Commission documents which are available in the Dáil Library.  The document entitled &ldquo;Proposals for harmonising consumer Taxes other than VAT&rdquo; contains a draft framework directive setting out the considerations underlying the proposed harmonisation; it also contains drafts of directives on the following products: spirits, wine, beer and mixed beverages.  The original draft directive on tobacco is also available in the Library (J.O. No. C 4 of 18-1-'71) together with a revised version which has just been received.</P>
      <P>These directives are concerned with harmonisation of the structure of the main customs and excise duties.  Proposals for harmonisation of rates will arise during a later stage.  The framework directive referred to proposes the ultimate abolition of minor excise duties at a much later stage in the progress towards economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>The implications of the draft directives are being considered, at the moment, in consultation with the main industrial interests concerned.  No loss of revenue is anticipated but administrative and organisational problems will arise.</P>
      <P>The draft directive on tobacco is at a relatively advanced stage.  The Government made their views known to the Commission on the original draft and discussions on the revised draft, which meets some of our points, will be held soon.  When the examination of the implications of the other directives has been completed, further consultations will be sought with the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> If the Council of Ministers of the European Economic Communities proceeds to adopt these measures before our accession, the Irish Government will have an opportunity to put forward their views under the consultation procedure.  After accession, the Government will, of course, have a voice in deciding the final terms of the proposals.</P>
    <P>As to my attitude to these proposals, the Deputy will appreciate that it would be unwise to disclose the line we will be taking at this stage, since the proposals are under consideration in conjunction with the trade interests concerned and will be the subject of discussions with the Community.</P>

      <P>I should like to say simply that it seems most unlikely that the draft directives will be adopted before accession to the Community and, at this stage, we would certainly have a full say in the proposals as they come.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question on the McKinsey Report on Comhairle na nospidéal because, as spokesman on health for the Labour Party, I was interested in the particular document and when I endeavoured to get a copy of it from the Department of Health I was told there was no copy available.  This is a document that was produced out of public funds and as a spokesman for Health I was astounded to be told there was no copy available.  I could not even buy a <Col N="417" /> copy.  There was no copy in the Library, although the Minister is obliged under the Act, at the very least, to provide a copy for the Library. On the particular day I phoned, there was no copy in the Library.  The report had already been published and had been given to members of Comhairle na nOspidéal.</P>
      <P>I phoned the Department and asked if I could buy a copy and they said no. I asked was a copy available to the health board members and I was told no.  Members of Comhairle na nOspidéal were told the document was confidential and could not be shown to anyone.  Comhairle no nOspidéal were set up by order of this Dáil.  Comhairle na nOspidéal is to have consultations with the health boards.  Therefore we must know the purpose of this report, what is in this report about Comhairle na nOspidéal.  As a member of a health board and as a Member of the Dáil I am entitled to know this.  In his reply the Minister said:</P>
      <P>other interested bodies, such as health boards, voluntary hospitals, medical teaching bodies and professional and trade union organisations representing staffs of hospitals, were supplied with a copy of the report and such numbers of copies of a summary of the report as they required.</P>
      <P>As a member of a health board I inquired about a copy and could not get one, so that that reply of the Minister is not correct.  When I think of a document which cost £45,000 of public funds to produce I am wondering why a copy could not be made available. Copies of previous McKinsey Reports were in plentiful supply.  As a matter of fact we had too many copies of them.  I was given a copy as a member of the health board and as a member of the Dáil, so that I had two copies of those reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other documents have been made available to us from the Department. An interesting book is <i>Health Services in Ireland</i> which is published by an official of the Department.  The Department went to considerable expense to give one copy to every Member of the Dáil.  I got three copies of that, one as a member of the health <Col N="418" /> board, one as a Member of Dáil Éireann and one as an editor of a medical journal.  Yet I could not get one copy of the other report even though I was prepared to pay for it.  I am wondering what was so special in <i>Health Services in Ireland</i>.  I have studied that book again and I have found nothing in it that is not available normally and I am wondering why so many copies were made so freely available by the Department at great public expense that I could have three copies of it.  There was no bar on the distribution of that.  I am asking the Minister would I be right in suggesting that he was in breach of the Act in not providing a copy for the Library when this report was published.  The answer I got from the Minister's secretary was that a copy would be provided in the Library.  I inquired the next day and the copy was still not in the Library.  It was not until three days later, which was the following Monday &mdash;I phoned on the Thursday and it was not there&mdash;that, under pressure from me the copy was put there.  I want to know why I cannot get a copy of this report, why I cannot purchase a copy. What is so confidential about it that it cannot be made available to interested people?</P>
    <P>Health boards must be given an opportunity to discuss the contents of that document.  It has been discussed already by the North-Western Health Board.  Members of that board are also members of Comhairle na nOspideál and they have had an opportunity of discussing it.  I cannot have the matter brought up at the next meeting of my health board, the Eastern Health Board, because I have not had an opportunity to study this.  The Minister may say he supplied a summary of it. I do not care what the Minister or the secretary may say; I say the summary bears no relation to the contents of that document.  It was not correct to say it was a proper summary of it; it was a bad summary and I am wondering why what purported to be a summary should have been issued as such.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a duty to this House as Minister for Health, and I think, out of courtesy alone, he should have made copies available to the spokesmen on health, at the very least, if not to every <Col N="419" /> Member of the House.  I cannot reconcile his statement that it would be too costly, a few extra copies would have made no significant difference in terms of finance.  The argument the Minister is going to put forward is without justification or foundation and I cannot accept it.</P>

      <P>First of all, I have no obligation under any Act to make available a copy of this report to any Member of the House.  Secondly, I would say that no Minister in this Dáil has ever been so communicative with Members of the House concerning health and hospital services.  This report had nothing like the importance of the previous McKinsey Reports which related to the operation of executive bodies spending millions and millions of pounds every year, in which executive bodies replaced a great number of health authorities.  The importance of the McKinsey Reports related to the fact that the whole of the staffing and structure of these bodies, who were responsible for execution rather than for research or advice, was involved. There is a very great difference between a report which simply sets out how the regional hospital boards and Comhairle na nOspidéal should communicate with the health boards, the nature of their staffing structure, and proposals that they should have area committees in order to facilitate their work, and the previous reports, which had much greater significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I already indicated to the House that copies of the reports were made available to members of the boards concerned, to voluntary hospitals, medical teaching bodies, professional and trade union organisations.  A copy of the report was presented to each health board and copies of a summary of the report, which I think is very adequate for purposes of discussion, were also presented to the health boards, and we have made a copy available in the Library.  I do not think I need make any apologies for my action, because the report has not anything like the significance of reports that relate to the entire reorganisation <Col N="420" /> of the executive work of administering the health and hospital services.</P>
    <P>In regard to the <i>Health Services in Ireland</i> booklet by Dr. Hensey, this was published by the Institute of Public Administration.  I felt it was very important to give Deputies a history of the entire progress of the health service administration from the foundation, and this document was provided by the Institute of Public Administration.  I should add, for the benefit of the House, that the officer of my Department concerned did not make any profit or royalty as a result of the distribution of the report to Members of the Dáil.  I should state that because it has been suggested that somehow he was benefiting personally by having extra copies sent to Members of the Dáil.</P>

      <P>Members of the Dáil are pretty busy people.  They already have an enormous number of statutory instruments and other documents which are made available to them through the Library.  Anybody who wants to study this document can do so.  The document is not really very complicated although, of course, the report is a very full one but the implications do not involve any political principles or controversial principles. It simply spells out the method of communication in order to avoid unnecessary duplication, unnecessary sending back and forth of documents, and to avoid all the problems that could arise when consultative boards, in the case of the regional hospital boards, and executive boards in the case of Comhairle na nOspidéal, are involved with health boards and with officers of my Department and finally with myself.  I am quite certain that the copies in the Library that have now been made available will be sufficient for the purpose of Deputies who are interested in this matter.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2nd November, 1972.</P>
