    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the <Col N="664" /> ground that it contains matter which is unnecessary and excessive and which is repugnant to basic principles of justice and liberty and the long established fundamental rights of citizens.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this Bill is concerned I intend to devote only a short time to rounding up what I believe to be the real reasons why there is no need for a Bill of this nature to be brought before the House, never mind enacted.  There is clearly no threat to the security of this State.  There is no apparent danger that there will be a threat to the security of the State or its institutions. I am convinced that at no stage was the Offences Against the State Act ever intended to be operated or utilised, never mind extended, unless there was a drastic situation where the State and its institutions were in grave danger of being demolished.</P>
      <P>I can see no cause for that.  In fact, I would like to advance the reasons why I am satisfied that the reverse is the case, in so far as any dangers might come from the IRA.  The Provisional IRA particularly seem to be the people, the resistance forces that have fought the occupation forces in the Six Counties over the last three years, who are now singled out in every way possible for a propaganda smear campaign against them.  This is in order to condition the people here to look on them not for what they are and have been, the resistance fighters of the Six Counties&mdash;who arose and developed from the peaceful protests which began on the streets of Belfast, Derry and elsewhere in 1968 and 1969 &mdash;and without whom there would not have been, over the last couple of years, any need for, nor would there have been any place for, nor would he even be allowed into Downing Street or Chequers, a leader of the Irish Government to talk about the problem of the Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Had there been no real resistance from the people on the streets in the Six Counties, there would be no problem to talk about today, that is, if we regard the total and complete suppression of the minority, after their <Col N="665" /> efforts of 1968 and 1969, their total disappearance and suppression further back than they ever were in the past 50 years, as no problem.  We would have no problem to discuss, and even if we regarded their continued suppression and the discrimination against them as a problem to us, there would be nobody in Britain, and certainly nobody of the stature of the British Prime Minister, in the slightest degree disposed to even bid the time of day to the Taoiseach if his quest across the Channel was in any way to discuss the situation in those Six Counties of ours.</P>
    <P>They came into being in that way and they are now branded as Provisional IRA.  There are others who do not belong to any IRA and they have been participating in the rising that came from that resistance that developed from civil rights marches which were met by force and brutality and by the forces of the Crown, the RUC and the B Specials.  It was by this very action on their part and their hasty reaction to suppress the people looking for their rights, which they have been denied for so long, that there developed the absolute conviction in the minds of the people in the minority in the Six Counties, and in the mind of the vast majority in the Twenty-six Counties, that there had to be resistance and that if there was not resistance they would be beaten out of sight never to rise up or to put up their heads again.</P>
    <P>We not only knew this was the case and not only sympathised with the plight of the people there, but we realised to the full that if there was not resistance on their part by force to meet force they would be wiped out in so far as any possible getting of rights to which they are entitled was concerned.  They would be wiped out in so far as their outlook for the future would be concerned.  They showed courage over the past 50 years in that having risen and having done the thing according to the book and made protests and held marches, they got their heads beaten in for their trouble.  Arising from all that and provoked by that brutality, there arose the will and the conviction, <Col N="666" /> which still obtains, that the minority of the Six Counties are finished with and will never again accept the manner in which they have been treated for the past 50 years, whether we support them or not.</P>
    <P>From there, there came this desire and this grave need for a means to combat those who were then brutalising them.  We here, and people in every party&mdash;maybe in some parties more than in other parties&mdash;in this House, had the utmost sympathy for them.  There was the utmost sympathy for them and for their needs at that time and, when those representing the citizens' defence committee came down here in August, September and October of 1969&mdash;they were all responsible well-known people &mdash;they visited quite openly all the parties here, including the Government. They did not come sneaking down in the dark.  They came down openly because of the exigencies of the time and the knowledge and belief they had that there was between them and the Members of this House, representing the people of this part of the country, a kinship, as there naturally should be, and a sympathy and an understanding.</P>
    <P>They held the belief that they would get from those whom they visited the help they needed.  They looked for arms as the only possible method of combating the visitations, the brutal visitations, of the alleged forces of law and order, particularly the B Specials at that time.  There may be a few here who can stand up now and say that they did not give these people any sympathy then and that they made not the slightest promise or gave the slightest hint that they were sympathetic to their needs.  But let there be no mistake about it.  A large number of most influential Members of this House gave them the fullest indications they could, and the most positive indications, of sympathy together with their promise that they would help them in any way they could.</P>
    <P>I know now that it is all too easy today, as it was all too easy during the last year or so, to pretend that they did not commit themselves in any way <Col N="667" /> at that time and there is a tendency now for certain people to hold up their hands and claim that they are now whiter than white.  I would ask those who now feel that way, who think they were totally opposed to any idea of help, as requested by those responsible people at that time, to think back and examine what their line then was.  Unless they are positive and unless they indicated then clearly and unequivocally their lack of sympathy and their rejection of the needs of these people, I would ask them now not to stand up and preach in terms which would suggest they had some divine inspiration at that time and never entertained a spark of sympathy for these people in their sad plight either then or since.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be probably all too easy to have some smart rejoinder to that, but I will not be tempted.  I want to be serious in this. I have the outlook I had as a result of what I have been saying.  I have no apologies to make for it, though I can see that my view in these matters could be as wrong as the views of those who disagree with me.  I believe in the views I hold and in the view that I express and, if there are now some who have changed their minds over that period, and if that is additional support for one's view, at least I have been consistent in my views. But that, of course, does not make them right.  However, on the laws of probability, I feel that consistency in a view over a time of great change and great difficulty is more likely to indicate that one's views are correct as against the views that have changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that is not really my point. What I am trying to get across is that there is no need for this law.  There is no threat of any kind from the Provisional IRA.  I pick them out because they have been picked out for special <Col N="668" /> mention from the point of view of the need for this Bill.  It is alleged they are the real threat.  The Provisional IRA grew out of the need at the time. As I understand it, they developed out of the citizens' defence committees, whose representatives at a very early stage came down south and were well received and given every sympathy and a promise of much support. People may quibble now as to what the promise of support really meant or did not mean.  If someone comes to your door and makes it very clear that he is in serious trouble and wants £20 immediately, or the next morning, and that is all he asked for, and insists that he wants nothing but the cash because only the cash is of any use to him, and you say to him: &ldquo;I am in agreement with you and I will help you&rdquo; could you, three months or six months later, in all fairness, expect that person to believe that you did not make a definite promise that he would get the cash?  That is my interpretation of the requests of these people from the North at that time and, to my knowledge, those requests were never refused.</P>
    <P>Not only did circumstances bring the freedom fighters into existence but so did the promised support of help, not just by me but by a lot of other people as well.  The blame lies on me and a whole lot of others, who helped to bring into existence shortly after those who are now condemned as terrorists, murderers&mdash;the gunmen of the Provisional IRA.  Were it not for this particular organisation and those others who came to the defence of their people, particularly in Belfast and Derry, those who erected and manned the barricades when the pressure was really greatest, would there be any problem to discuss with Mr. Heath, Mr. Whitelaw or anybody else so far as the Six Counties are concerned today?  The people would have been suppressed, driven back into the ground, walked upon as they have been walked upon for 50 years.  Having made the big effort, never again in our time, or in the foreseeable future, would the people ever march again to assert their rights in a peaceful or other protest.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility in this matter, <Col N="669" /> in my opinion, because of the encouragement and the participation and nothing we may now say can wipe that away.  There may be those who argue now that that was not right.  I do not argue in that way.  I believe it was right.  I do not put a tooth in it. Furthermore, I believe that it is our duty and our responsibility at this stage to support the case made by the people in the Six Counties, not in any mealy-mouthed fashion but openly.  We should assert absolutely that the British get out, that there is no hope in any other direction, that everything else has been tried, every formula except a clear indication that they will get out or, at least, stop guaranteeing that they will stay for all time.  This is what convinces me more and more, day by day, that there just is no possibility of any future peace of long-lasting duration or prospect for the people of the Six Counties whilst Britain continues blindly to guarantee continued maintenance and sustenance, financially and militarily, of a 6-county unit that does not deserve the badge of State, province, or anything else.</P>
    <P>While they persist in this blind attitude there can be no peace.  Nor can there even be, in my estimation, the prospect of the people of extreme views on the Unionist side every coming to a table to sit down to consider even in the remote future any change in the status of the union.  We must understand that there cannot be even agreement to sit down by a convinced Unionist, and there are convinced Unionists as distinct from the opportunist Unionists just as in every walk of life we get both kinds in our politics. There cannot be and there never will be a chance of a really convinced Unionist sitting down to discuss even the remotest possibility of uniting in any way in the future, for the simple and good reason, that even to agree to come and meet and sit down is an immediate concession of the entire principle of the claim to union with Great Britain.  Their &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;, &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; attitude is not just the attitude of stubborn, stupid people.</P>
    <P>This is understandable, but we do not seem to appreciate it.  If we did appreciate it, we would get back to the <Col N="670" /> kernel of it.  Why would it be a complete concession to sit down even to discuss the remotest possibility?  Because those who sustain them, those on the other side of the union continue to indicate and guarantee that they will stay with them come hell or high water. There it is.  Do not blame the Unionist for the attitude of &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; and &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;.  In all probability, placed in their position, I would take exactly the same attitude.  I could not take any other attitude, unless I had come to the conclusion and conviction that it was wrong to have union with Britain, and that it was a wrong thing for this country to continue to have it partitioned and divided as it is, under and because of that union.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances can there be any question of a Unionist sitting down to discuss it?  He would not be a Unionist any longer.  So it is that the convinced Unionist cannot even sit down to consider the remotest possibility in the far distant future of our ever coming together.  Britain and Britain alone is responsible, by her continued guarantees, for this attitude of mind that makes it impossible for Irishmen of conviction from both communities in the Six Counties, even to meet with a view to wondering what their future together might be rather than what we have known up to now.</P>
    <P>It is on foot of that, that we here have a grave responsibility which, in my estimation, we are far from carrying out.  A Bill such as this is not only not helpful but must be most harmful. By our indication of the need for this Bill, and the tagging of the Provisional IRA as being a threat to our institutions and our State south of the Border, we are saying in no uncertain terms that those same people in that organisation, which sprang from the streets of Belfast, Derry and elsewhere, back in late 1969, and the people from whom they came, are wrong, that we have no sympathy for their cause, that we do not agree with their outlook.  Therefore we take this action, an action which Mr. Heath and his Government, without understanding the real situation up there, see only as something which would please them if we did it.  In <Col N="671" /> their blindness they do not realise that, far from doing anything to help to bring about peace in this country as a whole in the future, we are more likely by this unnecessary, silly and stupid but dangerous proposed legislation to bring trouble south of the Border in a very real way.</P>
    <P>This is not Britain's fault because she does not know any better, and we are doing nothing whatsoever to try to convince her of the error of her ways, to try to convince her that she was the real culprit in this whole matter down through the years, and that because of that role she has the greater responsibility, and because of present circumstances she is the one party of the three we might say are at war at the moment who can move the keystone that would bring about a new dimension and a new possibility for discussing our way into ultimate, if not immediate, unity of our country.</P>
    <P>We are not helping.  Mr. Heath came into power only a couple of years ago.  He would be aware that, over on this side of the channel, there is an island that has been a continuing problem for Britain for all the years since she first set her foot in it, and occupied it, and suppressed it.  While he might have been aware of that, and probably was aware of it in general terms, he would not have known nor understood very much about what the real problems were in so far as the difficulties of Partition and the Border and so on were concerned.</P>
    <P>In fairness to him, in that short period, and from a very poor start, he has progressed quite a bit in his knowledge, if not his understanding. I charge that we here have failed in our role to improve his understanding and to add to his knowledge.  This was the greatest lack on our part and not only as a Government but as a Parliament.  We have not been getting through to that man that there is a way out rather than the Motorman operation, which we seem to condone if not support, which took place only a short few months ago. Surely the toll of additional deaths that have taken place since that operation <Col N="672" /> must now completely convince Mr. Heath and his Government that it was the wrong thing to do and the wrong way to do it.  Did we indicate what we must have already known without doubt from our knowledge of the past, that that operation would be a disaster rather than a solution for our trouble?  If we did not have that knowledge the lack is ours.  I believe we did have it and we did not use it, and that far from dissuading the man from going the distance, to say the least of it we condoned that stupid operation which brought into the Six Counties the largest concentration of troops that ever appeared on our soil, and with them came armaments the like of which this land has never before seen.</P>
    <P>Despite all this, all we get is more deaths.  Where are the deaths coming from mainly since this great Opertion Motorman, since the barricades were taken down, since the people's defenders were driven from the barricades in the no-go areas?  We have had rampant night after night in the hours of darkness, and sometimes during the day, the UDA, the UVF, or whatever they like to call themselves, driving in with impunity, shooting up indiscriminately, and driving away again.  Where are the 21,000 troops? What have they done about it, or what are they doing about it?  Is it not clear now, after this sad trail of additional deaths, that the very people we are now by our legislation proposing to try to drive out of existence, and the people who manned the barricades&mdash;and nobody else&mdash;are those who truly were capable of defending the minority in the no-go areas of our cities in the North?</P>
    <P>Surely we must see this.  Whether or not we agree with it, that is a fact.  Still this Bill is introduced, whether in good faith or otherwise&mdash;and I am not charging that it is in bad faith&mdash;and these proposals can only have one connotation for the oppressed in the Six Counties, that is, that the only vestige of defence they have known against the marauding hardliners in Belfast are the very people we would now wish to embroil in such a law that there is no getting away if we just <Col N="673" /> point the finger at them.  Yet&mdash;this is why I say there is no need&mdash;when those people organised themselves in Belfast at that particular time, 1969 and the beginning of 1970, did they not make it quite clear, as they have continued to do, that they have no war wish and no intention at any time of engaging in any campaign on this side of the Border?  They have been telling us that all along.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very nice of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Look, Deputy Tunney, whether it is nice or otherwise, it is a fact and time has proved it to be a fact and I completely and absolutely believe it.  Because of that belief, and because of the evidence over the last three years, I have every reason for that belief, I say there is no crisis, no grave danger to our State or institutions and that this Bill is, therefore, unnecessary and, worse&mdash;perhaps unintentionally&mdash; can only be provocative in a situation such as obtains at the moment.  Yet, we go on, willy-nilly, pushing it along as if it were the thing most needed, as if it were the very end product of all our dreams and aspirations.</P>
      <P>We have people coming into this House&mdash;I was not here when they were at it; I take it the news coverage of their say-sos is fairly near accurate&mdash; adopting the attitude &ldquo;either have this or have a general election&rdquo;.  Why should that be the attitude?  In a very serious situation, in the Government's estimation, in which they are preaching that there is a crisis and an emergency and grave danger to institutions of the State, why should they say: &ldquo;Give us that legislation or else we will plunge you into a general election?&rdquo; Is it that the general election would help to settle matters, would avoid a crisis or an emergency such as the Government are preaching is imminent at the moment, or would it not in all probability help to create the circumstances that could develop into an emergency that now does not even remotely exist?  It is no way to deal with this sort of legislation to say: &ldquo;Give it to us as it is, whole and complete, or you are in for a general election&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> The fact is you can drive Deputies and, I suppose, any party or Government party can do it for so long and so often but there is bound to come a time when your Deputies will not be driven any longer, when they have taken all that they can as regards supporting loyally the party line on matters that are party policy but when you get to an issue such as this, when you get to an issue that strikes at the very foundation of the rights of the people whom Deputies on all sides of the House represent, then any Government party is treading on most dangerous ground if they say: &ldquo;Either we get this as it is or you will be stuffed out to the country for an election&rdquo;.  Of course, the general speculation will be that this fellow will not come back and that fellow will not come back, and so on.  It can work for so many times and on so many issues but when you get on this sort of crunch issue, not only may it not work but the effort to make it work by coercion of that nature cannot have any good in it.  Even if it succeeds in getting that sort of support that is needed from the members of the Government party, in the long run it can only debase.  While there is collective responsibility in all parties and in Governments, there are issues in regard to which the individual mind and conscience of each member in that party must be given much more weight than if the matter were one of whether there should be an increase in social welfare, housing grants, road grants or some such thing.  These are altogether different matters.</P>
    <P>I would again say to the Government, do have more thought on this Bill.  Do consider its withdrawal because its enactment will not do any good and its operation can do an immense amount of harm.  If one believes that a measure will do no good and could do a lot of harm, even if that is only a remote possibility, it is totally illogical to push on with it and to insist on getting it.  I appeal again for a withdrawal and rethink on the part of the Government about this whole matter.</P>
    <P>There has been reference here to previous campaigns.  I can only <Col N="675" /> surmise what the idea behind the comparisons is.  I do not believe that there ever was a campaign previously that sprang from the streets of the Six Counties that really meant business like this one does and that is contained within those Six Counties, is being fought by the people of the Six Counties and where there is no effort&mdash;far from it; every assurance that there is no intention&mdash;at doing as other campaigns may have done, allowing it to spill over on this side of the Border.  There is no comparable campaign in my estimation in our recent history.  This is a totally different campaign from anything we have experienced in the past and the present condemnation of any campaigns and the treatment indicated as the treatment for them is totally misplaced. Therein, perhaps, lies the error in the thinking of our Government today that they have become imbued with the idea that there are at work forces attempting to bring down every last institution on this side of the Border as well as everything on the other side of the Border.  In fact, if the people now&mdash;many of them already know it but there are those who do not know it or do not yet believe it&mdash;were to consider the emergence of a resistance force, an armed resistance force for Belfast and Derry, they would realise that there is a vast difference between the IRA that would take on the Government on this side of the Border and an IRA, whatever appendage you may attach to it, that is insisting that only the government and the forces occupying our Six Counties should be taken on&mdash; nobody else.  Is that not, in fact, the real net difference in ideology, if one can call it such, between the two groups that are described as IRA but variously by the names &ldquo;Official&rdquo; and &ldquo;Provisional&rdquo;?  Is that not the real difference between them?  Yet, we hear nobody expressing anxiety as to what that other element might be up to.  Perhaps they are not up to anything and that may be one reason why a new organisation emerged in the streets of Belfast when the people were under great pressure in August, 1969.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="676" /> What about the other organisations? Have we declared all the hardline organisations in the Six Counties to be illegal and, if so, when were they so declared and where is the evidence to indicate any such declaration?  If this has not been done, what is the reason for it?  We have before us proposals that will enable us to get rid of the Provisional IRA and their friends, although they have continued to indicate during the past three years that they are not in any way a threat to the institutions of this State while the hardline Unionist organisations continue to declare war and trouble for us.  Not only are we doing nothing about these threats but we are avoiding talking of them, except in so far as we give them free rein on our broadcasting media&mdash;in complete contrast to the ban imposed on RTE 12 months ago.  The purpose of that ban was to prevent the broadcasting of any material concerning the Provisional IRA or any militant republicans in the Six Counties.  If that is the Government's attitude why do they not ban the other hardliners and why must we have such people as Mr. Craig, Billy Hull and Tom Heron on our media day in and day out telling us what they intend doing to us and how many people will be killed before Christmas?</P>
    <P>Do the Government think that because people all over the country are passive now they will stand for this carry on much longer?  I do not believe they will.  That sort of illogical behaviour can only go on for so long, and when the people have had enough of it the Government will find that it is not the IRA they will have to deal with.  They will be dealing with the people, as the Stormont Government found they were dealing with the people in 1968-69.  We know what followed from that and the situation would be no different here.  It is all right for the people to engage in passive protests and to say they are the only way, but if that is pushed too far while the establishment forces insist that you do not protest then, either the people become suppressed and accept the situation against which they were protesting or violence will meet the violence of the establishment and that is what happened in the Six <Col N="677" /> Counties.  Do not let us bring about such a situation unnecessarily here.</P>

After all the happenings in the northern part of our country during the past few years our people must be aware of their right to hear all sides on this crucial issue.  Therefore, far from banning anything, every effort should be made to give them a balanced picture of the situation through our national broadcasting media.  Let us finish with this lopsided, unfair and unjust presentation of news.  The blame cannot be placed on the heads of the newscasters because this situation has arisen by reason of the orders of the Government that were submitted to the authority and passed on to the operators of the service.  Yet, that same authority, who did their work as instructed by the Minister, have been given the sack, but, worse than that, we are told that they ignored the dictates of the Government on the suppression of republican views.</P>
      <P>Had I been in a position to do so, I would have fired them six months ago because of their suppression of republican views.  Therefore, I agree with the Government in their sacking of the authority, but my reasons are the reverse of theirs.  It is a scandal that our broadcasting media should be used to give to our people only the Unionist side of the sad events in Northern Ireland while the views of the republicans would be much more acceptable to the vast majority of our people. Generally the position in the news world is that, if there is a leaning in any direction, it is guided by what the people want to hear.  This applies both to newspapers and to broadcasting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only hope that there will be an end to this unhealthy situation.  Perhaps the new board will be caught in the rollers of the crusher also.  However, I would appeal to them and to the people working directly in the news media in Telefís Éireann, as well as to their <Col N="678" /> colleagues in the NUJ, to try above all to give us all the news from the Six Counties or, if they cannot do that, to give us none at all.  Let us put an end to the censorship and stop the masquerade of allegedly reporting what is happening.  Does it come within the terms of the Minister's directive under section 31 of the Broadcasting Act that the truth of what is happening in Belfast should be suppressed?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is getting away from the Bill.  There is an Estimate before the House dealing with the subject of RTE and related matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to avoid that, but the subject of broadcasting is intertwined with the Bill.  It is evident from reading the newspapers or listening to newscasts that this Bill is not necessary, because all we are being given is pro-Unionist propaganda. These proposals are being pushed mainly on the basis that the republican elements are the danger to our institutions, even though they continue to tell us that they do not constitute any such threat.  The threat is from the Unionists. There can be no justification for this action on the part of the Government at this time.  I cannot understand what has brought about this change in their thinking.  Why are we being so careful to suppress the truth about what is happening in Belfast?</P>
      <P>East Belfast is practically stripped of its minority population.  Who is doing it?  It is the organisations which are making the threats of what they are going to do here.  They have already indicated that they mean business but this measure is not being offered to this House to look after those people.  It is being recommended on the basis that it should look after the other element who have shown they have no desire to in any way upset or destroy any part of our institutions here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for this Bill.  There is no evidence that it will be needed and there has been every evidence in the past that far too much law is available to the present Government, which is being used to try to suppress a <Col N="679" /> danger that does not exist and may, as a result, provoke the danger that is not there but which we are now told we should fear.  Last night I mentioned the manner in which the crowds in Dublin behaved during the past week.  This was to me the most heartening assurance that there is no danger to our institutions or no desire on the part of our people of any particular persuasion, politically or otherwise, to do them harm.</P>
    <P>The first occasion on which the crowds behaved themselves well was at the Mater Hospital and the second occasion was in Molesworth Street on Wednesday night.  I indicated last night my belief that the obvious build up of gardaí and the Army in circumstances where there was not the slightest indication given that there would be trouble can provoke the very thing it is the fond hopes of those who directed the build up to prevent.  It was bad enough on Wednesday night but it was even worse when we found last night that we were in a state of siege in this House again.  One Deputy on the benches over there said to me: &ldquo;I walked into a lamp post because I could not see it for gardaí&rdquo;.  He hurt himself.  There was nobody else out there last night.</P>
    <P>I am sure the gardaí in those circumstances must feel foolish and must also feel that their time, which is so badly needed in the streets of this city, is wasted in this work.  I say to the Government if they are so afraid that they need up to 2,000 gardaí backed up by a couple of regiments of the Army would they put them under the bushes in St. Stephen's Green where they are not seen and they will not provoke trouble?  They will be near enough if they are required.  I say they are not wanted and they should not be in St. Stephen's Green or anywhere else. There is plenty more work for them to do that they would gladly be at rather than be brought in here from all over the country.  They have been coming in busload after busload from Cork, Galway and other places all over the country.  If on Wednesday night or last night the slightest trouble of any kind developed in Galway there would <Col N="680" /> not be enough gardaí to close the barrack doors never mind anything else.  That applies to all our large towns throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Who is creating those fears?  Is it a cynical attitude to try to promote the belief that this Bill, regardless of the lack of evidence, is necessary or is it that the Government are afraid?  If they are, why do they not tell us why they are afraid and we might be more understanding? We can see no reason for this attitude on the part of the Government and the establishment.  They are making no effort to show us that such a situation exists.</P>
    <P>Why do we want to provoke organisations into activity here that they have declared they have no intention of engaging in?  Why should we do this unless it is at the dictate of others who do not belong here and who have no interest or concern for our welfare but who are pulling the strings as they have done for generations past from Westminster and other such places?  If it is as it was in 1922, that we either do as we are told or we really get it in the neck, tell them to go and take a jump at themselves.  This is 1972 and we should not be frightened as we were then.  If that is what is wrong, why can the Taoiseach not tell us that is what is wrong?  If we did not agree at least we could understand.</P>
    <P>Are we being bludgeoned into doing the bidding of the British Premier? Are we being bludgeoned into doing, through his bidding, that which is felt to be conducive to satisfying the Unionists in the Six Counties?  If that is what it is please tell us.  It is not for the Government alone or even a few people in the Government to carry this burden and to make this decision without this House being fully informed and consulted.  Do not blindly go in for this sort of operation without telling us the true reasons and the causes.  If we understood fully we might not be as opposed as we are to this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is quite a lot for us to know and I do not believe for one moment that the proposals in this Bill are being <Col N="681" /> advanced only from our own needs and desires within the Twenty-six Counties.  I may be wrong but because I do not believe it I am entitled to know why.  I would even be satisfied if the Taoiseach let the facts be known in full detail to a few Members chosen from each of the Opposition parties in the House together with a few of his own Ministers.  If even a dozen people in this House could stand up here and say they had the knowledge, which back the peculiar attitudes which appear in the Government benches at this moment, I would be quite prepared to accept, although I could not see, what it was about.  I do not see any reason whatsoever for this Bill and I can only see harm in it if it is enacted.</P>
    <P>Another thing which I should mention before I conclude is that we have gone overboard in some way.  We have really gone off the track.  We have gone down the embankment somewhere along the way because not only are we at this sort of carry on here without justification, not only are we allowing, enabling and indeed bringing about the presentation of one-sided news but we are allowing as I understand it, laws of this country to be broken in allowing the circulation amongst our public of newspapers carrying advertisements for the recruiting for foreign forces.  What sort of end or attitude have we sunk to that in these circumstances and in these times we should allow to circulate amongst the people on this side of the Border big advertisements telling about the life in the Paras and the various regiments and units of the British Army, asking for recruits and enticing recruits to come over and be trained as murder gangs to be sent back to murder our own people.</P>
    <P>There is, as I understand, on the statute book a law which says that there should not and will not circulate in this State any publication which holds itself out as a recruitment document for any foreigner.  I do not see any other army advertising, incidentally&mdash;it is the British Army.  It is their preserve.  The cannon fodder of past generations is still sought and in these circumstances when they are being used, having been hurriedly <Col N="682" /> trained to be sent over either to be killed themselves or to kill Irish people in the Six Counties, if there never was any law against it, surely to God we should prevail on Mr. Heath to see to it that the Army, Navy, Air-force and the rest, for the sake of good sense, if nothing else, keep out of our papers.  Do not circulate them here.  They are not entitled to be here and it is provocative at a time like this and shows in my estimation on the Government's part a total weakness and a state of mind bordering on the subservient, if not complete and total subservience to their bosses in Great Britain.  Let us at least take these big ads out of our papers that are being sent in here; if they wish to keep sending them in with these advertisements in, keep the papers out.</P>

I do not wish to stand in their way but I do not stand up in this House, as might be implied by Deputy Desmond, merely to perform.  I have no particular wish to perform here or anywhere else.  I may appear to enjoy it but I do not like it or seek it, and in fact, over the past two and a half years, if Deputies will check&mdash;and I welcomed this debate for the reason that no limits were put on it&mdash;on the matters that really matter, they will find just how many minutes in total I had to speak here to put my point of view, which is not just mine personally but is representative of a hell of a greater and wider opinion than the numbers would seem to indicate in this House.</P>

I am not blaming the people in the media but merely remarking that there is that understanding and knowledge that the news people and feature people down there would be doing better for themselves and for the country, if they did not have much of these people because apparently it is not only Provisional and Republican people from the Six Counties who should be suppressed but anybody down here who would appear to sympathise too loudly with them.</P>

      <P>As I started last night, I ask the question: What is the Bill? What need is there for it and what are we going to do in so far as the utilisation of the powers in it are concerned? I see no need for it whatever. As to what it is, it is a repressive piece of legislation the like of which we have never experienced in this country and, indeed, I go so far as to say never experienced in any democracy in the world in our time.  It is of a nature that it can be used to suppress the right of speech and borders even on the suppression of thought.  This is what it is about; that is what it is. There is no necessity whatever for anything of that nature.  Why then should we have it?  Who is dictating the terms?  What purpose will it serve? I assert that it will serve no good purpose and, perhaps, may well do an immense amount of harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that it should be necessary for the Government to introduce legislation of this kind.  I accept wholeheartedly that the legislation is necessary and it would be my desire that everybody in the House will support it.  We live in funny times, extraordinary times.  There are some Deputies who come here and complain that opportunity is not given for people to exchange views, hear each other's views and help each other towards that which we all seek&mdash;the truth.  Apparently it has become quite the fashion now that you come in, say <Col N="685" /> what you have to say, listen to nobody else, lest you be influenced one way or the other, and speak at such length that if every Member of the House were to do the same we certainly would not feel the time passing until the general election.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney spoke about changes he had noted.  He implied that changes had occurred on this side of the House, especially in the attitude towards him.  I can say as a Member of this side of the House that my attitude towards him is identical with my attitude towards him in 1970.  Perhaps, it might help him to get to the root of the change that has occurred if I quote to him the changing attitude of people who are on the other side of the House.  Last night Deputy Thornley appeared to come to the rescue of Deputy Blaney when he thought Deputy Blaney was being attacked by his former comrades. Deputy Blaney is interested and perplexed about changes that have occurred.  In regard to his new found cheer boy, perhaps I should remind him that two years ago on the 8th May, 1970&mdash;column 813, Vol. 246, No. 7, of the Official Report, speaking about Deputy Blaney, his new custodian, the man who would now tell us that we are all without compassion, without charity, without anything that has any virtue said:</P>

In so far as I am about to develop the type of opposition we have to the Bill I assure you that I shall be quite relevant to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Criticism has been made by Deputy Blaney and by Deputy Thornley about what they consider the new powers <Col N="686" /> being given to the Garda.  As I see it, the change which is provided for allows a member of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent, to offer as evidence in court that it is his belief that a certain person is a member of a certain subversive organisation.  Contrary to what Deputy Blaney would say, I do not interpret the Bill as referring to the Provisional IRA, the Official IRA or any particular subversive organisation.  I cannot see any such reference.  Deputy Blaney and Deputy Thornley are now at one in opposing a situation in which a member of the Garda Síochána of the rank of chief superintendent, or presumably above that, could say that from evidence and information he has Mr. X was a member of a subversive organisation. I must return now to 1970 but with, I hope, every relevance.  The position in 1970 in so far as Deputy Thornley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy went down into the gutter with the housing action committee in Dún Laoghaire.  I have been endeavouring to help Deputy Blaney realise the changes that have occurred in this House.  I have been trying to pinpoint the change in the attitude of his new-found supporters towards members of the Garda Síochána.  In May, 1970, Deputy Thornley took serious issue with the then Deputy Boland who had referred in this House in what he claimed was an uncharitable fashion to a civil servant whom he claimed was responsible for activities of certain members of the Garda.  At column 808, Vol. 246, of the Official Report for 8th May, 1970, Deputy Thornley stated:</P>
      <P>If the civil servant whom Deputy Boland named in this House acted as Deputy Boland implied he acted, then the House and democracy in Ireland owe him a warm vote of thanks.</P>
      <P>I suggest this might help Deputy Blaney to interpret the changes that have occurred in the last few years and help him to identify on which side of the House those changes have occurred.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thornley, the new saviour of Ireland, the man with a monopoly of compassion especially when the Press and television cameras are present, in May, 1970, said of Deputy Blaney and the then Deputy Boland that whatever these men were dedicated to they were certainly not dedicated to the Constitution of Ireland, were not dedicated to the national Parliament or to the normal ethics of public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Thornley and Blaney will tell us we have nothing to fear from the subversives and they will say these people are doing this House a great honour by not publicly advocating the destruction of this House.  As I said to Deputy Blaney, that is very magnanimous of them.  I would remind Deputy Thornley that at the meeting he attended, it was reported in the newspapers, these people said they were out to destroy the Government <Col N="688" /> and Leinster House and wanted to get at politicians.</P>
    <P>They have attempted to get at politicians. These people talk about freedom and democracy and I hope they will practise it in the manner we adopt.  If they want to get at any politician, there is a prescribed way by which they must do it.  It is illogical, unreasonable and hypocritical for these people to try to act as saviours, pretending they are the only people concerned about republicanism and freedom and, at the same time, try to intimidate others.</P>
    <P>Because of my public office, frequently I am obliged to attend here to my duties.  It has happened that while I have been absent from my home my wife and four children, two of whom are very young, have been intimidated.  If the people who arranged for this intimidation want to get at me they should do it in the open.  They are not entitled to get at any man, whether of high station or low, political or non-political, by way of intimidation of that man's wife and children.</P>
    <P>I have as much interest in republicanism as anyone.  I have my visions of what is best for Ireland; I train my children in the manner I think best and I tell them how I hope these ideals will be realised.  My uncle and my late father were members of the real Sinn Féin.  Am I expected to put up with the situation where my children see people who masquerade under the title of Sinn Féin or Óglaigh na hÉireann try to attain freedom by way of intimidation and persecution? Where is the logic in that?  How can these people&mdash;with the backing of various groups, including the good clerics in Maynooth&mdash;think I will accept they are genuinely interested in real freedom when they pursue this by way of intimidation and violence?</P>
    <P>If I thought the bearing of a greater adversity would help in any way towards redirecting our people on the only road to lasting peace, I would be prepared to accept that adversity.  Nowadays a prison sentence is not the same as it was 50 or 60 years ago; it can be relatively comfortable.  If I thought that <Col N="689" /> serving a six months prison sentence would guarantee that we could move forward on this true road to peace then I should certainly serve it.  If I thought it would save any fellow Irishman&mdash;here I take slight issue with Deputy Blaney, any Irishman, North or South; to me there is no distinction in class or creed&mdash;from losing his life, prevent him losing a limb, or his house, I should be prepared to do it.</P>
    <P>We talk about consistency.  Deputy Desmond tells me that presently he will quote from something I said.  My memory is not wonderful but my faith in myself is such that I will defy Deputy Desmond or any other Deputy to show where since my coming here there was any inconsistency in what I have said.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote from what I said on the Estimate for the Department of Justice on 13th April this year in regard to the principle of a man being innocent until proved guilty.  Having given some thought to that principle over the last few years, I had convinced myself that, perhaps, the time had come when acceptance of that principle was no longer desirable.  This was in circumstances where the present legislation was not being discussed.  I said as reported at column 195 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>We are told that it is an accepted principle that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.  I must confess that I am having doubts as to the wisdom of acceptance of that principle....</P>
      <P>And I still have doubts.  I think it is somewhat extraordinary, bearing in mind that the fount of republicanism is to be found in France, that the great republicans we hear in this House instead of looking now at the approach to law which exists in France, seem to translate their republicanism into a desire to crucify the British Empire.  Their approach in the matter of law is that they will still continue to hold on to the law which has been given to them by their so-called enemies.</P>

      <Col N="690" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick who will be speaking later on is a legal man; unfortunately, I am not, but as regards this principle that you are innocent until proved guilty, have we not heard from that side of the House, certainly since I came in here, charges being made week after week that people were brought before the courts and were released?  Did this not in most cases spring from the fact that while those people to any layman, to neighbours or to anybody who reads the papers were, in fact, guilty, because of some legal technicality&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have not made one charge; I am simply making statements. I am anxious to probe the situation which exists now when we have so many people who are obviously at variance with each other apparently cementing themselves together.  To me that is a sinister development and as much in need of investigation as the curiosity which runs through the mind of Deputy Blaney in regard to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I want to establish that this legislation is not, as Deputy Blaney said, designed to deal with problems arising from the activities of the Provisional or the Official IRA.  I want to establish that the law is there and is necessary. My concern is more for&mdash;I do not like using the term&mdash;the ordinary person who is prepared to go about his business.  Again, I take issue with Deputy Blaney in circumstances where he would say that housing, education or jobs do not matter, that this idealistic, theoretical republicanism is all that matters.  Life is about jobs, and life is about education and housing, but not exclusively.  I do not want to see an Ireland solely concerned with these matters.  I want to see an Ireland concerned with the spiritual and cultural side as well.  However, in regard to the case Deputy Blaney makes for the immediate withdrawal of the British from the northern part of the country and for our assisting people there by means of force, there is an obligation on him to indicate what the new position will be in the event of achieving this ambition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the people who would be full of patriotic songs and would be telling me how they would free Ireland, I would ask them what their new Ireland would be like.  I would ask to visualise the new Ireland if Britain leaves tomorrow morning.  As I said in the House before, I do not want the British Army any longer than they must stay.  I do not want anything connected with England here any longer than we must have it.  But as long as I have their Army I will have their money.  The moment I do <Col N="692" /> not want their army or anything connected with them, I do not want their money.</P>
    <P>If that position arises tomorrow, how do we treat the people in that part of the country who to date have been accustomed to a certain standard of living which is provided by the subventions of the British Government? Have Deputy Blaney and the other people who want this new Ireland tomorrow planned how those of us in the Thirty-two Counties can live in a manner which would be consistent with what we deserve?  I do not know whether they are contemplating the phasing out of the subventions or their complete removal.  For my part&mdash; and this is the test I would put to the people of Ireland, the people of all groups, subversive or otherwise&mdash; would ask them, if they are as interested in the freedom of Ireland as I am, to make one sacrifice&mdash;and they should be prepared to make it&mdash;a financial sacrifice.  It would be a move towards unity, a move towards indicating to the people in the North that we are interested in deeds as well as words, if we told the British Government that next year we, the people of the Twenty-six Counties are prepared to pay £25 million as an initial step towards the phasing out of the subvention.  If we do that, then I shall be prepared to accept that we are in earnest in what we say, that we are not pursuing some myth, that we are not merely trying to get into an area of power irrespective of the consequences.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It seems to fall to my lot to speak after Deputy Neil Blaney or very shortly after him on occasions of major debate.  I think I have the doubtful privilege of speaking immediately after him on the 7th or 8th May, 1970, and on that occasion I recollect saying that I listened to the speeches of Deputy Blaney and the former Deputy Kevin Boland with considerable attention, and I entirely and utterly disagreed with the sentiments expressed by both of them but that I considered that Deputy Boland, as he then was, spoke with considerably <Col N="693" /> more sincerity.  I think events since then have proved that I was right.  Deputy Boland, in pursuing some of his beliefs, resigned from this House to vindicate those beliefs.  Deputy Blaney has had a couple of opportunities since then of expressing in a tangible way by his vote his disapproval of the Taoiseach and the members of the Government whom he denounced.  On critical occasions he failed to avail of that right and he abstained from voting.</P>
      <P>I want to repeat that I disagree with the sentiments of physical force and violence put forward on more than one occasion by Deputy Blaney. I disagree with those methods of physical force no matter in what party or by what person they are advocated. Deputy Blaney was the senior Minister in the Government party up to his dismissal and he has told us here this morning that the senior members of that Government actually brought into existence the Provisional IRA, financed the Provisional IRA and supported them with guns and money. That, in effect, was what Deputy Neil Blaney said this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is true, it is a serious charge to make against the Government, and certainly if it is true, the sooner there is a general election the better.  This party stands for and has always stood for freedom of speech and the supremacy of the ballot box, consistent with the rights to personal liberty and freedom of the individual.  In view of the trend that this debate is taking and in view of the fact that the Government, through the Taoiseach, the Minister for Labour, and other Ministers, have presented themselves here as champions of freedom, as the opponents of physical force, and are implying in some way that members of this party want to give solace to and defend the men of violence.  I want to put the record of this party on the records of this House.  The Fine Gael Party, or its predecessor under another name.  Cumann na nGaedheal, came into existence some 50 years ago to establish order, to carry out majority rule, to obey the wishes of the majority of the people <Col N="694" /> given in the ballot box.  We did just that.  We established law and order. We accepted the decision of the people.  We created the institutions of the State, including the Garda Síochána, the Irish Army and the other institutions which have stood the test of time and served the people well since then.  We did that as a constitutional party operating the Treaty negotiated with Great Britain. We did that under that Treaty which has given us, in this part of the country, every bit of freedom that we have attained, without firing one shot.</P>
    <P>In fair play, let it be said that we did that with the assistance of the only other constitutional party in the Parliament of the Twenty-six Counties at that time, the Labour Party. We were the majority party in the Dáil at that time, governing this country. The other constitutional party was the Labour Party, which constituted the Opposition.  Fianna Fáil have turned many times in their history, but they are now trying to pretend that we are not the upholders of law and order.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael are now and always have been the constitutional parties in this State which were never tainted with violence or with opposing majority rule, never tainted with defying the will of the people in this country by the gun, the bullet or the bomb.</P>
    <P>I want to go on the record as saying that there is only one party in this Dáil that I know of that ever believed in physical force, which ever defied the wishes of the majority of the Irish people, which did not accept the decision of the ballot box.  That is the Fianna Fáil Party.  A question posed by Deputy Blaney to the Government party is very significant.  He asked &ldquo;What has become of the party I used to know?  What has made them change their minds?&rdquo;  He was addressing his remarks to the Fianna Fáil Party, not of 50 years ago, but of five years ago when he was a member.</P>
    <P>This party have a proud record in regard to the defence of law and order. Let it go out from here that there are men on these benches whose families have suffered death in the defence of the ballot box, the defence of law and <Col N="695" /> order and the supremacy of the will of the Irish people.  This does not refer to one family alone.  There are numbers of Deputies on these benches whose families have suffered death in defence of law and order, majority rule and the supremacy of the ballot box.  We did all that in the 1920s notwithstanding the actions of the men of violence who were then the Fianna Fáil Party and who are now the Fianna Fáil Party.  In 1932 we set an example when the people of this country spoke again through the ballot box and said they wanted a change of government.  This party then obeyed the decision of the Irish people and handed over power to the Fianna Fáil Party in a constitutional and peaceful way.  Even in power the Fianna Fáil Party believed in force. Their supporters up and down the country were encouraged to break up Fine Gael meetings.  They broke up Opposition meetings and denied the right of free speech so that there would be only one party in this country.  In Fine Gael we defend free speech just as we defended it when in office as a Government.  We defended the Opposition. We restored their right to address meetings in public and to put their policies to the people.  We in Fine Gael always believed in law and order and in majority rule.  I want to go on record as saying that our history is that we behave that way when in power and when in opposition.</P>
    <P>We come now to the second charge which I want to make against the Fianna Fáil Party.  When they were in opposition members of that party, ex-Ministers and men who later became Ministers, encouraged violence in this country.  They encouraged the bomb and the bullet.  In fact, we in Fine Gael, in the earliest days of this State spent our time establishing majority rule.  I regret to have to say that we had to protect the minority religion from what was really a sectarian war being carried on against them by Fianna Fáil because they were supposed to uphold traditions that were not Irish, but they were doing it in a constitutional way and they were entitled to speak.  Admiral Somerville is one name which comes to mind as being a person who was murdered <Col N="696" /> by people who are now pretending to be the defenders of free speech and majority rule, and the opponents of violence.  It may be said that the Fianna Fáil Party have reformed and that they do not now believe in violence and that they are completely constitutional. If so, they had better answer the charges levelled against them this morning by Deputy Blaney that they are the founders of the IRA and that they supported the Provisional IRA with money, if they want the people to accept that they have reformed and that, as a party, they are solidly behind the policy they are seeking to put forward here.</P>
    <P>I believe the present Government have in it members who have a sneaking sympathy and a sneaking regard for the Provisional IRA and for violence. I believe that sitting behind them there are many Members who cherish in their hearts what they consider the best tradition of Fianna Fáil, the tradition of Deputy Aiken, the tradition of Deputy Smith, the tradition of Deputy Hilliard.  They are men who opposed freedom of speech and who opposed majority rule.  I could give the names of many other men sitting on those benches opposite, supporting the Government, who come from families reared in that tradition, families which opposed the ballot box in the 1920s and, from what Deputy Blaney said, it appears to me they have not changed.</P>

If that is so, then they had better answer the charges made by Deputy Blaney this morning.</P>
      <P>As recently as 1970, this Government, now posing as a constitutionally supported Government, were engaged through a number of their Ministers in attempting to undermine the security of this State.  We have heard a great deal about security since this Bill was introduced.  They were undermining the security of the State through four Ministers and others, who were arranging the illegal import into this country of arms to be used to embroil this country in a civil war with its neighbour.  That cannot be denied.  Four of these men were sacked or dismissed.  It is true that they were the men who took the action and who were caught out, but there were behind them on those benches, and they are still there, a considerable number of men who approved of their action.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I am writing into the records of this House the history of the party now masquerading as the defenders of freedom. These four men, as recently as 1970, were engaged in a plot to destroy freedom here and to embroil this country in civil war.  They were kept <Col N="698" /> in office by men who shared those views.  I believe the present Government are constituted of men who in their hearts do not believe in majority rule, who in their hearts sympathise with violence; that is the reason why, over the last three or four years, superintendents in the Garda Síochána were not allowed to arrest men engaged in illegal activities in their districts and were under instructions, at the behest of the Government, simply to report back and keep an eye on things.  That is why an armed band were allowed to encamp at Rathdrum in Wicklow for weeks, to the knowledge of the gardaí in the area, the gardaí who passed the information on to the Government, the Government who did nothing about it.  That is the reason, too, why armed men at Tyrellspass in Westmeath were allowed to behave as an army and to fire shots without any action being taken against them.  That is why armed men appeared in a graveyard in Cavan at another funeral and had no action taken against them.</P>
      <P>The Government should come clean. The Government are trying to cover up their inaction over the last three years or so by pretending now that they had not the tools to do their work and are now coming in here seeking the necessary authority.  They had the Offences Against the State Act of 1939, the Act which carried this country through the Second World War, the Act which had sufficient teeth in it to carry the country through the Second World War, maintaining relative peace here and protecting the State in those troubled times.  That Act was on the Statute Book for the last three years and it was never invoked.</P>

The people may be expected to believe that Fianna Fáil have been purged of their men of violence and that Fianna Fáil are now a constitutional party.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Government are going too far with repressive measures, and the sacking of the RTE Authority is an example of that.  Over the past three years this Government have done nothing to enforce law and order in any part of the country.  At Question Time in the past I drew attention to illegal meetings being held outside this Parliament.  Surely the machinery is there to prohibit these meetings. Surely the machinery is available to the Government in the form of statute law to prosecute those people for holding those meetings in contempt of parliament.  Why is this not being done?  Why was it not done over the past few years?</P>
      <P>It was done when the farmers came to the city because they were harmless. They were prosecuted and taken away in Black Marias for picketing this House, or for holding meetings outside it.  That reminds me of something else Deputy Blaney said this morning.  He waxed eloquent, too, about the Offences Against the State Act and said it should be done away with, that it was never intended to be used except in the most extreme circumstances.  How short is his memory?  Does he forget that he was a member of the Government who used the Offences Against the State Act against the farmers?  Can he deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, and it cannot be denied, that over the past three or four years this country has been going through difficult times.  It is a fact that the troubles in the North are in danger of overflowing in here.  The tragedy is that we have in office a Government who have not got clean hands, a Government who are tainted with the things I have been talking about.  In pursuance of their policy of defending law and order, the Fine Gael Party are prepared to give the Government reasonable machinery to enforce law and order consistent with <Col N="703" /> the preservation of the liberties of the individual.</P>
    <P>This party have been calling out for some years back for the establishment of a council composed of all parties to advise the Government and to deal with any circumstances arising out of the troubles in Northern Ireland.  That offer has been turned down, has been brushed aside.  The Taoiseach has promised, time and time again, to consult with the leaders of the Opposition parties in relation to serious matters.  He has not kept that promise. It has been said by Deputy Neil Blaney that this Bill was submitted to Deputy Cosgrave or some members of the Fine Gael Party.  I want to deny that.  I do want to say that if this Taoiseach and this Government were serious in dealing with things in a responsible way in these serious times the leaders of the Opposition parties would have been made aware of this Bill, would have been consulted about this Bill and it would not have been introduced here in its present form to create a controversial political matter.  It is not in keeping with the national interests that it should.</P>
    <P>I charge the Government and charge the Taoiseach with dereliction of duty, first of all, in not establishing a council whom he could consult about matters of supreme national importance over the years, particularly when he is a head of a Government who have the record in regard to national security that this Government have.  I charge the Taoiseach with a dereliction of duty and with creating a serious national situation by introducing this measure as a controversial political topic at this time.</P>
    <P>This Bill may lead and probably will lead to a general election.  I want to say that it is not in the national interest. No matter whether I am accused or misrepresented, it is a fact that it is not in the national interest that a general election should be fought on this Bill.  It is not in the national interest that a general election should be fought supposedly on the issue of law and order in prevailing conditions here.  It is dangerous for the country. It could have a bad end.  I am not <Col N="704" /> concerned about my seat.  I am concerned in doing what is right.  I believe that the Taoiseach should not play politics with fire and that is precisely what he is doing by refusing to consult with responsible leaders, by introducing this political hot potato and refusing to amend it and then going to the country in the dark nights of winter on a political issue like this.</P>
    <P>Let him take the consequences because he is leading a Government who have not got clean hands on this topic. He did not consult anybody and he did not take anybody's advice and he will not tolerate any amendment or suggested amendment.</P>
    <P>I have been asked what I am going to do about this Bill.  I thought before I came to that I had better present the various parties in this House in their true light and in their true tradition and as history sees them.</P>
    <P>We read this Bill in the short time at our disposal.  Certain sections of it shocked us.  We thought it necessary to put down a reasoned amendment on the Second Stage to give the Government an opportunity of withdrawing from the Bill its objectionable sections.</P>
    <P>Section 2 does nothing more or less than restate the law as it is and as it is in section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act which the Taoiseach in a very casual way said was violating the European Commission on Human Rights.  Other people in this party will deal with that and will refute it completely and utterly.  I notice it was not in the script of the Minister for Justice in proposing the Second Reading and it was thrown in very casually by the Taoiseach.  Be that as it may, section 2 is more or less a restatement of what I think is existing law.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with section 3 (1) (b).  It may not be vital but I am not happy about it because I do not think a man should have to put an advertisement in the paper to deny that he is a member of an illegal organisation just because somebody has thought fit to say that he was.  I think that is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) as it stands shifts the <Col N="705" /> onus of proof&mdash;no matter what anybody says&mdash;from the State to the accused person because it provides that hearsay evidence is evidence.  If there is evidence to be considered the onus of proof is then on the accused person to deny that and if there is no other evidence than the statement of the chief superintendent that he believes the person is a member of an illegal organisation the justice or court dealing with it must hold that it is <i>prima facie</i> evidence and unless the accused goes into evidence he must be convicted.</P>
    <P>What we want the Government to do as a minimum is to write into this subsection (2) a statement that the evidence of the superintendent shall be evidence that he was then such a member until such time as the accused person denies that on oath.  That is all we are asking.  We are asking that that protection be given to the accused person and I believe that if the person goes into the box and swears that he is not a member of the alleged illegal organisation the evidence of the chief superintendent should be neutralised.  That is all I am saying. I am not saying that it should end the case and that his statement that he is not a member of an illegal organisation should be a complete answer but I am saying that if a man or woman goes that far as to recognise the court and give it evidence on oath that he or she is not a member of an illegal organisation, that should neutralise the chief superintendent's evidence and all would be back in square one.  I do not think that is unreasonable.</P>
    <P>It has been stated here by the speakers from the Government benches, the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and others, that is what subsection (2) means.  I do not accept that.  It is <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  It shifts the onus of proof. The evidence should be neutralised if a person swears that he is not a member.</P>
    <P>If what I am saying is untrue and if it is really not <i>prima facie</i> evidence and does not shift the onus of proof. why not put that into the section?  All I am asking to be written into it is that this evidence be neutralised on the <Col N="706" /> sworn testimony of the accused person.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 4 makes it an offence for anybody to take part in any meeting at which certain things are said.  That is unreasonable.  We are notorious in this country for attending meetings.  I was talking to someone about a Sinn Féin meeting that was held and that person told me that 100 people attended the meeting but that of that number there would hardly be 25 who would be in sympathy with the sentiments expressed by the speakers. Under this section those 75 people would be guilty of an offence although they only went along out of curiosity or maybe to see somebody&mdash;for instance, Bernadette Devlin.  So far as I can see, there is no defence to this.  If a person is present at such a meeting he is guilty. Something should be written into the Bill to protect people who attend innocently.  It is sufficient to prosecute people who make speeches and who organise such meetings.  The Minister says that under the law innocent bystanders would be protected anyway; but why not write that into the Bill when we are dealing with this peculiar type of legislation?  We are told that the courts will look after innocent persons and that the judges will administer the law fairly.  But let us not forget that in certain extreme circumstances this Act may be administered, not by lawyers, but by military gentlemen.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being made portion of the law of this country and there is no time limit on it.  I believe it should have a time limit of one year.  If, at the end of one year, the Government&mdash; having amended the Bill as I suggest and as it should and must be amended &mdash;come back and tell us it is still necessary, the House would give it to them if conditions should warrant it.</P>
    <P>Those are my views on the Bill and on the present Government.  If the Minister for Justice is genuine he will accept the amendments called for by this party.  For the purpose of the record I wish to say that we could not spell those amendments out in the reasoned amendment on Second Stage because to do so would preclude us from raising them at a later stage if the <Col N="707" /> Bill should be given a Second Reading.</P>
    <P>Unless the Minister accepts the three amendments&mdash;(1) an amendment to subsection (2) giving the right to an accused person to answer a chief superintendent on oath, thereby neutralising the evidence; (2) protection for innocent bystanders at the meetings complained of; and (3) a time limit on the Bill&mdash;we will be forced in the interest of democracy and in the interest of the liberty of the individual to oppose this Bill and we will oppose it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Although much has been said regarding this Bill, much remains to be said yet.  During the past couple of days personal attacks have been made in this House on certain people.  At the outset I wish to clear the air regarding the attack made on my colleague, Deputy Thornley.  Deputy Thornley's action constituted nothing more or less significant than what transpired at the Limerick City Council on Wednesday last.  As reported in the press, the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party in Limerick, Mr. Liddy, said he subscribed to the unanimous resolution passed by the city council.  He said that his party did not see any objection to passing the resolution on humanitarian grounds, that nobody likes to see anybody dying for a cause he holds dear and that he had a high regard for fellow Irishmen, irrespective of what views they held. Mr. Liddy said that, on behalf of Limerick City Council, he was pleading with the Taoiseach and the Minister on humanitarian grounds to release Seán Mac Stiofáin.  I subscribed to that resolution and I introduced the deputation.  The resolution was subscribed to also by the Fine Gael members present.  Deputy Thornley has been accused of being a member of the Provisional IRA because of his attendance at the hospital on humanitarian grounds.  If that is so, the same must apply to the members of Fianna Fáil in Limerick who were associated with the resolution I have referred to. There is no point in any of us trying to pull the wool over people's eyes by misrepresenting the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Mr. Mac Stiofáin has been accused of murder and of trying to create civil war in this part of the country. I am not acquainted personally with this gentleman so I must go on what is said by his legal advisers and I quote from today's <i>Irish Times:</i></P>
    <P>Mr. Shevlin told reporters outside the hospital that Mr. Mac Stiofáin had given the following message for the people outside.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the name of God, I want the people out on the streets protesting on my behalf.  I want all protests to be peaceful, by which I mean no rioting, no stone-throwing, no abuse or name-calling of 26-county forces.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The fight is centred in the North and must be kept there.  I do not want anybody hurt or blood spilled on my behalf in the Twenty-six Counties.  That is why I am taking liquids.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Can anything be more specific than that?  Can anything more than that be expected?</P>
    <P>I accuse the Taoiseach and his party of introducing this Bill as a political election gimmick.  It is a gimmick because the Government know well that their days in office are numbered.  They know they have failed the Irish people. They have deceived them and have not lived up to their promises in regard to social benefits and all the other promises they made.  They have turned a blind eye to the economic position. They now see that the people are only waiting for a chance to go to the polling booths.</P>
    <P>There are very few members of the Government who were in this House when I had to suffer, first of all, under the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1931, when we were pulled in to account for our movements.  In 1932 there was a general election and we were told: &ldquo;Put out the Cumann na nGaedheal Government and we will open the prison gates.  We will open Arbour Hill.  We will release all your friends.  We will put an end to the Public Safety Act&rdquo;.  I want to put it on the record of this House that the pioneer of that deceit was Deputy Frank Aiken.  I was a young man at that time and I believed what I was told.  I voted for the first time in 1932 and did not <Col N="709" /> again cast my vote until 1948.  Fianna Fáil were in Government in 1932 and within one year we had the internment camps thrown open again.</P>
    <P>I want the people of Ireland to understand all this.  The gimmick which is now being foisted on the people will be misrepresented on television, on radio and in the press and the innocent people will be asked: &ldquo;What do you want?  Do you want Fianna Fáil back to protect your rights or do you want men like Mac Stiofáin and others?&rdquo; In this morning's press we are told how he made his position clear yesterday afternoon.  As Deputy Blaney rightly said, there never was or never will be a gun turned by Irishmen on anybody in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>We had the unfortunate incident in the cinema last Sunday.  The people who have been accused of perpetrating that act have denied it.  It is very easy to point a finger at somebody, but when you get around to prove the inaccuracy of that statement the message has gone so far that it is almost impossible to bring the truth before the people.  This Bill is being introduced to bring about the introduction of internment in a roundabout way.</P>
    <P>Two years ago the Minister for Justice stated one Sunday night on the television news that internment was about to be introduced.  The Labour Party challenged him on that and some of us were suspended because of the manner we opposed the Government.  I was one of the people who was suspended on that occasion.  We brought home to the Government that there would be no internment in the Republic.</P>
    <P>What have we now?  In this Bill we have unusual power given to chief superintendents.  Those people have only got to do what they are told.  They have only to go to a person and point a finger at him and say <i>&ldquo;Ecce homo</i>&mdash; behold the man&rdquo;.  The man is brought in to the Garda station and charged. How can he defend himself and prove his innocence?  If he brings in a noted member of any of those organisations who can say: &ldquo;I know he is not a member of this organisation&rdquo; the man who says that can himself be automatically <Col N="710" /> charged.  If he knows the accused man is not a member of the illegal organisation, he himself must be a member of it.</P>
    <P>In last night's <i>Evening Press</i> a district justice, a man on the bench&mdash;I do not know how long he has been on the bench but he is administering the law&mdash;writing as a private individual, expressed &ldquo;his disquiet at the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill presently before the Dáil&rdquo;.  He is Mr. Michael Sweetman of Taney Road, Dundrum, Dublin, and in his letter, he says he did not believe that he or indeed any readers could possibly prove that they were not members of the Provisional IRA any more than they could prove that they were not members of the British Secret Service. He continued:</P>
    <P>The object of this strange legislation appears to be to give powers of internment of suspected IRA men to the police for whose actions the Minister is responsible while making a clever and ruthless effort to pass the onus of making the order for imprisonment to a judge for whose actions the Minister is not responsible.</P>
    <P>Every judge before his appointment makes a solemn declaration that he will without fear or favour administer justice in accordance with the law but what can he do if faced with what many lawyers believe and perhaps he himself believes to be an unjust law?  Each judge must handle that dilemma on his own.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Mr. Sweetman says:</P>
    <P>I ask you to publish this letter before the Bill is passed in its present form.  Otherwise I will be risking imprisonment for myself and perhaps for you too.</P>
    <P>That is what a member of the bench has to say about this Bill and I am wondering what the Minister, who is legally minded, and the Attorney General were doing or why they did not see what this district justice reads into their actions today.  Rightly, he says it is another way of creating an internment crisis here.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Government of <Col N="711" /> the consequences of internment.  During the recent past, in the middle of the forties, we had internment.  What did it lead to?  It led to hunger strikes, to death on hunger strike; five gallant men died on hunger strike.  What else did it lead to?  It led to executions, with the hangman brought over from England to hang a particular friend of mine in this very month of December. Surely to God it is only a fool will make the same mistake the second time and this is exactly what Fianna Fáil are doing now.  Let them not say they were not told, advised and warned of the consequences of this action.</P>
    <P>I would direct the Government's attention to a matter which is of much more importance than the introduction of this internment Bill.  It is well known to them.  No later than 12th November, I received a letter from a Redemptorist priest who has experienced it and is living with it in Belfast and has been living with it since 1969.  <i>Inter alia</i>, this is what he says:</P>
    <P>There is the difficulty of course that due to censorship of the Irish news media people in the Twenty-six Counties are not given a fair chance of forming a clear picture in their minds of what is really happening in the Six Counties.  I wonder, for instance, how many know that the Convent of the Sisters of Charity in the Falls Road area was raided this week in the early hours of the morning by British soldiers looking for arms and how many know that a few weeks ago Clonard Monastery was surrounded by British Army tanks at 3 a.m. and had vaults and cellars thoroughly searched by soldiers using a dog because according to their officer, the Protestant people of the Shankill had passed on reliable information that illegal arms were stored there.  Nothing was found. Headlines like &ldquo;Early Morning Swoop on Convent by British Army&rdquo; and &ldquo;British Soldiers Raid Monastery&rdquo; in the Irish newspapers and news bulletins would be revealing and informative but for whatever reason the truth is denied our people. Consequently they do not know the injustices that are being inflicted on <Col N="712" /> the Irish nationalists in the Six Counties where, for example people, particularly young men, living in Catholic housing estates are continually harassed, humiliated, beaten, interrogated and tortured for the crime of failing to co-operate with the security forces.  Failing to co-operate means refusing to turn informer.</P>
    <P>Further on, he says:</P>
    <P>Given these and other similar facts one readily understands why victims of this official violence, having no court of appeal, grow frustrated in their desperation, perfectly good people will do things which they would never dream of doing in a normal society.</P>
    <P>There is the written word of a Redemptorist priest to me who has been experiencing hardship, harassment, and all the things he says there since 1969, and what have Fianna Fáil and the Taoiseach done about it? When I put down a question here a fortnight ago on that matter, why something was not being done, I got a reply that the question would not be allowed as the matter was not within the jurisdiction.  Now where do we go? Are they Irishmen or are they not? Do we speak for the Thirty-two Counties of Ireland, with all its islands and whatever else goes with it or not? Is it because a convent is torn to pieces, because a monastery is torn to pieces at 3 o'clock in the morning, that we have to sit down&mdash;not stand idly by; you can do something if you are standing&mdash;and shut up, which is exactly what the Fianna Fáil Government are doing today on this issue?</P>

      <P>It has this much to do with it, that I want to try to put over as best I can the trials and rigours our fellow Irishmen are undergoing today and that nothing is being done by the Government to highlight these persecutions not alone to the people creating them, the British Government, but to the world at large. Nothing is being done.  I say to them <Col N="713" /> that they would be doing a damn greater service to the people of Ireland if they applied themselves along these lines instead of locking up young men and women in internment camps. I have been associated with republicanism for 40 years.  I have experience of what has been done.  A former Taoiseach, whenever the question was raised: &ldquo;What are you doing about the Border?  What are you doing about solving Partition?&rdquo; always said: &ldquo;We never let an occasion go without bringing forward the question of Partition.&rdquo; That is all we ever got.  That is all I ever read in the papers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>And what it will lead to, I suggest.  In every age and in every cycle since the introduction of Partition 50 years ago, men and women have stood up and opposed it in one way or another, but never was there such a concentrated effort made as is being made at present.  The Fianna Fáil Government are baulking the effort&mdash;not because they want to do it, not because it gives them any pleasure to do it, but because they must do it and Mr. Heath has called the tune.  Everybody knows that.  But the tragedy of it is that in their presentation of this issue to the people it will be coloured, manoeuvred, misrepresented and bamboozled, as is typical of the Fianna Fáil approach. People will be asked: &ldquo;Do you want stable Government?  Do you want law and order?  or do you want disorder and the gun?&rdquo; There is nothing further from the truth and the Parliamentary Secretary who is now present and who lives with the situation knows in his heart that what I say is true and cannot be denied, that we are leading to the internment camp again.  We are on our way to it whether it be Arbour Hill, which is being renovated at present, whether it will be Ballykinlar or maybe it will be a prison ship, because there will be such overcrowded conditions they will have to find a way out.  Then what is going to happen?  Then you will have your escalation.  Then you will <Col N="714" /> have the people on the streets and the hunger strikes and the executions as you had in the mid-1940s.  I went through that and I am not so stupid that I do not know that the nature and the calibre of the Irish people has not changed in that short time.</P>
      <P>I want to dissociate myself from the statements made here yesterday with regard to the clergy and the hierarchy of our country.  Maybe it should not be mentioned, it was so vile and so scurrilous. It descended to the sewer level. It should be beyond contempt and ignored.  Maybe I should leave it as it is, but the thing is so repulsive and so stomach-upsetting that I must come out and denounce the statements that were made in this House yesterday.  No men are doing as much today to try to focus attention on the situation in the Six Counties as the clergy and the hierarchy.  If only Fianna Fáil went half the road with what the clergy and hierarchy are doing we would not be in this position today.  They have been foremost in their leadership on this issue.  It ill becomes any Member of this House to denounce them.  Let me completely divorce myself from and condemn what was said yesterday with regard to our priests and hierarchy.  I am no saint. Nobody here is, I presume.  They would not be here otherwise.</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary does not have to tell the Ceann Comhairle anything with regard to procedure in this House.  He is a fair-minded man and he will not take dictation or suggestions from any side of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is meant by being near to a place?  If I have to go to a creamery 1½ miles away with a donkey and cart, that can be quite a distance for the donkey, who has to bear the burden of heavy milk cans.  However, 1½ miles would be a very short distance <Col N="716" /> for the Parliamentary Secretary in his Mercedes.  How can the Government specify what is meant by being near to a certain place?  It could be said that if a person thinks about something he is very near to it mentally. This legislation is another way of introducing internment.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;give an account of your recent movements&rdquo; has been used.  I should like to know what that means.  In the last fortnight a woman was charged because of something she said more than a year ago and recently Seán Mac Stiofáin was asked to account for his movements.  Is a man who does a hard day's work supposed to carry a diary in his pocket setting out what he did at certain hours?  Will he have to do this for as long as this legislation is in existence?</P>
    <P>I want answers to these question because I consider I am involved in this. I may be asked to account for my movements but I will not do it.  I can be near a place, I can be pulled in, be accused and be sent to an internment camp.  This applies to everyone in the Republic of Ireland.  Can any member of Fianna Fáil deny that this is not leading to internment camps? The Government should tell us what they are doing.  They should be honest and tell us that they want to lock up some people in our society. They will rue the day they do what they did in the forties.  In 1948 we showed the Government what it was about; we threw them out of office and the sooner we do that again the better.</P>
    <P>In his many meetings with Mr. Heath why has the Taoiseach not insisted that if he interns people here or if he extradites people Mr. Heath will have to ensure that all his people in the North hand in their guns?  Have not the UDA and other bodies paraded in public in battledress?  Have they not destroyed people's homes because they did not share their beliefs?  What did the Taoiseach do about that?  He did not stand idly by&mdash;he just sat and kept his mouth shut.</P>

      <P>It is all interrelated. This measure is camouflaged behind a smokescreen, namely, that the Government want law and order. Everyone wants law and order, except, perhaps, a few skinheads.  They used to be known as teddyboys or razor blade gangs, next year they will adopt a different approach.  They are wayward boys and girls who will conform in time but they go through these phases.</P>
      <P>It is inherent in every Irishman to abide by the law and to conduct himself. I should like to repeat what the priest said:</P>
      <P>Given these and other similar facts, one readily understands why victims of this official violence, having no court of appeal, grow frustrated.  In their desperation perfectly good people will do things which they would never dream of doing in normal society.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil are doing nothing about this.  We will live to see the day when there will be a repetition of what happened in the forties in connection with internment.  Let the Government camouflage this as much as they like. Let them call it any other name&mdash;it will smell the same, it is internment and nothing else.  Everyone should realise this fact.  We cannot stress sufficiently that this legislation has been introduced for one purpose&mdash;to legalise internment. Let the Fianna Fáil Party know and live with that fact.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to one incident which occurred at the Seán Mac Stiofáin trial.  A tape was produced at that trial and was accepted in evidence against Mr. Mac Stiofáin.  Who knows who made that tape?</P>

I appeal to the Government, for once in their history to put the good, the prosperity and the unity of the people before the ambition of their own party and to keep matters such as this where they belong as regards priority.  Surely this is something that is unnecessary and uncalled for.

      <P>I heard Deputy Blaney this morning with his anatomy of violence and he presented his pen-picture of the North which is true in many ways and we can well understand that because of what is happening in the North we should have an overspill of trouble here.  He also told us that the Bill is directed against the IRA, whether Provisional or Official.  The Bill is an attempt to keep all violent organisations whether subversive or otherwise in check and under supervision.  He also stated that the British Prime Minister had some influence on the Bill.  The law here has to be applied to any organisation which sets out to violate the liberty or the safety of the people.  It will be applied to the UDA or UVF just as honestly and effectively as to either branch of the IRA.  It will also be applied to the British army should they again cross the Border and they will have their vehicles seized as they were seized on a previous occasion and brought to Dundalk.</P>
      <P>To suggest there is any British influence on this Bill is just laughable; to suggest that it is an attempt to curb the liberty of the people is also laughable. When this Bill is defeated, principally at the instance of Fine Gael, it will not have been defeated on its merits or demerits but because the Fine Gael Party were unable to resolve their internal difficulties.  Had they done so, this Bill would have been supported.  It is altogether wrong that a party, because of internal trouble, should use the people of this part of the country as hostages to fortune.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough.  I want to ask a member like Deputy FitzGerald, who is my colleague in Dublin South-East, if the need for this Bill has not been brought home to him when in our own constituency last Saturday night or Sunday morning some organisations&mdash;I do not know who they were but I hope they will be brought to justice&mdash;planted a bomb in a Dublin cinema not very far from here and maimed many people?  Deputy Sherwin assured us last night that everything was peaceful here and that there was no need for this measure. Also last Sunday a mob attempted to attack the Mater Hospital.  If they went there because a man was dying on hunger strike and prayed outside one could perhaps forgive them, but when they went there threatening and chanting &ldquo;we are coming in&rdquo; while there were 400 to 500 defenceless patients in there maybe some of them dying or <Col N="722" /> have died since, you can picture the frightful atmosphere in that hospital. Take another instance in my own area last Sunday night when an elderly woman, because she displayed a referendum poster in her window, was approached by five young braves and interrogated.  Her only offence was that, in common with the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour Parties she supported the referenda.</P>
      <P>When such people come to Deputies' houses and picket them&mdash;they can picket my house 24 hours a day if they want to&mdash;it will not bother me, but when they terrify people in neighbouring houses by their picketing I shall certainly do anything I can to stop them.  There are elderly people who live near me and they see this happening, and not very far from me a member of the judiciary is going through the same thing and his wife and family are being terrorised.  Then Fine Gael say this Bill is not necessary, that the existing law should be applied.  It is because the Government know the present law is inadequate that they have introduced this Bill, not because they want to hold on to power or because they want to penalise anybody.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned earlier, this Bill may well be defeated and then the people will have the opportunity of deciding on it.  When I say &ldquo;the people&rdquo; I mean the mass of the people, not the intellectuals who have protested against this Bill, not the various societies who turn up at every protest and try to lecture the masses on how they are being exploited by the Government.  I hope that in the next few weeks people will have this opportunity of giving their decision on whether or not they think this Bill is necessary or whether it is perfect or imperfect.  I do not think you could have any better brand of democracy in the world than that of asking the people to decide by their votes at the ballot box whether the Government should be returned or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney chided us because, as he said, we have become affluent and therefore have lost interest in the North, that we wanted to keep our own little cotton wool world down here and did not want to be <Col N="723" /> bothered with the troubles in the North.  This is most unfair.  The people in this part of the country have at all times helped the people in the North and are still doing it.  Maybe the help is not adequate.  I do not know what help would be adequate. We could only work in the best way possible for peace in the North and, in the meantime, ensure that any person who is persecuted by the British paratroops&mdash;and some of them are being persecuted&mdash;would not be penalised further by the lack of money, food or anything else.  The people in the South will never deny that help to them, but they do not want to see a repetition of last Saturday night's ocurrence in the cinema or last Sunday's occurrence at the Mater hospital. Who can blame them for that? Surely they have a right to seek to live in peace here.  This Bill will ensure that they are given further protection from subversive elements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney said&mdash;this point may not be quite relevant but I refer to it only because Deputy Blaney mentioned it&mdash;that only for the violence in the North the Taoiseach would not have had the opportunity of seeing the British Prime Minister.  I can recall a previous Taoiseach who went to Downing Street and came back with a settlement in 1938 which at that time, was, and still is, a tremendous achievement.  Britain then believed that the Northern bases were very valuable for her Navy.  We know that at present they are useless and that if the British Government could slip out tomorrow they would.  The point is that these things can be achieved by peaceful means.  The Taoiseach can emulate the achievement of his predecessor, Mr. Eamon de Valera.  I hope that soon we shall have the people's solution to the Northern problem, but in the meantime I do not think the people here should be criticised for their lack of support of the North.  It is inherent in our very nature for us to help an underdog.  We can help the people in the North by supporting this Bill.  This will ensure that the local subversives and the UDA and the UVF, which may become as big a threat as the <Col N="724" /> others, will be kept in check.  Many of the people, North and South, do not want violence.  The Members of the House who are going to vote against the Bill, unless they give better reasons that they have given so far for so doing, must stand before the jury of the people in the next few weeks and say why they did not support the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is as simple as that.  No amount of wriggling on the part of some of the Fine Gael Members will distort the image which they have before the people.  The question is whether one supports this Bill as an effort to ensure that our people will be given all the support possible against subversive organisations.  People may ask what the row is all about.  They may ask whether this Bill will limit the liberties of any subject.  Most of our people go about their daily business and they want to see a united Ireland wherein each one of them, and their children, will have a good living and wherein they will be able to create a society such as our predecessors fought for.  We cannot go along the road to this society if we deny the people the liberty to which they are entitled.  We hear quite a lot today from the liberals who say that the freedom of the individual is in danger. What about the freedom, dignity and safety of the people in the Dublin cinema last week or in the Mater Hospital?</P>
    <P>The message which we wish to get over to the people is that this is a democracy and that a democracy is worth preserving and must be preserved.  We are not going to stand and see our country destroyed by a small minority. The Members of this House must make up their minds on the merits or demerits of this Bill.  I suppose no Bill is perfect and any Bill may have defects. Deputies should not fiddle about with possible deficiencies in the Bill while a cinema burns or a hospital is attacked. I am amazed at the attitude of the Fine Gael Party.  In my own area I have been lectured for many years by their Deputies about how they are the great upholders of law and order and how they carried the banner of law and order in this country.  One can now see <Col N="725" /> that they are no longer the people to do that.  They see some advantage in joining the so-called liberals in opposition to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have received some letters and a telegram from people who are certainly not subversives.  These people are entitled to their views.  I find it much more educational to speak to the people in the streets, listening to their attitudes to the Government proposals on this Bill and to the Opposition attitude.  A man stopped me this morning and he wanted support for Government action. He was not an intellectual but just an ordinary Dubliner who had few possessions. This man had a family and a home, in themselves vital possessions, and he was wiser in his way than the Deputies in this House or the intellectuals outside it who are opposing this Bill.  His advice was that the Taoiseach should go to the country and give the people an opportunity to give, in no uncertain terms, their opinions on this Bill and the Opposition attitude to it. Nothing could be fairer than that.  The people in the streets will record their verdict.</P>
    <P>The Chair has been indulgent to most speakers.  We have wandered far from the actual wording of the Bill.  This is a very short Bill but it is amazing what people read into it.  Some people tell us that we are facing domesday as regards liberty.  This is the greatest nonsense ever.  We heard similar views in regard to the Forcible Entry Bill.  This Bill may give some help to the people.  As the Taoiseach said, it may get at the leaders of some of the subversives.  I am talking about the type of person who organises the picketing of houses and who gets other people, who are more innocent than themselves, to do something wrong.  They are then brought away and charged but the real instigators go scot-free all the time. Under our present laws they cannot be apprehended.  They are encouraging some of the youth of this city to violence.  They see a good opportunity of using the youth to gain their own ends.</P>
    <P>It is a duty on this House as the national Parliament to do anything we can by way of legislation to ensure that our society gives utmost liberty.  When <Col N="726" /> I talk of liberty I refer to the people who cry out from the house-tops that their liberty may be infringed.  Many people have had their liberty infringed already.  They have been threatened. Their houses have been picketed.  They have been intimidated in other ways.</P>

      <P>The point is that the Opposition will do anything but debate this Bill.  They resolutely refuse to get down to discussing the merits of the Bill.  This House may decide to reject this measure.  In a way, it will be a good thing if it does because then a bigger jury will be asked to decide on it in a short time.  The Bill has been misrepresented since its publication. The heartening thing is that since the speeches of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and other Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party the people are now beginning to realise that an attempt was made to mislead them, and the sooner they are given an opportunity to show what they think of those Members of this House who tried to mislead them, the better it will be.  If there is an election any of us may be casualties, but that does not matter, what matters is that the people have been ensured the right of going to the ballot box and there clearly demonstrating how they think democracy should be protected.  The latter is what the Government have set out to do.  If an election comes, the Opposition will be asked to render an account.  We shall have some very pertinent questions to ask the Opposition, especially in the more affluent areas in which they have always proclaimed themselves as standing for the right to private property and everything else.  We will ask them if they have abandoned these principles.  We <Col N="727" /> will ask them if they have cast off their tradition and have become liberals in the sense in which that word is understood today.</P>

      <P>Deputy Moore must be talking about Deputy P.J. Burke's area when he talks about the affluent society he hopes to impress.  This should be a very serious discussion. This is a very critical time.  I have been appalled by some of the speeches made from the Government benches. I refer in particular to Deputy Dowling's contribution.  He never once referred to the Bill.  His entire speech was devoted to &ldquo;slagging&rdquo; the Opposition. We have heard that speech before from Deputy Dowling and we were not surprised when he repeated it yesterday evening.  What did surprise me and what did upset me was the Minister for Finance coming in later and making Deputy Dowling's speech all over again.</P>

      <P>It was completely out of character for the Minister for Finance.  He told us nothing about the Bill.  He spent himself hammering at the Opposition.  I admit the Opposition were a bit unruly in interrupting and that, perhaps, aggravated things, but this whole matter is far too serious to be dealt with in the way in which the Minister for Finance dealt with it.  Indeed, some Deputies seem to derive some pleasure and some amusement out of that approach to this very serious piece of legislation. Deputy Moore comes along now and he says all Fine Gael are concerned about is to try to establish that they are the party of law and order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>When I got my copy of this Bill I <Col N="728" /> read it slowly and carefully.  I did not have the benefit of any legal training and I had no more than the knowledge of the ordinary Deputy in regard to the legislation that is in existence, legislation designed to enable the Government to deal with unlawful organisations.  My first reaction to the Bill was that my hackles rose against it.  I believe that would also be the reaction of the average person.  It is possible that, not being a legal man, I read more into the Bill than it actually contained, but that is the way it affected me and that is the way, I believe, it affects the majority of the people: I said immediately: &ldquo;The Government have gone berserk.  The Government have suddenly wakened up to the realisation that they have allowed a serious situation to develop because of their own inaction over the last three or four years.  They are now in a state of panic and they cannot see clearly what legislation they require to deal with this situation, a situation in which everything seems to be tumbling down around their ears.  They do not know how to cope with the situation or how to contain it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I may be right in that, or I may be wrong, but that was the effect it had on me.  I was convinced that the legislation available to the Government three or four years ago&mdash;it is actually still available to them&mdash;was more than adequate to deal with the situation, a situation engendered because of Government inactivity.  But the situation was even worse than that. It was well known that there were within the Fianna Fáil Party certain people actively assisting unlawful organisations.  Those people constituted a sizeable section of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Can the Government blame us now if we criticise them when they come in here for emergency legislation to deal with the situation which they irresponsibly allowed to build up?  I do not think they can. I do not think they should be surprised that we are fearful of giving them more legislation than is absolutely necessary to deal with the situation. We have seen them both underuse and misuse the powers they have. I emphasise &ldquo;under-use&rdquo; and &ldquo;misuse&rdquo;. <Col N="729" /> That is why we are apprehensive. That is why we are slow to give them the green light.</P>
    <P>It is quite wrong for Deputy Moore to allege that Fine Gael are here for no other reason but to oppose this Bill.  We are not here for anything of the sort.  We have clearly spelled out the position taken up by this party on this Bill.  We do not say that no part of this Bill is not necessary.  We are quite prepared to examine it critically and we have enough legal brains on this side of the House to assist us in making up our minds.  We have Deputies, like Deputy Moore, coming in here and saying: &ldquo;We want the Bill. We cannot do without it&rdquo;.  The fact is they do not explain why they cannot do without it and they do not explain how much further we must go if we are to do a really effective job in dealing with unlawful organisations.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill.  The Minister made a very long statement on it but I do not think he succeeded in clarifying people's minds.  The Taoiseach made light of certain sections of the Bill and seemed to explain them away with a wave of his hand.  On several occasions I have been told by legal people outside this House that they do not care a damn what the Minister or the Taoiseach said in the House, and that it is what is written in the Bill that is important.  As a responsible party we cannot allow a measure to pass through the House which says something which is explained away, or attempted to be explained away, by the Minister when he is introducing it, when he has not written it in, or is not prepared to write it into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not deny that there is a dangerous situation here, a situation which has been allowed irresponsibly to build up by the Government.  We warned them on several occasions that they were allowing the situation to get out of hand.  We asked them continuously to use the law available to them and they did not use it.  We implored them to increase the strength of the Garda force and the Army and to equip them properly.  All these matters have been neglected.  Is it any wonder that lawlessness could develop and thrive in such a situation, when we have <Col N="730" /> an insufficient police force and Army, obviously an easy target for any lawless group to take on.  The Government cannot complain if we criticise them bitterly.</P>
    <P>I thought the position of this party was spelled out as clearly as possible and that there could be no ambiguity. I do not think there is.  There are people on the other side of the House who are deliberately setting out to misrepresent us.  The attitude of every member of this party is that, whatever Government are in power, they must be given sufficient authority to carry out the mandate of the people, and to maintain law and order and respect for the institutions of the State.  We all feel a sincere responsibility to ensure that they have that authority.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the failure of the Government in the past, regardless of who is responsible for putting us in the position we are in now, we have a duty and a responsibility to look at the situation as it exists today.  That is the attitude of responsible politicians. We are elected to carry out the will of the people and we must insist that we have whatever legislation is necessary to do just that.  The Government have not told us in detail what they feel is the additional legislation they require.  They have thrown this Bill at us and said it is that or nothing.  They cannot maintain that stand.  When I looked at this Bill I thought that it was surely the legislation of a police state.  Can I be blamed if I read too much into it?  If I did not read too much into it, why can the Government not give us our amendments? In what way would they weaken this measure?  I do not think they would weaken it at all.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is the definition section. We are prepared to give the Government section 2.  On section 3 we start to disagree with the Government.  In section 3 (1) (b) there is a word none of us likes, the word &ldquo;omission&rdquo;. It provides:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an illegal organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself <Col N="731" /> be conclusive.</P>
    <P>In his statement the Minister for Justice makes light of this and says that if a person for any reason was unaware that a statement was made about him he cannot commit a sin, so to speak, by omission.  It should be easy to rectify that.  It is only common sense that it should be written into the Bill as a safeguard.  That is a very minor thing.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 (2), if a chief superintendent says he believes John Murphy is a member of an illegal organisation, that will be accepted as evidence, full stop.  We cannot accept this because it smacks of the law of a police state.  The Taoiseach makes light of this, too, and says it is subject to cross-examination, and that the evidence of anybody else who is brought in will be considered.  We are asking for something quite simple in order to safeguard the individual who may be innocent.</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister quoted section 26 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  It provides:</P>
    <P>...Chief Superintendent states on oath that he believes that such document was published (as the case may be) by the accused or by the accused in concert with other persons or by arrangement between the accused and other persons, such statement shall be evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and this is the important thing</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;(until the accused denies on oath that he published such document either himself or in concert or by arrangement as aforesaid) that the accused published such document as alleged in the said statement on oath of such officer.</P>
    <P>We are suggesting that this should be brought into this Bill as well as a safeguard, and that the undue significance given to the evidence of a chief superintendent should disappear, or that it should be possible to get a proper abutment by the accused.  The Government cannot see that it is important to safeguard the individual by allowing him to swear that what the <Col N="732" /> chief superintendent believes to be true is false&mdash;that is all we are asking for&mdash; and that it then ceases to be evidence once the accused says on oath that this is not so and that he is not guilty.</P>
    <P>I do not think it would require any great effort on the part of the Government to agree that this represents an improvement in the legislation they are asking the House to give them.  When they consider the issue seriously and look at the legislation in existence at the moment, I am sure they will agree that it is only right and proper that this should be written in.  That is our main bone of contention in this Bill. We are standing on this and we must stand on it.</P>
    <P>We are not quite satisfied with section 4 because again we want the rights of any individual to be safeguarded. We do not want a situation where a person walking along the street, stops at a meeting and listens and thus puts himself in the position that he may find himself in court and in jail.  We are asking that that danger be removed and that a person cannot be committed simply for attending a meeting.  A person might be there accidentally or he might go there to hear what this crazy group or person had to say and would feel entitled to do that.  Everybody is entitled to hear what somebody else has to say.  That comes under the right of free speech.  I do not think it is too much.  Deputy P. J. Burke agrees with me.  I am sure that individuals on his benches and Ministers, and even perhaps the Minister for Justice, will agree.  They will say, of course, that when the matter comes to the court the person will get out of his trouble.  Of course he will, but I say that is no good if it is not written into the Bill. It is the simplest matter to write that safeguard into the Bill.  I hope some sensible Minister, or the Minister for Justice when he comes to reply, will say that they accept that this is easy, that it is right and proper, that the Minister for Justice will say that it is in his statement and that he has no hesitation in having it written into the Bill.  That is the sort of assurance we want.</P>
    <P>Our opposition to this Bill is by no means wholesale opposition to any <Col N="733" /> measure that is necessary to contain the dangerous situation the country is in at the moment.  We realise and recognise that this is emergency type legislation, that it is repressive legislation. We do not want repressive legislation for one hour longer than it is necessary to have it because the more repressive the legislation the more likely it is to beget violence. Of course, unreasonable people must be dealt with but, as I say, Fianna Fáil have a great deal to blame themselves for and the situation we are in is largely due to the fact that they have neglected their responsibility over a period of four or five years. It is due also, I have no doubt, to British misunderstanding of the situation in the North of Ireland and their stupidity in thinking they will ever solve the Irish question by force of British arms and by their presence in the North.  Until that is realised, as well as the fact that we are not standing here on this side of the Border for lawlessness of any description, we will never see the end of this.</P>
    <P>We want a time limit on this legislation. None of us would like to see it in existence an hour longer than is seen to be absolutely essential.  We might be prepared in the first instance to give it a life of 12 months&mdash;six months perhaps&mdash;but certainly not more than 12 months when we all hope sanity will have returned to all parts of the country, and peace and security and normal living.  It would be to anticipate something that none of us wants to think possible to make it for longer than 12 months.</P>
    <P>That is our opposition to the Bill and I do not want any Member on the other side of the House, Deputy Moore or anybody else, trying to interpret our attitude in any other way. That is what we want.  We have clearly stated it and I regret to say that the Government have not clearly stated to us in what dimension the law as it stands today is short.  We have legal men on this side of the House who have reached the top flight of their profession and they feel that, with these amendments and with the sections and subsection of the Bill, we are already prepared to accept the position is truly and properly taken <Col N="734" /> care of and that no further excuse lies with the Government for failing in their duty to the people.</P>
    <P>There will be other speakers after me and they may help to reinforce what I have said.  They may help to clarify what I have said.  Quite frankly, it is wrong for any speaker on any side of the House to go back over the history of the last 50 years, a history in which we would come out pretty well, but it is not appropriate to the occasion of this Bill that that history should be trampled over and over again and that the bitterness of the past should be resurrected for a variety of purposes.  We are here at a time when great responsibility is called for.  We should deal with this measure in the most responsible way, in the most critical way.  One of the things that convinced me was what the Minister said about a case of a lady where they failed to get a conviction on membership. I believe the law should be such that it is possible to convict such a person as a member of an unlawful organisation, a person who comes out openly and says that he or she is a member; not only that but that his or her purpose is to unseat the lawful authority in this part of the country. Certainly, when it can be shown that the existing law is inadequate to deal with that sort of situation we in this House should give any necessary improvement in the law to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in moving the Second Reading:</P>
    <P>The provisions of the section reenact as accurately as possible that branch of the law of contempt of court which relates to comments on a case that is <i>sub judice.</i>  Such conduct is ordinarily dealt with summarily by the court in relation to which the offence of contempt is committed.  It might therefore be asked why it is necessary to create a specific statutory offence to deal with this kind of conduct.  The answer is that the extent to which these activities have been carried on in recent years, their increasing seriousness and the fact that they are frequently planned and organised for the clear purpose of subverting justice in relation to members of <Col N="735" /> unlawful organisations make it right, in the Government's view, to prevent the activities by making them the subject of a statutory offence that can be prosecuted in the ordinary way and that is punishable with suitably severe penalties.</P>
    <P>I agree very strongly with that statement. I have in mind the protests carried on in the Curragh in the last few months when contingents came down from the North of Ireland and confronted our Army personnel.  I have received reliable and accurate descriptions of those protests.  We should not deny any Government the necessary legislation to deal effectively with such people.  Their conduct was deplorable. Our Army should not be subjected to that sort of conduct.  It is not right that people can get away scotfree having conducted themselves in such a manner. The same applies in the case of the Garda Síochána.  They should not be open to a similar measure of assault from lawless persons who can then go free anywhere they like.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to support any improvement necessary in the legislation to deal with that sort of thing and I am sure that goes for every Member of this Parliament.  We wish to ensure that the forces of law and order get the support they need to carry out their work on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made clear the purpose of the extent of our opposition to this measure.  I hope, too, that when he is replying, the Minister for Justice will see the wisdom of accepting the alterations we have proposed.  The leader of this party, Deputy Cosgrave, has made our stand perfectly clear and it is behind him that we all stand on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I congratulate Deputy Cooney on his contribution to this debate.  His speech was in the manner of a coherent, rational and clear-cut opposition to the serious difficulties surrounding this Bill.  It was a massive exposition of the reasons for our opposition to the Bill.  Also, I support strongly the calm reaction of Deputy Cluskey.  His speech was in accordance with all of his other statements here.  I am proud that Deputies <Col N="736" /> Cooney and Cluskey are the spokesmen on Justice in their respective parties.</P>
      <P>It is easy to become emotional when speaking of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill.  This Bill has been the subject of much condemnation by people in all walks of life.  However, I would abhor some of that condemnation while supporting a great deal of it.  An example of the kind of condemnation that I would abhor is a statement made by Bernadette Devlin while speaking in Liberty Hall on the 29th November, 1972.  I quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of the 29th and 30th November:</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed through the Dáil and is going to become law, may the hand of the President who signs it wither as he signs it, and may every one of his dead comrades who fought and died for this country appear before his dim eyes and curse his beating heart.</P>
      <P>That was Miss Devlin speaking at a so-called rally that was held for the purpose of opposing the Bill.  That is the kind of sick and scurrilous statement which I who am certainly in opposition to this Bill, could not support. It is the kind of statement from an Irishwoman which to me as a trade unionist soils the historic spot which is Liberty Hall.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As Irishmen and Irishwomen we can at least conduct our affairs without vilifying the President of this country.  It is a statement which I resent bitterly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to deal with another aspect of the Bill, that is, the statement made by the Minister in his contribution. Unfortunately, Deputy O'Malley who is usually very well briefed in respect of his contributions in this House, has not yet overcome his petulant and rather stupid attitude not only towards the Press and the communications media generally but towards Members of the House.  Invariably he gives assurances to the House in relation to a whole range of matters which are not in his Bills at all.  For example, in his speech in support of this Bill he said that the admission as evidence of a statement by a chief superintendent <Col N="737" /> that he believed a person to be a member of an illegal organisation was justified in the view of the Government because of the evil against which the law as to membership of an unlawful organisation was directed, and because there would be no possible danger of an innocent person suffering as a result of the provision.  There is no reference to innocent persons in the preamble to the Bill.  Neither is there any reference in it to the protection of innocent persons.  This is merely an assurance by the Executive of the State that innocent persons will not suffer.  But such assurance is not worth the paper it is written on because it is not contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that the fact of a senior officer having formed such an opinion and being prepared to swear to his belief in court made it virtually certain that the accused was a member.  That is a nice piece of stage managing of the future implemenation of this Bill.  In simple terms the Minister is saying now to the 25 or so chief superintendents around the country and particularly to the chief superintendent of the Special Branch: &ldquo;Look, so far as the Government say, if you believe it it is right and as a result of your belief we are virtually certain that the accused is a member&rdquo;.  This is not in the Bill but it is in the mind of the Minister and what perturbs the Opposition more than anything else are the intentions behind the Bill and the attitude of the of the Government towards it rather than what is contained in it.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that there were complete safeguards within the Bill. There are no such safeguards.  He told us that the superintendent's statement might be wrong but that in such case there were complete safeguards.  That is not the case.  Under section 3 (2) a chief superintendent is not obliged in any way to produce a shred of corroborating evidence before the court apart from stating that it is his belief. With due regard to the state of civil and criminal legislation in any European country I do not think that any court of justice would accept this kind of legislation under any circumstances. Not even among the most reactionary advocates that one might find in the most extreme right wing quarters in <Col N="738" /> the USA would legislation be accepted by any Senate committee or court of justice whereby a Federal officer could say, for example, that he believed Barry Desmond was a member of the Communist Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation, I am afraid, had its origins more appropriately in the South American context. Therefore, I reject very much the attitude of the Minister here in stating, for example, that the evidence could be challenged in court.</P>
      <P>I disagree completely with a good deal of what Deputy Neil Blaney stands for in this country.  However, he is a former Minister of State and a fairly experienced public representative.  He knows quite well that the evidence of the chief superintendent of the Special Branch is invariably accepted in a court of law.  He will not be asked to disclose the source of his information. Let this House be under absolutely no illusion what it is voting for when it votes on this Bill.  Many of the rank and file Fianna Fáil Deputies as distinct from those who are very concerned about saving their seats, are very perturbed about this Bill.  A number of them came to me in the constituency which I represent and said: &ldquo;If it were not for Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and yourself talking about the IRA, the Government would never have been forced to hound those republicans.&rdquo;  Many members of the Fianna Fáil Party must be extremely perturbed about what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make a plea to the House that in the Republic we should not talk ourselves into a state of emotional political crisis.  I fully support the security forces of this State.  I would go so far as to say that it is necessary to have special security forces in any democratic State. Nevertheless, I resent very much the sudden build-up in the Republic during the past fortnight by the Taoiseach &mdash;starting with RTE&mdash;of an atmosphere of crisis for what I would regard as rather spurious political expediency. I do not think that crisis is there.  I am quite convinced that the security forces <Col N="739" /> of this State, the Army and the Garda, the Special Army Intelligence, the Special Detective Unit Intelligence&mdash; both of which are now massively augmented&mdash;are more than capable of dealing with a few hundred people who actively involve themselves in the Provisional IRA and a few score who actively involve themselves in the so-called Official IRA.</P>
    <P>We should not give way to panic and we certainly should not give way to the hypocrisy of the various Fianna Fáil Ministers who have come before this House in defence of this Bill.  We had an exhibition of support yesterday by the Minister for Transport and Power.  I remember speaking to Fianna Fáil members in Roscommon about a year ago.  The Minister for Transport and Power at Fianna Fáil meetings in Roscommon said: &ldquo;Now lads we have to take a hard line against them because we need the money from big business to run the election.  We are really with the lads and as long as they keep up the good work and do not get involved down here it will be all right.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I will say political ambivalence, and I think we all know what that means.  This Bill has very little to do with the elimination of violence in the Republic and it has very little to do with bringing peace, reconciliation and full employment to Northern Ireland.  It is ironic to note that not one Government spokesman here has referred to the fact that the Taoiseach has completely shut out of his mind what has happened in the past four years.  He made no reference to the fact that 644 people in this country have lost their lives as a result of violence in the last four years.  He accepted no responsibility in respect of the litany of horror in our community. He made no reference whatever to the fact that 8,572 men, women and children have been injured in Northern Ireland in the past four years.  If the Taoiseach came into this House and said that he wanted to stop the slaughter, the political assassinations and the strife in Northern Ireland and that he needed this Bill to prevent it happening any further in Northern Ireland there might be a certain reaction in the Opposition benches.  The Taoiseach did not do that.</P>
      <P>The Bill was not brought in to exculpate the Fianna Fáil Party for the fact that 444 civilians and 29 RUC men, who are Irishmen, in Northern Ireland lost their lives during the past four years.  The Bill has been brought in because it became expedient in the Taoiseach's scenario to have this Bill introduced.  It became essentially an exercise in internal political party power.  A golden opportunity was presented to the Taoiseach to screw the Fine Gael Party and have the Labour Party thrown in as a bolster.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the reality. The Bill has very little to do with controlling subversive individuals and organisations in our community.  It is a pincer movement to wrongfoot the Opposition.  There is an Opposition dilemma.  The issue should be one of law and order between the Government and the IRA, both Provisional and Official, but it has been twisted to become an issue of law and order between the Government and the Opposition.  The Government stand to benefit from that.  Therefore, we have the basic ploy of the Government to engineer, if at all possible, a law and order election.</P>
      <P>What is the purpose of this?  It is not to resolve the situation in Northern Ireland.  It is to preserve Fianna Fáil in power for another four years because we are now in the last 12 months of the lifetime of the Nineteenth Dáil.  The Taoiseach will pick the best possible opportunity to go to the country.  The ploy is to ensure that the Opposition are put in the greatest possible embarrassment. The Taoiseach has been successful in that.</P>
      <P>Is there any concern on the Government benches in relation to the 70,000 people in the Republic who are unemployed? If I came into this House this afternoon with a motion in relation to unemployment there would be a mass exodus from the Government benches. They could not care less about unemployment, price control or social security.  Everything goes out the window on an &ldquo;against violence&rdquo; campaign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is essentially an exercise in the retention of power rather than in the resolution of the issues we have, a pincer movement designed more to catch the Opposition than the subversives and that is the whole purpose of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very reminiscent of the style of politics of the Taoiseach who succeeded magnificently in 1969 in running this kind of election campaign, a <Col N="742" /> campaign which was largely designed to catch the public concern about the ideological attitudes of certain Labour Deputies, and of course the political style of the Taoiseach is to prove to the world his total personal integrity, his meticulous concern for having absolutely clean hands on all issues, while playing a very dirty brand of politics which he is very capable of playing.  We are facing now a general election which could well prove to be the most scurrilous in the history of the State.  It is rather a tragedy and totally irresponsible that the Taoiseach should for narrow political advantage decide to fight an election on that basis.  Personally I am quite prepared to face the electorate and accept the consequences, but I submit seriously to the electorate and to the House that it is not desirable nationally&mdash;I will not say it is a tragedy because there is a need for a sorting out of certain individuals in this House, and Deputy Burke and I will agree on that&mdash;that we should have a situation in which Jack Lynch, Liam Cosgrave and Brendan Corish should be trying to prove to the nation who is the toughest in terms of repudiation of violence.  It is undesirable for the nation when only a few short months ago all three leaders and all three political parties unanimously rejected the use of violence for the attainment of political ends.</P>
    <P>It has been quite some time since the terms &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gestapo&rdquo; or &ldquo;repressive&rdquo; were used in this House and thrown across the floor, and I do not use these terms lightly in a House of Parliament, but I think it does behove the Members of Parliament to pay special attention to the contents of this Bill, and on any reasonable analysis of it, one certainly must describe it by saying that it is fascist in content, if not intent.  It is certainly reminiscent of the denial of the opportunity for a fair trial which one saw in the legislation in Nazi Germany.  I do not use these adjectives lightly because I do not think one should become exceptionally emotional on this matter at all.  One must approach it in the manner of Deputy Cooney and the calm manner of Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> I might add in relation to the Bill that I personally have no hesitation in facing the electorate.  I will circulate copies of the Bill to every household in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency, pointing out the reasons why I was not prepared to give to the Garda superintendent of F Division the right to say of any constituent of mine whom I have the honour to represent that he was a member of an unlawful organisation.  I have sufficient faith in the good sense of the constituents I represent to read between the lines of the gurrier contribution of Deputy Dowling and the unfortunate contribution of Deputy Colley, the Minister for Finance, who said nothing whatever about the Bill.  I have every hope that the electorate will see through these and I have the feeling&mdash;maybe I am completely wrong&mdash;that there will be a bit of a rebound on this Government, that the electorate sharply distinguishes between the Provisional IRA, the Official IRA, the question of offences against the State and the global legislation contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The electorate have been profoundly underestimated by the politicians in the past four years.  That is the feedback that I have been getting and some Deputies have underestimated the views of the electorate more than others.  Unlike Mac Stiofáin, the Ó Brádaighs and indeed Bernadette Devlin, I will accept the democratic verdict of the people of my constituency. I may be a redundant Deputy and I may have to emigrate because I have no other job.  That is the way the ball will hop but it will be a democratic ball and one which we in Opposition most certainly are prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>I also want to say&mdash;there is scarcely need to say it, having said it for four or five years&mdash;that I support the democratic institutions of the State, the Irish Army and the Garda Síochána, and I accuse the Government of failing in those past four years to give the necessary support to the members of the Garda Síochána and the Irish Army who attempted to deal with or&mdash;I do not like to use the phrase &ldquo;deal with&rdquo; because it is an O'Malleyism&mdash;to take control of <Col N="744" /> security situations in this country.  I would stress that there have been many instances.  If I may give a few, the climate of political reaction started with the burning of the British Embassy.  That was a great gag for Fianna Fáil Deputies and there were members of the Fianna Fáil Party who stood up here and said that they welcomed the burning of the British Embassy and also said that they did not burn half enough of the British premises.  May I make the point that when British company offices were burned in Dún Laoghare and when I made inquiries about it, there was a blank wall of silence from the Department of Justice and from the responsible Minister because it was not then popular to get those who threw the petrol bombs into the British premises in George's Street in Dún Laoghaire.  When British Rail offices were burned in Cork, did Jack Lynch ask for a Special Branch report? Not on your life.  The Taoiseach sat dumb because it was not then politically expedient.  When the British Rail offices in Limerick were burned and when the matter was raised by way of Parliamentary Question, Fianna Fáil sat idly by shedding counterfeit crocodile tears and with glee in their hearts that we were being beautifully anti-British.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the Taoiseach's scenario was very simple &mdash;if the Provos can keep it up long enough and if we have a few nice incidents in the Republic, we will be bombed on to the conference table with Ted Heath.  We will take the bonus from the Provisional IRA but we will have our seats at that conference table and if necessary, without having to impose any other kind of legislation.  Therefore, the Taoiseach has been trying to have it both ways in the past four years.  Certainly the Labour Party cannot be accused of that.  Certain Deputies in the Labour Party have had a foot in different camps and I dissociate myself from them.  I have supported consistently <Col N="745" /> the view adopted by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, a man who has been vilified by the Fianna Fáil Party and crucified at every Fianna Fáil cumann meeting throughout this country for cheap political gain and crucified by the Taoiseach as well until finally the Taoiseach discovered that the people of this country are opposed to violence, are opposed to the Provisional IRA and are opposed to the Official IRA, and the Taoiseach now wants to cash in on that.  As far as I am concerned, he is not going to hang that kind of secondhand clothing around my neck in any general election and I will certainly travel to Cork, out of my own constituency, to make that clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to make it clear that we in the Labour Party do not have to apologise in any way in respect of our past or our current attitudes, the official attitudes adopted by the Labour Party at the annual conference in Wexford in relation to parliamentary institutions.  We will not allow the parliamentary institutions of this State to languish either from the fascism of the IRA or from the erosion of civil rights by the Government.  We know the essential distinctions.  The Garda Síochána and the various superintendents and the officers of the Irish Army, underequipped as they were, came to successive Ministers for Defence and Ministers for Justice and it was discussed around the Cabinet table because this Cabinet leaks like a bucket&mdash;I do not want to name the Ministers but those of us who are full-time politicians and come in here every day and have a few &ldquo;jars&rdquo; in the bar know that you would be amazed what you can find out about Fianna Fáil.  They are not that security conscious.  When reports came through from the Border areas of Irishmen on this side of the Border playing havoc with the security of the Border, when it was reported to members of the Government that there were in certain areas dumps of arms in the Border counties, when it was reported that bombs were being made even in the suburbs of Dublin and when the Government were asked to take action, the Government did <Col N="746" /> nothing.  That is documented effectively in the reports of the Special Branch over the past four years.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, make the global accusation that there is blood on the hands of Fianna Fáil going into any general election.  I accuse them, as one with the right to make the accusation, as one who opposed the IRA when it was bloody unpopular to do so and when I did not have to have around my home at two in the morning a panoply of the Army and the Special Branch.  When I was dragged out a few years ago with bomb threats and scares and telephone calls I did not come into this House with a bleeding heart, making a scene about it.  I now disclose the provocation that I suffered as a member of the Opposition.  I had bloody few members of the Government willing to give me protection when I and my family faced that in my home in the past two or three years.</P>

      <P>I am not Pontius Pilate.  I am simply pointing out that we have the godfathers of the Provisional IRA now turning on their young.  They have turned in the past week, as only Fianna Fáil can turn. They started with RTE and they will finish up with virtually CIE if they are allowed to get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irrespective of the actions of individual Deputies, a very heavy responsibility lies in respect of this odious piece of legislation directly on the Provisional IRA and the Official IRA.  I do no think we should lose our sense of perspective.  They are in many respects the authors of this legislation.  They have given the incentive to the Government. In that context there may not be a great deal of sympathy for them but what is important is not the Provisional IRA or the Official IRA, but the large mass of three million people in the Republic whose civil rights transcend <Col N="747" /> the fascism of the IRA.  I do not think we have had what I would call a rag bag of Provisional IRA opposition to this Bill.  That is not that important.  What is important is the deep-rooted, genuine perhaps unspoken feeling of the majority who are very perturbed at the idea of putting these rights into the hands of a Garda superintendent for an unlimited period without any rebuttal open to an individual.  In a Christian country, where a man is prepared to go into court and swear on the Bible&mdash;allegedly 95 per cent of the Irish people are Christian, though looking at Northern Ireland and the South in terms of political violence I have grave reservations about that&mdash;it should be sufficient for any Government or any court of law that an Irishman, whose oath is allegedly his sacred trust, would go into court and swear that he is not a member of the IRA.  According to this Bill this is not rebuttal.  Such a denial, says the Minister, shall not by itself be conclusive. We see&mdash;if I may use the phrase used by Deputy Collins in relation to myself&mdash;a mantle of holier-than-thou descending upon the Minister for Justice.  Presumably he will go round in clerical garb from now on seeing that he is not prepared to accept a denial under oath by a citizen of this State of being a member of the IRA.</P>
    <P>In the election campaign which may come, depending on what happens in the next few hours, the electorate will sharply distinguish between those Deputies who have consistently opposed violence and spoken out against it and those who have remained silent.  I would accuse the overwhelming majority of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers of remaining totally silent in the past four years on the question of violence.  They may now cash in, with great glee, on the backlash against violence, but they do not deserve to be the recipients of any electoral support in that regard.  The electorate should examine the records of Dáil Éireann over the past four years.  There are many Fianna Fáil Deputies who by their silence condoned a great deal of what went on. There have been many occasions when the Taoiseach stood there condemning <Col N="748" /> violence and there was dead silence behind him.  I would implore the electerate to take careful note of those Deputies.  I honour Deputy Burke, and indeed Deputy Tunney.  To their credit they did speak, but there are many who did not.  I would also ask the electorate to take into account the various Deputies&mdash;from all parties, I must admit&mdash;who have been ambivalent on this issue.  There are about 12 Deputies who deserve an unequivocal reaction from the electorate when we go to the polls.  There are about 12 individuals who have been trying to keep a foot in all camps.  That is the real division in the House, not the spurious division we will have here later this afternoon.  There is no need for me to name them.  They have condemned themselves out of their own mouths here and outside.  I would particularly implore the electorate to take particular note of those Deputies who actively promoted subversion when they had an opportunity of doing so.  There are Deputies whose greatest fault is that they made thundering idiots of themselves before the electorate. Idiocy does not kill anyone, it is not political assassination.  There are those Deputies who were silent; perhaps we could accuse them of cowardice but cowardice never killed anyone.  Cowardice never sliced the head of a young child in front of a supermarket when the glass was blown out.</P>
    <P>There are Deputies and Ministers who incited subversion in this country. These facts are contained in the as yet undebated report of the Committee of Public Accounts.  There are Deputies who inspired and encouraged subversion and they come from the Government side.  There are Deputies who advocated subversion and all of them are spawned from the Government side.  There are Deputies who financed armed military subversion into Northern Ireland; again, these Deputies are on the Government side.  This double-dealing hypocrisy has to be exposed and I hope the electorate will take careful note of it.  The Taoiseach is running to the country because he has not the guts to put the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Gibbons, before his peers in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> I should like to quote from the report of the Committee of Public Accounts:</P>
    <P>The conclusions stated in Part IX, and in paragraph 40 may now be summarised by stating that of the £105,766 5s. 9d. spent, £29,166 12s. was spent on relief of distress, £34,850 was possibly spent in Belfast, but on undetermined purposes, £250 was spent on purposes possibly related to the relief of distress, and £41,499 13s. 9d. was not spent on relief of distress.</P>

      <P>If I might finish my quotation&mdash;the Baggot Street main account was for £23,150, the George Dixon account £38,249 13s. 9d., the Ann O'Brien account was £6,450, making a total of £76,599 13s. 9d.  A sum of £76,000 was spent in the formation of the Provisional IRA whom we are dealing with in this Bill. This House voted taxpayers' money to finance the Provisional IRA but the Government are getting a bitter return for their money.  They will get a bitter return from the electorate in the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> I hope the electorate will examine with the greatest of care the credentials of all candidates from all parties in the next election and I hope that scrutiny will be given to the Fianna Fáil candidates.  During the past four years many Deputies have played a dangerous game of politics with Northern Ireland and with the lives of the people in the Republic. One must ask how many of them have been prosecuted, how many have faced the courts as a result of the report I have quoted?  I would repeat the phrase that Fianna Fáil are the godfathers of the Provisional IRA.  It was a particularly drunken christening party; unfortunately the children have returned now, they are very belligerent and they came to the gates of Leinster House a few nights ago looking for more money and calling on Charlie Haughey to support them once again.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil gave the Provisional IRA a christening present of £76,000 of the taxpayers' money.  By their ambiguous support in this House they nurtured the Provisionals and they defended them by their cowardly silence when they should have opposed them.  Now they turn on the Provisional and the Official IRA not because they are a threat to the security of the State but because they are a threat to Fianna Fáil.  This is the supreme irony of this Bill.</P>
    <P>One might recall the five Derry women who came to this House five months ago.  I was honoured to meet them when they spoke with Deputy Corish and Deputy Cruise-O'Brien. These women spoke out against violence and against the tactics of the Provisionals in the North of Ireland. They were under no illusions about the subversive assistance that was coming from the Republic and they told us so.  Did the Taoiseach then decide to take action?  He did not take any action.  He thought his scenario of quadripartite talks, of the negotiating table, would unfold gently with the aid of the Provisionals.  Unfortunately it has come to nothing and the Taoiseach is left with 26 counties to look after but he is not making much of a job of it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> Had the State wished to act, in the past four years there were many occasions they could have done so.  There has been many international Press conferences held in Dublin where members of the Provisional IRA from north and south and the Official IRA claimed responsibility for killing fellow Irishmen.  They have bragged in Dublin about this in the past four years.  The Taoiseach suddenly has become holier than thou and he has decided to act.  At these conferences there were many tapes used and there were newspaper reports: many people condemned themselves out of their own mouths.  They claimed responsibility for murders, bombings and assassinations but what did they get from Fianna Fáil?  What they got from Fianna Fáil was international diplomatic immunity because it was expedient for Fianna Fáil not to be too hard on these republicans.</P>
    <P>This brings me to my own constituency. Last week the Fianna Fáil people took refuge in the roundabout twist that if it was not for Cruise-O'Brien and myself bringing pressure on the Government to deal with the IRA they would never have got involved in putting republicans in jail.  That could be a beautiful twist in an election campaign&mdash;blame Cruise-O'Brien, Desmond and those people in the Labour Party who are always hounding the IRA and say that if it were not for them we would leave these republicans alone.  This is the Fianna Fáil propaganda, except, of course, that it has all become very topsy-turvy in the past two or three months.</P>
    <P>May I also refer to the many instances in the past two years which are fully documented in the Garda reports, where members of the Garda Síochána and members of the Army were obstructed, abused, threatened and physically assaulted in the performance of their duty and Deputy O'Malley sat on that bench as Minister for Justice and fulminated.  He was very perturbed but, of course, he could do nothing because meanwhile the Taoiseach was keeping the hot line <Col N="752" /> open to London in the hope that Ted Heath might come across with something and then things might be all right.  We being as we are, in terms of Anglo-Irish relations, dreadful snobs, we love talking to the brass of the British.  It is a great thing to be seen doing it even if nothing happens.  Meanwhile, the Taoiseach told the Minister for Justice to ease off on the Provisional IRA because it might upset the country while he was resolving the issue around the conference table.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there was a political decision to take it easy and now the Government because of sheer political expediency have decided to deal with the matter.  I allege, therefore, that for four years the Taoiseach provided diplomatic immunity in the Republic for certain activities which under no circumstances could be tolerated by any self-respecting Government.</P>
    <P>It is a peculiar kind of immunity.  I want to refer to the number of clerics who have been visiting, associating with Mr. Mac Stiofáin in recent weeks. It is entirely appropriate and understandable that any minister of religion should give spiritual comfort and solace to any man who is facing a personal crisis of life on this earth but I find, as a Christian, it is nauseating and revolting that a priest of the Roman Catholic Church should address this nation with the words: &ldquo;In the name of Christ and Seán Mac Stiofáin ...&rdquo; To me &mdash;and I must say so irrespective of attitudes&mdash;that is blasphemy, and I want to put that on record.  I do not presume to judge any man but I cannot forget that Seán Mac Stiofáin ordered, initiated, instigated, defended, and rationalised in his way, the deaths of men, women and children in this island.  Therefore, while I understand and appreciate why men should be visited and attended by their spiritual advisers, I regard it as sanctimonious humbug that one priest in particular should involve the sacred name of Christ with that of a man whom I cannot admire and in such a manner. I cannot allow it to pass without comment because I feel strongly on the matter.</P>
    <P>I want to make another reservation. Personally, I think I have the right not <Col N="753" /> only as a Christian but as a politician to say that when a priest transfers his spiritual services from the bedside in a very blatant manner to the political platform, a distinction should and must be made in the interests of a country where the overwhelming majority profess Christian beliefs and where people can very easily become confused.  I have those reservations.  Distinctions must be made by men and I have the most profound misgivings about any minister of religion who allows himself to be used for political purposes by any political party whether in the convent parlour, as in the last general election, or at the bedside of a man who wishes to have spiritual comfort in a personal crisis.  I am not in any way disputing the right of any member or former member of the Hierarchy to visit whom he wishes. I do not presume to question the motives of any minister of religion in that regard.  I do not question how these arrangements were made but I think it is fair comment to ask: how many of those who were blasted in the bomb explosion in O'Connelf Street were visited and by whom?  How many members of the Garda Síochána who had their faces ripped open in front of the Mater Hospital were visited and by whom?  These are questions I should like to ask in a public context.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the Bill itself and the details of it, I want to indicate that Deputy O'Malley in the wake of all these events seems to be determined to outdo his predecessor in achieving a reputation for the introduction of regressive legislation affecting the civil rights of all citizens.  The Fianna Fáil Party have very assiduously courted the SDLP and allegedly assisted that party in many ways.  Therefore it is important that the Fianna Fáil Party should take note of the opposition of the SDLP to this Bill.  I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1st December:</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Party of the SDLP last night declared itself opposed to the Offences Against the State Act (Amendment) Bill, and said that it would be seeking an early meeting with the Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, to discuss its effect on the situation in the North.  The party would also be seeking meetings with <Col N="754" /> the Fine Gael Leader, Mr. Cosgrave, and Mr. Corish, the Labour Leader.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary party said that it was extremely concerned at the departure from the accepted standards of basic civil liberties contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It went on to say finally:</P>
    <P>As a party we have consistently advocated that laws that seriously infringe these standards can be a major cause of violence, and we have a bitter Northern experience as proof of our attitude.</P>
    <P>We would like to make clear that our opposition to this measure is in no way intended to lend support to organisations committed to violence.  These organisations have shown scant regard for civil liberties themselves, including the most basic civil right of all, the right to life. The way to end political violence in Ireland was to ensure a just settlement to the Irish problem, the party said.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the reaction of the Taoiseach to the SDLP statement. He has always maintained that the fullest consultation would be maintained with the authoritative opposition in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, I think we can accept that he will consider and reconsider his views in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to a number of other matters.  Not being a lawyer I have no pretentions in that regard in relation to the Bill.  I must work on what I may call the smell of the situation as the smell comes from the Bill.  I have long since given up any pretentions I might have had as I exhibited, say, on the Forcible Entry Bill, to suggest that I might make a legal analysis of the Bill but I think it is fair to say that the fundamental right of public expression of views, the fundamental right of freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, and the freedom of the communications media to present balanced and authoritative comment, and, above all, the freedom of fair trial and freedom from the common informer informing for the chief superintendent&mdash;all of these <Col N="755" /> basic rights are seriously eroded in this Bill.  Section 3 (2) imposes a grave imposition on every citizen and I would seriously challenge, from a purely layman's point of view the constitutionality of the Bill, just as it might be submitted that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs impugned the integrity of the RTE Authority in dismissing them under an Act of the Oireachtas in the context of their advocating violence which they most certainly never did.  There is no safeguard whatsoever for the non-member of the IRA who quite clearly indicates he never has been a member of an illegal organisation.  Under section 4 the right of the individual to attend ordinary meetings without being open to prosecution is also in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party did agree to the setting up of the Special Criminal Court.  Our agreement was not particularly called for&mdash;this court was set up by the Minister, but by and large we accepted that this was necessary because of the intimidation of juries.  The Special Criminal Court seems to have been effective in dealing with the bulk of the prosecutions they have faced, but I do not think any member of the Special Criminal Court has come to the Government and said they were unduly hampered in dealing with the cases here.</P>
    <P>My party will accept the democratic decision of Dáil Éireann on the Bill, and that is a great deal more than we can say for the Provisional IRA. The question at issue is the question of balance in a democratic society.  We have the double-barrelled issue of the preservation of the rights of the State and the rights of the individual, and I suggest that this Bill is massively weighted in favour of the State and is even more massively weighted in favour of an individual in the security forces of the State, namely, the Garda chief superintendent.  The security forces of this country are not the private property of Fianna Fáil or of the Minister for Justice, and the security forces of the State would be extremely perturbed to find themselves with these powers which are a grave infringement of the civil rights of citizens.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="756" /> As I say, we shall accept the decision of the Irish people in relation to this Bill.  Last July I challenged the Provisional IRA to put up candidates in the mid-Cork by-election.  I want again to challenge the self-same gentlemen who are now knocking at the gates of Leinster House, if they are as adamant in their opposition to this Bill as they say, to put up candidates in the general election.  Let us sort things out once and for all.  I think the Government will have to pull back from implementing this Bill.  I certainly do not accept the views of the Provisional IRA in relation to the Bill, but if they want to test the objection they have let them do so through the ballot box.  Let them put up candidates and then let everybody accept the verdict of the people in that regard.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most serious challenges that this Parliament has had since I came here in 1944.  I do not intend to refer to individuals who contributed here. Everyone is entitled to his own view and I would die to defend his right to express it.</P>
      <P>We on this side of the House do not want to see anybody in jail or on hunger strike.  Neither do we want to see people persecuted in their own homes.  I am an ordinary backbench Deputy but my home has been picketed about ten times because I made a simple statement in this House that this Parliament should be supreme.  I do not mind if they come to my house every day when I am there, but this is the kind of democracy that the Opposition want to uphold, the right of the mob to come to Deputies' homes and frighten their wives and children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may be at the wake of the 19th Dáil.  I may never come back here again but whether I do or not I want to put it on the record of this House that I stand for this democratic assembly being supreme. If anybody wants to challenge that, they have the right to go to the country in a general election and put their candidates and their policy before the people.  I was a young man when the civil war came <Col N="757" /> and I saw what happened in my own parish where people would not sit in the same benches in the church because of the bitterness between them.</P>

      <P>I will discuss this later with the Deputy in the passage. We are torn over the Six Counties. The Six Counties are part of our island.  God knows, so far as tolerance is concerned, there never was a more tolerant leader than the present Taoiseach. He, like all of us here, hopes that some day reason will prevail and that violence will be brought to an end.  One cannot make friends with a neighbour by throwing stones in his window every time one passes his house or by intimidating his wife or children.</P>
      <P>We are tonight challenged by the Opposition.  I have always thought they were a responsible Opposition. We are not anxious to prosecute or put anybody in jail who does not deserve to be brought for trial.  There is no such thing as trying to arrest decent people in the streets.</P>

Our homes are our castles and we are not to be interfered with because we come to this decision now. Do the Opposition stand for this type of abuse of democracy?  Have they the backbone to make a decision?  They are going into the lobby to vote us out.  Possibly we will have a general election in three weeks' time but if we have or have not I want to assure the people of Ireland that my leader and my party found it hard to make a decision to interfere with the rights of any individual.  We were forced into this position.</P>

    <P>I was a member of Dublin Corporation and outside corporation building I was hit by people who were supposed to be members of Sinn Féin. <Col N="758" /> They were part of a housing action protest.  Now the corporation have been dissolved as a result of a decision of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party.  That is past history.  I am concerned about this Bill here.  I am asking each Member of this House in conscience, no matter what his party affiliations may be: &ldquo;Do you stand for democratic order and decisions of this House or for mob law?&rdquo;</P>

The terms of reference tonight are short.  They are: &ldquo;Do you stand for democratic rule or for anarchy?&rdquo;  That is the vote we are going to take this evening.  I am interpreting it in my own way from a national point of view.  I have the honour of representing County Dublin for many years and I have found the leader of Fine Gael one of the greatest gentlemen I have ever worked with.  I am surprised that he is going to go into the lobby and that his party are going into the lobby to vote for anarchy instead of stability and democratic order.  The vote here tonight is not against Fianna Fáil.  That is the only way to put it at the present time.</P>

      <P>We are concerned about this.  From a national point of view I ask each and every one of you to think nationally tonight.  Posterity may judge you on anything you do <Col N="759" /> here tonight.  There was a Deputy here once in the Opposition and he was a very vocal speaker.  He always said that he wanted to make this Dáil supreme and said that anybody who challenged it outside should not be considered.  It is hard on us as a party to introduce a measure like this.  We are aware of the political results of such things.  This would interfere with our party afterwards.  No party wants to introduce legislation interfering with the rights of the individual. From listening to Deputies on the Opposition benches one would think that we wanted to see people in jail and on hunger strike.  We do not.  I am a senior member of the Fianna Fáil Party and I say that. Neither the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice nor any of the Ministers want to see anybody in jail or on hunger strike.  We are forced into this position simply to see that John Citizen and the Deputies of this Dáil can go about their business without being hindered.</P>
      <P>On Wednesday night last there were people from the North of Ireland coming in here to tell us what we should do.  This is an important night in the history of our country.  No matter what goes on we cannot wash our hands like Pontius Pilate when he gave Our Lord to the multitude.  That is the type of situation we are waiting for here.  I do not want to say anything personal.  This is a serious matter and personalities are out as far as I am concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been forced upon us by those who have no respect, good, bad or indifferent, for law and order. We had to make a decision in the interests of the people.  If the people do not want that decision they will have an opportunity of saying so within, perhaps, the next few weeks.  If they prefer mob rule and anarchy to law and order, they can make their choice.  Those who vote against this Bill in this House will do so because they prefer anarchy to law and order. I have been in this House for many years now.  In all my years in this House this is the most serious speech I have ever made.  Ponder well the <Col N="760" /> choice, law and order or anarchy.  I have been surprised in this debate at the approach of many of the Fine Gael and Labour Deputies.  They have no guts.  They will never rule.  They will never be anything but what they are now.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke does not believe one word of what he says and, before he departs, he should go to confession rather than hear them. Deputy Moore said today that the Government were forced to bring in this measure and he mentioned two incidents in support of his argument. He did not mention Radio Telefís Éireann; he mentioned the Mater Hospital and a bomb outside a cinema.</P>

      <P>The argument advanced is that, if this Bill is not passed, there will be anarchy.  Not later than three or four months ago, when I was speaking to Fianna Fáil Deputies and saying that I was against the IRA, I was told: &ldquo;I would not go that far.  The Officials are not very much but there is something good in the Provos&rdquo;.  Now the attitude has changed quite suddenly.</P>
      <P>There are six sections in this Bill, to two of which we object.  It took the Government six months to introduce the Bill.  Was the delay because party members were being briefed so that there would be no danger of any more dissidents?  The Minister for Transport and Power said that they could not spell out the deficiencies in existing legislation because subversive groups would then know what the deficiencies are.  Anyone who wants to find out what the deficiencies are can do so quite easily.  There is no difficulty in obtaining legal opinion in matters of this kind.  There are plenty of specialists available to advise.  The Minister's argument was absolutely nonsensical. It arises only out of the fact that there is no answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been blamed for Partition. Very few were interested in the North until the trouble started up there.  I believe that trouble can be laid in some measure at the door of both Protestant <Col N="761" /> and Catholic clergymen and they will have a good deal to answer for inasmuch as they made no effort of any kind at integration in the schools. There was no integration down here either and the only time I met people of other denominations was when I played rugby against them.  Our history books have done nothing to help the situation.  In fact, our history books are guilty of building up the situation.  The die-hard republicans on the other side of the House, who must take the blame for a great deal of the troubles in the past, are now pretending that they are for law and order.</P>
    <P>In the history books absentee landlords are mentioned as the ruination of Ireland.  I agree with that, but the landed gentry did the same in Cornwall and Wales and Scotland.  It was not mentioned that we were just part of the whole set-up at the time.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the opinions of the newspaper pundits and the speculation which has been well spread about by Fianna Fáil, I do not think they will do well in the election.  Many people in Dublin remember the Forcible Entry Bill.  Some people did not bother very much about it.  The first time that Act was used was during the rent strike in Dublin city.  It was not introduced for that.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party and all parties here have spoken against internment. The Taoiseach said at one stage that we would not stand idly by.  Now he is introducing a Bill which to me is worse than internment.  I would prefer internment. I agree with what Deputy Blaney said about that and I do not often agree with him.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the history of the arms trial.  Only Fianna Fáil were involved in it.  Nobody from Labour or Fine Gael was involved in it.  At that time we did not know who was backing Deputy Lynch, Deputy Haughey, Deputy Colley, or Deputy Blaney, who was another runner.  If this Bill becomes law what will happen to those Ministers?  Will they get off scot free or will they be like Mrs. Drumm and will somebody go back over the period and find out what they said and intern them or put them in jail?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="762" /> If we went back to the 1920s and 1930s we would find that the position of Fianna Fáil has been reversed completely, if they are sincere in what they are doing.  This Bill is probably a political gimmick.  The introduction of this Bill will build up opposition. There will probably be more head cases around.  To give an analogy.  I am in the licensed trade and, at times in that trade, you have to put a person out by force.  If you do that as a practice, or if you are too severe, you will have people coming up to challenge you and see can they beat you the next time, and you will end up with fisticuffs very often.  That is the type of thing this Bill will do.</P>
    <P>We have heard about irresponsible people over the past week-end.  There were many.  I would say there were roughly 2,000 marching outside here, although the scribes on television make it 4,000, 5,000 or 6,000.  I went out of here and I reckoned it at 2,000.  I would say 25 per cent if not 50 per cent of them were from the North of Ireland.  Among them were three MPs from the North.  They should mind their own business.  One of them is an anarchist, Bernadette Devlin.</P>

      <P>Outside there were 2,000 or 3,000 people and about 1,500 Garda.  This was a build-up to frighten the people.  Out there, there were many people who would jump onto any bandwaggon but to me the irresponsible people were the newspapers who should have given a lead.  On Tuesday the newspapers were against this Bill. The next day they were on strike.  I know it was not the fault of the newspaper owners.  It was the fault of the unions.  The people should have been fed the information, and they were not.  On Thursday morning the newspapers were still against it.  This morning they want a compromise.  These are the people who are supposed to give a lead.  They blame the politicians and say we are not consistent.  We are a hell of a sight more consistent than that.</P>
      <P>We have had the Fianna Fáil Party for the Provos.  Three months ago for six weeks running <i>The Irish Press</i> were backing the Provos and now they are for the Government.  I wonder why. Did the whip come from here?  I do not know whether it was for political reasons or for reasons connected with circulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned the case of a journalist who gave information which would not be <Col N="764" /> printed.  I wonder have we got to that stage.  I do not often agree with Deputy Blaney.  I admire his ability but I think he has turned the wrong way.  He has gone pro-IRA and I am against them. He said this Bill was introduced because Stephenson or Stiofáin, or whatever you call him, was put in jail. Because of that there was an uproar and this Bill was brought in.  If that man decides to go on hunger strike I cannot stop him.  As Deputy Browne said, there are many other people on hunger strike.  Nobody bothers about those who are on hunger strike down in Portlaoise.  While people are marching up and down here worrying about him, what is happening to the 30 or 40 people who were maimed in the Abercorn?</P>
    <P>I have known the Minister for Finance for a long time.  I stood with him in Dublin North-East when it was a five-seater.  I have a tremendous respect for him, while I disagree with him politically.  Yesterday he came in here and stooped to sewer politics.  He should have been defending the Bill or explaining it to us, but he spent his time attacking Fine Gael and chopping them.  The last time Fianna Fáil did this, they did it to hide their own problems.  That was just shortly before the Arms Trial.  They said Fine Gael were split down the middle and, within a week, four of them were gone.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance mentioned a newspaper report, a garbled report untrue <i>in toto,</i> and he added to it and threw it across at us here.  What he was really doing was trying to put Fine Gael in the position that they were objecting to this Bill for party politics and, in fact, worse, that somebody in Fine Gael was trying to take over, which is untrue and wrong.</P>
    <P>I say now to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, that the Fianna Fáil Party are using this Bill solely for party political gain, not in the interests of Ireland.  The talk around the House now is, &ldquo;We will win&rdquo;.  That is the only reason why Fianna Fáil are pressing this Bill.  I should like to warn the Taoiseach that it is my solemn belief that he will be beaten.  I do not agree with the <Col N="765" /> papers.  The former Prime Minister in England, Mr. Wilson, thought he would canter home a couple of years ago.  He was beaten.  Things looked better for him than they do for the Taoiseach.  Many young people are influencing their parents.  We have had the case of the television authority being sacked.  They were sacked and replaced by Fianna Fáil men and a Labour man&mdash;I do not know whether he is in Labour; he is Fianna Fáil.  Last night I was with a man outside the House who had taken too much to drink.  Another man asked, &ldquo;What will you do with him?  Put him on the board of Telefís Éireann.  You do not need any qualifications for that&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill was commented upon in the North of Ireland.  Everybody was against it, including Captain Brooke. He was not much help to us down here.  The one man who was for it was Bill Craig.</P>
    <P>The speech of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, yesterday was despicable, trying to change the truth.  Every party in this country is for law and order.  Let that go on the record and let it be published abroad by the newspapers.  There may be individual exceptions but the parties overall are for law and order.  I cannot guarantee that 100 per cent of Fianna Fáil but Labour I am certain of because they have come out openly since 1922.  So are 99 per cent of the people for law and order.  This law and order should be guaranteed without taking away the rights of the individual. The only difference between the parties at the moment on this Bill is that we think it is taking away the rights of the individual and Fianna Fáil do not.  There is the old saying about Fianna Fáil looking into their own heart to discover what Ireland wants.  They might find to the contrary. We should get a formula for changing the law whereby the three parties could back the Bill to implement it.  If there were an agreed Bill, any subversive organisation would have to pack up and go because they would know they were finished.  They would know that no authority would exist in the State but the elected Government.  In the North there are various parties and they disagree.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> I am not thinking about whether I am in Dáil Éireann or not.  If the Government want this vote there will be an escalation of violence throughout the country because the more repressive the law the more reaction you will get against it.  If the Government let this go to a vote and if they go to the country, I am telling you&mdash;it is on the Taoiseach's shoulders&mdash;there will be two or three persons killed and the chances are that they will be Fianna Fáil.  I do not want anybody killed while standing for election but I am afraid that will happen.  O.K., you will canter home.  That is a great thing.  You will leave civil war behind you or, if not civil war, at best, you will get martial law.  Every country that has had to fight for its independence has ended up with a military dictatorship or a dictator.  At least in Ireland we have a democracy.  I doubt if we will have it if this Bill goes through.  We are a democracy and I hope that that position will not be changed.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach wants to put the country into turmoil, let him go ahead.  In my view, section 3 (2) is diabolical and should be deleted forthwith. In the South in the last 15 years great strides have been made.  Trade unions, employers, Government and Opposition had a lot to do with it. There has been co-operation between unions and employers and in some cases at least there has been recognition of the employee as an individual, not in all cases but there has been a movement towards this.  If we get this election with guns in it, it will put us back 20 years, not only economically and in tourism.  Deputy P.J. Burke said it speaking as a Fianna Fáil TD, I say it as an individual, that we should think of Ireland and forget party politics. I do not care about the results of the election.  I will be in to win but if I lose I shall not die but I would hate to see an election where guns would come to the fore.  We need the co-operation of all parties and the Government have got that in regard to the North of Ireland from Labour and Fine Gael.  We need the co-operation of the three parties, not one individual party, to maintain law and order.</P>

      <Col N="767" /> Since we all agree on the question of the maintenance of law and order, why should one party say that they have the God-given right in regard to law and order when up to that point they had not bothered about it?  We should now agree on a policy for law and order. Any differences should be in regard to economic, industrial and social policy. This is what we should be discussing in the Dáil.  One party should not try to get the better of the other.  I will hardly gain any votes by praising a Deputy of another party who happens to be in my constituency, but in all fairness to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien it must be said that the Government are now coming around to his way of thinking.  As a businessman who has many premises in Dublin I am aware of the possibility of losing business as a result of my opposition to these measures, but I cannot support them because they would escalate the violence.  I would be sorry to see any Opposition party going down.  In the case of our own party my vanity would be hurt rather than my pocket because my salary amounts to only £400 after the deduction of tax. However, I do not think we will go down as a result of our stand on this issue.  If Fianna Fáil are again the cause of civil war in this country, let that be on their heads.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to plead with this Government, who are implacable in their determination to introduce this Bill almost in the fourth year of this Dáil.  It is not my intention to ask these defenders of law and order to please have mercy on the Opposition, to please defer an election. If the Government are saying to the Opposition almost in Lloyd George terms: &ldquo;Accept this Bill or else the consequence will be an immediate and terrible election&rdquo;, I am saying to the Government &ldquo;Let us have the election.&rdquo; If it is the Government's belief that there is surefire victory for them in such an election, let us test the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been named the IRA Bill by the media but we could not accept it in any sense because our fundamental position is that the existing <Col N="768" /> law is not being applied by this Government and that the only problem that has worsened the security position and led to the growth of the illegal organisations, has been the cowardice and the lack of political will on the part of the Government to enforce the laws they have.</P>
    <P>As we look at the Bill we cannot understand how the Minister for Justice can say that the Bill does not transfer the onus of proof to the defendant.  In God's name we cannot see how such a statement could be made in all seriousness by the Minister when we look at sections, such as section 3, subsection (2) (b), which reads that</P>
    <P>In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that this simply admits such statement as evidence, but what weight is to be attached to such evidence?  In any ordinary court the evidence is brought in by the chief superintendent and the statement shall be evidence that the person accused was then such a member.  This is not normal admissibility of evidence.  It attaches great weight to the evidence of the superintendent and, as has been asked during the debate, what kind of cross-examination could lead to the displacing of evidence coming from such a source in any trial.  In practical terms it transfers the onus of proof to the accused.  Therefore, the golden thread throughout our criminal law, whereby a person is innocent until proved guilty, is set at nought by this Bill.  How can the Government expect co-operation from any Opposition in relation to such measures.  They do not need one extra comma in the existing legislation to enable them to enforce the law.</P>
    <P>Such has been the cowardice of the Government during the past three years, such has been their nurturing of the only thing animating the party&mdash; that is, the sustaining of political support in every constituency&mdash;that they have not acted at any stage except simply to buttress and save their seats <Col N="769" /> in the Twenty-six Counties.  During that period there was rich game for any politician in the South who wished to stroke Twenty-six County susceptibility, who wished to raise Twenty-six County passions and prejudices on the unity question.  The Government charged with grave responsibility during that time have played that game throughout.  I would lay at the door of the Government the necessity for introducing special courts because this necessity arose from their cowardly silence.  Although the special courts act on the usual rules of evidence, the departure of the jury is an impairment in the carrying out of justice.  It is a diminishing of the existing system.</P>
    <P>Last summer I appeared on a television programme in Belfast with Mr. Paisley and he made the charge that we had to bring in special courts because we could no longer trust juries.  What lead did the Government give during that time to the civil juries of this country?  How many Ministers, before Christmas 12 months, spoke out on the menace of the anti-democratic organisations, the illegal groups?  We had careful statements from them.  For instance, we heard the Minister for Finance telling the IRA to stand aside. Such were the statements that were wrung from the lips of these reluctant Ministers who are now here in full strength on the side of law and order as if they had invented the terms.</P>
    <P>This is no IRA Bill as we see it, although the Government and their supporters may say so.  The Bill is a threat to the liberty of every ordinary man and woman in the country.  We cannot trust this executive with the extraordinary power demanded in this measure.  The Bill is framed deliberately to raise the temperature in the country and to provoke opposition.  It is a scaremongering Bill.  Let us look at section 3, subsection (1) (b) where we are told that &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but that the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.  If the daily journal in some small town in Bangladesh were to report that I am a member of an illegal organisation and if I do not <Col N="770" /> happen to hear it, it would be possible that some touring Minister might get a translation of the journal and have me brought before the courts.  These are the absurd provisions of this Bill.  If I am not tuned in to the happenings in Bangladesh, I suppose my omission to deny the charge would also be laid in evidence against me.  Suppose, for example, that I speak about the necessity for regional Government in this country&mdash;certain organisations have been talking on that topic recently as if they invented the concept&mdash;is anybody to say that this is a reasonable inference that at a particular time I was a member of an unlawful organisation? The test is if one is able to connect outlandish and absurd situations with clauses in this Bill it should surely be proof of its ineffective drafting and its unsatisfactory nature.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed also to label, as we have seen speaker after speaker from the Government benches do, opponents of the Bill as supporters of illegal organisations.  It is an outlandish charge but I suppose with the industry and the diligent application of Members opposite in the approaching election some of it may be made stick.  The Government and their advisers may be making a mistake there.  I have trust in the good sense of the ordinary people and I believe we can answer that charge and get rid of that smear in the approaching general election campaign.  I do not rule out the possibility that we can bring the attention of people back in this election campaign to prices, housing and economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is not an impossible task and I warn the Government not to be too sure of the result of this election about which they think they are so confident. The Government should not be too confident about it.  We have all seen faces in this House glowing in anticipation of a certain result when a referendum or an election is held.  The ballot box hides mystery and produces strange results. I am confident that when we expose, as we will up and down the country, the repugnant features of this Bill the people will give their verdict against this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will suspend judgment as to the outcome.  I am not saying that the issue <Col N="771" /> is the most advantageous to the Opposition because it was designed as a trap for them but I am confident that in an election campaign, and with a consistent approach by the Opposition to the repugnant features of the Bill, followed by a strategy to bring before the electorate the real problems, we can, in fact, face the Government and get a satisfactory result.</P>
    <P>The Government, of course, may rely on the benign figure of the Taoiseach who has a most attractive reputation to go with the election campaign that this Bill is designed to lead into.  He has a most comforting and consoling reputation for such a Bill and such an issue. It is up to the Opposition to talk clearly, calmly and without propaganda about the elements in this Bill and the threat it imposes for the liberty of every man and woman in this country.  We have seen the ultimate in political cynicism in the course of the debate on this Bill.  We see the very people charged with law and order in this State over the last three years who did not live up to their responsibilities come now with this nightmarish measure saying they are so anxious to catch up on the chores and the duties they did not live up to and looking for support for this Bill.  How many of these Ministers at various times in the last three years condemned the private armies?  I am not narrowing this charge down to the usual few referred to in this connection. I say that in 1969 and the period after 1970 that I know from conversations in this House that there were Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers, who are still Ministers, who were encouraging groups in the North in the idea that an armed campaign in the North could lead to results leading to unity.  Those people are in good standing with the people opposite who are now seeking to impose law and order.</P>

      <P>One is led to the conclusion that the proper enforcement of this Bill would lead to the jailing of the majority of the Members of the present Government.  If <Col N="772" /> Members opposite are acting in conscience on this Bill they should voluntarily go forth to the 23 chief superintendents and make their statements if there is any honesty left in them.  From what we have heard in the last couple of days they are the very paragons of honesty in this country at the moment.</P>
      <P>We had sad experience of running election campaigns on the Communist smear.  This will be the Provo smear.  The irony will be that the people attempting to apply the green paint are the very people whose actions led to major bloodshed.  They encouraged people to think that a vain effort at armed insurrection and an armed campaign could lead to unity.  These are the very people now wrapping the flag of law and order around themselves.</P>
      <P>There is a trap, as I said, set for the Opposition by the Government in the Bill.  We are giving the Government the opportunity to brand all of us who vote against this Bill as Provos.  That is the grand opportunity we are giving this Government.  Just as sometimes there is no choice for a Government but to take decisions which do not advance their own political fortunes&mdash;if the Government are worth their salt they have to shrug off that unfortunate choice and take the path which leads to serving all the people of this country&mdash;so also there is a time for an Opposition to refuse to compromise.  An Opposition must, in fact, with their eyes open, walk into a trap set by a Government, when they have no other choice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our position.  We will be smeared as Provos.  The Bill is designed to provoke opposition and as we see in brutal contributions here from Members of the Government the issue is that you are either for the IRA or you are for democracy.  I say to the Government: &ldquo;Unleash the Provo millionaires who have supported you in the past.  Let their cash flow out into the campaign in this approaching general election.  Let us see how this issue will be settled.  If your advisers in Mount Street say that this is a good issue let us see <Col N="773" /> what the result will be.  This plan hatched in Mount Street suggests that it will be a sure success for you but I doubt that&rdquo;.  It is now up to all the people in the Opposition not to be cowardly in the face of this smear. We can answer it and our record over the past three years is there for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>Who are the people in this House who are not for upholding law and order?  The majority of those in the benches opposite are the people who for the past three years have prepared the terrible situation which is now being exploited by them for election purposes.  This Government have at all times only considered their political fortunes in the Twenty-Six Counties. They considered that to be the touchstone of their existence.  They have abided by that principle in terms of their treatment of the Northern question. They refused to declare openly what their plans were to get unity by consent and agreement.  They refused to deal with the Opposition on an equal basis to get a united approach from this House on the matter of unity.  They displayed no courage on the Northern question.  They have this week shown how lacking in courage they were in the light of the tiny items they are putting before the people in the referendum. They are shrouding all their work on the North in secrecy, refusing to be open with the Unionists who may be interested in joining in conversations with us.</P>
    <P>The Government have again in this measure considered solely their own political interests.  They have judged the time to be right, in terms of their own electoral fortunes, that this issue would be the best issue on which to keep the electorate off the real issues affecting ordinary people up and down the country, the cost of living, jobs and houses.  They have, by this measure, made a football, a political plaything of liberty and the fundamental institutions of democracy.  They have given joy to these people.</P>
    <P>I have never seen how the unity of this country can be advanced by the fall of democracy in the South, and I see the imposition of this Bill as an <Col N="774" /> inroad into the democratic institutions we have, as an attack on liberty from within by the Government set down here who are nominally saying to the people &ldquo;We are out to get the IRA&rdquo;, when in fact they are attacking the rights of the ordinary people.  They are therefore giving joy to the most reactionary Unionists and dismaying any people in the North who are seeking a peaceful settlement based on unity, consent and agreement.</P>
    <P>Take this very debate and the manner in which Fianna Fáil have approached it.  Their speeches from the very outset have not been addressed to the terms of the Bill.  They have been reaching out to the chapel gates which they will be traversing this very weekend. Take the case of the Minister for Finance.  In the entire course of his speech, he ignored the Bill, but he takes on the leader of the Labour Party.  All I can say is when we look at the record of this Dáil, we find on the Government side silence for a great number of years.  On our side, whatever may be said about us, we spoke up at a time when it was necessary, as we felt, but unpolitical.  We did it deliberately, knowing that it was unpolitical, and with no apologies about it being unpolitical; but we felt it was important to speak out if we were going to be faithful to the complexities of the unity question.  That always involved the challenge of unpopularity in the South. We always knew that and we knew it was not good politics, that it is never good politics to attempt to get unity by consent and agreement and to speak out faithfully in this Assembly in Dublin on the complexities of that question.</P>
    <P>The people opposite, always on a Twenty-six County basis taking refuge in cowardly silence in years past, now come out clamouring for law and order with this measure; but Deputy Colley made this attack on Deputy Corish and accused the Labour Party of sheltering &ldquo;Provos&rdquo;.  I would refer the House to the policy agreed by the Labour Party in Wexford, which was long before the Health initiative, where in democratic session we met and considered the great issues of violence and unity and came down solidly in <Col N="775" /> favour of unity based on consent and agreement.  Did the Fianna Fáil Party in any of their well-advertised Ard Fheiseanna over the past three years debate this issue openly and honestly with their cumainn?  No, they were involved in that period of fighting about who should be in charge of the loot over the past three or four years, fighting over one or other alibi of their court appearances over the past three or four years.  These were the issues discussed at the various Fianna Fáil Ard Fheiseanna.  We could have been silent if we had wished to adopt a similar practice, could have passed on the other side.  We did not do so and we have no regrets for not doing so.</P>
    <P>To conclude, because other pressing business calls all of us, Yeats in some poem said &ldquo;I have never despaired of the people&rdquo;, nor do I.  If the media wizards attached to the high command in Mount Street, aided as I have said by the millionaire revolutionaries of whom we have seen a lot over the past two or three years, if it is their considered opinion, obviously based on the sensitive messages brought back by their various analyses over the past week&mdash;nobody can tell me that it is in a spirit of induction that we have this decision to go to the country; I would say it is based on very careful samples mathematical of the various income groups in various parts of the country and based on this computer intelligence&mdash;the Hatch Street command are ready to go to battle.  All right; we will join issue with you and let us see.  We make no boasting prognostications about the result but I will say to the Government this: beware that you have not made an error, beware that the reputation of your leader may not suffer in this campaign and beware of the commonsense of people in the general election.</P>

      <P>We expected and the House was entitled to expect many <Col N="776" /> Fianna Fáil speakers to come in here and justify the Bill to the people of Ireland.  Instead, the few Fianna Fáil speakers who did come in were not particularly interested in explaining this Bill or its effects to the people of Ireland.  There was a particular speech for which I was present which saddened me and lowered the status of this House in no uncertain fashion. The Minister for Finance came in here as a senior Minister and we were entitled to hear from him a defence of this Bill but we got no defence of this Bill from him.  Instead, we got a guttersnipe's speech, a speech worthy of a street corner boy, and it was sickening to listen to him.  It was sad to sit here and to feel that a senior member of the Cabinet could lower himself to make such an irrelevant speech on such a very serious occasion.</P>
      <P>I quote the Minister briefly.  He said, according to <i>The Irish Times</i> of today:</P>
      <P>Deputies who went through the lobbies to vote against the Bill were giving aid and comfort to the enemies of Irish democracy.</P>
      <P>I wish to refute that statement.  It is a calculated and misleading statement. Who in this House can seriously put forward the argument that anyone in Fine Gael ever gave succour to the members of the IRA or any other subversive organisation? Who can seriously put that forward? Nobody, because the history of the Fine Gael Party is well known.  The IRA and many other subversive organisations are anathema to the Fine Gael Party, always have been and always will, but that is not the case with the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will pursue that matter at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House knows full well and the people of Ireland know full well that the duplicity of the Fianna Fáil Party in the past four years has led to a very unsatisfactory state of affairs in our Republic and has certainly led to and helped to create in no small way the disastrous situation which has developed in Northern Ireland.  The silence on the benches of Fianna <Col N="777" /> Fáil in the past few years is shocking for any democracy.  They have not only by their words but by their actions supported the Provisional IRA in their activities in the North of Ireland.  How can we trust the Fianna Fáil Party to implement this legislation, obnoxious though it be, if they have not implemented legislation already on the Statute Book, and there is sufficient legislation on the Statute Book, to put down any subversive organisation, but the Fianna Fáil Party for devious reasons have refused to see the law to be implemented in the courts of this country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that the law was found over the past three years to be inadequate or insufficient.  I refute and challenge that statement. It is the type of speech which has been coming from Fianna Fáil speaker after speaker.  It is a misleading statement and one calculated in no small way to mislead the people on this vital matter.  The Fianna Fáil Party have never seriously gone about suppressing the IRA in recent years and they will never seriously do so because there are too many skeletons in the cupboard. It has been said here today that the Fianna Fáil Party was indeed the godfather of the IRA.  Certainly, the present Government and their supporters on those benches are the godfathers of the Provisional IRA. It is very important that this should be stated in this House and that the people should know this because we are facing an election.  The people should also know that it is possible to beat Fianna Fáil in this House and at the hustings.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland situation is so sad that one is reluctant to speak about it except on a very serious level but I can safely say that a large part of the blame for the situation in Northern Ireland in the last few years has been the narrow interpretation of republicanism expounded by the Fianna Fáil party since the establishment of this Republic.  It is largely they who have been responsible for the sad situation in Northern Ireland. Down through the years that party have done little to reconcile Catholics <Col N="778" /> and non-Catholics in the North or to reconcile Northern Ireland with our Republic.  The attitude of that party has been to divide the two parts of the country.  De Valera himself has been the arch contriver of this division. He is now President of this country.</P>

      <P>Very little was done down through the years by former Taoiseachs of the Fianna Fáil Party to help ease together the two ways of life in our country.  Instead, a very narrow and introvert line of republicanism has been the catch-cry of the Fianna Fáil Party and has been the cause of this sad division.  I ask you to remember, when we have the election, that our country is still as divided as it was 50 years ago.  We, as a Parliament, and we, as a nation, must bear our share of the guilt for not trying to reconcile in a positive way the non-Catholic and Catholic ideologies.</P>
      <P>The 1937 Constitution has been a source of much criticism.  It is a document which is most unacceptable to non-Catholics, both within the State and outside it.  What have the Government party done to change the Constitution? It is now 35 years old.  Surely it is time to put a new Constitution before the people, a Constitution which would not divide our country but would in some small way help towards the reunification of our people.  Despite the machinery available, despite a number of appeals to change the Constitution, there is only one relatively minor attempt&mdash;I do not know what will happen to that if there is a general election&mdash;being made in relation to two sections of Article 44.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Constitution alone will not unify our country.  It must be backed up by action, and the action of the Fianna Fáil Government in relation to law and order is deplorable.  This has been only too evident in the last few years.  I have <Col N="779" /> said that there is no new legislation required to suppress and contain subversives within the Republic.  I stand over that statement.  Are the Government aware, or do they care, that it took approximately 1,500 gardaí to protect Leinster House on Wednesday night, supported, I understand, by Army personnel, because there was a demonstration held only 100 yards from the gate?  That demonstration called for, among other things, the downfall of this Parliament.  Are the Government not aware, or do they even want to note, that under section 28 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, there is a prohibition on meetings within a half-mile of Leinster House? What moves were made last Wednesday night to implement that law?  I am not aware of any.  This is a current example of how the Fianna Fáil Government turn a blind eye on matters of vital importance to the integrity of this Parliament and of the Government themselves.  I should like the Minister to answer that.  What new legislation is required to apprehend the gunmen who opened fire in a civilian hospital last weekend?  None.  No new legislation is required in relation to any person who holds a gun in this country.  Yet, they were able to break into the Mater Hospital and fire on gardaí.  We have frequently seen on television volleys fired by people in semi-military uniforms over graves and monuments.  What action was taken against them?  What effect do the Government think this kind of action has on young people? The blind eye has been turned too often.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another matter covered by the 1939 Act concerning interference with military or other employees of the State.  Section 9 (2) states:</P>
    <P>Every person who shall incite or encourage any person employed in any capacity by the State to refuse, neglect, or omit (in a manner or to an extent calculated to dislocate the public service or a branch thereof) to perform his duty or shall incite or encourage any person so employed to be negligent or insubordinate (in such manner or to such <Col N="780" /> extent as aforesaid) in the performance of his duty shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>How many times have gardaí been abused, challenged and encouraged to leave their posts?  In this Act of Parliament there is sufficient power to apprehend and to convict people who are guilty of these activities but precious little has been done by the Fianna Fáil Government.  A blind eye was turned because it suited the ghost of narrow republicanism that exists in the ranks of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Section 27 (1) of the Offences against the State Act states:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful to hold a public meeting which is held or purports to be held by or on behalf of or by arrangement or in concert with an unlawful organisation or which is held or purports to be held for the purpose of supporting, aiding, abetting, or encouraging an unlawful organisation or of advocating the support of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>In this section the expression &ldquo;public meeting&rdquo; includes a procession...</P>
    <P>How many public meetings which have called for the downfall of the Dáil have been held?  We have read of countless such meetings and we have seen them on television calling for anarchy. Why has section 27 not been used against people who took part in these public meetings?  The reason is that it has not suited the Government Party. I am sorry Deputy Haughey has left the House as I wish to refer now to Volume 11 of the reports of the Committee of Public Accounts, for Tuesday, 9th February, 1971, because this matter relates specifically to the Bill before the House.  I asked a question of Chief Superintendent John Fleming and I got the following reply:</P>
    <P>I know that Mr. Haughey had a meeting with one of the leading members of the IRA and he also promised him £50,000.</P>
    <P>That is the sworn testimony of a chief <Col N="781" /> superintendent who was head of the Special Branch.  That man had nothing to gain by making such an allegation; it is possible he put his own future at risk by making that statement.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Bill before the House, one wonders what Deputy Haughey might say if Chief Superintendent Fleming decided to go on the stand before a court and, under section 3 (2) of the present Bill, to make the same allegation?  Might it not be concluded from that statement that Deputy Haughey was a member of the IRA?  One wonders if Deputy Haughey would think that restricts his personal liberty or offends his rights under the Constitution.  Deputy Haughey is still a member of Fianna Fáil&mdash;in fact he is a vice-president of the party, but he is also the man of whom the Taoiseach said there was a taint of suspicion.  This is a clear example of the present structure of the Fianna Fáil Party and it is sad that it was necessary to make this accusation. Nevertheless, it is necessary to put it on the record.</P>
    <P>With regard to the special fund set up by the Government in 1969 in relation to the North of Ireland, members of the committee which were set up to handle the money were personally sanctioned by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey.  One of those people is known to be a member of the Provisional IRA.  We know that a sum of £40,000 of the money voted by this House was not spent as the House intended.  It has been alleged that a large part of the money was given to the Provisional IRA.  This is a sad reflection on the Government. Nevertheless, it is important that this fact should be noted in the House now that we are facing an election.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the people should know exactly the composition of the Government party who are engaging in a smear campaign, an unjustified campaign of vilification against the Opposition parties, unjustified because the record of the Fine Gael Party is one of being 100 per cent for the administration of law and order and for the suppression of illegal <Col N="782" /> organisations.  That was not questioned here when I put it to the House a few minutes ago.  It has been alleged by one Fianna Fáil speaker after another that if we vote against this Bill we are helping illegal organisations.  That argument is untenable and it is important that the House should understand that.  We have in Fine Gael always been in favour of law and order.  Also, we have always tried to maintain a democratic balance in regard to individual freedom and personal liberty which is important in any democratic society.  It is very important that every citizen should feel that his personal liberty will be protected in the courts of law and that individual freedom to express opinions and attend meetings will be protected by the Government and the courts.  If that balance is unduly upset, as happened in Northern Ireland, the reaction can be worse than the intention, or indeed the performance under the policy adopted by the Northern Ireland Government, to deprive citizens of their basic civil rights.  That has been proved in the recent history of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The facts are clear.  Fianna Fáil have reneged on their duty to preserve law and order in the past four years and have turned the blind eye time and again to cases which merited prosecution. Many prosecutions were stopped by phone-calls from Fianna Fáil TDs to the Minister's office, or by private approaches to senior police officers. Perhaps in some cases only minor offences were involved; yet every attempt by politicians which succeeds in perverting, in however small a way, the course of justice damages the fabric of our society and our system of democracy.  However small the offence, whether it is unlawful parking, drunken driving, or a hit-and-run case, every successful attempt to pervert the course of justice is damaging to democracy.  This has been going on under Fianna Fáil for many years.  But a time must come when if such activities continue they will eat through the fabric of society and we shall become a sick society.  Then we shall have a proper fear for our democracy.  Fianna <Col N="783" /> Fáil have been neglectful of their duty in the real implementation of the law and the proper use of democracy; they do not give a hang for it.  It is sad, but it is a fact.</P>
    <P>What have Fianna Fáil done about the things that affect the everyday lives of our people in the last few years? We now have over 70,000 people unemployed, and the highest rate of inflation in western Europe.  The problem of solving these practical problems was neglected by Fianna Fáil who did not even attempt to resolve them.  They have been far too fond of trying to ensure their own perpetuation in office.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs earlier this year I spoke of the corruption and political patronage that have been the life blood of the Fianna Fáil Party through the years, jobs for the boys. We had the very recent example of the dismissal of the RTE Authority and their replacement by a Fianna Fáil authority; by definition it must be Fianna Fáil or sympathetic to Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall merely refer in a general way to political patronage and corruption because every Fianna Fáil man who gets a job because he is a Fianna Fáil man is a damaging instrument to our democracy.  This eats through the fabric of society and the spirit of our people because every citizen is equally entitled to a job, to fair play and equality before the law. This has not been the case because Fianna Fáil are not a truly democratic party.  In the famous phrase of one of their leading Ministers it is a slightly constitutional party.  That is quite so and has indeed been proved.  Because of the neglect of the Fianna Fáil Party in recent years and their refusal to see that the law is carried out in full, because the police have been hindered in carrying out their duties, not by people outside the Government or outside the Oireachtas, but by instruments <Col N="784" /> of the Government, we have reached a very serious situation.</P>
      <P>Courts have been denuded of juries in certain cases; convicted people have been removed to military detention camps and this Bill has now been introduced. It is important to understand why: it is because in the last few years the Government have not taken sufficient steps to ensure that subversive and illegal organisations were kept down.  It is important that the people should understand that we in Fine Gael cannot trust this Government to implement this legislation because we know they have not seen to it that existing legislation has been used to the full. We know it and the people of Ireland know it and no matter what the Fianna Fáil members say we are prepared to be judged by the people on our stand in relation to this Bill, because our stand is a democratic stand and one that is in keeping with the true aims of democracy.</P>
      <P>The Government should have been agreeable to amendments to section 3 (2) of the Bill which provides that the evidence of a chief superintendent shall be admissible in a court.  An accused person is entitled to rebut that evidence and to be given a good deal of freedom in so doing.  The citizens of this State have a right under the Constitution to attend meetings but section 4 puts them in danger of being put in jail for attending such meetings.  There should have been a time limit set on this Bill.  A time limit of 12 months has been suggested.  These were all reasonable amendments, and these were the minimum amendments we would have sought on Committee Stage.  However, I am not a legal expert and I will leave it to a more senior member of the party well versed in this matter to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was not amenable to accepting amendments or to allowing the pressure of democracy in this Parliament to be seen to be working.  It would not be a defeat for the Government to accept amendments.  It would have been an exercise in democracy, but the arrogant, jackboot attitude of the Minister, which is so like that of his fellow Ministers, means that the matter will now be put to the people.  We have <Col N="785" /> no hesitation in going before the people because we have always stood for law and order.  We shall explain to the people that we have no confidence in this Government who have not stood for law and order but who have, when they found it necessary, perverted the course of justice.</P>
    <P>I am confident that my party will do very well in the coming general election because we can hold our heads high in respect of our record in Government. The people, in their wisdom, will put out this Government who have done a great disservice to the people by introducing this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened for many hours to speeches on this Bill. The Bill has been gone into very thoroughly by speakers on every side, but to me this Bill is simply an election Bill.  The Bill has been designed to bring about an election and to create the climate in which an election could be held on this issue of law and order.</P>
      <P>The media have labelled this &ldquo;the IRA Bill&rdquo;, and this is a very convenient title for the Government.  It is, I believe, the title the Government would have chosen for the Bill if it had not been an amendment of a particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the sections which make the Bill probably one of the most heinous pieces of legislation that has been introduced in the last three years, it has united every section of the Opposition. People who have absolutely nothing in common except that they sit on the Opposition benches have united to oppose this Bill.  The provisions in the Bill were designed so that this would happen.  The Government are being made to appear the good boys&mdash;the man on the white horse fighting against the bad guy on the black horse&mdash;the maintainers of law and order as in the old Wild West.  Anybody who does not agree with them is for the bad guy, for the gunman and the bomber.  If he opposes the Bill on the basis of any section that may be in it this does not make any difference to the Government. He finds himself conveniently labelled as being in favour of the IRA, <Col N="786" /> being in favour of the bomb and the bullet.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, in a very poor speech last night, labelled the Opposition as irresponsible for opposing this Bill.  I say that the Government are irresponsible in introducing this Bill and in fighting an election on the Bill, if necessary, and I do not think there is any doubt in anyone's mind in this House but that there will be an election on this Bill.  The most disappointed man in this House would be the Taoiseach if he were to win a vote on the Bill, and I doubt if he will even allow a vote to be taken on the Bill in case he does win the vote.  I think he has decided right now to go to the country and to try to label the Opposition parties as the parties of violence, the parties who support the IRA against the democratic institutions of this State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance charges the Opposition with irresponsibility, but surely if the Government themselves were so responsible in the last three years they could have introduced this Bill on several occasions.  I was a member of an all-party delegation that went to Britain in 1970.  While we were there we were telephoned by our respective Whips in the dead of night to return home immediately, that there was a Government crisis, that the institutions of the State were in danger and we must return home for discussions in the House.  On that occasion the danger to the institutions of the State did not come from irresponsible people from across the Border or in our midst but from the Government benches.  On that occasion and after that occurrence, no Bill like this was introduced.</P>
    <P>Last November there was a story in the Sunday papers that there was a move by certain elements in the country to kidnap certain Ministers.  There was a threat of internment.  On that occasion that threat was not because of any kidnapping.  No such thing was likely to happen.  The threat was to make the House agree to the Prices and Incomes Bill.  An attempt was made to get the Opposition to accept the Prices and Incomes Bill or else at the behest of the Taoiseach internment would be introduced.  Surely that was another <Col N="787" /> indication of Government irresponsibility. We had the Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill.  An attempt was made on another occasion to introduce the Criminal Justice Bill.  All these things were done by the Government to secure by the backdoor method one or other of their objectives in the economic or social fields.</P>
    <P>The Government are suggesting backdoor internment in this Bill.  They know well that the Opposition could not accept that.  This is simply for election effect.  It is a great piece of stage management to give the impression that the country is about to be overtaken by irresponsible elements. Over the last few evenings as Deputies left the House they saw a huge number of police and military surrounding the House.  This was arranged to give the impression that the Government were in imminent danger.  The television cameras were in the area and they could not help but pick up the huge number of military and gardaí in the precincts of the House and outside it.</P>
    <P>Last year after the deaths in Derry as a result of brutality by the British Army many of us took part in a parade organised by the trade union movement. People from all walks of life paraded on that day to the British Embassy by way of O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Nassau Street and Clare Street.  The shops were closed but many had windows damaged by petrol bombs used by irresponsible elements in the community.  There was no move then to introduce this Bill or to eliminate those elements.  When we arrived at the British Embassy those of us who genuinely wanted to show our feelings by joining in the day of national mourning expected to walk by the embassy to let those inside report to their superiors the feelings of such a large number of the community.  Irresponsible elements took over that march and had their plans well laid.  They destroyed the embassy.  There were more police on the Gallery last night listening to Deputy Blaney than there were in the precincts of the British Embassy that day.  Certain gentlemen were allowed to place coffins outside the premises.  Others were allowed to enter <Col N="788" /> Merrion Square and throw petrol bombs and any fool would know that the coffins were incendiary devices&mdash; boxes loaded with rags and petrol&mdash; and when the petrol bombs hit them they went up in flames.  One man was allowed to climb onto the building and break the window so that the bombs could be thrown into the embassy itself. There was little or no opposition to those people on that day.  Some of us were disgusted at what happened.</P>
    <P>On the last two nights we have seen hundreds of military and police protecting this House when there was little or no danger to it.  Why were other places not protected in the past?  Why was this Bill not introduced when those other occurrences happened?  There was a greater threat to the democratic institutions of the State on those occasions. Irresponsible elements were heard to say that they wanted to march on Leinster House.  I came back here and the House was guarded by two ushers with a chain and a padlock at the Merrion Square entrance.  That was all the protection the House was getting on that occasion.</P>
    <P>This has been stage-managed so that the country would be forced to believe that we were in imminent danger and that the Government needed this legislation and if it was not accepted the country would be asked to give the Fianna Fáil Government by their votes the right to bring in this Bill.  It is the same sort of production as we have seen in the making of epic films like &ldquo;Ben Hur&rdquo; and &ldquo;Quo Vadis.&rdquo;  The Taoiseach will come in and dissolve this Dáil or suspend the sittings and over the weekend then dissolve it.  If the Taoiseach thinks that the people of Wicklow or the people of Ireland will react in the same way as he can expect certain elements to react in this city, as they have done over the past few days, he will be surprised this time.  We know that the Government cannot fight an election on any of the major issues facing the country at the moment. They cannot fight on the issues of the economy or the issues of social justice at this time.  They would not dare to go to the country on those issues. Over 70,000 people are unemployed. <Col N="789" /> Prices have gone sky-high since the introduction of VAT and since decimalisation.  A convenient issue has to be found for the Government. They are running out of time. Economic experts have told them that an election on that basis would find them in the minority.  The greatest threat is provided by the talks in progress between this party and the Fine Gael Party on a united front in the next election.  This is really the thing that worries the Government.  This has always worried the Government.  In the last two elections the Opposition were not united in the ballot boxes but, on the next occasion, possibly next spring or next summer, there will be a united Opposition, or possibly much sooner and I contend that the real reason for the introduction of this Bill is an attempt to force an earlier election.</P>
    <P>There is no great threat to the institutions of this State.  We have enough law, enough repressive legislation, enough of the kind of thing that is in this Bill, to deal with any of the elements causing any problems in our community.  The people will not accept the &ldquo;backdoor internment&rdquo; proposed in this Bill.  When the media get around to it, they will not describe this as &ldquo;the IRA Bill&rdquo;; they will label it, as it should be labelled, the &ldquo;backdoor internment Bill&rdquo;.  Will the Government like to fight the issue on that basis?  I can assure them that, if they think it will be a walk-over, I will be very glad if there is an election in the next few weeks and I will be glad that the constituency of Wicklow will cast a united vote against the Government on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity of expressing the view of a backbencher of our party.  Because of our numbers we do not all of us always get an opportunity of talking on every measure that goes through the House.  Indeed, we are sometimes taxed to that effect.  I should like now to put my humble views on record.  I am fully behind the decision of the Government in bringing in this Bill.  I am at one with my party on this Bill. <Col N="790" /> The Bill is necessary.  A strong Bill, such as this Bill is, is essential to deal with a desperate situation.  Our Minister for Justice, with his experience, and the experience of those who are best fitted to guide and advise him, knows that the law, as it exists at the moment, is not capable of dealing with these subversive elements, subversive elements which succeed in flouting the law and getting away with it.  We all know this.</P>
      <P>The arguments we have heard advanced on the opposite benches, particularly on the Fine Gael benches, as expounded by Deputy Cooney, appear to rest on the assumption that the law as it exists, if properly implemented, is capable of dealing with a threat posed by the enemies of this State.  Deputy Cooney rather belaboured this argument in giving his side.  His leader, or the man who up to lately was the leader of that party, did not seem so thoroughly convinced.  The only difference I could see between the shadow Minister for Justice in Fine Gael and the real Minister for Justice is that the shadow Minister and his satellites are playing their traditional role of hurlers on the ditch who imagine that, if they got the opportunity&mdash;thank God, the people gave them that opportunity on only two occasions, and they were brief ones; they were very quickly demoted again to the sidelines&mdash;they could do wonders.  The real Minister for Justice does not indulge in vague imaginings. He deals in realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the Government of the country and the first duty of any Government is to govern.  Our Minister for Justice knows that there are loopholes in the law, loopholes we now intend to close.  We have been asked why we did not spell out the loopholes, why we did not expose the chinks in the armour of the security of the nation.  It should hardly be necessary to remark that this would be a very foolish thing to do because it would provide opportunities for those who wish to bring down the State.  There is nothing as detrimental to the morale of any nation as charging a person, whom we all know in our hearts has committed an offence and who is a member of an illegal organisation, and then seeing that person <Col N="791" /> go scot-free.  We have had instances of people caught leaving the scene of a crime, the scene of a shooting incident, who, when they were caught, did not actually have guns on them, but whom we all knew were guilty, and yet we could not prove they were guilty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sherwin last night and Deputy Blaney this morning let their case rest on the allegation that there was no emergency here.  I doubt if the people in Dundalk and the people in Dublin, where a bomb went off recently, would agree with that.  I say that there is an emergency.  There is intimidation of journalists and witnesses. There is picketing of courthouses. All that adds up to an emergency in my opinion.  Garda and Army personnel in my constituency have been subjected to attack and to gross insults by those people who declare themselves the &ldquo;People's Democracy&rdquo;.  I am sure the Garda and the Army personnel involved in these incidents would agree that we have here a state of emergency.  Only this week they were once more insulted. They were struck with stones and sticks and informed by the leaders of the &ldquo;People's Democracy&rdquo; that they would be back again for Christmas to ensure that both the Army and the police did not enjoy the festivities.  It is essential that officials, be they clerks in a bank, postmen doing their rounds, Army or Garda personnel, be allowed to carry out their duties without hindrance.  This they are not being allowed to do now.</P>
    <P>We have had an extraordinary charge levelled at us by the Opposition. We have been charged with doing nothing for the past two years. Some speakers actually charged us with helping the Provisional IRA in their work.  We are now told that the measures we propose to deal with the IRA and other subversive elements are too harsh.  Can anyone explain to me why this remarkable change of heart should have come about?  I should like an explanation of that if any of the Members on the Opposition Benches would care to give it to me.</P>
    <P>We have, too, evidence of a remarkable <Col N="792" /> political somersault in the Fine Gael Party.  Indeed, the only one who did not as yet take part in the political acrobatics of that party is their late Leader.  I would term him one of the few honest men on the opposite benches.  I remember some years ago&mdash;I think it was Deputy Harte, if I am not mistaken&mdash;who referred to the then Deputy Kevin Boland as one of the few honest men on our benches.  I hope history will not now repeat itself and that Deputy Cosgrave, as a result of these remarks of mine, will not follow in the path of Deputy Boland.</P>
    <P>We have had the &ldquo;doves of peace&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy L'Estrange has been foremost amongst them&mdash;warning us about the drift to anarchy.  On every occasion on which he could do so Deputy L'Estrange warned us about this and taxed us with allowing people to break the law with impunity.  These &ldquo;doves of peace&rdquo; are now transformed into the mongrel foxes Deputy Cosgrave mentioned.  Indeed, I think they have been transformed into vultures.</P>
    <P>There is an emergency here.  There was an emergency last Sunday in the Mater Hospital.  After the events in that particular hospital, when the patient was transferred to the Curragh &mdash;a necessary step, in my opinion, for the safety of the person himself and of the other patients there&mdash;we had a clamour from the benches opposite and we were told that he should be transferred to an intensive care unit.  I cannot for the life of me see the logic in this because, if a person sincerely decides that he wants to die no medical aid will avail him.  Deputy O'Connell, who appears to have free and frequent access to the Provos on any and every occasion &mdash; more frequent access, maybe, than Deputy Corish would like&mdash;admitted he could not promise, if the patient, Mr. Stephenson, were changed to another hospital for more intensive care, there would not be another attempt to rescue him.  I should mention here that the legal adviser to the leader of the Provisional IRA saw fit to refer to the General Military Hospital on the Curragh as an abattoir. That is a rather unusual statement from the legal adviser of a group of <Col N="793" /> people who were prepared to turn the Mater Hospital into a slaughterhouse a short time before that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>There is of course.  We read today that they are happy with the services and the attention.  They seem to be much happier today and to have changed their minds again.  Such people who do not know their own minds from one day to another do not deserve mention.  I know the military hospital on the Curragh.  I know the staff and the doctors and nurses there. On one occasion I got treatment there, after an accident on the hurling field.  I am confident that it conforms to the very best in any other military encampment.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary was very much taken up with thoughts of the forthcoming general election.  He was confident, he said, that the judgment of the ordinary people of Ireland would vindicate them.  I must admit that on this I am of the same mind as Deputy O'Leary.  The ordinary people of Ireland I know want the Government to govern.  They want the Government to enforce the law.  I am confident that, if this Bill becomes law, as it will, when it is enacted, no decent law-abiding person has anything to fear from it. The people who have reason to fear this Bill are members of illegal organisations, subversive elements who want to undermine the foundations of the State.  Whether they are provisional or Official IRA, or the various elements that latch on to them, I do not know.  They are the people who have reason to fear this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I doubt the purity of the motives of many of these people.  Some of them, I am sure, are sincere in wanting to see a united Ireland.  Others, I am convinced&mdash;and they have expressed this view&mdash;are very interested in seeing the downfall of the State.  They have announced that, since they have accomplished the downfall of the Northern State, they are now prepared to turn their attention here.  I doubt, too, if the proceeds of the various bank raids and other coups have found their way into <Col N="794" /> truly republican hands.</P>
    <P>I have faith in the courts and the judges.  I have faith in the integrity of the Garda.  We have had evidence of their integrity over a long period, and more recently, too.  I have not got a legally trained mind but I should like to refer briefly to section 3 (2) which seems to cause a lot of concern to the Opposition.  This has been continuously misrepresented to such an extent that the people down the country, gullible people, have believed the misrepresentation. They are now asking me is it true that the evidence of a chief superintendent can send a person to jail. That is the propaganda that has been advanced.</P>

If a judge in this country decides something beyond all reasonable doubt, I am satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that justice will be done.  In this Bill we are proposing to deal with the subversive elements, whether they are IRA or tartan gangs, or whatever elements are enemies of this nation.  We know on this side of the House what we want to do.  There is no shallowness or insincerity about us.  We know our minds on this.  I will ask those opposite: &ldquo;Have you decided what side you are on?

      <P>I do not wish to speak at any great length because, if my information is right, it will not make much difference.  In view of what Deputy Power has said, and particularly in view of what the Minister for <Col N="796" /> Finance said last night, there is an obligation on me to speak personally on this issue.  Before doing so, I should like to recall&mdash;and I take a certain amount of pride in this&mdash;that I have tried to be as responsible as any Deputy could be on this issue since 1969.  I have tried to be an Irishman before being a politician.  At times I felt I could have got bonuses in terms of votes by being a politician, but it was my opinion from the outset that this was a human conflict in the North of Ireland and that, if we seriously believed in trying to settle that conflict we must approach it by fair means and that, if we were to play our part, there was an obligation on us as elected representatives of the people to place before the elected Government of the day any information available to us which we believed would be of assistance to the Government in arriving at conclusions.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the main speakers from the Government party yesterday evening, I have become completely disillusioned, because the message that came across to me loud and clear was that the Fianna Fáil Party were now using the Northern conflict for political ends.  For the first time, the Northern conflict has been introduced into the political arena of the south.  When the Minister for Finance suggested, as Deputy Power has just done, that any person who voted against this Bill was on the side of anarchy, I got up on a point of order and asked him was he seriously suggesting that I, as a Deputy who had spoken out against the IRA, and who had said in this House that I did not want to represent that type of society, was on the side of the Provisional IRA, because I was opposing repressive legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does any person in Donegal believe the Minister for Finance?  Deputy Cunningham, who is sitting in the Taoiseach's seat, did not open his cheeper on this issue for the past three years.  He does not know which way to run, whether in the Blaney direction, or the Lynch direction.  Do not interrupt me.  Let me say this.  Deputy Cunningham will have an opportunity to follow me in this debate.  I shall be glad to hear his views.  Many people in <Col N="797" /> this country, and particularly in North-East Donegal, want to know at this stage where does he stand.</P>

      <P>I have not said that.  If the Parliamentary Secretary would listen to what I am saying, I am saying that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, who challenged his leader for the office of Taoiseach in 1967, suggested that any person who voted against this Bill was on the side of anarchy and lawlessness.  That is what I am disputing.  If the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to take the side of the Minister for Finance, then I will debate the matter with him.  Does he wish to say that he does not stand on the same ground as Deputy Colley?  Does he wish to reiterate and support what the Minister for Finance says: &ldquo;that by virtue of the fact that you walk through the Division Lobby tonight&rdquo;&mdash;I hope being beaten&mdash;&ldquo;and support repressive legislation, the history of this country for the last 50 years will be rewritten?&rdquo; Does he seriously suggest that history can be retold?  Does he seriously suggest that society will forget that his party flirted with anarchy for the last 50 years, paraded with lawlessness and created the Provisional IRA?  Does he seriously suggest that society will forget about this and does he go further and say that because of their misdeeds, I am to be condemned for opposing repressive legislation?</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, gorgeous George, was giving us all a face lift with his political cosmetics.  He was sounding the bell of election politics.  He was buying votes out of the political pond of Northern Ireland in order to be reelected. The matter is much more serious than that would imply.  I do not wish it to be said that because I am going to vote&mdash;and vote I will&mdash; against the repressive measures, for reasons which Deputy Cunningham knows are valid, I recognise that the Official IRA, the Provisional IRA, the UDA, the UDF, are part of our society.  It is a shame after 50 years of freedom for a Deputy to have to admit that, because none of us has ever tried to build a society which these people could identify with.  I can say this much, that I will share the blame, I will carry the same amount of blame as any other Deputy of this party, for failing in this direction.</P>
      <P>Recently someone said to me there were two types of Irish people alive today: there was the person who believed in violence and the person who believed in peace.  What that person could not understand was that the person who believed in violence had the courage of his convictions to use violence but the person who believed in peace was not big enough to use peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had arguments from the Fianna Fáil benches.  Deputy Power has just said that over the last 40 years Fianna Fáil have been in power except for two short breaks and he took pride in the fact that the Irish people had given an Opposition only <Col N="799" /> two short trips before, as he suggested, being taken off the field and being replaced by substitutes.  Let us take the 40 years that Deputy Power has been talking about.  In what way has the Fianna Fáil Party lived up to its obligation of unification of the country?  In what way have they tried to bridge the great divide North of the Border?  They stand condemned, even in the eyes of the most moderate Protestant opinion North of the Border, for not trying to suppress violence.  No, they encourage violence and they used the IRA at a time when they became a nuisance value to the Northern Protestant community many of whom&mdash;and make no mistake about this&mdash;are as good Irishmen as I am and by many standards much better.  I am just the average one in this House&mdash;no better, no worse, than anyone else.  You stand condemned in the eyes of the Northern moderate Protestant who, if he saw any identification with a united Ireland, would reach out and try to find a level of identification with us. You stand condemned because when he was being bombed and shot, when his children were being killed, when hate was being poured into his society, when he had no friends from any part of the British Isles, you did not do anything to stop the murder that was taking place in his society. For that, I do not think the Fianna Fáil Party can ever be forgiven by that Northern Irish community.</P>
    <P>I wonder why this Bill was introduced. I know that people want law and order.  I was speaking to constituents of mine, people who vote also for Deputy Cunningham, on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week. I had reasons not to be in the House. As I said yesterday evening, I do not have to put forward those reasons.  I had an opportunity of mixing with people in North-East Donegal.  I recognise their desire to have law and to have order.  They, in their frustration, would be inclined to say, &ldquo;Yes to your Bill.  This is very necessary because society must be protected against subversion&rdquo;.  I, too, fell into that trap and my first and immediate feeling was, &ldquo;Yes, something has to <Col N="800" /> be done to protect society against the anarchists&rdquo;.  But, when we stand back and examine what it is all about, I ask myself do I really want law and order or do I want law and order that is backed up by repressive legislation and my answer is quite clear: I want law and order but I will not back repression.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Cunningham and I go before the Donegal electorate I will debate publicly with him, as I have done in the past, this very issue, because Deputy Cunningham knows that I could not in conscience support the type of legislation put before this House by his party.  I could not support that despite the fact that I have very good relations with members of the Government and with the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch.  I respect the Taoiseach.  I expect that he has found himself in a very difficult position. He is not without criticism but, then, who in the Fianna Fáil Party could do any better at the moment? I respect him because as a human being, having his own views on what way this crisis can be resolved, he must take with him a party that finds its roots in republicanism in this country.  It is to his credit that he has taught a few of you manners and that was well overdue.</P>
    <P>In spite of those good relationships which I have and which I publicly stated on a number of occasions, Deputy Cunningham knows that I could not in conscience vote for this type of repressive legislation because there is no difference between this type of legislation and the legislation which introduced internment in August, 1971 in Northern Ireland.  I do not know what part Deputy Cunningham played in trying to head off internment in the North but I can tell the House that during the four weeks of detention which preceded internment, I found myself going to and from Belfast and the people whom I went there to speak to were not the people I used to meet and whom we referred to occasionally as &ldquo;our people&rdquo;.  I went to meet the Protestant people who also saw the dangers of internment and who were trying to have it averted.  These people were doing their best to persuade <Col N="801" /> the Unionist Party to understand that that action was counterproductive and that counterproductive measures solve nothing. Neither will this repressive measure before us solve anything.  It must be recognised that in society at present there are people who do not identify with the Government's thinking or with my thinking either.  There is no good in closing our eyes and hoping these people will go away.  The aim must be to build a new society, a society that will embrace not only the Northern Protestant Unionist but also the type of people who are now being referred to as subversives.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I came across the biography of General Ulysses Grant. I learned from it that General Grant fought and won the bloodiest war that the world has ever known&mdash;the American Civil War&mdash;when neighbours of divided view literally butchered each other with whatever was available, knives and bayonets if they had no guns.  Under the most severe pressure, he refused to be pushed by his own supporters into introducing measures which in his judgment were unfair because he believed that to construct the America that was to become the United States was to construct a society in which everyone had a part to play.  That was more than 100 years ago but this country has not yet got the message. After 50 years of independent government&mdash;speaking politically I suppose I am right but, economically, I suppose one could ask a big question&mdash; we have not matured enough to realise that Fianna Fáil have not got the monopoly of good opinions in this matter.  We have not matured sufficiently to understand that in the ranks of Fine Gael there are people who wish sincerely to build bridges, that in the ranks of the Labour Party there are people who wish sincerely to play their part but, no, Fianna Fáil say: &ldquo;That is not your game.  If there is to be a united Ireland it will be on our conditions.  It will be the united Ireland that we plan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Yes, the party that was formed in 1927 on that issue.  The British Conservative and Labour Parties have a bi-partisan policy on Northern Ireland.  Mr. Heath takes into his confidence Mr. Wilson when issues are being introduced in Westminster that affect the North.  Is it not a sad reflection on the present Government that the Taoiseach could not have taken into his confidence Deputies Cosgrave and Corish?  It is not necessary for me to state that these two Deputies are as interested in law and order as is the Taoiseach.  Neither should it be necessary for me to repeat on every occasion on which I speak publicly on the Northern situation that I am absolutely opposed to any use of force whatever. Your inconsistencies in your approach to the Northern crisis has left this part of Ireland in such a situation that southern public opinion would be such that if I speak my mind clearly and honestly as an Irishman, trying to reach out to the Northern Protestant, there is the belief that this guy, Harte, is a West Briton or a Catholic Unionist when all I am trying to be is an ordinary Irishman trying to create conditions in this island that will allow my family and other families and those who come after them to live as they are entitled to live.</P>
      <P>I oppose this legislation because I do not consider it to be necessary but if I thought it was necessary I would be likely to support it.  Looking back over the past 18 months and reflecting on the different occasions on which it was my duty to report to the authorities on certain matters of public disquiet but about which no action was taken, I ask myself what was lacking in our society during that time.  Was it the lack of legislation or was it of public conviction on the part of the Government? The answer is too obvious.  If at this stage the Government put forward the argument that they do not have sufficient legislation to convict subversives, is it not fair of me to ask them what they have been dithering about during the past three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I have occasion to write to distant relatives in reply to letters received from them and tell them what is happening here, I find myself concluding <Col N="803" /> any such letter by saying that all this trouble is part of our society and that I am ashamed to admit to being part of it.  We are all part of it and it will not be put down by repression. That has been proved time and again and the Northern scene bears witness to it.  We remember the hue and cry there was from the Government benches in this House when Brian Faulkner introduced internment.  We heard from them that this was repressive legislation and would be counterproductive. Must I go over the story of what happened in Northern Ireland immediately after internment?  None of us can ever forget.</P>
    <P>I do not suggest that we will have a similar situation south of the border but I do suggest that when 12 or 20 people who met in Queen's University in 1965 or 1966 to start what we described later as the civil rights movement, those people did not see then the far-reaching effects of their simple little meeting.  I suggest that they did not realise what it would cause not only in Northern Ireland but in this part of the country too.  I do not think any of them thought that less than six years later more than 600 people would be dead, that Government Ministers in the South would be sacked, that properties would be bombed and destroyed, that hatred would be so bad that Catholics would have stopped talking to Protestants and Protestants to Catholics.  I wondered, when I walked out of this House this evening and saw up to 500 university students sitting on the roadside in Kildare Street and Molesworth Street if they really knew what street politics is about.  Street politics is, in my judgment, the weapon used by the people against a Government which introduces repression.  If that is the price the Government want to pay, let them understand their decision before they take it.  When you start street politics you cannot just switch it off.  It is not possible to switch on and off.  If you want to pay the price of street politics in the city of Dublin&mdash; this is where it will start&mdash;go ahead with your repressive legislation this evening.  Go ahead to the country, <Col N="804" /> when you are beaten in the vote, and tell the people what you want to have is law and order.  I will tell them what you want to have.</P>

      <P>You want to have powers which make you answerable to no one.  We have had people talking about the Provos.  Let us not stick our heads in the sand and believe anything other than what we are told by people closely associated with the Government party of how the Provos began.  I remember, in a lengthy telephone conversation from this building to the Falls Road in January, 1970, speaking to a member of the Stormont Parliament, asking him if there were many IRA gunmen in the Falls Road district at that time.  I was told there were not many, but if the amount of money coming from the city of Dublin to pay those people to come on the streets at night to shoot each other if they could not find British soldiers or policemen to shoot&mdash;remember that is what they did&mdash;kept coming, then, before December, 1970, not alone would there be fewer than 30 but there would be more than 3,000.  If anyone wants to identify this person the simple knowledge of who represents Falls Road in Stormont will give the answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now have the Fianna Fáil Party telling us that, if we vote against this type of legislation tonight, we are supporting the Provisional IRA.  Do they forget the paper called <i>The Voice of the North?</i>  Do they forget who financed <i>The Voice of the North</i> and who edited it?  Do they forget for whom he was public relations officer before he took up that position?  We have reached a time when southern politics are being influenced by the Northern scene, when Deputies are now counting the bonus votes they will get by clambering on to the bandwagon of the tragedy in our country.  If my information is right an election will be held this side of Christmas.  Over the next three weeks, irrespective of whether there is a solution found for Northern Ireland, and not caring if families are bombed to eternity, politicians this side of the Border will be deciding that the more emotional, the more republican, <Col N="805" /> the more anti-British, the more anti-Unionist and the more anti-Provisional they become, the bigger the vote they will get on polling day.</P>
    <P>At this stage, having given loyalty to the Government as an Opposition Deputy and feeling no regret about the stand I have taken, I find myself asking what thanks I have got.  What thanks have people like Deputy Cruise-O'Brien got for being brutally frank with the southern community?  What thanks has Deputy Corish got for keeping his party on the rails?  What thanks has Deputy Cosgrave got for taking a similar line?  We have all been used by the Government.  We have been asked to be responsible.  I hope we have met the demands of the Government, but we have not been acknowledged.</P>
    <P>We are now told that because we oppose repressive legislation we are on the side of the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; in our society.  The theme in the general election campaign is: &ldquo;Do you favour law and order or do you favour anarchy?&rdquo; It will not be: &ldquo;Do you favour fairplay or do you favour repression?&rdquo; I would like to conclude by saying that, if there is to be a general election, I will make my position clear to the electorate.  I stand for a society in which all the people on this island of Irish parents and grandparents, irrespective of what their religious views and beliefs are, will be able to live together.  If people who have supported me feel that this stand is not shouting for one's own team, then I am afraid someone else will have to represent them in this House.</P>
    <P>I believe in being Irish first and being a politician second.  I am afraid the Government have fallen short of my standards in this regard.  I would like them to aim at the same standards and play the game fairly.  If it is to be a ruthlessly-fought election, then I will meet that challenge.  If it is to be a well-debated, constructive, responsible campaign, then I will accept that.  I believe this country can no longer jog-trot along in the way it has over the last three years, saying that we have not got enough legislation to convict those people.  The people in Donegal who might read this speech know exactly what I am talking about without <Col N="806" /> my having to enumerate the different things going through my mind at this moment.</P>
    <P>On one occasion, perhaps about 12 months ago, a young waitress in the town of Lifford, walking harmlessly to Strabane which is in the same parish, was shot dead.  I do not think there is any person in the parish of Clonleigh or within 25 miles of the scene of that tragedy has any doubt in his mind as to who was responsible.  I wonder why the authorities did not arrest the people concerned.  If someone happens to come out of a public house and uses obscene language, if someone forgets to get his car taxed or forgets to get his driving licence, he will find himself appearing at the next sitting of the district court, but to this date nothing has happened about the death of Bríd Carr.  This is one of the shames I carry with me and which I suppose the people of my community carry also, that we knew that in our society, in our community, there were people who were responsible for that young girl's death.  I do not think the Government needed this type of repressive legislation to get convictions in that case.</P>
    <P>That is why I believe I am justified in saying to the Government that they are now using a steamroller to crack a nut and now telling the people that because of their failures of the past three years to back up law and order, to comply with the mandate the people gave them to protect society against subversion and to govern this country in the manner which we expected them to govern, they must have this legislation. They have failed and so much so that they now shamelessly come before us and say: &ldquo;We had not got the powers to rule the country in the way we wanted to rule it&rdquo;, but it took them three years to make up their minds about it.</P>
    <P>During those three years many things happened which are no credit to any Member of this House, no credit to any members of the forces of law and order, no credit to any person who calls himself Irish, because this is not the society we want.  The society we want is a peaceful society with which all people can identify, a society in which each person will be able to call <Col N="807" /> himself Irish without being spat at by someone who might use the word &ldquo;renegade&rdquo;, in which a person who wants to call himself Irish will be belittled by people who think they are super-Irishmen and super-patriots, who believe that their brand of nationalism is the purest and that any person falling short of this is just an Irishman by birth and by accident but not really and truly Irish.</P>
    <P>Let me say in conclusion that I had the privilege of speaking on the last day of the 17th Dáil and the last day of the 18th Dáil.  I think I have now had the privilege of speaking on the last day of the 19th Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike other speakers in the debate, who said they would detain the House only a short time, I will detain the House only a short time.  I think everybody in the House and in the country knows what is in this Bill and it is therefore unnecessary for me to examine it section by section, clause by clause.  This Bill sets up a police state.  Let us be clear about that.  There were quite sufficient powers in the Offences Against the State Act passed here in 1939, part of which was subsequently found to be unconstitutional but the rest of which has remained in operation ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that Bill was going through the House, I heard the late Professor John Marcus O'Sullivan say from the Fine Gael benches across to the Taoiseach, Mr. Eamon de Valera: &ldquo;I would trust nobody with these powers&rdquo;, and the then Taoiseach replied: &ldquo;I would only trust myself with them&rdquo;.  Are we now expected to give huge additional police powers to the Government of this country?  If anybody had said that to me when I came back to this House in 1969, I would have said he was out of his mind.  Yet we have seen the fabric of this State go to pieces completely in the past three years.  No words that may be used by any member of the Government can wash out the reference in subsection (2) of section 3 to a senior police officer, and no matter how long he talks, nobody can wash out the particular <Col N="808" /> kind of reference, that what this man believes he can give evidence about in court.  One does not have to have been in court very often to realise that if you bring your beliefs before a judge, he will tell you to go away, to take a jump in the Liffey.  You will not say it for very long if you say that you &ldquo;believe&rdquo; but this is the case from now on as far as particular police officers are concerned,</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are the oldest political party in this country.  To their credit, they took no part in the civil war but they paid a high price for that, a price which they are still paying. Notwithstanding that history of having no connection whatever with violence, the members of this party were last year accused in this House, in my hearing, of being supporters of murderers. Who made that accusation? The very man who is in charge of this Bill, the pocket Napoleon we have here, who is going to change the whole attitude of this country, he thinks, and going to have people in the courts guilty unless they prove themselves innocent.  I am not a lawyer, but I thought I knew what proof was&mdash; mathematical proof and logical proof &mdash;but to my surprise, I found that legal proof was a completely different thing, a completely different kind of animal.  Legal proof is something that can stand up chapter and verse.  The trouble about this Bill is quite simply that judges are bound by statute law and it has been their customs and their tradition that, no matter how much personally they may disagree with what is in the statute, they have to implement it.</P>
    <P>It is not the Labour Party who created the people now called the subversives, the Provisional IRA.  The Provisional IRA were spawned by the Fianna Fáil Party.  We all know that. We may have differences of opinion about various things in this House but there is no question about the truth of that statement.  At this moment of time &mdash;a popular phrase I hear used now but I cannot remember having used it myself&mdash;perhaps it is a significant moment and perhaps not&mdash;it is the Minister for Justice backed by the Government who is subverting the <Col N="809" /> common, law which by tradition gives certain rights to ordinary people.</P>
    <P>Why did the Fianna Fáil Party set up the Provisional IRA?  They did it because the Official IRA, who have behaved very well in recent times, have kept their word since they declared the truce.  There is no man in this House who knows fewer members of the IRA of either type than I do.  I am not aware that I know a single member of either group.  The Official IRA had become known as a progressive left wing organisation. They were regarded as socialists and that would not do for the party of the big money, the conservative party.  Therefore, they set up this illegitimate organisation and having set it up, they find now that it is a Frankenstein with which they have to deal.  If they had not set it up, we would not be in this House now facing a general election on a law and order campaign, by the way.  Law and order my foot!  This is an attempt by the Government to divert attention from their own failure.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out&mdash;I realise this is an awkward point I am going to make&mdash;with force that is coercive for me at any rate that the particular chief superintendent who will be involved&mdash; I am talking about the cases now which do involve subversives&mdash;is a man whose evidence, to any ordinary person, is extremely suspect.  As has been pointed out here, when asked any awkward question he can plead privilege. It is the ultimate in nonsense that people's freedom, people's rights to go about their ordinary business, can be sworn away by a man who can plead privilege the minute he is asked an awkward question.  Anybody who goes into a court realises that judges have more regard for the evidence of policemen than they have for the evidence of ordinary people.  There are a number of reasons for this.  They are more skilled in giving their evidence.  They are very often more careful.  I think this is as it should be, a police officer should be received better than an ordinary witness but not when it is done in this outrageous fashion.</P>
    <P>The long standing legal position in <Col N="810" /> these islands&mdash;that is why the expression &ldquo;Coercion Acts&rdquo; came into being&mdash;is that a person is innocent until he is proved guilty.  In certain continental countries it is otherwise. Now under this Bill in the year 1972 because the Government have made such a mess of the ordinary affairs and we are now next door to bankrupt, they trump up this excuse to create an issue upon which they believe they can win a general election.</P>
    <P>The difficulty about this legislation is not that anybody here wants to defend subversives or to support them in any way but the people who are in this subversive organisation I am talking about that was created by the Fianna Fáil Party have shown an unrivalled capacity for precluding the Government from proving that they are members of that organisation.  It is the business of the Government so to apply the law and to pass such law as, without interfering with the ordinary citizens, will enable the State to convict those people if it is a crime to belong to a subversive organisation of this sort.  If that is a crime it is the business of the Government to deal with it without passing this kind of disgraceful legislation.</P>
    <P>The fact is that it does not matter what judges may think personally of the evidence.  I realise an effort has been made in the last few days to say: &ldquo;It is only evidence&rdquo;.  That is not the way it is in the Bill.  As it is in the Bill, it will be coercive on the judge, regardless of what his personal opinion may be, to apply this subsection of section 3 which destroys the rights of the ordinary citizen under the common law.  This Bill strengthens in an outrageous fashion an Act which should now be repealed. If the Government had come into the House with a proposal to repeal the Offences Against the State Act, do they really believe there would have been any substantial opposition in this House?  There is a pretence that the institutions of State are under pressure.  I would need to believe in fairy tales to believe that.</P>
    <P>A couple of nights ago we had institutional force on a massive scale here.  At the back entrance to Leinster <Col N="811" /> House a military force was drawn up, gardaí by the hundred.  There were four or five times as many gardaí there as ordinary citizens who, quite rightly, kept away down at Merrion Square.  I am talking about the massive display of force.</P>

      <P>In the 1930s in this country the Government were able to carry on in infinitely more difficult circumstances than exist now without any of this legislation.  The legislation which is now being strengthened was not passed until war broke out, until 1939.</P>
      <P>Captain John Brooke in the North, who has not been noted for his liberal views, has referred to this Bill.  He showed more regard for democracy in this whole island than do the Government.  I agree with him 100 per cent.  He believes that this Bill if it goes on the statute book will destroy the democratic good name of this Republic.</P>
      <P>Last Monday night I watched BBC television and I heard a commentator make an interesting point about this Bill.  He said that the Bill contains some of the most far-reaching powers a stable conventional democracy can arrogate to itself.  Have we not a stable conventional democracy here? I take it everyone knows what a democracy is although people on occasions have spoken about their form of democracy in relation to Russia. Of course, this shows that one can make a word mean anything one likes and this has been done frequently in Acts of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Foreign Affairs said the European Communities Bill was the most important Bill <Col N="812" /> that had come before the House.  That Bill was not a proper piece of legislation but this Bill is a proper piece of legislation in that what it intends to do is carefully defined.  In fact, if it is put into operation with full force we will have here a complete police state as bad as exists anywhere in the world.  It can be asked if one would not trust the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch.  I would trust the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, but what guarantee have I how long he will be here? Quite frankly I hope he will be here for a short time only&mdash;this is not personal&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are a number of people on this side of the House who will not interfere with the rights of the citizen in the fashion of this Bill.  If this Bill should become law the new Government will wipe it out when they come into office just as the then Government wiped out the massive taxation that had been put on in the supplementary budget in 1947 by Deputy Aiken.  That enormous amount of taxation increased the price of practically every commodity but when they wiped it out it was forgotten in a few months.</P>

      <P>I do not want to dwell on these matters because they are not relevant to the Bill but I am glad to have aroused members on the Government benches from their apathy. When a Government try to impose a fascist regime the whole object of the exercise is to make the people feel apathetic and to take it quietly.  This is done by pretending that certain legislation is directed at &ldquo;roughnecks&rdquo; and <Col N="813" /> the like and will not apply to ordinary individuals.  Is it the case that, in view of the enormous budget this year, the Government are in difficulties and know that people have discovered this fact?  This year the budget was 2½ times more than when I came into the House a few years ago.  Perhaps the Government have realised that if they wait another six months to have a general election they could not win it because people would be well aware of the state of affairs in the country.</P>

      <P>There have been surprises in election results before and Fianna Fáil may be in for the biggest surprise of their lives.  It has been proved conclusively that the Government have only one ambition, namely, to cling to office no matter what happens. They are determined to stay in office in circumstances where any other democratic Government would have toppled.  Fianna Fáil cling to office like limpets&mdash;in fact, they have about the same amount of brains as limpets because people of genuine ability would not do what they are doing.</P>
      <P>Yesterday morning a letter was published in the newspapers from a district justice, a man whose job it is to help operate our legal system.  He said that the object of this strange piece of legislation now before the Dáil appears to be to give the power of internment of suspected IRA men to the police for whose action the Minister is responsible while making a clever and ruthless effort to pass the onus of making the order for imprisonment to a judge, for whose actions the Minister is not responsible.  In other words, this is internment without the name of internment; it is the setting-up of concentration camps without calling them concentration camps.  It does not matter that I might not think that much of the people who will be put in the concentration camps but it is surprising the way tyranny develops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the beginning of tyranny in this country.  District Justice Sweetman has pointed out that every judge <Col N="814" /> before his appointment makes a solemn declaration that, without fear or favour, he will administer justice in accordance with the law but what can he do when he is faced with what many lawyers believe to be an unjust law?  Each judge must handle that dilemma on his own.  I shall leave the matter to Deputy O'Higgins to deal with.</P>
    <P>The custom of judges has been that they regard the making of laws as the function of Parliament, the function of this House basically, and anything done in this House, subject to the right of the Supreme Court to decide on the constitutionality of Acts, is the law.  But that is subject to another piece of statute law, something that is superior to ordinary statute law which is, in itself, in fact, a piece of statute law.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Mr. Sweetman writes:</P>
    <P>I would ask you to publish this letter before the Bill is passed in its present form; otherwise, I would be risking imprisonment for myself and perhaps for you too.</P>
    <P>That is fair comment on this Bill.  As I said already, other people have gone through the Bill and it would be quite easy to go through it, item by item, section by section, and prove the various points I have made, but it is not necessary to do that in view of this debate on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>My horizons will not be as wide as those of many who have spoken before me.  I propose to support the Bill and I do so for reasons which are personal rather than anything else.  I have not the time and, perhaps, not the ability to go into questions of law, order and evidence as deeply as I should like and at such a time I must draw on my personal experience.  I found myself, on returning home one night, in the unpleasant situation that my house was picketed when it contained nobody but my wife and children.  On one occasion I was visited by the sergeant of the local gardaí who was making arrangements with me and my wife that if anybody came that we <Col N="815" /> thought should not have admission we could communicate with him.  I have had the experience of reading that a group came down from Belfast and inspected the local power station the main source of our economy there.  I have had the experience of reading of a Garda from Roscommon who was murdered in this city and, if I recall correctly, a witness with great reluctance gave evidence.  From reading the papers I recall a number of court cases of people who actually pleaded guilty to the charges made against them but were aquitted.  I know of cases where witnesses refused to give evidence through fear.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to have my personal experiences repeated and as far as I can see the danger that they will be is more likely to arise.  Throughout the debate much reference was made to the courts, to evidence, to the judges and all the paraphernalia of the law.  I have had some experience of the courts, perhaps, not a lot.  I have always had great admiration for the judges and lawyers and always felt they had an anxiety to bring in a just verdict.  As far as possible this verdict was dealt with humanely.  In the days when the Workmen's Compensation Act was in force I attended a number of these cases as a witness.  When the Act was abolished I paid tribute in the House to the humanity of the judges who tried those cases.  For this reason I have absolute faith in the judges.  The previous speaker, Deputy O'Donovan, to my mind, made the most important statement on this Bill.  He said that he defeated the Government in the courts, thereby establishing that an individual can beat the Government if he goes the right way about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been discussions as to what chief superintendents will say and will not say.  Deputy O'Donovan invited Deputy O'Higgins to enlarge on some matter for him and I should like to hear him enlarge on the question of evidence.  Throughout the debate the suggestion was thrown out that just because somebody gives evidence the judge accepts it.  This almost presupposes that there is only one party in every case.  In my experience there are <Col N="816" /> two parties in most cases that come to court and both sides give evidence and in nearly all cases the evidence of one side is rejected and the evidence of the other side accepted, perhaps, not <i>in toto:</i> the loser does not have his evidence rejected <i>in toto,</i> either.  I should be very interested to know if, in fact, a judge has not the right to reject any evidence offered if he believes it is not correct.  He establishes this by examination or cross-examination on a particular question put to the person in the witness box.</P>
    <P>Arising out of that, I thought, listening to Deputy Cooney yesterday, that he did not deal with this aspect of the Bill.  He dealt with it as it has been dealt with in public.  I understand that if this Bill becomes law and is used in court it will not be there in isolation but will be there along with all the criminal law that has gone before it. And this is the way it will be used in court.  In this way, I understand, it can be circumscribed.</P>
    <P>Many different points have been raised in the debate.  One was the question of liberty.  This is vitally important and this made itself apparent to me when I found my house picketed.  The liberty of my family might or might not be interfered with.  Nobody likes to take away anybody's liberty but we must understand what liberty is.  Liberty must not interfere with other people's liberty and at the times of great stress one of the contradictions in society is this: in fact, to preserve your liberty when it is under pressure you must interfere with the liberty of all citizens.  This happened in the first world war.  The British Government, the one we knew best, had to introduce laws curbing the activities of the citizens. It happened to a greater extent in the second world war with all the rationing restrictions, restrictions on the movement of people, and so on.  At that time it struck me that the state was almost as much of a dictatorship as the states it was fighting against on the grounds that these were dictators. It appears to me that this will always be the situation.</P>
    <P>Democracy is another word that was thrown around.  The number of unsigned telegrams one gets is amazing. <Col N="817" /> I make a point of replying to telegrams and I should be delighted to get addresses but for some reason they are not signed.  I got an unsigned telegram yesterday from Carrick-on-Shannon to say that there is a silent march and they are asking me to protect democracy. There was a certain silence in Carrick-on-Shannon throughout the year because the tourist season was not as good as it might be.</P>
    <P>On the question of democracy, the only people who are subject to democracy are the people who come into this House, county councillors and others elected by the public.  If the people do not like us they can vote us out of this House.  How many organisations who are assuming authority outside this House can be voted out of authority? I was talking to a constituent of mine the other day about these problems and he said: &ldquo;If I do not like you I can vote you out of Government.  If I do not like Telefís Éireann I can write to them but I cannot make much impression on them and I cannot put them out of business.  If I do not like what the Provisionals are doing I dare not even write to them or open my mouth to them.  In the long run you are the only people who are subject to the democratic process.&rdquo;  This is something we should not lose sight of.</P>
    <P>I sat through a certain amount of the debate yesterday and I heard Deputy Cooney and Deputy Oliver Flanagan speak.  The latter's contribution was somewhat hysterical.  I heard Deputy Noel Browne speak and I thought his contribution was very sincere and moving.  It was of interest to me that they placed so much blame on the schools for the difficulties in which this country finds itself now. This recalls to me one occasion when I spoke to Mr. Jerry Boland, who was Minister for Justice in the 1957 to 1961 period.  I expressed the view to him then that if the schools of Ireland taught history as it should be taught, many more young men would have been taking part in activities such as are taking place in the North of Ireland. I said that both the Church and the State went out of their way to prevent history being taught in Irish schools because they did not want this trouble <Col N="818" /> from the young men of Ireland.  This is in direct contradiction to what my colleague, Deputy Browne, has said. He seems to have had a different experience at school from what I had. I certainly was not taught history that would provoke militancy.  I went to a diocesan college.  The man who taught me history there is still alive and I should like to take this opportunity to pay him tribute as a first class history teacher.  He taught us a great deal of history in a very intelligent manner, to such an extent that much of it has remained with me since.  I cannot recall that at any time he used the subject for emotional reasons, although his family were associated with the republican movement of the period.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne also suggested that young men who are fighting in the North are in the same position as those involved in the 1916 to 1921 activities.  This is an opinion with which I do not agree.  The situation is quite different.  The people of the 1916-1921 period expressed a desire in two elections for a particular type of government, but this was frustrated by the British Government and when those concerned found they could not get that in a constitutional manner they decided to fight for it.</P>
    <P>After 1932 the situation changed completely because those elected had not to take the oath and Parliament was open to people of all beliefs and principles.  To achieve their aims they had not to resort to violent means.  It has often been said that this Dáil represents the will of the Irish people but I have always had the feeling that this was not 100 per cent true.  The groups who advocate violence should be represented in this House.  They should declare to the people in a constitutional manner that if they came to power they would use the forces of the State to achieve unity by violence. It was a pity that in 1957 when there were four or five Deputies elected that they did not come in here and establish such a party.  I do not want to be misunderstood in this regard.  I believe that if this happened much of the activity that is taking place outside the House would not take place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> As a person who has given evidence in court I would like to refer to the evidence which Mr. O'Kelly gave in court.

      <P>I am sorry.  People discussing the Northern problem should have some idea as to how best we can reconcile our two peoples.  The visit of the late Mr. Seán Lemass to Captain O'Neill in Northern Ireland was one of the biggest contributions that any man in this country made to unity and, secondly, it was Mr. Lemass's greatest achievement.  The development of this approach, which was already taking place through co-operation in regard to electricity, drainage, tourism and so on, was the slow, cautious means of solving this problem.  At times reading about Mahatma Ghandi one was inclined to think that this civil rights business, this refusal to co-operate, would probably hurry things up a bit, and I remember when Mr. Austin Currie sat into some house that he felt was wrongly allotted, believing that it was going to start then but it was some months afterwards when it started.</P>
      <P>In other countries many organisations start off with good intentions. They may be more aggressive than people like, but always tagged on to these organisations is a certain section who want to create trouble for their own reasons and they bring the organisations into bad odour.  This is something that happened with the civil rights movement in the North though at that time, it seemed to be innocuous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not in the House, but I understand from what Deputy Harte said that a Deputy who spoke here earlier took some responsibility for the establishment of the Provos.  He, and subsequent speakers, suggested <Col N="820" /> that this would be attributed to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I want to repudiate that.  It is not correct or fair that this attribution should be made.</P>
    <P>There is another point I should like to make.  I referred to the fact that a power station was used by an organisation from the North.  If, at some time, certain people put an explosive there, and they were picked up on the road two or three miles away and had northern accents, but could not be otherwise associated with this crime, the Garda could not detain them for longer than 48 hours.  From experience I know what the attitude of the people in my area would be in those circumstances.  Section 2 could deal with that to some extent.  Most other points have been adequately covered. I just want to put on the official record some of my thoughts in regard to these matters.  One of my main reasons for supporting this Bill is the fact that I myself have been subjected to certain intimidation.</P>

      <P>At this stage, in this debate, it would be a very courageous Deputy who would try to strike a humorous note.  I shall not attempt to do so, but I recall listening to speeches when this proposed Bill was first announced by the Minister; it was announced on television. A Minister told the people that he had been concerned about the inadequacies of our statute law and had been working for many months on a Bill to amend the law to enable him to deal with the IRA.  One could not but have visions of midnight oil being burned and the Minister hour after hour, day after day, week after week, month after month, scribbling, writing, reading, drafting, cogitating, consulting, and having conferences, and the results of all this going into the Minister's <i>magnum opus,</i> into something that would enable him to do what he wished to do with a new piece of legislation designed to put teeth into the little tiger and give him a way of dealing with the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last Monday we got this Bill containing three sections and a definition section.  After all the months, and months, and months of cogitation, conference and worry we have a Bill <Col N="821" /> containing a title section, a definition section and three other sections, two of which are repeats from the Offences Against the State Act. Immediately I saw this I began to wonder at the bona fides behind it and I was struck by the coincidence of events.  Last Saturday morning an astonished Irish public read of the sacking of the RTE Authority.  Last Saturday night a satisfied Irish public read of the conviction of Mac Stiofáin. On Sunday we had the clarion call made by these pseudo-militants to converge on Dublin city and, on Monday morning, the mountain having gone into labour, produced this mouse.</P>
    <P>That was no coincidence.  That was all deliberate political play-acting by the Government.  Having realised what was going on, I looked at the Offences Against the State Act.  I will not go through it in detail, but these are the powers and these were the powers available to the Minister for Justice for years back.  Section 6 provides that every person who is a member of an unauthorised armed force shall be guilty of an offences and liable to ten years' penal servitude. How many times in the last few years have armed men, wearing berets, strode around forming fours and posing for photographs, firing shots in the air?  Each single one of those was liable under that Act to be convicted for felony and sent to jail for ten years.  Their photographs were in the papers; their identity was known to the Minister for Justice and to the Garda Síochána but no action was taken.</P>
    <P>Section 7&mdash;intimidation or obstruction of the Government, the Legislature, the Courts or the Judiciary&mdash;a felony punishable with seven years' penal servitude.  How often did we see in the last few years mobs collected in different district courts throughout the country for the purpose of intimidating and obstructing the process of justice, with the gardaí present, looking on, with the photographs of these people in the newspapers, with their identities known, and no action taken by the Minister for Justice or the Government?</P>
    <P>Section 15&mdash;unlawful drilling, manoeuvres <Col N="822" /> or training, or coming together to meet for that purpose, a misdemeanour punishable with imprisonment for two years.  How often in the last few years did we see that and no action taken?  Other provisions of the Act provide for every known facet of illegal activity; every known symptom is dealt with in the Offences Against the State Act, an Act passed by this House after years, and years, and years, of experience of illegal IRA activity.  And that Act was brought in and passed by experts, by people who knew from the inside what the IRA were.  There is not a single threat and not a single activity the IRA engage in that is not covered by the Offences Against the State Act. Meetings can be prohibited.  Processions can be banned.  The publication of all kinds of documents can be prevented. Every person seen in or near a place where a crime has been committed, or who could reasonably be suspected of committing a crime&mdash;Deputy Dr. Gibbons referred to such a case&mdash;can be arrested by a Garda officer, can be brought to a Garda barracks, can be detained for 24 hours, for a further 24 hours, can be asked to give an account of his movements and, if he does not answer or gives an account which is not to the satisfaction of the Garda questioning him, he can be sent to jail for six months.</P>
    <P>There is provision in the Act for special criminal courts.  We have them now.  There is provision in the Act for different forms of prosecution for different offences.  This Act has not been enforced.  One might ask can anything more be required?  I would say that there might, perhaps, be some extra facility in relation to evidence, something minimal, but there is no defect in the Offences Against the State Act which justified Government inaction for the past three years and there is nothing which justified a worried, anxious and determined Minister to sit pondering month after month, biting his nail, searching his soul, researching into the law and all the rest of it.  There is no defect in our present code of law.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I and my colleagues very quickly began to suspect from the moment of the publication of this <Col N="823" /> Bill last Monday, from the paucity of its provisions, from the fact that it repeats, as I will show in a moment, two sections of the Offences against the State Act, that all this is part of an exercise in the political conning of this Dáil and it is being done by a Government who realise they can no longer afford to do nothing in relation to the IRA and they are now anxious to explain their delay over the past three years and to produce an excuse for their political cowardice since 1969.  That is what this Bill is about. They failed to take action when action was needed.  They lowered the confidence of people in our institutions. They allowed armed bravados to intimidate people and it is only when the picket goes on the houses of Fianna Fáil Deputies that we see action.</P>
    <P>Bodenstown, the GPO, the firing of shots outside the GPO, armed military funerals throughout the country, a town in County Wicklow cordoned off for a bank raid, the murders of Garda officers, all these things have gone on, to the eternal shame of the Fianna Fáil Government.  All these things were permitted.  No effort was made to enforce the law.  But they could not afford to continue in inaction because they realised that not merely the patience of the people here at home but the patience of people outside was running out.  They were forced to take action.</P>
    <P>What action did they take?  They abolished the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority and they rushed in with this Bill in an effort to provide a political alibi for their political cowardice.</P>
    <P>We have had an extraordinary situation in the lifetime of this Dáil.</P>

      <P>Since 1969, in the lifetime of this Dáil, we have seen gross intimidation by the self-appointed leaders of subversive groups and organisations, people who give Press interviews, people who issue press releases and all the rest of it, and not <Col N="824" /> one step taken by this Government to enforce the law against them.  Why, I ask, and the people ask why?  The answer is perfectly clear.  The reason no action was taken up to this was that inside the Government party were sympathisers and active associates of the IRA.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget the arms scandal. Let us not forget that two Ministers were implicated, according to the Taoiseach, and subsequently charged. Let us not forget that another Minister and Parliamentary Secretary left the Government in sympathy with those men.  What were they supposed to be doing?  What was the allegation against them?  That they were importing arms to put in the hands of the Provisionals in Belfast and Derry&mdash; this in the lifetime of this Parliament, and this coming from the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>We know that the Ministers implicated, according to the Taoiseach, were only the big fellows.  There were many other sympathisers inside Fianna Fáil, and they are still inside Fianna Fáil, hidden and quiet now, but identifiable.  The dissidents were not merely the six who left.  There are those still inside the party who sympathised openly just two years ago at the time of the arms scandal.  They are still inside the ranks of Fianna Fáil and, because they were there, no action was taken up to this.  The law was not enforced because to do so in the past two years would have been political suicide for them and for their leader.  Let us look at the record, and a miserable record it is.  Section 19 of the Offences against the State Act provides for the making of suppression orders against unlawful organisations.</P>

      <P>It provides for the making of suppression orders against <Col N="825" /> unlawful organisations and, until a suppression order is made, no organisation is unlawful.  It is surprising to note that only one suppression order was made under the Offences Against the State Act.  It was made in September, 1939, and it declared to be unlawful an illegal organisation known as the IRA, otherwise the Irish Republican Army, otherwise Oghlaigh na hÉireann.  That is the only suppressed organisation under the Offences Against the State Act.  No suppression order, no declaration of illegality, has been made in relation to the two distinct organisations that have grown up in the past 33 years, one of which has a Chief of Staff called Goulding and the other a Chief of Staff called Stephenson.  Those two organisations militant, aggressive organisations, illegal armies outside the Constitution, outside the control of this House, recognise no law except their own law and seek to intimidate ordinary people in the courts of this land.  These organisations have not been suppressed. Why?  Because the Fianna Fáil Government had not the courage to do it. To suppress the Provisionals at any stage up to this would have caused a political fissure inside Fianna Fáil. There are Fianna Fáil Deputies listening to me who know well that I am telling the truth and hitting the nail on the head.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is action being taken now when up to this no action was taken when action was necessary. Suddenly something is to be done. Who cracked the whip?  I suggest the whip was cracked in London and the orders came from there.  Action is to be taken, not because of what is required in Irish circumstances and in Irish conditions, but just because the story must appear right outside this country and to the Prime Minister of Britain.  In the decades gone by, in the days of the first Government of this country when this problem was there, as it is today, except that there were different leaders and the personnel were different, when this kind of legislation <Col N="826" /> had to be brought in, when extra powers had to be given to the military and the Garda authorities and to the courts, decisions were then taken without anyone outside the Government having the impertinence to interfere with Irish decisions.  They were taken by the Irish Government for Irish reasons and were exclusively the responsibility of the Government of this country.  Today I doubt if that is so.</P>
      <P>The Government say this Bill is necessary and that they have to get it to do their job.  If that is so, perhaps the Minister or some member of the Government could explain to the House why this Bill was not introduced three years ago when this Dáil was first elected.  If it is necessary now, it was necessary last year and the year before. Why was it not introduced?  The powers contained in section 2 enabling a Garda officer to ask for an account of a person's movements, a person he suspects of being involved in the commission of a crime, are also in section 52 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, precisely the same powers. In 1956-57 many members of illegal organisations were convicted of the offence of failing to give an account of their movements.  Why has that not been enforced?  The Taoiseach said it was contrary to the Convention on Human Rights.  The Convention on Human Rights of November, 1950, to which this country has subscribed, contains in Article 5 the conventions that the signatories regard as appropriate in relation to personal liberty.</P>
      <P>Article 5 provides:</P>
      <P>No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases...</P>
      <P>One of the cases is:</P>
      <P>The lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Taoiseach to explain to this House in what way, in what sense, section 52 of the Act of <Col N="827" /> 1939 contravenes that convention or any part of it?  It does not.  I accuse the Taoiseach of trying to cod this House by putting forward that as an excuse for not operating section 52.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that in introducing this Bill the Minister never mentioned the Convention on Human Rights as being a reason for not enforcing the powers already there.  The Taoiseach threw it in afterwards expecting, presumably, that no one would bother to look up the convention and see whether he was right or not.</P>
    <P>I assert that the powers contained in section 2 of this Bill are already in the Offences Against the State Act and that there has been no reason whatsoever why the provisions of sections 30 and 52 of the Act of 1939 have not been used.</P>
    <P>In regard to the other section which creates an offence&mdash;section 4&mdash;again, if one looks at the Offences Against the State Act one will see that the provisions in section 4 are already contained in sections 7 and 27 of that Act.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances we have two sections purporting to create new offences which, in fact, are already in our law for the last 33 years.  This whole thing is a political trick.  It is done to try to save the credibility of a Government that fell down on its task.</P>
    <P>In public life, a Cheann Comhairle, one has on some occasions to decide what it is right to do and then do it no matter what the consequences may be.  I believe that this is such a moment.  Everyone in this House, particularly every Deputy in the Opposition, has a responsibility&mdash;a responsibility to those who sent him here, a responsibility to his colleagues also, to observe and watch legislation, has a particular responsibility if the legislation is dealing with individual liberty and may be restrictive of it. We have a responsibility which we cannot renege on, a responsibility to examine carefully each proposed piece of legislation and if we think it goes too far, if we think it is excessive, if we think it is unjust, if we <Col N="828" /> think it is wrong, we have a responsibility to point that out, to seek amendment, to oppose, no matter what the consequences may be.  I believe this is such an occasion.</P>
    <P>No one can accuse me, I hope, of having any sympathy with the IRA. I am one Member of this House whose family experience indicates that I could have no such sympathy.  My grandfather was killed by them and my uncle, as Minister for Justice, was slain going to Mass.  I cannot ever be regarded as in any way sympathetic to illegal organisations or that kind of element, to those who do not recognise the authority of this Parliament. I am and I hope always will be, a democrat in the proper sense of that word.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I and my colleagues here tonight say that in this Bill, repetitious though it may be, there are certain provisions which we regard as potentially harmful to the individual and, therefore, unjust. We refer in particular to section 3, subsection (2).  We refer to the wording of section 4 which seems wide enough to cover an innocent bystander at a meeting or a procession and we point to the fact that this unusual legislation, this repressive and restrictive legislation, is proposed as a permanent part of our statute law and we feel that there should be a time limit upon it.</P>
    <P>If we have come to these conclusions as Deputies of the Opposition and as democrats, we have the obligation and the duty to try to get our point of view understood, to get the legislation, if not amended, opposed, and that is what we are doing here and now, loud and clear.</P>
    <P>My party is concerned for law and order.  My party built this State.  My party and its leaders established this Parliament and defended it when the Fianna Fáil Party was outside sneering and jeering, marching and drilling. We will take second place to no single party in this country in relation to the traditions of democracy and to the observance of law and order in this State.  But, we want to see Parliament work.  We want to see this Dáil work as a Parliament.  We <Col N="829" /> want to see things take place inside this Dáil whereby people can see that their work is being done, that the legislative process is not merely the handing down of a decision from a bureaucratic Government and everybody is supposed to say, &ldquo;Yes, we will do that&rdquo;.  This is a Parliament, a place for discussion, a deliberative assembly and it is our duty to see that it functions as such and, when we see in this kind of legislation errors and areas of possible injustice, it is our responsibility to point them out and to try to seek a change.</P>
    <P>On behalf of this party Deputy Cooney and I asked the Minister for Justice today whether he would be kind enough to see us because I was concerned at the dangers involved in this situation.  My colleagues and I were concerned, too, that we should do our duty as an Opposition.  At 1 o'clock today the Minister for Justice, together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, received Deputy Cooney and me.  We discussed this Bill and pointed out that we sought three amendments.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsection (2) of section 3 we sought an amendment which would provide that, if the accused person swore on oath that at the material time he was not a member of an unlawful organisation, that should be a conclusive answer to that particular charge.  We told the Minister also that we wanted an amendment to section 4 which would exclude an innocent bystander. We told him too that we wanted a time limit on the Bill and we suggested six months in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleague listened very courteously to us.  In fact, we discussed the details of these possible amendments for about half an hour.  At the end of that time I said to the Ministers that, if they indicated that they would meet our point of view along these lines on the Committee Stage of the Bill, we would not move our motion to refuse a Second Reading. The Ministers told me, and I accepted it entirely, that they were bound by a Government decision and they undertook to communicate with me later in the afternoon.  We know that the Government met in the afternoon, apparently for some hours.  At <Col N="830" /> about 4.30 p.m. a message was conveyed to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the effect that the Government were not prepared to give any undertaking in relation to amendments. What does that mean?  It means that an arrogant effort is being made to make this Parliament not function.  In a situation in which we have a Bill that was issued hastily and which has three glaring defects the Opposition are to be told that there will be no amendments of any kind.  I assert that that is making a farce of this Parliament.</P>

      <P>These are the things that cause these difficulties in our society.  I regret that, from time to time in our community, we disagree. We have never learned properly to abide by the decision of the majority. There are far too many people who insist on having their own way; and, in seeking to have their own way, they are driven to trying to achieve it by force.  I will not say anything more about that, but that is why we have illegal and subversive organisations in this country doing today what they did 20, 40 and 50 years ago, doing the kind of things which mean the negation of democracy.</P>
      <P>I am concerned with this legislation here because the situation is now that the Government are prepared to force this legislation through the House. They will not consider amendments and will not listen in any way to the reasoned suggestions put forward by this Parliament and when we react, as is our duty, when we say: &ldquo;You will not do that in a democratic Parliament&rdquo;, we are accused of being against law and order and of fomenting strife and trouble.  If they think they are going to get away with that, they had better think again.  The people of this country will not stand for that kind of double dealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Standards have been lowered in this country since 1970.  The Minister for Finance used to talk of low standards in high places.  There has been an appalling lowering of standards in high places in the last year.  The Government have failed to do their duty. They have allowed people to be intimidated by open breach of the law, and every member of that Government has shirked his duty because of the political disadvantage entailed.  Maybe <Col N="832" /> time heals.  If there is to be an election, perhaps we can be told whether Deputy Haughey is being taken back into the Cabinet.  That is something the people will like to know.  They will like to know exactly what kind of a deal has been made during the past six months or so.  This legislation is unnecessary.  Mr. Stephenson was arrested, charged and convicted.  He was arrested and charged with, among other things, a speech he made 18 months ago.  At any time in the past 18 months he could have been arrested, charged and convicted, but it was not done.  Do not let the Minister say that it was the tape that did it.  The fact is that the detective officers went shrimping and caught a big fish and he had to be charged. He was charged and convicted.  It demonstrated that the law was there all the time to be enforced.  The little tiger had teeth all along but there was not the will and the determination to use them.  This is a parliamentary effort to provide an alibi for a Government that failed to do their duty that can no longer be inactive.  They are forced into action and this Bill is supposed to give them credibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been listening for the past few days to a debate on a Bill which the Government endeavoured to put to the House and to the country as being a very important one.  But as time passes, as the minutes tick by, it appears as if the introduction of the Bill, as Deputy O'Higgins said, is part of a very well-laid plot.  That the plot may, in fact, recoil on the Government has yet to be seen.  I regret, while we are discussing the Bill here, that explosions are rocking the city.  If anybody would tell me that the people who, according to the Government are to be caught as a result of this legislation, are causing those explosions in an effort to stop the Bill I think they should have their heads examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a horrible thought.  I could not for the life of me see what earthly use to the Provos the explosions which occurred after the meeting in O'Connell Street the other night would be.  Is it not strange that it should be at that time that some of <Col N="833" /> the illegal organisations in the North which are not illegal here should come down here and cause an explosion? Is it not extraordinary that tonight, as the debate on the Bill draws to a close, explosions come again.  The thought must come into people's minds that there is only one group of people who can gain by those explosions and they are sitting on the benches across there.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach came in here yesterday and spoke about the Provos.  He spoke about the connection between the Provos and the Labour Party.  He referred to the Labour Party as being friends of the Provos.  All of you read <i>The Irish Press,</i> I think.  <i>The Evening Press</i> this afternoon carried the headlines: &ldquo;IRA Link Admitted by Blaney&rdquo;. It was not admitted by Blaney.  It was bragged of by Blaney, not Neil Blaney the backbencher here, the Independent, but Neil Blaney, the Government Minister.  He is the man who admitted that, as a Government Minister, he was involved in the setting-up of the Provos.</P>
      <P>Who was with him?  According to the Taoiseach at the time, and according to the court which tried the man, one of the Fianna Fáil vice-presidents, the present vice-president, Deputy Haughey, who was also a very important Minister.  I have great respect for the ability of Deputy Haughey.  For the life of me I could never understand why he became involved in this.  There must be some peculiar little twist which those of us who came to know him did not know about.  He was a brilliant man and, in my opinion, is a brilliant man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shocking situation that we now have what I consider to be a trick Bill introduced by the Government in an effort to create a general election situation so that the Taoiseach, <Col N="834" /> the respectable man, can lead the party into the election, stand next June for the Presidency and be replaced as the leader of Fianna Fáil by you know who.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We will wait and see.  I heard the Deputy talking about fairy tales before.  When the row started about the arms trial, the importation of arms into this country for use in the North, when the Provos were established, when the £100,000 disappeared, there were in this House a few big fish mainly Deputy Blaney and Deputy Haughey.  As with fish, they were attended by a number of little fellows.  They were not that small.  I do not think Deputy Flor Crowley could be described as small.  There was also Deputy MacSharry who made the famous statement in Sligo about what he would do with the non-Catholics in this country if things went wrong.  You had Deputy Allen and there was Deputy Briscoe who is now being lauded as the man who will show the way for ecumenism in this country.  He also felt we were not going far enough with our republican ideas.  The man who was shouting a few moments ago from the Fianna Fáil benches, Deputy Davern, also belonged to the small group who were travelling around the House with the two big fish holding meetings of the &ldquo;Letterkenny Parliament&rdquo; on the lawn, who would not come into this House to take part in the proceedings.  That is well known to anybody who is a regular attender here for many months.  They all stayed outside; they went to the restaurant but would not come in here to take part in the debates.  Those people did not agree with what the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, was doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You think of this happening, and then you had the sheer audacity of the Taoiseach in the House yesterday pointing across here saying the Labour Party were friends of the Provos. Somebody made a comment here on the first day of the debate which some people considered to be a little bit in bad taste.  I did not consider it so to be as I considered it to be terribly accurate.  He referred to the Provos <Col N="835" /> as the illegitimate sons of Fianna Fáil. What else are they?  Is it not true that, because of the fact that certain well-placed members of the Fianna Fáil Government considered that the Official IRA were not doing enough in the North, they encouraged other people to break away from them and set up the Provisional IRA to take part in the activities they have been taking part in since then?</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear to the House that the Labour Party down the years, when Fianna Fáil were in the hills, were in this House helping to defend democracy, making it possible for parliamentary democracy to work.  They took no part in the civil war, although they took a manly part in the fight for freedom before it.  We have accepted the sneers and barbs of Fianna Fáil for long enough, but now that they have asked for it they are going to get their answer.  As far as we are concerned, Fianna Fáil have proved themselves in the Bill before the House to be the greatest lot of chancers this country has ever seen. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, a man for whom I have a fairly high regard, came in here and followed the line that the Labour Party, individual members in particular, are friends of the Provos, that they want to do away with law and order and that they want to create chaos in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people I see facing two ways, the &ldquo;pulla-pusha&rdquo; birds of this country, are the Front Bench of Fianna Fáil because they want to have &ldquo;Republican Party&rdquo; on the election posters which will be out in a couple of days, in small letters and in brackets.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs can smile because he will not be involved in it at all.  He is a lucky man&mdash;he will be gone away&mdash;and I am sure he is thanking God that he is able to get out from this outfit anyway.  They want to be able to say &ldquo;Republican Party&rdquo; in small letters on their posters and to tell everybody else the wonderful people they are and that for the world they would not be seen lying down with Republicans.  Now the game is up because they have introduced here something which they thought they would be able to get away with and which they now find is blowing up in their own faces.</P>
      <P>We had yesterday evening Deputy Dowling resuming one of his old roles, that of the chief mudslinger of Fianna Fáil, except that this time, as befits a man of his present position, he puts on his gloves before throwing the mud.  He came in here to tell us what should be done and about lawful and unlawful organisations.  I would like again to remind the Government that the only reason unlawful organisations have been getting on so well in this country is that the Government would not allow the authorities to deal with them.  I have been sorry for the Garda authorities. They have been doing their best in very trying circumstances and they have been time and time again thwarted by people who did not want to have it said publicly that they were bad Republicans but had not the guts to come out in the open and say either one thing or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been reading two little books over the last few days to refresh my memory.  One is <i>Orders for the Captain</i> and the other a book written around the same time, <i>Arms and the Men.</i>  If the Front Bench Members of Fianna Fáil have not read those two books, I would voluntarily subscribe to the purchase of a copy for each of them because <Col N="837" /> they then might see what they are supposed to have done, and they have not denied doing.  This is the extraordinary thing about it because the documentation contained in them is nearly as bad as the documents in the Public Accounts Committee inquiry into the £100,000 which disappeared and never came back.  Indeed, I was reminded the other day of an arms dealer somewhere on the Continent who, when asked what arms he sold to the gentleman who went over representing certain members of this Government, said he did not sell any arms, he bought them.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, a number of people who are with the Government, supporters of the Government, who were described in various ways by speakers from the Government benches and each of them has explained his own case here: Deputy Sherwin, who has definitely left the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Blaney who was expelled and Deputy Brennan who was expelled and Deputy Foley who resigned.  They spoke here and spoke pretty well according to their lights, but it really struck me as rather peculiar that in all the comments they made, they did not say they were going to vote against the Government tonight.  They said they were not going to vote for them, but even when Deputy Blaney was asked by way of interruption here, if he was going to vote against the Government, his reply was: &ldquo;That is a very good question.&rdquo;  I would like to see these gentlemen coming in here and putting their votes where their voices are and let us see where they stand.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we can persuade them to vote in the way in which they should vote or the way they talked about voting, the Government will be defeated here tonight, and if the Government are defeated tonight they will have got their wish and it is a wish they will regret for a long time.  They have given the impression in a number of ways that nobody except a crowd of irresponsibles is objecting to the passing of this Bill.  They try to prove that protection for this House is badly needed.  They had literally hundreds of guards out there last night, standing around frozen with the cold, and wondering why the heck they were <Col N="838" /> brought away from their duties because there was nobody there except themselves, and the same happened tonight. They had all sorts of spotlights, radio vans and what have you, and military out on Leinster Lawn the night before. As one Deputy said earlier, at the time when there was a rather serious threat to the House, the only people there were the ushers and they successfully kept the invaders away.</P>
    <P>Before I go away from it, I want to repeat that I do not believe that the people responsible for the explosions in this city could have been the IRA because they would be damned stupid to do it.  If it was the responsibility of one of the Northern organisations, orange organisations, of course they have a free run here because they are not declared illegal and I regret very much the situation which has resulted in three explosions, with two people I understand dead, and we must offer their relatives our deepest sympathy.  It is too bad that anything we are doing cannot stop this sort of thing, but I would ask the Minister for Justice to say does he consider that he has not got the powers to deal with anything that has happened up to now?</P>
    <P>It is quite true that the Taoiseach came in here and said that a certain section&mdash;section 52, I think&mdash;of the Offences against the State Act was against the European Convention on Human Rights.  Deputy O'Higgins says it is not, that there is no doubt at all that it does not contravene that convention, but is it not an extraordinary thing that if it is in contravention of it, no effort was made by the Government even in this Bill to remove it from the statute book, or do the Government think that the Bill, if it ever becomes law, will stand up to the Convention on Human Rights?  Is it not true that this Bill is even worse than the section to which the Taoiseach referred?  Surely the Minister is not serious when he suggests that this Bill is a way of dealing with the matter differently from the way in which the previous Bill was to deal with it?  I suggest to the Minister that he has all the powers he requires.  In fact, I believe he has a lot more powers than he is entitled <Col N="839" /> to have and yet he has not been dealing with subversive elements in the country.</P>
    <P>I mentioned a few minutes ago that we in the Labour Party have a very proud record in this country of not being involved in any of these schemozzles which are carried on.  An effort was made to pinpoint one of our Deputies and he gave a personal explanation here.  He gave his reason for going to the Mater Hospital.  He said it was on humanitarian grounds to try to alleviate the suffering of a man who was there under guard.  I regret very much that it has been necessary for Deputy Thornley to come here and make that explanation.  Possibly his action was not politically wise, but then we are not all wonderfully wise politicians, and I would accept that Deputy Thornley, being a very humane man, did what he did in the best interests of the person he was attempting to succour.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that while I differ as widely as is possible from Mr. Seán Mac Stiofáin and what he stands for and have never under any circumstances given any support and will not give any support to the IRA, at the same time, I have a grudging admiration for a man who has got the strength of character to bring himself to death's door for something he stands for.  It is all right for those who have just come out of the restaurant having had their tea to be critical of somebody who has not eaten for a number of days.  I commented when somebody asked me recently if I wanted Seán Mac Stiofáin to die that if he died at least it was his own choice.  The 640 odd people who died in the North had no choice and the people who are supposed to have died in this city had no choice.  That still does not take away from the fact that I have a grudging admiration for somebody who is prepared to give his life, as apparently this man is, for his principles.  I do not agree with them; I could not disagree more with them, but at the same time we must be honest about those things.</P>
    <P>It has been said that only a group of dissidents, a group of people who do not really count, are opposed to <Col N="840" /> this Bill.  I assume they include the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in that. I have a telegram here from Navan Chamber of Commerce.  It says:</P>
    <P>Resolution passed unanimously. We the members of Navan Chamber of Commerce are opposed to oppressive legislation as embodied in the proposed amendment to the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.</P>
    <P>This came from a group of businessmen, without any influence from me or anybody else.  I have here a letter signed by ten teachers in the vocational school, Kells.  It says:</P>
    <P>We the undersigned teachers of the vocational school, Kells, County Meath, deplore the introduction by the Government of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1972, as a complete distortion of normal justice in a free and democratic society.</P>
    <P>I could go on and on&mdash;letters, memos, phone calls from responsible people. Turn on the television and what appears on it?  A group of priests. Dissidents no doubt, in the Fianna Fáil vocabulary, because it was a Fianna Fáil front bench man who some years ago referred to a respected cleric in this city as a so-called priest because he did not agree with what he was doing.</P>
    <P>We have all these people who apparently agree with us that the Government have enough power to deal with this sort of thing and are trying to get power which they are not entitled to.  I listened to and read the Minister's speech when he opened this debate.  Either the Minister is misinformed or he is trying to misinform this House because he suggested that there was no change in the rules of evidence, that when a person was accused by a chief superintendent of being a member of an illegal organisation that did not have to stand.  He said he was entitled to cross-examine the chief superintendent.  We all know that the chief superintendent has only to plead privilege and the man or his legal adviser will not be allowed to cross-examine him.  All that has to be <Col N="841" /> done if this Bill becomes law is for a garda for any reason&mdash;and I have great respect for the Garda and for their restraint at the present time, the great restraint being shown by them and by the Defence Forces&mdash;to point to a man and say he accused him of being a member of an illegal organisation, take him to court where a chief superintendent will repeat that because the garda told him he thought he was a member of an illegal organisation he is one and there is no defence to that.</P>

      <P>The Minister need not pretend that this is not so because he knows it is.  He knows the idea behind the whole thing is to carry on what was started a few months ago by the Government, an attempt to get a grip on everything in this country so that the opposition to Fianna Fáil will be worn down.</P>
      <P>The law as proposed is so wide that the Unionists in the North have expressed the opinion that they would like to have some of the powers which are to be bestowed by this Bill and they would be able to do things which they are unable to do at present.  Why we, who claim to be such a freedom loving people are being asked to support the Bill which is to take away the freedom of so many people on a flimsy excuse I do not know.  Would the Minister not admit that what he is asking us to do is to give him the power of internment?  Is it not true that instead of introducing internment &mdash;which, incidently the Taoiseach mentioned about two years ago that he might have to introduce in certain circumstances&mdash;we now have the Minister for Justice under another guise attempting to introduce internment?  I do not know what Fine Gael are going to do about this Bill.  I am sure they will vote against it.  Whether they do or not we in the Labour Party will vote against it because we are perfectly satisfied that the Bill should not appear on the statute book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Somebody mentioned earlier that Mr. Mac Stiofáin could have been arrested on a number of occasions and was not arrested.  It is true that a few short months ago Mr. Mac Stiofáin <Col N="842" /> was in Liberty Hall and not alone was he not arrested but he was given a guard of honour leaving it.  I think eight gardaí had to accompany him safely to his car.  If the State claim that they were looking for him, as we understood they were, why did they not arrest him then?  Is it not extraordinary that they knew that he was going to make a tape and they knew what was going to be on the tape when they arrested him, because if they arrested him on chance surely they could have arrested him on chance on a previous occasion?  The charges which were made against him included the tape and also included something he was alleged to have said on other occasions. The whole story of the Government in this case makes very bad reading.  Can the Minister tell me what exactly has been achieved by the arrest and sentence of Mac Stiofáin?  While I am not going to defend him or anything he does, it is rather remarkable that his arrest has resulted in the exact opposite to what the Minister said he hoped to achieve by having him arrested.</P>
    <P>Let us turn for a moment to this question of internment.  The Minister must be aware that the rate of killing in the North following the introduction of internment increased enormously.  It may be truly said that the conflagration in the North caused by internment has been the biggest trouble that has hit this island for many years.  Yet the Minister suggests that the way to solve our problems here is to intern certain people.  The Minister already has the power to arrest and try people.  The Government have not used it for some extraordinary reason, or not so extraordinary when one thinks of what the Government are doing.  They have now come along with this peculiar sort of Bill and are expecting to get it passed in this House.  If it is defeated, as I expect it will be, they will have a general election and will claim they are going to fight it on the law and order issue. I should like to make a comment on that.</P>
    <P>A few days ago on the RTE news programmes at 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. there was a comment that the issue would be whether the Government or illegal <Col N="843" /> organisations would have the right to rule the country.  That was a most improper comment to make on the national radio station because the issue is not as was stated.  The issue is that the Government want to take powers to which they are not entitled.  If they are defeated in this attempt they will have an election and attempt to hang around our necks the charge that in some way we are responsible for what has gone wrong.</P>
    <P>It might be convenient for the Government to do something like that. They must have an election next year and the economic trends show that things are not getting better.  If they are able to claim they are running an election campaign on a law and order issue they hope people will forget rising prices, rising unemployment, bad housing and social services and all the things that affect the people of this country.  They are hoping that they can bluff the people, as they have in the past, by claiming they are the knights in shining armour, the people who will defend the country against the &ldquo;baddies&rdquo; on this side of the House. No doubt Deputy Crowley will return to west Cork where he will explain to the people at the church gate that if they vote for Labour they will run the risk of the parish priest finishing up in chains.</P>

      <P>I want it to go on record that if this Dáil is dissolved tonight it will be the desire of the Taoiseach.  The Minister for Finance and of many Deputies in Fianna Fáil to hang around the neck of members of the Labour Party the brand of being friends of the <Col N="844" /> Provos.  The brand that they are in favour of bringing in an alien doctrine to this country will not work.  I have tried to trace the history of the formation of the Provos, who supported them and where they got their money.  It is rather ironic to find that the people responsible for putting them into the race are now claiming that they are attempting to put them out of action. Fianna Fáil's chickens are now coming home to roost and the party have got to live with what they created.</P>
      <P>I want to make it doubly clear that the Labour Party are as much in favour of law and order as anyone else in this country.  The Labour Party are always prepared to stand up to their responsibilities, not only when it is popular but also when it is unpopular.  Anyone who reads the Official Reports of this House will find that Members from our benches expressed their views and were prepared to take the consequences and that is what we are doing now.</P>
      <P>I know that it is easy to stir up outside a story that someone is trying to cause trouble.  I heard from one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies the story about the picket outside his house and I sympathised with him.  All of us in public life have to accept those things.  We may get phone calls or letters but if we cannot accept them we should not be in public life. I think it is quite fair, as Deputy Hugh Gibbons has said, that anyone who wants to have a go at a politician should do so to the politician, not to members of his family.  Members of our families have nothing to do with our political lives and they should not be involved in any way in what happens here or outside the House.  There will always be petty-minded people who think they are achieving something when they picket a house or make comments over a phone.  The Labour Party have stood up to this kind of thing but we resent it when it is done to our own families or to the families of other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice stated categorically in this House that the Bill was brought in after consultation with the police authorities.  I do not know what he meant by &ldquo;police <Col N="845" /> authorities&rdquo;.  Did he mean the gardaí on the beat, the superintendents or the Garda Commissioner?  I should like the Minister to say at what level this consultation took place.  I have gone to considerable trouble to find out where the consultation took place but down the line they did not know anything about it and they certainly do not want to be saddled with those powers.  A decent garda does not want to have on his shoulders the responsibility of being judge and jury, which is the case if he identifies someone as a member of the Provisional or Official IRA or any other illegal organisation. There are about 27 chief superintendents throughout the country; is it suggested that they are the people who will go into court?  When a chief superintendent says a person is a member of an illegal organisation he is signing a jail warrant for that man unless the person can prove otherwise.  I understand it is practically impossible to do this; how can one prove one is not in an organisation if this is the case?  I should like the Minister to explain how he thinks this will work.  What is proposed in this Bill is not Irish law and we do not want it to be introduced now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening to Deputy Burke too long to be embarrassed by anything he would say. The Offences Against the State Act, which this Bill is supposed to amend, has only been used, as was again pointed out by Deputy O'Donovan recently, in the last few years against one group who possibly the then Minister might consider was an illegal organisation; it would not be the type of organisation perhaps that he would consider should be entitled to get on, and that was the National Farmers' Association.  Strange to say, the Minister who used it against the farmers was the Minister for Agriculture at the time, Deputy Charles J. Haughey. He found it necessary or found it possible to introduce a section of the Offences Against the State Act for the purpose of locking up farmers.  Since that time very many people have paraded outside the gates of Leinster House.  None of them has been arrested.  Most of them, I assume, were town dwellers.  There is, I know, a tendency to deal with the country man in one way and the townsman in a different way, and it appears this has come true in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister for Justice found it possible to arrest members of the National Farmers' Association under the Offences Against the State Act and send them to jail, it should be possible without any additional powers for the present Minister for Justice to arrest <Col N="847" /> anybody, particularly those who apparently can parade openly and break the law openly, and put him in jail without putting in jeopardy ordinary citizens who if they are going about their business can be arrested under the proposed legislation and locked up and there is not one darn thing they can do about it.</P>

      <P>This Bill is another of the Fianna Fáil red herrings we have had over the years.  The Minister's purpose in introducing it is to cloud the real issues before the people today: the high cost of living, unemployment, and the failure of Fianna Fáil to rule the country properly.  There is already in existence a law adequate to deal with the situation but what we lack is a Government with the guts to enforce it. That is why we have the situation we have today.  The purpose of this legislation is to get Fianna Fáil off the hook.  It is rather strange that they had the power to arrest the leader of Sinn Féin.</P>

    <P>Deputy P.J. Burke spoke a few moments ago about backbone.  If the Fianna Fáil Government had backbone and if we had had leadership in the country for the past three years, if the Government were prepared to do their duty and not to allow the <Col N="850" /> position to drift from chaos to chaos, we would not now be facing the anarchy that we are facing.  The Government stood idly by when they should have been doing their duty. Unfortunately, due to past history, they were not in a position to do that.</P>
    <P>I speak as one who, in this House, consistently over the past three years opposed the IRA, the subversives, in this country.  Time after time over the past three years I appealed in speeches throughout the length and breadth of this country, for the Taoiseach to lead from the front, to do his duty to stop standing idly by.  He refused to do that and because of his refusal the country tonight, perhaps, faces anarchy.  I appealed to the Taoiseach on numerous occasions.  Time after time he made a skit of me in this House.  He got up, from where the Parliamentary Secretary is sitting tonight, and spoke about &ldquo;L'Estrange's drift to anarchy&rdquo;.  I appealed to him three years ago, when there were only a couple of hundred IRA men in the country.  Even in the course of a speech last year I appealed to him, and I pointed out that there were only 500-800 IRA men in Northern Ireland, but there were 20,000 members of the British Army, armed to the teeth with modern, up-to-date equipment and tanks, and that there were 8,000-9,000 UDR people, also armed, and a further 4,000-5,000 of the Special Branch there, and yet the IRA were bombing, blasting, killing people and ravaging the cities of Belfast and Derry.</P>
    <P>I said then that unless the Government acted against those irresponsible, subversive elements in our community there would be an over-spill here and we would face the same difficulties. Three years ago I appealed to the Taoiseach on numerous occasions to go on television, as he did when the farmers of this country threatened a strike.  The Taoiseach then said he would use all the forces of the Army and the Garda Síochána to put down the farmers of the country.  I appealed to him to speak on radio and television and, remember, I had the help and the backing of the two Opposition parties. I asked the Taoiseach to say that in so far as he was concerned there was not going to be any further double-talk, inaction or selective justice but <Col N="851" /> that he was prepared to govern.  The Taoiseach said that last week, but it is a pity he did not say it three years ago.  If he had done so, we would not be in the turmoil in which we are today.</P>
    <P>I said on numerous occasions in the past, and I want to say again tonight, that I do not believe in repressive legislation.  We know what repressive legislation has done in Northern Ireland.  I believe in justice and the rights and freedom of the individual. I believe in law and order, but we cannot have law and order unless we have justice, freedom and liberty, and unless the Government cherish all the children of the nation equally.  Unfortunately, that did not happen because when it suited the Government we had selective justice.  When it suited them to let certain people go scot-free in case they would lose votes, we had no justice.</P>
    <P>I do not like going back, but it might be no harm to quote what I said in Mullingar on 4th April, 1970. That was after the brutal murder of Garda Fallon.  I said that the brutal and cowardly murder of Garda Fallon, a member of the Garda Síochána, in the performance of his duty as a defender of the citizens of Ireland brought home to everyone the importance of upholding the law and authority unflinchingly and ceaselessly. I want to challenge the Taoiseach and ask him did they do that after the death of Garda Fallon?  Did the Taoiseach take the bit in his teeth and govern as he should have governed? That happened three years ago.  If he had taken action then, we would not be in the unfortunate position that we are in tonight.  I also said on that occasion in Mullingar that foremost among the achievements of the Fine Gael Party was that they established the basic institutions of this State with a trowel in one hand and a gun in the other.  Unfortunately, we had to do that at one time.  We set up the Army and the Garda Síochána, and we are justly proud of them. The Fianna Fáil Party have vacillated and dithered for the past three years. A member of theirs at one time said that they were a &ldquo;slightly constitutional&rdquo;<Col N="852" /> party.  I am afraid that the wheel has now turned the full round. To quote Banquo from <i>Macbeth:</i></P>
    <P>that we but teach</P>
    <P>Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</P>
    <P>To plague the inventor; this evenhanded justice</P>
    <P>Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice</P>
    <P>To our own lips.</P>
    <P>That is, unfortunately, what is happening at present.  As Deputy Tully has said, the chickens are now coming home to roost.</P>
    <P>I also said in that speech on 4th April, 1970:</P>
    <P>The tragic family left behind by Garda Fallon will at least have the consolation that he had died a hero's death.  His life and death alike are a credit to the Force... I hope the Government will spare no effort to bring his murderers to book, no matter what opinions he or his companions may hold about our national rights or our destiny.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that is what happened at that time because Fianna Fáil were interested in one thing, in the art of survival; they wanted to hold on to power and, because many of those people had voted and supported them in the past, they were not prepared to arrest them.  Survival was the name of the game and, if there was a Nobel prize for the art of survival there is no denying that the Taoiseach and his Government would get it.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice at the time, Deputy Ó Moráin.  Our police force knew where the murderers of Garda Fallon were and they asked the Government to introduce section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act so that they could take them in, hold them and question them.  The Government met for four hours, but there was a by-election taking place in Longford/Westmeath and the police were told, as they have been told on so many occasions, this would be a political decision that &ldquo;might do our Government harm and we are not prepared to introduce section 30 of the Offences Against the State <Col N="853" /> Act&rdquo;, and they did not do it.  Had they done so the murderers of Garda Fallon could have been apprehended at that time.</P>
    <P>I also stated in that speech:</P>
    <P>It is the first principle of a civilised society that its guns are under the lock and key of the lawfully elected authority of the State.  We are the elected representatives of the people and through us alone will basic national decisions be made.</P>
    <P>That has been our policy since the foundation of this State and, as far as we are concerned, since the foundation of this State we have stood for law and order.  We believe that the existing legislation could have enabled the Government to deal with these subversive elements, had they wanted to deal with them but, for their own political reasons, they did not want to deal with them.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach read this speech and the very next night, speaking in Longford on Saturday, 5th April, he replied to my speech and accused me of trying to make political capital out of the murder of Garda Dick Fallon. I was not trying to make political capital out of the murder of any member of the forces of law and order in this country because we have too much respect for them and we have stood by them ever since they were set up, as an unarmed force, by Cumann na nGaedheal.  We have always backed them up and we will continue to back them up and, had they got the same backing from Fianna Fáil, instead of being told to turn the blind eye and not to arrest this person or that person, there would have been no need to introduce this repressive Bill into this House.  Their instructions were that they were not to arrest if there was a big crowd. This instruction was given to the members of the Garda Síochána when they telephoned to say that So-and-So was at a meeting.  They were told: &ldquo;You know these decisions are political. If there is a big crowd do not arrest that person.  If there is a small crowd arrest him.&rdquo;  There was a big crowd and he escaped.  The Garda <Col N="854" /> Síochána had to do what they were told.</P>
    <P>How could one expect democracy to flourish in a country where this happens? Is it any wonder we are in the unfortunate position we are in at this moment?  The blame for our unfortunate position now rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government who, for political reasons, were afraid to do their duty.</P>
    <P>I stated further on that occasion:</P>
    <P>We are the elected representatives of the people and through us alone will basic national decisions be taken.</P>
    <P>Had the Government lived up to that we would not be in the plight in which we are.  That was three years ago and Deputy Dowling challenged me as the &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; man and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, also challenged me.  I am proud to stand up here and remind the House that I said those things three years ago.  I am sorry for one thing, and one thing only: I am sorry that I have been proved correct.  Would to God, that I had been proved wrong in all that I said three years ago.  Had the Government acted then as we, on this side of the House asked them to act, we would not be in the position in which we are tonight.</P>
    <P>I further said in that speech:</P>
    <P>What have the Government been doing to allow this accelerated drift towards chaos?</P>
    <P>I asked that of the Government and of the Taoiseach at that time.  We know they did nothing then and it is only now they are trying to do too much too late.  I further said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>We have seen men who do not belong to the Defence Force in uniform, carrying arms, and go unarrested.</P>
    <P>We did see that and I shall deal with that in a moment.  They appeared on our television screens and they were not arrested.  I said: &ldquo;Open contempt for the law has produced only a frightened silence.&rdquo;  That was three years ago.  Unfortunately it is not a frightened silence we have tonight, but we definitely have violent explosions in our midst due to the fact that this <Col N="855" /> Government refused to take action in time.</P>
    <P>I accuse the Government of standing idly by, to use their own words, for the past three or four years.  The Government did not enforce the law.  As I said earlier, had they allowed the constitutional institutions of our State &mdash;by that I mean the Garda Síochána, of whom we are proud, no matter what Government may be in office&mdash;to take action against irresponsible elements, we would not be here tonight discussing the provisions of this Bill. Unfortunately, the instruction given was to observe but not to apprehend. Gardaí&mdash;I said this here before and I repeat it now&mdash;take a solemn oath to do their duty.  I know respectable members of the Garda Síochána who were threatened by Members of this House.  I know cases in which men who did their duty were transferred to Mayo, to Galway, to Donegal and to other parts west.  I have always claimed that the Government should stand behind these men and, instead of being transferred, they should get promotion for going out fearlessly and doing their duty.  It is they who should get promotion and not the men who hobnob with politicians and spend their time drinking with them.  These are not the men we want leading our police force. We want the dedicated men prepared to go out and do their duty, and arrest, if necessary, certain people irrespective of class, of creed or politics.  Unfortunately, in the past, too many people have not been apprehended because of their politics.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go back too far in the past but, still, following the taunts and the things that were said to us today about having backbone I want to ask: who opened the jails in 1932 when they were elected to power and allowed out scot free men who had been sentenced to jail for shooting members of our armed forces and our Civic Guards and other people in this State?  It was not the people on this side of the House because we had done our duty at that time.</P>
    <P>Who in 1932, 1933 and 1934 sacked members of the detective force and the Garda because they apprehended Fianna Fáil people&mdash;the dividing line <Col N="856" /> then was as thin as now&mdash;who were members of the IRA?  I can give the names, but I think it is not necessary, of the Fianna Fáil Government of that time.  These were dedicated and courageous members of the Garda who did their duty in those years but, because the people they had apprehended, IRA men, were so closely connected with Fianna Fáil they had to resign their positions and were sacked out of the Garda.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that we have the frustration that we have in this country today?  This may be the last occasion I may get in this House to put on record what was said by Justice William Sweetman in a letter in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 28th December, 1970&mdash;and around that time the deterioration started in this country. Having given about six different examples of where the Government refused to do their duty, he gave a political one, and I shall come to it. He wrote:</P>
    <P>But an earlier incident may be more significant in the present context. We can all remember reports of armed activities near Abbeyleix during a visit by a member of the British Royal Family.  A number of men were brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>There was disorder in the court on that day and Gardaí were beaten up. I remember that myself.  It goes on:</P>
    <P>There was disorder both inside and outside the courthouse.  A few weeks later ten of the defendants who had been ordered by the court to give bonds to keep the peace on pain of imprisonment were released by the Government without the bonds being signed.</P>
    <P>The Government countermanded the decision of the judge.  They had no authority to do that, and yet they did it.  Some of the people they allowed out scot free at that time are some of the leaders of the IRA today.</P>
    <P>I want to come to another incident that took place in my county and in my home town of Mullingar.  The remains of Barnes and McCormack were brought home from England to be reinterred in Ballyglass cemetery in <Col N="857" /> Mullingar.  There was a procession from the cathedral out to the graveyard. There were people marching that day in uniform; and, when the remains were covered over, four men stepped forward, produced guns, and fired shots into the air.  Their photographs appeared in the three daily papers the next day and they appeared on television.  Thank God, we had conscientious members of the Garda in Mullingar.  The next day the officers of the Garda in Mullingar sent the names of the four people to Dublin to the Department of Justice and said: &ldquo;Here are the names of the four men. When will we arrest them?&rdquo;  I want to put on record as I have at least ten times in the past three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is that not selective justice?  The Minister for Finance talked about low standards in high places.  Are they some of the low standards in high places he talked about when he made his speech three years ago?  I questioned the Minister for Justice about this and his reply to me was that he was not Minister for Justice at that time.  I will give him credit for this. He did not say it should not have happened&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I beg leave of the Chair and the House to intervene in the debate at this stage in my position as proposer of this reasoned amendment on behalf of the Fine Gael Party.  I should like to remind the House that our amendment was designed to show opposition to the Bill as drafted while, at the same time, indicating that we support all reasonable measures to enforce law and order.  Tragic events have overtaken Parliament and conscious, and indeed anxious, about the fact that our amendment, if supported by those Members of the House known as the dissidents and now revealed as fellow-travellers of the IRA&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On behalf of the Government and the whole House I offer the sympathy of the House to the relatives of those who have been killed and to the people who have been injured.

      <P>Just over an hour ago I, on behalf of my party, deplored and condemned the recent horrible and dastardly outrages in Dublin, as we consistently condemned all politics that lead to violence.  We do not agree that these atrocities constitute a justification for this Bill.  If the Bill were in operation tonight would these bombings have been prevented?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after subsection (2) to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Subsection (2) of this section shall be in force whenever and for so long only as Part V of the Act of 1939 is in force&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to apply the same limitation as exists in section 2 of this Bill to subsection (2) of section 3.  Subsection (2) of section 3, under the amendment I propose, would be in force only while Part V of the 1939 Act was in force.  This is a period following the making of a proclamation by the Government that a state of unrest exists in the country. <Col N="868" /> The ordinary courts are not adequate in the circumstances.  This will have the effect of allowing subsection (2) of section 3 to apply only in these times of serious unrest.  I have considered that it is probably only fair to limit the periods of its application but I want to make it clear that this in no sense restricts it to any particular period of time in the calendar or chronological sense but it is restricting it to such period or periods of time in the future when this state of very serious unrest would exist.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Minister's amendment seeks to limit the operation of this section it can be received without any great objection. However, in the opinion of this party it does not go far enough.  When the House adjourned at 10 p.m. it was for the purpose of enabling discussions to take place between the Minister and spokesmen of the Labour Party and myself on the subjects of amendments.  In the course of that discussion we indicated to him certain amendments which we regarded as important. I understood that adjournment took place in the spirit of the statement from this party with regard to our reasoned amendment on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>We indicated the withdrawal of that reasoned amendment was being moved having regard to the terrible exigencies that now exist and in an effort to show our co-operation with the Government in the present national difficulty.  It was in that spirit we withdrew our amendment.  It was in that spirit of co-operation that we answered the Minister's invitation to discuss amendments to the Bill with him.  Regrettably, the invitation was a hollow one because the Minister's attitude&mdash;if I might use a phrase from another part&mdash;was &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We offered an amendment to section 3 (2).  This is the subsection that has caused most controversy.  I should like to remind the House that this is the subsection that permits an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent to state his belief that an accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation.  It says that <Col N="869" /> this statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    <P>I can well conceive the motives which prompted the drafting of that section.  I can well conceive the difficulties the gardaí might have in proving that fact.  The type of person this section is aimed against is not the kind of person who will make evidence readily available, is not the type of person who will have incriminating documents in his possession, nor will he make voluntary admissions if he is in custody.</P>
    <P>I concede that these difficulties inspired the drafting of this section but, even in a crisis situation, the section as drafted permits a person to be convicted of a serious criminal offence, and an even more serious political offence in this climate, on hearsay evidence of a garda officer.  I do not impugn the integrity of the officer who will offer that evidence but I dispute the principle of introducing hearsay evidence without, in the same section, giving an accused a right to rebut it conclusively and absolutely.</P>
    <P>The amendment which I had hoped the Minister would take from me read as follows:</P>
    <P>On page 3, line 6, to add after the word &ldquo;member&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;provided however that the accused may on oath and without being liable to cross-examination deny the statement of the chief superintendent as aforesaid and such denial shall of itself be conclusive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that the evidence is hearsay and that the person giving it is a chief superintendent, should the defendant attempt to cross-examine the chief superintendent he will find himself met by the plea of privilege, a normal plea by a garda officer when he is asked for the sources of his information.  In common justice the defendant should be put in the position where, if he makes a rebuttal on oath, that should be conclusive.  If he is innocent he will not have any trouble in making the rebuttal on oath; if he is guilty he will fail to make this rebuttal and the evidence of the chief superintendent will be coercive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> The amendment was offered to the Minister in the spirit not in any way of damaging what he wanted to achieve but in the hope that it would restore some of the balance which should be in our legislation and in our courts but it was rejected.  The amendment the Minister has offered &mdash;it is small but is acceptable&mdash;is to limit the time during which the section would operate.  If the chief superintendent had other positive evidence other than his own hearsay, the rebuttal by the defendant would not be sufficient to excuse him from answering in cross-examination whatever facts might be adduced.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the House of the dangers of hearsay.  Hearsay can come from fourth, fifth or sixth-hand and in its journey from the original source to the person giving the evidence it can become garbled. The status of the original information can become diminished in its progress through three or four persons.  There is a lively possibility of mistake and equally there is the possibility of fraud if the originator of the information should be somebody wishing to work off a grudge.  He might be a person of status using his status to work off a grudge and, when that grudge arrives on the desk of the chief superintendent, it becomes evidence that can come into a court of law.</P>
    <P>In fairness this demands that the section should be softened by giving some rights to the accused.  The minimum right he can and should have is the right to rebut on oath the hearsay evidence of the superintendent. In his opening statement the Minister alleged the courts would not necessarily take the evidence of the superintendent and that in any event it was not conclusive.  The Minister knows as well as I do that if an officer of the status of chief superintendent is prepared to give evidence on oath of his belief and if that evidence is not controverted the court is coerced into accepting it.  The Minister sought to suggest in his opening statement that this subsection merely extends the common law rules of evidence under which a witness's <Col N="871" /> opinion as to a fact is admissible and he quotes the case of an expert witness.</P>
    <P>Of course, that is a complete misstatement of the law.  In that context a superintendent is not an expert witness. An expert witness is a doctor or engineer giving technical evidence in their particular field of work but a chief superintendent giving hearsay evidence of his belief that a person is guilty of a crime is not an expert witness in that sense.  It is for these reasons and in the spirit in which we withdrew our amendment to the Second Stage that we put to the Minister that common justice demanded&mdash;and he could concede that demand without in any way taking from the efficiency of the Bill&mdash;that he accept our amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not our intention to delay the House or go over what has been said previously in this debate. Very briefly, I would like to say that, as far as this party is concerned, with or without this amendment of the Minister's, we totally oppose this section. In particular, the acceptance of the evidence of the chief superintendent that &ldquo;in his opinion&rdquo; a person is a member of an illegal organisation is a total departure from the normal proceedings in any court held in a democratic country.  We are greatly encouraged in our opposition to this section by the wide variety and numbers of people who have also indicated their objection to it, people who by no stretch of the imagination could be called Provisional or Official IRA or members of any illegal or subversive organisation or people who could be classified as those who would support or defend the aims of any illegal or subversive organisation.</P>

    <P>We in this party are extremely conscious of the great difficulties this country is in, and we have deplored violence since it first became a reality in any part of the country in the campaign since 1969.  We still deplore it and our opposition to this Bill is based on one thing and one thing only: we are perfectly satisfied that <Col N="872" /> there is sufficient and adequate legislation already passed by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Cooney, this section permits evidence to be admitted only and does not in any way interfere with the accused's right to rebut that evidence.  Deputy Cooney said specifically, if I heard him properly, that the accused did not have the right to go in and swear to the contrary.  Of course he has that right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He most certainly has that right.  As well as that, he has the right to cross-examine the chief superintendent as to his information and as to the source or nature of his information.  He further has the right to call other witnesses besides himself to rebut the evidence of the chief <Col N="873" /> superintendent.  What the chief superintendent has said is evidence only; the court is not in any sense compelled to accept it and the whole question of whether or not the accused is a member of an illegal organisation is to be decided by the court not simply on the basis of what the chief superintendent swears but on the basis of all the evidence and, in particular, on the basis of the cross-examination.</P>
      <P>It may interest the House to know that since February this year there have been 30 prosecutions in our courts for membership of an unlawful organisation. In only three of those cases has a conviction been secured and I think at least one of those three is well known, and the rather laborious method by which the conviction was obtained is well known, and I think this is indicative of the difficulties which there are in proving an offence under section 21.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should further be borne in mind that not alone must the court take all evidence put before it either by the prosecution or by the defence into account, but it must be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the man was in fact a member.  If the defendant can raise any sort of reasonable doubt at all, even quite a small degree of doubt, in the minds of the <Col N="874" /> court, whether it is judge or jury, then that court must acquit him.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ascertain what the Minister's intention is when he provides under section 4 (1) (a):</P>
      <P>Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any meeting...</P>
      <P>What is meant by &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;?  As far as I can gather you can make a statement orally or in writing.  I wonder what does &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; mean? Can we take it that the Minister is trying to ensure that, if a dumb person happens to be involved in any incident and uses dumb language, his gestures in doing so can be classified as &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; under this section?  I should like the Minister to explain this to me because I fail to understand what &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; means.  Is Harvey Smith's famous gesture at a function not too long ago &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;?  Could he be convicted for making that gesture?  If I had time, or if I were allowed, or if I were given some facility as a novice Member of the House, I should like to put down an amendment to section 4.  I should like to add a paragraph (c) reading, &ldquo;that this section is also binding on all persons, including Government Ministers&rdquo;.  Section 4 (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any meeting, procession or demonstration in public, that constitutes an interference with the course of justice shall be unlawful.</P>
      <P>As I mentioned on Second Reading, the Tánaiste went on television in 1970 and was clearly in breach of this section.  Indeed, he was in breach of the existing law.  He used words which had the effect of accusing two ex-Ministers of the Government of being conspirators at a time before they were brought to trial.  The Minister should add my proposed paragraph (c) to the section so that in the future the Tánaiste or any other Minister would not be permitted to go on television and do what he did in May, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment drafted to substitute a new paragraph (b) in subsection (1).  I will not bore the House by reading it because the Minister has made quite clear his attitude to amendments or to the spirit of co-operation offered by this party.  We should not be surprised, although it is to be regretted in the <Col N="877" /> circumstances of the present situation, that arrogant politics should be played with a loyal Opposition.</P>
      <P>Subsection (b)&mdash;as the Minister well knows, is drafted to interfere with the institution of civil proceedings.  It is puzzling to see the words &ldquo;civil proceedings&rdquo; mentioned in a Bill entitled an Act to amend and extend the Offences Against the State Acts. During the debate on our reasoned amendment I gave an example of how the Bill, as drafted, could inhibit proper agitation for the commencement of justifiable civil proceedings. The Minister knows well that that danger is there but, in his failure or refusal to co-operate, he is prepared to let a Bill go through which is patently bad and which contains law which he admits is bad.  I look forward to the Supreme Court correcting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cooney's suggestion would seem to constrict the operation of the section very considerably indeed.  It would fail to embrace people who would seek to pressurise an authority or person concerned with the institution of proceedings against instituting those proceedings. If the words suggested by Deputy Cooney to be omitted were omitted, it would mean that demonstrations, pickets and so, designed to compel either the Attorney General or the Garda Síochána from instituting proceedings would, in fact, be lawful or at least not unlawful under the section and, of course, such demonstrations at the moment are clearly contempt of court and that is why they are included in this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister why he insists on retaining the words &ldquo;civil proceedings&rdquo; in the section? This is a criminal statute, why <Col N="878" /> make it a criminal offence to mount a campaign for the redress of a wrong that can be redressed by civil proceedings? Why make that a criminal offence?  If the Minister has in mind picketing in pursuance of a dispute that is not a trade dispute within the strict meaning of the Trade Disputes Act, that is covered by the Conspiracy Act of 1875.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a great many quasi-criminal prosecutions, such as prosecutions under Fisheries Acts and other similar ones.  These are regarded as civil proceedings.  Any summary summons other than by the State or statutory authority is regarded as civil proceedings and, of course, there are several different types of purely civil proceedings in the institution of proceedings in which certain subversive groups would try to undermine or try to pressure to prevent proceedings and, of course, the most obvious type is an ejectment proceedings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has in mind summary proceedings of a quasi-criminal type, as he calls them, it would be a simple matter to amend the Bill by deleting the word &ldquo;civil&rdquo; and putting in &ldquo;summary of criminal proceedings&rdquo;.  Then we would be quite clear what he means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If a man has a civil right to damages, in my opinion, it is the law, at the moment, in contempt of court that it is wrong that he should be pressured by some group of persons from exercising his right.  It is public policy that people should be encouraged to exercise their rights in court so that disputes will be solved or agreed in court rather than in any other fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it is proper public policy that people should be in that position but, does the Minister not realise that the section as drafted can cause these people to be prosecuted? It is becoming farcical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It can cause people to be prosecuted who seek to restrain someone from exercising his lawful <Col N="879" /> rights.  I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Or would seek to encourage someone.  The section deals with any proceedings that can have any influence in any court.  If somebody seeks to influence a person to commence very proper civil proceedings&mdash; I quote the example if a newspaper campaign were launched to encourage proceedings against the purveyors of dangerous drugs such as thalidomide &mdash;that person would be committing a criminal offence under this section.</P>

      <P>We are dealing with the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Especially in relation to this section.  I want some form of undertaking from the Minister. I am afraid of every section of the Bill but I am particularly afraid of section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing section 4 only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir. Section 4 states:</P>
      <P>Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any meeting, procession or demonstration in public, that constitutes an interference with the course of justice shall be unlawful.</P>
      <P>I want to have a guarantee from the Minister for Justice that in the case of a responsible group of landowners, farmers or town tenants who feel they have a serious problem in connection with the payment of what they consider to be an unjust tax or an unjust rate and if they are charged before the courts for it, they will be exempt from the provisions of this Bill if they demonstrate outside the courthouse, if they speak or if they picket a local authority office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> This section gives extraordinarily wide powers, not alone in relation to offences against the State; the Minister for Justice and the Government, if they so wish, could twist the terms of this Bill to suit any emergency that is likely to arise.  I should like to hear from the Minister if he can give a guarantee that there will not be a state of affairs such as we had some years ago when a peaceful demonstration of farmers ended by the farmers finding themselves in jail.  I want the Minister to give the House an assurance that the citizens will have the right to protest, to march and to demonstrate peacefully so as to expose possible injustice, that the public will be entitled to express an opinion and that that will apply also to speakers on their behalf, either Members of this House, local authorities or others who support the exposure of what are believed to be genuine grievances. I would not like to see, under this Bill, any restrictions on peaceful demonstrations by the public.</P>
    <P>In relation to trade unions, in relation to organisations far removed from the illegal organisations the Bill is supposed to cover, the Bill could be used by the State in an effort to prevent the free expression of opinion, free speech and peaceful protest.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I have no respect for violence or violent men.  I have condemned violence. I condemned it yesterday.  I condemn it now.  I want to maintain and I ask the House to cherish, the rights of citizens to protest loudly, clearly and determinedly without fear of being dragged into prison for doing so.  If a citizen feels that he has been harshly treated by the courts, that penalties or fines have been too severe, or if it is proven beyond doubt that the law has been unjust in dealing with citizens, there must be some means whereby the citizen can be protected against the provisions laid down in a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about any infringement of the right of peaceful protest and peaceful demonstration and the right of free speech, the right to make known a grievance and to solicit support in redressing grievance, in a <Col N="881" /> peaceful and law abiding manner.  The citizen cannot do it in a peaceful and law abiding manner if the terms of this Bill are implemented.  That is why I am so terribly afraid of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I am very sorry.  I realise it is the early hours of the morning.  It is of vital importance to safeguard the individual rights of citizens.  This House should be very slow to allow those rights to be whittled away.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister, that this section will not diminish the right of peaceful protest far removed from offences against the State but which could be brought before the court, by order of the Minister, as an offence against the State.  I want to preserve the right of free speech, free demonstration and peaceful protest whether it is a trade union or organised farmers or town tenants who are involved. If you like to include women's lib in that, they also should have the right.  I would like to have greater assurances from the Minister on this section.</P>

I am worried about taking away the rights of citizens and that is why I have had <Col N="882" /> such a dread of this Bill since reading it first, especially in relation to section 4 which, in my opinion, could be used by Members of this House, for instance, and could be used generally by the Government in muzzling those who might not agree with them.

      <P>Any answers or assurances that the Minister may give to Deputy Flanagan as to whom this Bill will or will not be used against are useless because, so far as the courts are concerned, all they will apply their minds to is what is contained in the Bill.  In this instance any assurances from the Minister are of even less use than the normal assurances we get from Fianna Fáil Ministers.  This Bill is worded deliberately so as to allow the Minister at some future date, if he so desires, to move against organisations that are in no way subversive but which are an embarrassment to the Government.  For instance, in its present form, the Bill could be used against NATO, a body that is very much a source of embarrassment to Fianna Fáil.  It could be used against such an association as ACRA if at any time they should decide they had enough in respect of the health charges being levied on the rates and if they should decide to hold meetings to discuss what action they might take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> It could be used against the NFA, for example.  In fact such legislation was used against that body despite assurances by a Fianna Fáil Minister at the time of the introduction of the relevant Bill that it would not be used against any such body.</P>
    <P>The Bill is drafted in a way that would give the most sweeping powers that any democratically elected Government have ever sought in a democratic Parliament.  For those reasons we are opposed totally to it.  The Bill is not necessary to deal with the IRA and other illegal organisations.  There is already adequate legislation for that. The Bill can be used to give widespread powers to a Minister at his discretion, and is there any sane person who is not able to interpret what is meant by a Fianna Fáil Minister's discretion?  It means nothing less than Fianna Fáil's political advantage at any particular time.</P>
    <P>I know it is normal on Committee Stage for Deputies to question, to probe and to try to reach agreement; but in our case we are stating, that the Bill is totally unacceptable to us because it is not necessary for the purpose for which we are being told it is necessary.</P>
    <P>We do not intend questioning and probing during this Committee Stage because we know that any such exercise would be useless in this instance. Fine Gael, too, should know it would be useless to do so at this stage.  They have tried to co-operate with the Government, tried to do what in their conscience they thought they had to do, but we are opposing the Bill in the only effective way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is not here to explain why the existing provisions of section 27 <Col N="884" /> of the Offences Against the State Act are not sufficient to deal with the problem proposed to be dealt with in section 4 as proposed.  Under section 27 of the Offences Against the State Act there is power to prohibit a public meeting on behalf of or by arrangement or in concert with any unlawful organisation or which is held or purports to be held for the purpose of supporting any unlawful organisation.</P>
      <P>While section 4 refers to different aims and different purposes it seems to me that section 27 was adequate, particularly as section 7 of the Act of 1939 makes it an offence to intimidate or obstruct the judiciary or the courts.  I do not understand why section 4 has been deemed necessary and I would like some explanation from the Minister.</P>

He has had to leave for the moment because he is joining the Taoiseach at a meeting with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and the Chief-of-Staff of the Army in connection with securty measures.</P>
      <P>In regard to the arguments that have been made on this section, the short answer is that the section enacts in statutory form what is the present law under the common law in relation to contempt of court.  That is what it is doing.</P>

      <P>I am not concerned whether the Minister intends to argue but I assert that he cannot be serious. This is a section which, in effect, prohibits meetings or processions held for a specific purpose.  Already in our legislation, combining sections 7 and 27 of the Offences Against the State Act, this prohibition appears to be there.  I ask the Minister reasonably why this proposed section should be totally necessary.  It has nothing to do with contempt of court or anything like that.  Even at this late hour I suggest the Minister ought to get a grip of himself.  Is it the position that nobody can reasonably explain to Dáil Éireann why section 4 is necessary?</P>

      <P>So far as section 4 re-enacts the law on contempt it is not clear why it is necessary if the law is there already.  Some reason must be given why the law of contempt is inadequate in its present form and needs statutory enactment. That has not been explained, because by definition, that attempted explanation explains nothing.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like the Minister, if he has recovered from his fit of pique to tell us under what circumstances at any time in the past a person has been found guilty of contempt for attending a meeting or procession.  I have no recollection of any such thing happening at any stage.  Perhaps that is my ignorance. If the Minister is prepared now to discuss the matter and has recovered from his momentary attack, or whatever it was, would he give us some example to validate his statement?</P>

      <P>&ldquo;any such statement made orally, in writing or otherwise,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Can we find out from the Government what precisely &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; means?  So far as my understanding of making a statement goes you can make it either orally or in writing.  Is the word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; included to get at a person who has not the power of speech but would speak in sign language?  Will this language, to be interpreted as a statement to interfere with the course of justice, be under the heading of &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;?  Perhaps the chief superintendent, when he is trying to arrive at a conviction, is able to interpret a person's dreams.  Has he the power of mental telepathy so that he can ascertain what a person is thinking?  Is that what &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; means?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> This House has facilitated the Government tonight in relation to this Bill, and if I might say so, has rightly facilitated the Government, but, in those circumstances, the Minister and the Government should co-operate with the House.  Normally there is a lapse of a week or more between the Second Stage of a Bill and the Committee Stage and it is possible for Members to put down amendments and have them discussed.  I fully appreciate that the Minister for Justice is unavoidably out of the House and that the Minister for Finance is at somewhat of a disadvantage, but this is unusual legislation and legislation which should be explained <Col N="890" /> when a reasonable request is made.  It is not my purpose nor this party's purpose to stand up for members who are not in this party but I would like to stand up for the supremacy of Parliament we have been talking about over the past few days. A reasonable request has been made for an explanation of the meaning of &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; in section 4 (1) (a) and it is not unreasonable that an explanation should be given or should be attempted to be given of what exactly is meant by it.  I think I know, but the House may not know and it is the business of the Minister in charge of the Bill to explain it.</P>

It reads: &ldquo;Any person who makes any statement or who organises, holds or takes part in any meeting...&rdquo;. Does &ldquo;passing by&rdquo;, &ldquo;standing&rdquo;, &ldquo;listening&rdquo;, &ldquo;clapping&rdquo; mean that he takes part in?

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins gets up here and says that because it is not written into this section <i>mens rea</i> must apply and then a person can be guilty under this, even though he has not a guilty intent.  Why does he not say that about the other sections?  I will tell you &mdash;because he knows as well as I do that it does not need to be written in, that it is there under the general law. We have all this nonsense going on here, with people trying to question what is the existing law.  I told the <Col N="892" /> House that was the position and Deputies want me to explain what the existing law is.  I do not intend to go along with this kind of codology which is designed to retrieve to some extent the shattered political fortunes of the parties opposite.</P>

This thing had better be applied a little more impartially.  The point that is being made, and not being made in a political way but because we are in a very serious situation and this is a very serious matter we are discussing after one o'clock in the morning, is that through no fault of his, the Minister does not understand what this Bill is about.  I suggest that, in the interests of whatever democracy we are going to have left when this is passed, this House should be adjourned until the Minister for Justice is available I am not criticising him for not being here; I realise that he is engaged on a most important job at the moment.  I am only asking that, to ensure that this House and parliamentary democracy are left with some credibility, the House should adjourn until a Minister who is competent is able to answer the legitimate queries which Deputies raise.</P>

I want to be more than reasonable with the Minister and I do not want to treat this lightly but this Bill must go to Seanad Éireann before it reaches the Statute Book and I invite the Minister for Justice to consider seriously the meaning of the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; and to explain them to the House and if they mean something so ingloriously vague, as the Minister's interjection would suggest, I appeal to him with all the sincerity at my command to have second thoughts about them.</P>

      <P>Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The only word that is left out is &ldquo;mentally&rdquo;.  He will be committing an offence almost in thought.  Would the Minister not be prepared to drop the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;?  Are these words to capture say the tick tack man one sees at the races, somebody who communicates by sign?  If dumb people start expressing views it will be taken by the gardaí that they are participating in an illegal act.  It could also include a wink of the eye or a nod.

    <P>If all the things I have mentioned are to be taken as offences I think this House, though it is in the early hours <Col N="896" /> of the morning, is engaged in a worthwhile exercise.  A wink of the eye, a nod of the head or a sign are all included under &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.  Deputy Kitt is laughing.  He is laughing because he has the State car for Christmas. He was not laughing earlier in the day.  If this Bill was bad this morning it is bad tonight because it has not changed.  I want to know in what circumstances the citizens of this country are to be hamstrung by this Bill, tied up and perhaps imprisoned under the heading of &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;.

      <P>I should like to emphasise this is not a frivolous matter despite all the laughs and smiles of the people on the other side.  The Minister for Finance said that the question of intent to do something illegal is necessary in this context but I should like to read section 4 (1) (a) which states:</P>
      <P>Any public statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any meeting, procession or demonstration in public, that constitutes an interference with the course of justice shall be unlawful.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister explain how a person can show intent or how can it be shown by the chief superintendent that he showed intent by way of a gesture or otherwise, as is set out in this section?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the reason for including the words &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;? Surely the legal advisers to the Minister have given some reasons why they consider these words are necessary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two types of offences known to the law.  There is what is known as an absolute offence and that is usually stated in bald terms, namely, to do a certain thing shall be unlawful.  There is the other type of offence and it is one for which a guilty intention is inspired. For example, the offence of larceny is committed only when a person has the intention of depriving permanently the owner of the object stolen.  That is what the phrase &ldquo;<i>mens rea</i>&rdquo; means. The Minister for Finance has suggested that in this section in order to commit the offence it is necessary to have an intention but I dispute this. Section 4 (1) (a) states any public statement that constitutes an interference with the course of justice shall be unlawful.  However, section 4 (1) (b) states:</P>
      <P>A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended,</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that requires intent, but it goes further because it states:</P>
      <P>or is of such a character as to be likely,</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there is no intent required there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>directly or indirectly to influence any court,.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>section 4 (2) states that a person who makes any statement or who organises, holds or takes part in any meeting that is unlawful under the section shall be guilty of an offence.  This very badly-drafted section provides that if this mythical &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;, whatever it might mean, which might directly or indirectly influence any court is carried out irrespective of the intent of the person who performs this &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo; he has committed an offence and that is the end of the matter.  It is nonsense to say this <Col N="898" /> section can come into operation only where there is guilty intent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two separate issues here.  First, there is the issue which has not been resolved to the satisfaction of this side of the House as to whether there is a legal principle applicable to a section like this which requires and implies that <i>mens rea</i> must be involved.  The Minister has asserted this but he has not given us any legal authority for it and on this side of the House there are genuine doubts as to whether what he has said is correct, whether, in fact, <i>mens rea</i> applies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <P>This is a serious matter.  If there is something wrong about this matter we want to put it right.  The Minister is not entitled to treat the House with levity, as he has done.  It has been pointed out to him that there are statutes, for instance, the Road Traffic Acts, where <i>mens rea</i> is not required.  It is excluded there but it is included here.  The Minister is not entitled to treat my request for an answer with contempt.</P>

      <P>When we have completed the debate on it, Sir.  It is quite clear <i>mens rea</i> does not apply here and, therefore, this section as drafted puts an innocent person in jeopardy; secondly, on the question of &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo;, the Minister says &ldquo;if somebody nodded&rdquo;, that is what &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; is meant to cover.  If somebody at a meeting says something which in some way could influence the course of justice and any member of the audience nods to that, he is, therefore, liable to be sent to gaol for a term of imprisonment of five years.</P>

      <P>It seems to me we are doing something very strange here.  If a person who nods to assent to a statement, and if it is <i>mens rea</i> because he intends to assent to a statement which can be shown in the court to be equivalent to contempt of court, he gets five years in gaol.  That seems excessive treatment for a person at a public meeting who nods to assent to a proposition which he may not have the legal sense to realise is in contempt of court.  Would the Minister not agree that is going too far and that it is possible to deal with the IRA and other illegal organisations effectively without giving five years to somebody who nods at a public meeting?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I know I will not get an answer but I want to go on record as saying that I do not accept the proposition that unless <i>mens rea</i> is written into a statutory offence it is not necessary. I want to take the Minister for Justice back for a moment to the Road Traffic Act, particularly to the section of it which deals with dangerous driving causing death.  That section says that anybody who drives a car or motor vehicle in a dangerous manner thereby causing the death of another person shall be guilty of an indictable offence for which he can be tried before a judge and jury and for which he can be sentenced to a lengthy term of imprisonment.  If what the Minister is saying is correct, the wording would be: &ldquo;anybody who knowingly or with intent drives a vehicle dangerously&rdquo;.  There is nothing like that in the Act.  Therefore, I say that anybody who innocently attends a meeting is guilty of an offence even if he only happened to be passing the meeting and decided to pull up to see what was going on. I think that calls for an explanation. I know it is not going to be given, but I want to go on record as saying it.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under paragraph (a) of section 5, would the Minister consider excluding the map of Ireland? It refers to any map, plan, graph or drawing.  On Second Stage it was clearly indicated to the Minister that it is pretty normal for any person travelling throughout this State to have a map of Ireland in his possession or in his dashboard.  It is not inconceivable that this person, no matter what organisation he belongs to, or otherwise, may have certain markings or pencillings on that map and, for the convenience of the chief superintendent, or whoever might be giving evidence, if he has failed to get anything else, he may use a map of Ireland <Col N="905" /> in the possession of this man in his car as evidence to be brought before the court.</P>
      <P>It is not inconceivable that the chief superintendent could construct some form of statement that this map was used by this person in his activities as alleged by the chief superintendent. I gather that when the Minister includes &ldquo;any map&rdquo; he means a detailed map of a section of the country, or a building, or otherwise.  Would he consider excluding a map of Ireland so that every person travelling throughout Ireland who has a map will not be in fear or dread that he will be hauled in and brought before the special courts on the basis of having an ordinary map in his possession?</P>
      <P>With regard to paragraphs (c) and (d) would the Minister withdraw the word &ldquo;tape&rdquo; as defined as a &ldquo;document&rdquo;? It is known to every member of this House that it is not unknown to suggest that tapes might be altered. Tapes can be tampered with and jockeyed around and can have voices added to them, to try to bring evidence before the court.  With regard to bugging devices producing a sound track of events or happenings within a building which the Special Branch wish to take a sound track from, again it is not inconceivable that in wrong hands a tape or a sound track can be tampered with.  Seán Mac Stiofáin objected recently in the courts as to the admissibility of a tape recording.  He suggested very strongly that the tape should not be left in the hands of the Special Branch but should be handed over to the custody of the courts in case it might be interfered with.  To my knowledge a tape recording has never been admissible evidence.  We have seen what a tape recording can do.  We have seen what the sacking of the RTE Authority can do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to withdraw the word &ldquo;tape&rdquo; from the definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo;. To refer back to the map, does the Minister not consider that any person who happens to have a map, costing 6d <Col N="906" /> or 1s in his possession, might be in fear or dread of being apprehended by the forces of the State on the direction of a chief superintendent, and brought before the courts?  In my contention he has no way of proving that he is not what the chief superintendent may allege him to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many serious difficulties in regard to section 5.  No matter how highly qualified chief superintendents may be, and they are highly qualified, nevertheless there have been cases in which genuine mistakes have been made.  If genuine mistakes have been made it is quite likely that, under this section, genuine mistakes may be made which may lead to the conviction of innocent persons.</P>
      <P>Section 5 refers to &ldquo;any map, plan, graph or drawing, any photograph&rdquo;. I would ask the Minister to tell us what is meant by &ldquo;any map&rdquo;.  Would it be a map of Ireland or of the United States or of Canada?  The wording is very vague.  It is usual for a motorist to have a map in his car. A member of the Automobile Association will have an AA map.  Will it be an offence under this section to carry such a map?  Will it be an offence to have a map on which certain areas are marked, areas in which in the opinion of the superintendent a breach of the peace is likely to arise, of which possibility the motorist is unaware?  This is very serious.</P>
      <P>Engineers and architects usually carry plans and drawings.  If there is an engineer or architect who is politically active and who comes under the notice of the chief superintendent, probably on the basis of information given by a competitor who may want to damage his business, could he be charged with committing an offence under the provisions of this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section does not define &ldquo;photograph&rdquo;. Will it be an offence to have a photograph, say, of the men who died in 1916?  Would that be sufficient to identify a patriotic citizen as being guilty of an offence against the State? The word &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; is too vague.  If a photographer takes a picture of persons attending a meeting <Col N="907" /> and if, in the opinion of the chief superintendent, those persons are associated with activities not in the interests of the State, that photographer, no matter how innocent he may be, will be unable to prove his innocence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the use of the words &ldquo;disc, tape, sound-track or other device&rdquo;, I want to say that persons engaged in television repair services and in dance bands and other activities use certain equipment of the type mentioned in the Bill.  There is a link between the business of TV engineers and those employed in television in relation to tapes and discs.  In that way a TV engineer may come under suspicion if he has these items in his possession.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the innocent person who finds a photograph and has it in his possession, even though he may have no connection with what is depicted?  What will happen in the case of the citizen if a map, plan, document or photograph is sent to him through the post which could come under this section?  Will he be liable under this Bill?</P>
    <P>The section is vague.  It is dangerous. It loads the dice against the citizen. I consider it to be a most offensive section.  The citizen can be adversely affected by the section and will have no means of proving his innocence. By being in possession of the items mentioned in the section the citizen is automatically guilty and is liable to the penalties prescribed.  I strongly object to the section and view it with alarm.  In existing circumstances there is no need for these provisions.  The law as it stands is adequate to deal with any emergency likely to arise. The Act of 1939 does not require these additions in order to safeguard the State.  I fail to understand why the section has been put into the Bill. The section having been inserted, safeguards should have been provided for innocent persons who might find themselves charged under the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would seem to me that paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 5 were inserted for the benefit of the <Col N="908" /> Special Branch and the Garda.  The items mentioned in (a) and (b) are items which the gardaí might find on a person or in his car or in his house. It is clear that the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) will be used by the Garda in order to secure a conviction. Since I have referred already to the question of tapes I would like to refer specifically to the last part of paragraph (d) which reads:</P>
      <P>...and a reproduction or still reproduction of the image or images embodied therein whether enlarged or not and whether with or without sounds or other data.</P>
      <P>I can interpret this only as being a reference to photographs that may be in the possession of the Garda.  Police forces in other places, especially in the North of Ireland, take photographs of protest marches and identify the participants from the photographs.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to tell me how the authorities, in using a section of an enlarged photograph, could establish a time element in court so as to use the photograph or portion of it as evidence.  During my journeys to and from this House and to other places, many photographs could be taken, but how could the Garda establish later when any such photograph was taken?</P>

This proposed section is being added to include matters that were not related in 1939 and in particular this relates to subsections (c) and (d) which have come in for criticism and which relate to discs, tapes, sound-tracks, film, micro-film and tapes.

      <P>Earlier yesterday evening I indicated on behalf of my party that we were prepared to withdraw our reasoned amendment.  I indicated at that time and subsequently why we were prepared to do that.  We were prepared to do that as a loyal Opposition, intent on assisting the Government and the Parliament to do their duty if the Government decided it had to be done in the exigencies of the present situation, a situation which was tragically heightened for us yesterday evening.  We offered that co-operation as a loyal Opposition in a democratic Parliament.  We offered it in the hope, now proved groundless&mdash; if we had considered the record of the party opposite a vain hope <i>abenissio</i>&mdash; that some of the matters in this Bill, which were patently objectionable, would be amended in such a way as <Col N="913" /> not to deprive the Bill of any of its power or efficacy.</P>
      <P>Our hopes in that regard were vain hopes because the party opposite are not yet a fully Constitutional party. They have no conception of the role of Parliament or any conception of what the duties of a Parliamentary Opposition are.  With every duty goes a right.</P>

      <P>Even though it is 2.45 a.m.  Deputies should give this measure very serious consideration. Yesterday I spoke on this Bill.  I was very critical of it.  I was worried about <Col N="920" /> the provisions of this Bill as a restriction on rights and liberties.  I was worried about this Bill as a serious threat to democracy.  I spoke strongly against it yesterday and I wanted to carry my conviction into the division lobby.  I want it to go on record that my opposition to this Bill is because its provisions are unnecessary.  The Government have sufficient law to carry them through any possible emergency.  I voted in accordance with the dictates of my conscience.  I could not allow this Bill to pass without voting against it.  I voted against it because of the provisions in regard to the change in the giving of evidence.  I object seriously to the conviction of Irish citizens on hearsay which I think is wrong, on the statement of the belief of another individual. I was impressed by the Association of Irish Priests&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who publicly expressed their concern about the change in the law in relation to the giving of evidence.  Under this Bill the dice is loaded against the defendant and for the first time the defendant must now prove himself innocent.  I do not think that is good law.  The Minister has not been reasonable in this matter.  The Opposition spoke loudly against the Bill and asked the Minister to amend it.  If this Bill was wrong yesterday and the day before it was certainly wrong when the Minister was finished with it because he did not amend it in any way.  For that reason I want it to go on record that the Government have treated serious views expressed by the Opposition with contempt and arrogance.  They have turned the blind eye and the deaf ear to the reasonable pleas to safeguard democracy, to safeguard the rights and liberties of citizens and not to pass a Bill under which Irish citizens can be convicted on hearsay, can be convicted on supposed evidence, can be convicted on information got through a secret service, can be convicted on the anonymous letter, on the anonymous phone call, can be convicted on a tape recording of a telephone conversation.  All of this is contrary to democracy and all <Col N="921" /> of this is being enacted without any real need for it.</P>
      <P>I warned the House yesterday and the day before that this type of legislation can lead to violence.  I want it to go on record that a Bill of this kind can breed violence, unrest, suspicion, the extension of secret service, underhand methods, grudges against neighbour. Is it possible that every single chief superintendent in this country&mdash; all men of stature&mdash;but is it possible that every one of them is a man who cannot make a mistake?  We are all human.  We all make mistakes.  It is by mistakes we learn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be unnatural and inhuman if chief superintendents could not make mistakes.  I do not want to see citizens being convicted on the statement of one who believes he is telling the truth.  At the same time he is guilty of a grave injustice against the citizen and that is the serious objection I have to this Bill.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill strike at the heart of democracy and it is the first step in the establishment of a police state here.  This will not be helpful in our efforts to have good relations between the forces of law and order and the community.  The best way to achieve peace is co-operation between the people who administer the law and the public.  Where that co-operation exists there will be very little crime but where it ceases because of injustice or suspicion the result can be disastrous.  I am sorry the House has not given more serious thought to the extraordinary powers given under this Bill to the Garda Síochána.  They have never asked for or wanted these powers.  There will be many miscarriages of justice because of the provisions contained in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like this Bill and I will oppose it.  I am afraid the dice is loaded against the ordinary citizen and <Col N="922" /> I would be failing in my duty if I did not point out this fact.  I believe in co-operation between the public and the Garda Síochána but where there is a wedge driven between both sides and when the people begin to think that the police are their enemy then we will have trouble.  The purpose for which the Garda Síochána were founded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Garda Síochána were founded to safeguard the lives and property of people but if it happens that the public lose confidence in the Garda Síochána because of this Bill there could be serious consequences.  I hope the consequences I fear will not materialise. This Bill will lead to many breaches of the peace and I am sorry this legislation will be put on our Statute Book.  I am obliged to oppose it because I do not believe in this kind of legislation.  This is an effort by the Government to deprive people of their liberty.  To demonstrate, speak or to march in procession will be the prerogative of Fianna Fáil only and that is one of the reasons I am opposed to the Bill.</P>

      <P>As the Minister did not make any speech concluding the debate on Second Reading, I have to depend on what he said in his introduction. The Minister said that these points were matters of common sense. You cannot decide whether any conduct implying or leading to a reasonable inference is a matter of common sense.  The other part is subsection (2) of that section.  The Minister said that the purpose of that was to amend and strengthen the law, that is to say, to <Col N="924" /> depend on the word of a chief superintendent and that this was to be the guide&mdash;&ldquo;shall be evidence&rdquo;&mdash;and it does not matter where the word of this chief superintendent came from.  Then what did the Minister say?  That the majority of the people were in favour of this.  I do not believe for one moment that our people are in favour of that kind of thing.  He went on to talk about persons who attempted to arrogate to themselves rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is removing my constitutional rights and those of the people of Ireland.  Under this Bill a conviction can be secured by the forces without any redress.  Under section 3 (2), any member of the community irrespective of whether he be an ordinary citizen or a member of the gardaí, no matter what rank below chief superintendent, can, in producing evidence, point the finger at any other member of the community and even effect death.  This can be clearly shown in the case of Mac Stiofáin or any other person who may conscientiously object to being treated in the manner in which this man was treated, who may take the same action as Seán Mac Stiofáin took and die from hunger and thirst strike.  This Bill is wrong from that point of view and if it is made law it will be bad law.  Under section 3 (1) (b) if a person is named in public in a published report on RTE as being a member of an illegal organisation, and if that person is brought on RTE, because he demands to be brought on RTE, to deny that this published report is correct, the possibility is that under this subsection we may see the removal of another Authority because such action is interpreted as not being in accordance with section 31.  I have no intention of delaying the House any longer except to suggest to Fianna Fáil that they can fool some of the people some of the time but they cannot fool all of the people all of the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that he was the saviour of the Fianna Fáil Government tonight because Fine Gael have advanced, <Col N="928" /> as their reason for not voting against the Bill, the fact that they would not go into the Division Lobby with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what he did say and I think he got that from Deputy Cooney's pronouncements as to why they had changed their minds now as against the earlier stages of the Bill.  So far as this Bill is concerned, it is as nasty a piece of legislation tonight as it was last night and the night before and I have no doubt that tomorrow night and every night thereafter it will be seen to be, as it is now, as nasty a piece of legislation as ever came before this House.  Its nastiness may be seen more clearly as time goes on and the Bill begins to take effect, the effect being that, under the various provisions in it, we will find a situation arising in which a member of the Garda Síochána, having a reasonable ground for believing&mdash;that is the phraseology used a couple of times here&mdash;that an offence, which is, for the time being, a scheduled offence, <i>et cetera</i>, was or is about to be committed and, coming across a person in the vicinity at the particular time, that member of the Garda Síochána may then demand full details from the person in question as to who and what he is, where he has been, and where he is going, and ask him to account for his movements; and, if the questions asked by that member of the Garda Síochána are not answered, that will be an offence in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this provision to be totally unnecessary.  But, worse than all that, the penalties that are laid down for not conforming with the demands of the member of the Garda Síochána for information are severe penalties, severe to the point that the person in question cannot win and must lose, irrespective of whether or not he gives the information requested.  Likewise, we find even more unacceptable perhaps in another part of the Bill a provision under which a chief superintendent, or higher officer, is empowered to go into the witness box and say that he believes that a particular person is a member of an illegal organisation.  This is a provision for <Col N="929" /> which there is no justification.  No evidence has been adduced to support such a provision.  No demand was made for such a provision, particularly in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at the moment.  The organisations that are threatening the security of this State have not been proscribed. They have not been declared illegal. Those who perpetrated the outrages in this city last night are still not, so far as we here are concerned, declared illegal and this Bill, therefore, does not apply to them.  Neither does it apply to a number of other kindred organisations which have been making quite a lot of threats lately.</P>

We have got to have the proclamation and proscription of this organisation if we are to have any security on this side of the Border. I would also remark that the haste and the panic with which this Bill has been put through here tonight, in fact the grasping of tragic opportunity, is not the manner in which a Bill of this weight, this type of measure, should be rushed through.

This is part of the Bill.  This is, in my estimation, the real reason why chief superintendents should be sorted out and mentioned particularly so that this gentleman should, in fact, be given this sort of authority, this sort of law, that he can do his depredations on ordinary innocent and decent people, as he has displayed himself capable of doing, but the law did not stand for it.</P>

      <P>I would particularly wish that that would be enumerated and explained as far as possible.  I would also ask the Minister and, indeed, the Minister who will be charged with the responsibility of the administration of this document, this Bill, when it becomes an Act, whether, in fact, he will, or his Government, through the Attorney General, be able to call the tune in regard to the application of these various provisions or will the Attorney General and the law officers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sorry.  Could I just put it this way, that I am not discussing what will happen in future?  I am asking will the administration of this Bill, when it is enacted, be in the hands and under the jurisdiction and be the sole responsibility of the permanent law officers or officer or will that mean in the hands of the Attorney General in turn directed by the Government if political aspects emerge, which undoubtedly must emerge in almost anything in this context?  In other words, will the Government be the directors of the Attorney General in regard to the administration of the Bill when it becomes an Act?</P>

      <P>No problem whatever I hope.  Could we also get the further assurance which I have already heard the Minister give by way of a very short reply, a rejoinder, to questions asked, in regard to the next section, that is, the section covering discs, tapes, sound tracks and so on?  The Minister did indicate, as far as I know, that these items and films and microfilms and negatives and all the modern paraphernalia of communication or recording will not, cannot be used as evidence or as a means of convicting a defendant unless those tapes, recordings, films, negatives, or whatever, arise from something that was produced as a public statement or effort indicative of some particular line of thought that would be said to be subversive or in support of subversion or an illegal organisation?  In other words, can we have an elaboration, if possible, from the Minister that unless these items arise from public utterances and were intended to be public they cannot be included as evidence that would go towards the conviction of a defendant under this section?</P>

      <P>Fair enough.  Thank you very much.  Having said those few things in regard to the Bill, some of which would appear to have been on the outer cover rather than the inside, as I have been informed by the Ceann Comhairle, whose indulgence I have perhaps overstrained, I want to say that the Bill was, is and will continue to be a repugnant, nasty, cynical piece of legislation, that it is dangerous and will be damaging in its administration and cannot do any good and will in <Col N="937" /> my estimation undoubtedly do an immense amount of harm, with perhaps disastrous effects, before it has been very long in existence.  This is not, I am sure, the intention of the Government but, on the other hand, the Bill is there, the dangers are there and nothing that has been said here, or that could be said, can take from that.  That is my opinion, was my opinion and nothing I have heard here has done other than confirm the opinion that it is a wrong piece of legislation, one which is unworthy of this House and which strikes at the roots and foundations of the rights of our people, which are restricted enough at the moment.  It will be regretted.  The only thing I hope is that I will be around long enough to see it wiped off the books together with its parents, the 1939 and 1940 Acts, <i>in toto.</i></P>

      <P>A lot of rather hysterical debate has been induced over the past few days on this measure.  At this Stage we should bring the matter down to earth and discuss in a few minutes what exactly is involved.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an amendment of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, designed to ensure as far as this State is concerned the men of violence and the people of violence, no matter where they come from, no matter what label they have on them&mdash;by that I include IRA, UVF, UDA or any other label that people of violence want to attach to themselves&mdash;can be dealt with appropriately by the Government in the interests of the preservation of the lives and the property of the citizens of this State.  That is what this Bill is about.</P>

      <P>This can be done by way of proclamation under the Offences against the State Act, 1939 and this Bill is designed to improve that Act so as to ensure that any deficiencies that have existed under that Act and under the criminal code generally <Col N="938" /> are rectified so as to ensure the apprehension of people who are enemies of this State, enemies of this Parliament.  We are all in this, as I said when making my contribution on the Second Stage.  This is not a question of political parties.  This is a question of all of us who go before the people and seek democratic election to this Parliament.</P>
      <P>There is one important aspect that I feel should be mentioned and it meets a lot of the points made just recently by Deputy Blaney, that is, that whatever additions we have made here to the powers in the Offences against the State Act as they exist now are all matters that will arise for consideration by independent courts and this also meets the point that has been consistently made by Fine Gael spokesmen here.  We will have courts deciding these issues.  It meets the major point that was made in regard to subsection (2) of section 3.  It means that whatever the chief superintendent may produce in regard to a particular citizen can be rebutted by that citizen in court and that citizen can give his evidence in full and can be legally represented and the chief superintendent can be cross-examined. If people in this House want to smear our independent courts and our independent judiciary, then they are in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;going into a very dangerous area where the courts are under attack.  We have and the Government have sufficient confidence in the independent courts established under our Constitution and under our laws.  They are there to ensure that justice is meted out and that the laws of evidence enshrined in the Common Law and the Statute Law of this State over many centuries is properly administered and properly dealt with.  The fundamental assurance is there under our laws of evidence and of procedure that a person charged in an independent court in this land with any offence must be found by that judge or jury to be guilty beyond all reasonable doubt before he can be <Col N="939" /> convicted.  There is nothing in this Bill or in the Offences against the State Act and neither is there anything in our criminal law that takes one iota from that fundamental right of anyone charged before a court.  I emphasise that point because it is the basic point that arises here.  Once a defendant goes into a witness box and is accused of being a member of an illegal organisation, the onus of proof does not shift and the accused has the right to rebut the charge, there is an independent judge who decides where lies the onus of guilt and if guilt is not proved beyond all reasonable doubt, there will be an automatic acquittal.  This aspect should be given much more publicity than is given to the nonsense talked here in regard to this matter.</P>

      <P>Deputy Blaney raised the question of the application of the provisions of the Bill and asked whether the Government or the permanent law courts of the State direct whether a prosecution takes place.  Indeed, this applies in respect of the provisions under the Offences against the State Act and to our criminal code generally.  Deputy Blaney was in Government long enough to know the position which is that the permanent law officers of the State, from the Chief State Solicitor <Col N="940" /> down through the various State solicitors are employed and appointed permanently.  They are there irrespective of government and they are the people who decide, on foot of information furnished to them by the police officers, whether a prosecution should be initiated.  That has always been the position and will continue to be so.</P>
      <P>It was precisely because of the advice given to this Government by the permanent law officers of the State to the effect that there were basic deficiencies under the existing State criminal code and under the Offences against the State Act that we introduced this measure.  They advised the Government that these deficiencies prevented us from acting effectively in regard to the apprehension of enemies of the State.  These enemies of the State, regardless of what label is applied to them, be it IRA, UDA, UVF or any other could not be apprehended effectively because of these deficiencies.  After seeking to invoke and make effective the existing measures we decided on the advice of the permanent law officers to make the provisions more effective and that is why this measure is before us. The House is now well aware of the very real need for provisions of this kind and Fine Gael are well aware of the mistake they have made in seeking to ignore the advice of their leader.</P>
