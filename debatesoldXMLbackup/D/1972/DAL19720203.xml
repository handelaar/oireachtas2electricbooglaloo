    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 22 (Votes 43 and 38) on the Order Paper.  Questions will be taken from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Government to make time available immediately for discussion of the Six County situation. I did not press this thing to the degree that I would have done had I realised that it was in the nature of not just a gesture of sympathy or adjournment the other day but rather seemed to spread itself a little further.  I want to indicate clearly, without any question, that in asking for this I am not asking for it by way of provocation or in order to tell people how right I or anybody else has been in regard to this whole situation for quite a long time, but because of the fact that every government that has anything to do with this has already discussed it by way of emergency debate, including even what we would regard as the slow-moving House of Lords, and I believe now the House of Representatives in America.  Here we are, an Irish Government, not giving time and apparently not regarding it as urgent, not regarding a discussion here as of any value.  I would appeal, without saying anything further at this juncture, to the Government and to the Taoiseach to give us time here today and tomorrow to discuss this very important matter so that the views of the people of this country, which should be expressed through us in this House rather than that they should have to express their views outside this House in other ways, may be made known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Further arising on the Order of Business I, too, would like that the Government would alter their decision on the Order of Business today. It is evident over the last few days that the people have shown very clearly that they are in fact three steps ahead of the Government.  We should be very concerned that this House would not tend to be as irrelevant, as a growing number of people throughout the country actually believe it is, as the Stormont regime in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to postpone a debate on this.  The Order of Business has been agreed between the Whips.  I would be prepared to give time, and today if possible, for a short while to have this debate. Questions have been arranged from 2 o'clock to 5 o'clock.  I would be prepared to replace that with a short debate or to have one hour's questions and a short debate after that for two or three hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand that in this instance I, representing Aontacht Éireann, will be called and that this debate will not be limited to statements by the three parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no agreement yet.  I am only making a suggestion. Every Deputy in the House is entitled to speak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge the Taoiseach's indication of his intention to make time available.  Might I say further, in addition to what Deputy Sherwin said, that the two or three hours could be worse that useless.  It would be just impossible to try and get any number of people in.  I would further appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Government to think in terms of utilising not only the time today, whether after Questions or before, but tomorrow should be used as well. While appreciating the indication of time made available by the Government, anything less than today and tomorrow would not really be meeting the case at all and indeed could be little more than useless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Whips might meet and discuss arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would say in relation to Deputy Blaney's suggestion about meeting tomorrow that he knows better than many other people in the House that it is one matter to extend a day's sitting but it is another matter to make a new day's sitting on the eve of that day, knowing the commitments that Deputies and Ministers have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for being persistent in this matter.  The matter of whether or not it is procedure or precedent is surely not quite relevant in the circumstances.  I agree in the normal way that sittings of the House are something of which, for the benefit and indeed the convenience of all concerned, we need to have as much notice as possible.  But the urgency for this and the necessity for it is so great that any question of precedent, procedure or of our convenience I do not think necessarily arises here to the same degree as it would in normal business.  I would again appeal that time be made available as early as possible today and that the House sit tomorrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make only one comment.  Deputy Blaney spoke about emergency debates in other Houses on occasions like this.  In other Parliaments, in other Houses, they can limit the hours in which these debates take place and they can arrange to limit the length of speeches.  I think it ought to be possible for us, too, and we will have a discussion between the Whips to see if this can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will concede that a three-hour debate would be absolutely inadequate in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that some of us had an opportunity of expressing certain views here on Tuesday but I think the House is entitled to have the maximum amount of time possible.  I am not suggesting it should be an open-end debate.  My concern is that it would be a reasonable and restrained debate in view of the awful situation <Col N="842" /> we are in now and which could get worse in another few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would leave it to the Whips to see if they can arrange a reasonable length of time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say one final word.  Surely we should in this House consider that we are acting on behalf of the people.  During the past few days the people, <i>en masse,</i> in every part of the country, have shown how they feel.  We should be given adequate time at least to try to express the people's feelings.  We are not in an ivory tower.  We cannot withdraw ourselves completely from the people although we have seen occasions where we have not been expressing the views of the people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I understand the Taoiseach to say that the Whips will meet to have a discussion on this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should put it this way to the Taoiseach.  What we should like to know is whether we could have some indication that the Whips having met, the House will be so informed in some sort of official way.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1971-72.</Title>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1972, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin) Gerry Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cronin)</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate, Deputy Dowling suggested that fatigue duties should be abolished.  As the Deputy will know, fatigue duties can be popular or unpopular depending on the men.  I agree with the Deputy that in general fatigues are not popular but it must be accepted that they are more or less a permanent feature of military life.  I will have the Deputy's suggestion examined.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney referred to the employment of civilian orderlies for fatigue duties in barracks.  There are 93 civilians employed in barracks throughout the country to do cleaning duties and civilian boilermen are employed to maintain the solid fuel heating systems in barracks.  It is not practicable, however, to relieve soldiers of all fatigue duties.  Indeed, there are good reasons why men should be responsible for the cleanliness of their own quarters and why the Army as a whole should not be too dependent on civilian assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Clinton and Tully made complaints about representations to Members of the Oireachtas by serving personnel.  Members of the Defence Forces are expressly forbidden from addressing communications or requests on service matters to Members of Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann, other public bodies or members of the Press.  The reason for such restraints, which are common to other Government employees, must be obvious to anyone who wishes to preserve the non-political character of the Army.  I should add that procedures whereby Army personnel can apply for redress of wrongs or pursue complaints are provided for in the Defence Act of 1954 and in Defence Forces regulations. <Col N="844" /> The terms of these procedures are brought to the notice of all ranks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite obviously the Minister has not served in the Army.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I served in branches of the Army.  I served in the FCA and the LDF.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the regular Army.  The Minister would have something to complain about. Tell a commanding officer to right some wrong and see where you get.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Clinton and Tully referred to the promotion of NCOs to officer rank.  A limited number of NCOs have been selected in the past to undergo potential officer courses and have been appointed officers on successful completion of those courses.  A competition was held in 1970 and 31 NCOs who had successfully completed their courses were appointed officers in December of that year.  It is proposed to have further officers' courses.  This is a system which is acceptable and which has proved satisfactory and it will be continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is to build up the Army the place to get officers is from the ranks of serving members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies Clinton and Dowling referred to the need for resettlement arrangements for personnel on leaving the Army.  I will deal with <Col N="845" /> this at length to indicate clearly that opportunities and concessions are made available to military personnel on retirement.  There is a scheme of concessions in existence to assist ex-servicemen to secure employment in Government Departments.  The scheme provides for the awarding of extra marks and an extension of normal upper age limits in competitions as:</P>
      <P>(a)  General service clerical officer, departmental clerical officer and tax officer in the Civil Service;</P>
      <P>(b)  Assistant preventive officer;</P>
      <P>(c)  Prison officer;</P>
      <P>(d)  Male attendant in the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum;</P>
      <P>(e)  Postman;</P>
      <P>(f)  Driver tester.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that facilities and concessions are made available to military personnel on a fairly liberal basis in their resettlement. The scheme in operation also provides for preference for ex-members of the permanent Defence Forces in the filling of subordinate posts in Government Departments.  These concessions are available during a period of two years after completion of service in the permanent Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>In relation to the AnCO training scheme, arrangements exist for the attendance of Army personnel of 40 years and upwards at courses of training in such skills as turning, grinding, milling, welding, <i>et cetera,</i> at training centres under AnCO control.  There is a very good liaison between the Department of Defence and AnCO and a number of very useful schemes are in operation to the advantage of apprentices and serving personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of further education courses, arrangements exist for the attendance of other ranks in the permanent Defence Forces at courses leading to the leaving certificate and group certificates.  The purpose of these courses is to raise the educational standard of the men in the permanent Defence Forces which would enhance their prospect of employment on return to civilian life.  This is a very useful development.  It permits serving <Col N="846" /> personnel to continue with their studies and go on to leaving certificate, day group certificate and so on.  We have 43 men enrolled at six centres at present on leaving certificate courses and on day group certificate courses there are 85 men enrolled at five centres.  This is a welcome innovation and gives serving personnel an opportunity to continue with their education.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the method of purchasing equipment for apprentice schools.  I cannot accept that any serious problem exists regarding the equipment of these schools.  I am satisfied that any particular need that is brought to attention through the normal channels can be provided for under existing arrangements.  It is possible that there is some misunderstanding in the matter.  If the Deputy has any particular case in mind we will be glad to hear of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Naas was very badly equipped.  I do not know whether anything has been done there recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of Naas is under constant review.  That, I suppose, is a familiar term but, anyway, we are conscious of the importance of Naas as a training centre and I can assure the Deputy that any shortcomings there will be made good as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The question of the high rate of income tax deductions was raised by Deputy Collins.  Each year, in anticipation of the income tax assessment being received from the Revenue Commissioners, my Department make arrangements whereby non-commissioned officers and men are encouraged to agree to the recovery from their pay each week of a sum approximating to what they would have to pay under PAYE.  Unfortunately, a large number of personnel do not avail of this facility and it is necessary, when the tax assessment becomes available from the Revenue Commissioners in the autumn, to recover in many cases large sums and this is a very painful operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it not made compulsory? Why not insist from the start that they do pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="847" />
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>The facility is available whereby the men can opt to pay a certain amount each week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is made compulsory after six months.  Why not make it compulsory from the start? It is done with us all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the PAYE system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter what it is called.  The Minister should hear what the soldiers call the other one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>Some proposals for an improvement in the present system are being examined at the moment and we hope to make the operation as painless as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputies Clinton, Tully and Dowling referred to the provision of housing accommodation.  This, too, is an old chestnut, of course.  I explained on previous occasions that the local authorities are primarily responsible for the provision of housing and soldiers have an equal claim on local authority houses with other members of the community.  Army accommodation has already been considerably improved in recent years and within the limits of the available resources it is my intention to have this improvement continued.  We will do a certain amount in relation to accommodation but, in the main, it will be a matter for the local authorities.  Where the need seems greatest we will endeavour to provide some assistance.</P>
      <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the ages of serving personnel and contended that the average age of personnel was too high.  We look upon the age as being reasonably satisfactory.  For the information of the Deputy, 80 per cent of all non-commissioned personnel and 55 per cent of line officers are under 40 years of age.  This, I think, is a fairly satisfactory state of affairs. Some imbalance in the officer age structure will be corrected I expect by the increased numbers of cadets coming in.  This 55 per cent will be raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Coughlan, Clinton, Nolan and Cosgrave referred to compulsory <Col N="848" /> military training as part of the ordinary educational facilities.  This in the main and in a general way would be desirable but there is no legislation in existence under which it could be introduced.  This is something that might be considered in the future. It is a policy matter and it is something towards which I would be, on the general principle, favourably disposed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Malone referred to the rehabilitation of the Curragh lands. Following the reception of a deputation from the Curragh Sheepowners Association in June, 1970, proposals for the fertilisation and rehabilitation of the Curragh lands which would not impose any financial burden on the State were invited.  We had a discussion with a representative group and outline proposals were received from a joint executive of the Curragh Sheepowners and Claimowners Associations who are working in conjunction with the Kildare County Committee of Agriculture. Detailed proposals are now awaited and will be sympathetically examined. We are well disposed to be helpful in this connection.  The association have also been invited to submit proposals which would not impose any financial liability on the State for the eradication of furze and the clearing up of the lands and at the same time being mindful of the military requirements there. The Department of Defence are doing a reasonable operation in relation to the Curragh lands and they should not be expected to undergo any further expenses in improving the lands for the users.</P>
    <P>The Naval Service came in for some comment by a number of Deputies, especially Deputy Kavanagh.  I want to put on record that three coastal minesweepers were purchased last year which was a considerable improvement in the naval position.  These vessels are capable of not alone fulfilling a naval role but they are suitable for fishery protection duties as well and they have been found very effective in this role by other countries.  As well as that, a new all-weather fishery protection vessel is under construction in the Verolme <Col N="849" /> Dockyard, Cork, and is nearing completion. This vessel, which has very modern equipment, is expected to be in commission by the end of April next. It is evident that the Naval Service has had a considerable boost this year and while much more needs to be done to bring it to maximum effectiveness strides have been made and will continue to be made to improve this highly valuable service especially in the context of future fishery protection.</P>
    <P>The question of the strength of the Naval Service was raised by a number of Deputies.  The efforts to recruit personnel were tremendously successful to a point where recruitment had to be stopped.  A total of 186 recruits were enlisted in the service during 1971.  There is, of course, the old problem of the shortage of executive branch officers.  We are conscious of the need to improve and increase our naval executive officer strength and measures are in hand which we expect will attract suitable personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not paying them enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a highly competitive market and we find it difficult to compete with the merchant navy.  However, we are endeavouring to remedy that and we hope that what we propose will have the effect of attracting suitable people.  I am sure the Deputy appreciates that we have a problem.  We are ourselves well aware of it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nolan and Deputy Esmonde proposed that the Naval Service should be permitted to make foreign cruises. This would certainly be an innovation. It is a proposal towards which I am personally well disposed and it is a proposal that will be put into effect at the earliest possible opportunity.  I am not saying how soon that will be, but the proposal is being examined.  It is a commendable one and, as soon as we find it possible to do so, we will consider providing for foreign trips for our navy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of naval operations, a number of Deputies referred to the adequacy, or inadequacy, of An Slua <Col N="850" /> Mhuirí equipment.  Each company there are two in Dublin, one in Cork. one in Limerick and one in Waterford &mdash;is equipped with one whaler for sailing and rowing.  A motorised whaler is on order.  It will be delivered before March, 1972.  We recognise that An Slua Mhuirí needs attention and we are examining what can be done.  We are conscious of the need to provide suitable vessels for this valuable branch of the Defence Forces and we are examining certain types of vessels which might be suitable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Esmonde referred to the necessity for providing a hydrographic survey.  I dealt with this matter in reply to Parliamentary Questions during the year. The Government have decided in principle that such a service should be established as part of our Naval Service, but the implementation of that decision must be deferred until such time as the staffing resources of the Naval Service are brought fully up to strength.  There are deficiencies in the service and, until such time as we provide the priority requirement of staff, it will not be possible to give attention to the provision of a hydrographic survey.  As well as that, this is a type of service involving other Departments, principally the Department of Transport and Power, and, while a comprehensive study has not been made in recent times, the charts are periodically brought up to date; within the limits of available resources every effort is made to meet this requirement and keep the records correct.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clinton referred to the Army Equitation School.  The record for last year was not bad.  Riders and horses won, or helped to win, as members of a mixed Army/civilian team eight first places at the eight international shows they attended during 1971.  This was an improvement on the four first places secured in 1970.  The total prize money won in 1971 was approximately £2,500. Bord na gCapall are at present availing of the stabling and other facilities at the Army School of Equitation for six of their horses.  The training facilities are also being used by six civilian riders selected by the board under the direction <Col N="851" /> of the board's civilian trainer and the services of that trainer are being availed of by the Department of Defence for a trial period of three months, ending 5th March, 1972, so that the prospect for the future is considerably improved.  We hope that in the coming year this combination will have the effect of bringing further prizes to this country and recapturing some of the glory won by Army jumping teams in the past.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the reduction in the provision for the purchase of horses.  In 1970-71 the amount provided was £16,000 and in 1969-70 it was only £12,000.  It was felt that a provision of £11,000 would cater for likely offers of suitable horses.  If, however, the sum does not prove sufficient, the question of making additional funds available will be considered.  The purchase of suitable horses is kept under constant review and Bord na gCapall have also been consulted in this matter.  This is part of the scheme of co-operation between the Departmen and the board and this is an aspect that will receive all the attention it merits.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to the military implications of our entry into the EEC. The position in relation to military commitment, if there is one, is outlined in paragraph 6.7, page 57, of the recent White Paper issued by the Government.  The paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The Irish Government, in applying for membership of the Communities, declared their acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris, the decisions taken in their implementation and the political objectives of the Treaties.  The Government have, furthermore, declared their readiness to join as a member of the enlarged Communities in working with the other member States towards the goal of political unification in Europe.  It should, however, be emphasised that the Treaties of Rome and Paris do not entail any military or defence commitments and no such commitments are involved in Ireland's acceptance of these Treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the question of gratuities for single officers and men on the termination of their service. This is a matter which has been and is being considered by my Department. There are some difficulties involved and there is no immediate solution envisaged.  The position is that married rates of pay for officers and men are higher than those for single <Col N="853" /> personnel of the same rank.  Yet the pensions for married and single personnel are not very different in amount.  In the case of officers the maximum pay of single officers represents a much higher percentage of pay than does that of a married officer.  A single soldier receives the same basic pension as a married soldier though the latter's rate of pay is much higher. A married soldier receives a married pension, of course, in addition to his basic pension.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave raised the question of pensions.  He claimed that the 1937 scheme was a contributory scheme and that the widows of officers who died before the full contribution scheme came into operation in 1970 should, therefore, receive the full contributory pension.  The position is that the 1937 pension scheme was not, nor could it be regarded, as a contributory scheme. There can be no justification, therefore, for paying a full contributory pension in such cases.  The benefit has been in operation since 1937 while it has only become operative in the Civil Service and local authority service from 1st October, 1969.</P>
    <P>I think I have referred to most points raised by Deputies but there is one here which was raised by Deputy Davern and about which a number of Deputies may be concerned.  It concerns the qualifications for IRA widows' pensions, the scheme which was brought into operation last year.  There have been instances where for one reason or another persons qualified for pensions did not accept them.  The qualification here is that if a member is entitled to a pension by reason of a certificate issued by the referee his widow gets the pension.  We have no case of a refusal.  This is important because on personal considerations of principle and so on some of those granted pensions did not accept them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole trouble is over the special allowance.  That is the great case of trouble and confusion. Some were really entitled to pensions and did not get them for a variety of reasons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's point but at this late stage <Col N="854" /> it would be impossible to review the entire pensions position.

The House may expect to receive my full co-operation on any proposals which would make for the betterment of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister about a matter he appears to have overlooked?  I referred in my contribution to the question of the evacuated Gormanston Camp.  Has the Minister had an opportunity of rectifying the situation there?  He is aware that certain people are prepared to treat it as the cratering of Border roads is being treated by the same type of people and there is likely to be action by people who will be encouraged by those concerned.  Surely the closing of that gate is in the very same category as the cratering of Border roads, preventing people having free use of a public road which they have used for 30 or 40 years.</P>

There is a matter of the security that must be observed and there is the question of making personnel available to look after the gates which will have to be closed at a certain time.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st day of March, 1972, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The net Estimate for 1971-72 amounts to £1,775,000 including a sum of £90,000 which was already the subject of a Supplementary Estimate.  The total amount sought represents a decrease of £75,000 on last year's figure.  The decrease is due to a reduction in the amount required to enable repayment to be made to the Central Fund of <Col N="856" /> advances made to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which were issued by the board to fishermen for the purchase of boats and gear and were later written-off as irrecoverable in the board's accounts.  Disregarding this exceptional item, there is an increase of £250,000 over last year's requirements. Factors in this increase include an increase of £100,000 in the grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for capital purposes, an increase of £60,000 in the grant-in-aid to the board for administration and current development, an increase of almost £56,000 for inland fisheries development, an increase of over £13,000 for sea fisheries development and an increase of £5,000 in the grant-in-aid to the Salmon Research Trust of Ireland Incorporated.</P>
      <P>The progress which has been evident in recent years in the development of our fishing industry was more marked than ever in 1970.  In that year the value of landings of sea-fish and shellfish had reached almost £4 million which represented an increase of almost £1 million on the 1969 record figure.  The increase in landings gave rise to a substantial increase in the value of exports of fish and fishery products of all kinds.  During 1970 a record export figure of almost £4.6 million was achieved, representing an increase of 29 per cent on the previous year's figure and practically doubling the value of the exports achieved in 1967.</P>
      <P>Although affected by the current difficulties relating to tourism, revenue from angling tourism was nevertheless estimated at just over £4 million in 1970, thus showing once again the value of angling to our economy.  The total external income attributable to our fisheries, therefore, amounted to some £8.6 million in 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Landings of sea-fish, other than shellfish, increased from 1,075,000 cwt. in 1969 to the record figure of 1,325,000 cwt. in 1970&mdash;shellfish being excluded because there are recorded partly by weight and partly by number.  The total value of landings, including shellfish, rose from £2,404,000 in 1968 by 25 per cent to £2,996,000 in 1969 and by a further 31 per cent to £3,911,000 <Col N="857" /> in 1970.  While in both 1969 and 1970 all categories contributed to the increase, the herring catch was the predominant factor, increasing from £496,753 in 1968 to the record figure of £783,973 in 1969 and by a further 63 per cent to the new record figure of £1,275,442 in 1970.  Shellfish, which also continued to increase in value, again accounted for approximately 28 per cent of the value of the catch in 1970.  In addition to herrings, the varieties of fish which contributed most to fishermen's earnings in 1970 were lobsters, plaice, cod, Dublin Bay prawns, haddock, crawfish, whiting and ray/skate in that order.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the pattern of landings for the first eight months of 1971 for which final figures are available continued in the same satisfactory vein.  The quantity of sea fish, excluding shellfish, landed was 62,000 cwt. greater than in the corresponding period of 1970 with an increase in value of more than £220,000.  The value of shellfish landings also increased by almost £200,000 in the same period.  The important herring fishery on the south coast, however, got off to a very slow start in November and December with a consequential drop in the quantity of herring landed during those months compared with the exceptionally high landings a year earlier.  Despite this set-back, it is estimated that the total value of landings of all fish for 1971 will be of the order of £4.1 million, which is still the highest to date and represents an increase of about £200,000 on the 1970 figure.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already the value of exports of fish and fishery products in 1970 was approximately £4.6 million, an increase of more than £1 million over 1969.  The pattern of exports changed in 1970&mdash;wet fish, mainly herring, at £1,641,500 replacing shellfish as our principal export.  Shellfish, however, at £1,594,000 followed closely while freshwater fish, mainly salmon, was next in importance, accounting for £1,363,000.  Statistics for the first ten months of 1971 show an increase in the value of exports of almost £1,200,000 or 35 per cent more than the corresponding period in 1970.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="858" /> Once again Britain was our best customer taking £1,889,410 or 41 per cent of our exports in 1970.  Substantial exports were also made to the Continent, particularly to France, Germany and the Netherlands.  Exports to the six member countries of the EEC amounted to £2,141,961 or 47 per cent of our total fish exports.  Exports to the six countries of the EEC and to the other three applicant countries represented no less than 89.4 per cent of our 1970 fish exports, which augurs well for our marketing prospects on Ireland's entry into the Community.</P>
    <P>As we all know, we are now embarking on an era of much greater competition for all sectors of our economy and, in common with other industries, the fishing industry must, if it is to develop, operate on the most efficient lines.  Our skippers must keep abreast of modern fishing methods and techniques, they must acquire the skills necessary to operate successfully the larger vessels coming into the fleet and they must become expert in the use of all the modern aids to fishing. Similarly, the deck-hands must equip themselves to work as highly skilled operatives.</P>
    <P>This highlights the need for first-class training facilities for the personnel of the fishing industry.  The Government's decision to establish a permanent fishery school at Greencastle, County Donegal, has already been announced and, while progress has not been as rapid as I had hoped, due to technical difficulties outside the control of my Department, I am pleased to say that all the formalities have now been completed satisfactorily and the building work has now commenced. This school, which is being built for the Department by the National Building Agency, will replace the present temporary arrangements.  It will cater for the training of new recruits to the industry by the provision of instruction in such subjects as seamanship, navigation, net-mending and cookery and will provide courses for experienced fishermen who wish to acquire their skipper tickets.  The school will be available also for specialised courses in subjects such as engine maintenance and fish <Col N="859" /> handling and for educating our fishermen in any facet of the industry in which specialised instruction may be required in the future.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing training schemes to ensure the efficiency of our fishermen, it is necessary also for my Department to supplement this efficiency by maintaining a scientific programme designed to keep abreast of modern research and technology in the fisheries sphere.  The conservation of existing stocks must be a top priority and efforts must continue to be directed towards locating lucrative new fishery grounds so that worthwhile expansion in fish landings will be possible. With the aid of the two fishery research vessels <i>Cú Feasa</i> and <i>Cú na Mara</i> exploratory work on the various species of fish is constantly being carried out and the results have proved invaluable towards planning the fisheries development programme.</P>
    <P>The fish quality regulations, which were introduced in April, 1968, continue to operate.  Deputies will recall that these regulations prescribe procedure and requirements for the proper handling, storing and transporting of demersal fish so as to ensure that only fish of the highest quality reach both our home and export markets.  To this end the Department's team of fish quality officers carry out regular inspection of premises and boats where fish are accumulated for sale.  I am pleased to be able to say that the effort of all concerned&mdash;both at sea and ashore&mdash;in improving the quality of our demersal fish is now showing good results, despite the occasional lapse by some who are not always as meticulous as the majority of the fishermen and the members of the fish trade.  It is essential that this effort be maintained if the image of Ireland as the producer of the freshest fish in the world is to be justified.</P>
    <P>As a further step in the planned expansion of the sea fishing industry I have recently made an order prohibiting, as from 1st April, 1972, the export of certain frozen fishery products save under licence.  Export licences under the order will be granted only to persons, firms or co-operative societies who are licensed by the <Col N="860" /> Institute for Industrial Research and Standards to use their standard mark on their products.  This new export control, which is fully supported by the trade, has for its object the establishing on world markets of a quality image for Irish processed fish.  Backed by effective promotion, the control should ensure an enhanced demand for our fishery products with consequential benefits for all sectors of the fishing industry.  I hope to extend this type of export quality control to additional fish products according as standard specifications for them are formulated by the institute.</P>
    <P>A feature of the processing industry in the past year has been the number of fish processing factories which have been enlarged.  A number of new factories have also gone into production notably a shellfish processing factory at Killala, County Mayo, and one for the processing of herring and mackerel at Midleton, County Cork.  The expansion which has taken place in fish processing in recent years has had the particular advantage that it provided outlets for species of fish such as crabs, sprats and sand-eels for which the demand otherwise would have been practically non-existent.  The continued investment by both private enterprise and the State in the various fish processing factories provides an assurance for fishermen that they can dispose of increased landings without difficulty. This was borne out in the past year when large quantities of queen escallops and escallops were landed from new fisheries and were readily disposed of for processing.  Increased landings of Dublin Bay prawns and mussels have also been readily absorbed at prices satisfactory to the fishermen.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1971-72 for administration and current development amounts to £460,000 and the grant-in-aid for capital development amounts to £400,000 including the additional £90,000 to which I referred at the outset.  The total of £860,000 represents an increase of £160,000 on the previous year's figure.  In addition to these grants-in-aid, repayable advances are made to the board out of the Central Fund mainly to enable <Col N="861" /> the board to give loans to fishermen to assist them in the purchase of boats and gear.  The total amount of these advances authorised for the current year is £530,000 which can be supplemented by the board ploughing back into the industry a sum estimated at £200,000 in respect of part of the loan repayments by fishermen that are not immediately repayable by the board to the Central Fund.  There is thus at the disposal of the board loan capital to the amount of £730,000 for 1971-72.</P>
    <P>In addition, it will be observed from the Estimates that a provision of £71,406 is made for the repayment of advances by the board to the Central Fund.  This sum is required to wipe out the board's indebtedness to the Central Fund for the period from 1st April, 1968, to 31st March, 1970, in relation to those cases where repayment of advances from the Central Fund was waived by the Minister for Finance following the writing-off in the board's accounts of a similar amount in respect of bad debts.  The formal waiving of the repayments, which involves bringing the matter before the Dáil, is necessary so that a more realistic picture can be presented in the board's annual accounts.</P>
    <P>The substantial increases in the funds being made available each year to an Bord Iascaigh Mhara reflect the growth which is taking place in the sea-fishing industry.  I have already outlined the increases achieved during 1970 in the volume of fish landings and exports and the trends so far in 1971 are most encouraging.  The immediate effect of this development is that there is a buoyant demand from fishermen for new vessels.  As a result, the three boatyards operated by the board, as well as the many private boatyards, are working to full capacity and, as there is a tendency for many of our experienced skippers to turn over to larger vessels, the demands on the board for grants and loans under their marine credit plan have been mounted considerably.  This sector of the board's activities represents capital investment in the industry which, I feel, is fully justified on the results which have been achieved to date and will, I am confident, pay rich dividends by way of <Col N="862" /> further expansion of the industry in the years ahead.  Likewise, in regard to the board's functions of providing advisory services to fishermen in the use of new fishing techniques and equipment and to fish processors and exporters in the marketing of fishery products, the growth of the industry gives rise to a greater demand on these services and, of course, to increased outlay.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the present level of investment in the catching side of the industry, Deputies will be interested to know that in the year ended 31st March, 1971, the board assisted Irish fishermen in acquiring 58 new vessels and 26 secondhand vessels ranging from 26 feet to 82 feet in length.  As 16 of the 26 secondhand vessels had previously been operated by other Irish fishermen, there was a net addition of 68 new and secondhand vessels to the fishing fleet during the year, excluding of course the small losses that arise from time to time through normal wastage.</P>
    <P>As I have referred to the work of the board in developing markets at home and abroad for our fishery products, I should, I feel, pay tribute to the role being played by fishermen's co-operatives in this field.  I am particularly pleased that the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society Ltd. who have been very helpful in the organisation of these co-operatives have recently appointed a full-time organiser to assist them in every way possible and as a result I look forward to still greater participation by fishermen's co-operatives in the industry.</P>
    <P>My Department continue to be intensively engaged in planning the provision of new and improved fishery harbours and landing places around the coast in the interest of the sea fishing industry.  The Office of Public Works carry out the actual engineering works and the technical appraisals necessary beforehand for all of which the element of State grant is provided via the vote for that Office.  However, as is customary in dealing with the Fisheries Estimate, I would like to tell Deputies how matters in this field stand at present.  At Dunmore East, Castletownbere, and Killybegs, work is progressing on the development of <Col N="863" /> the ports as major fishery harbours as provided for in the Fishery Harbour Centres Act, 1968.  Due to unavoidable delays, the works at Dunmore East which were to be finished last year are not now expected to be completed until later this year.  At Castletownbere work is progressing satisfactorily and it is hoped that a contract will be placed in the near future by the Office of Public Works for the construction of a bridge from the mainland to Dinish Island where work on the provision of a new wharf is already in hands.  It is expected that the development works at Castletownbere will be completed in 1974.</P>
    <P>Development works at Killybegs were retarded because of problems relating to land acquisition.  However, the Office of Public Works has invited tenders for the construction of a new pier and wharfs east of the town pier which will provide an additional 630 feet of discharging and servicing space for the Killybegs fishing fleet.  The provision of this new pier is badly needed as the expansion of the local fishing fleet has greatly outpaced the rate of development of the harbour facilities. Following recent consultations with the Killybegs fishermen, and to meet their wishes, work is in hands to carry out other improvements including a modification of the design of the pier ladders, improved lighting and kerbing on the town pier.  In addition the provision of extra berthing space at the Black Rock site and the provision of mooring facilities in the harbour are being investigated with a view to relieving congestion in the port.</P>
    <P>In addition to the development works on the major fishery harbours to which I refer, special attention is also being given to the need for other new fishing ports and landing places and the improvement of existing facilities in the western counties and on the rest of our coastline.  For that purpose the coastal surveys which were started in 1966 are being continued so that a comprehensive programme and an up-to-date appraisal will be available of the fishing ports and landing facilities which are required to meet the present and expected needs of the fishing <Col N="864" /> industry.  Surveys have been completed on the coasts of Cork, Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  A survey of the coast of County Waterford is now being undertaken and will be followed by a survey of the east coast.  During the past year improvement works for ports and landing places were approved for various places in Counties Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Donegal; harbour works are in progress in a number of places in Counties Cork, Kerry, Galway, Mayo, Donegal and Dublin; various works have been completed in Counties Kerry, Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Dublin and Wexford.  In addition, boring surveys and technical investigations preparatory to undertaking improvement works have been carried out in three places in Counties Cork, Kerry and Donegal while navigation lights were erected at Tullaghan Bay, County Mayo and approval for erection of navigation lights has been given in four places in Counties Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal.</P>
    <P>As announced in May last, a contract was signed with the Decca Navigator Company Ltd., for the installation of an electronic navigational system to aid the development of Irish sea fisheries on the north-west, west and south coasts.</P>
    <P>The system which involves the provision of one main transmitting station and three slave stations at selected sites in counties Donegal, Galway, Kerry and Waterford, is expected to be in operation by November, 1972.  The whole coastline will then be fully covered by the Decca system as the east coast is already adequately serviced by stations located in Britain.</P>
    <P>The system will enable fishing vessels to plot their exact position at any time. It will facilitate the navigation of trawlers to reach selected fishing grounds with the least possible delay and to return to port by the best route and without any loss of time due to darkness, bad weather, <i>et cetera</i>.  The location of good fishing grounds can be recorded on charts so that by utilising the Decca system, the vessel can return at any time to the same location.  The <Col N="865" /> location of obstructions on the sea floor which could damage fishing gear can also be plotted for future guidance.</P>
    <P>The establishment and operation of this Decca chain will cost the State about £¾ million, spread over ten years. This sum covers the capital cost of building and services to house the special transmitting apparatus and it also covers the annual leasing charge of the equipment to be operated by the Decca Company.  It also covers the cost of designing specially overprinted charts for sale to fishermen in conjunction with their Decca receivers. The cost mentioned does not include the cost of receiving apparatus on board the fishing vessel, the arrangement there being that the receiving apparatus is rented privately by the vessel owner from the Decca Company</P>
    <P>The most important development affecting our fisheries in recent years is, without doubt, Ireland's application for membership of the EEC.  As Deputies are aware, one vital aspect of the EEC fisheries policy which came into operation on 1st February, 1971, had been a cause of concern to all of us.  This concern arose from that part of the Community policy which provided for equality of access to and exploitation of fishery waters of each member State by the fishing vessels of the other member States.  However, after protracted negotiations we have been successful in securing a satisfactory arrangement which has removed what we regarded as a serious threat to the livelihood of our fishermen and to the continued expansion of our fishing industry.  This represented a major breakthrough, having regard to the position adopted by the Community earlier in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>The arrangement, which will be subject to review after a ten-year period, reserves exclusively for Irish fishermen the waters stretching from the coast to a line six miles seaward of the existing baselines and this reserved zone extends around our entire coastline.  In addition, the existing regime is also being retained in the six- to 12-mile zone from Lough Foyle to Cork Harbour for all species of fish and from Carlingford Lough to Carnsore Point <Col N="866" /> for shellfish.  The waters so protected provide over 90 per cent of our national catch.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that four of the present member States of the Community and Britain already enjoy substantial fishing rights under the London Convention of 1964 in the remaining areas where vessels from member States will now be permitted to fish.  We will also have the right to fish in large areas of the six- to 12-mile zone off the British coast from which our fishermen were previously excluded or restricted to specified species of fish.  These additional rights will be particularly valuable to our fishermen for fishing off the easily accessible west coast from the Bristol Channel northwards.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, this whole arrangement is to be reviewed in ten years time.  In agreeing to this review, we had to be particularly careful to ensure that the formula adopted was not such as would debar us from securing a continuance of satisfactory arrangements at the end of the ten year period.  Under the review clause finally agreed, the Council of the enlarged Community in deciding on the arrangements to apply after the ten-year period, must take into account the position of the fishing industry in member States and in particular the position of coastal populations dependent mainly on inshore fishing and the state of development of the inshore fishing industry.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Council, we will be taking an active part in all its deliberations and will be in a position to ensure that our national interests in the fisheries sector will continue to be safeguarded by appropriate arrangements including the maintenance of special limits.  Because of the natural concern throughout the past year about the access question, the many benefits available under the Community's common fisheries policy have tended to be overlooked while the negotiations lasted.  We must, of course, take into account on the credit side the advantages for our fishing industry of the price supports, marketing arrangements and other aspects of the common policy.</P>
    <P>In 1970 we exported fish and fishery <Col N="867" /> products to the total value of £4.6 million.  Of these exports over 89 per cent went to the EEC and the three other applicant countries, as I have already mentioned.  Thus less than 11 per cent of our fish exports went to countries outside the EEC and the applicant countries.  Our significant trade with the existing EEC countries has been achieved despite our exporters being hampered by import duties and in some cases by quantitative restrictions.</P>
    <P>When we are members of the Community the abolition of these duties and other restrictions will greatly enhance the prospect for our trade and we will, of course, also retain our present free entry opportunities in the UK market.  In view of the expansion which has taken place in our fishing industry in recent years it is essential that markets continue to develop.  Our home market is limited so we must look to export markets to absorb our increased production.  The main items we have available for export are herring, salmon and shellfish, fresh and processed&mdash;all products which will continue to be in good demand in the enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see what future there would be for our fishing industry if Britain, Norway and Denmark joined the Community and we remained outside. In such event we could lose our free access to the British market and find ourselves confronted with the same restrictions which at present limit our trade with the EEC.  More than this, Community fish would then enjoy free access to the British market.</P>
    <P>Apart from improved export market prospects there are other aspects of the EEC regulations which should benefit our fishermen.  There is provision for the fixing of guide and withdrawal prices for a number of varieties of fish.  These include varieties in which we are interested, such as herring, cod, black pollock, haddock, whiting, mackerel and plaice.  The prices fixed in the EEC for 1972 are generally higher than the prices hitherto obtained by our fishermen. The present fish prices will be gradually equated to the EEC prices <Col N="868" /> over the five year transitional period. Accordingly, our fishermen can expect an increased return for their catches of the varieties involved.</P>
    <P>Support arrangements will provide the added advantage of reasonable prices even in times of heavy landings. Financial assistance will be made available to producer organisations of fishermen to encourage their establishment, to facilitate their functioning and to enable them to compensate members whose produce is withdrawn from the market under the withdrawal price arrangement for marketing support.  The advantages of these measures should offset any effects of the freeing from quantitative control of imports into Ireland of fish and fish products from other member countries.</P>
    <P>There will also be special measures to protect the market against imports from non-member countries and for the subsidisation of exports to such countries, if required.  As an added protection for home landed fish, the Government recently imposed duties on imported fresh, chilled or frozen fish at rates equivalent to the common customs tariff of the EEC.  We previously had no duty on whole fish and only a small duty on fish fillets in this category.  The new duties will be phased out in intra-Community trade during the transitional period but will be retained against non-member countries.</P>
    <P>The common fisheries policy also provides for grant assistance from Community finances towards measures taken to increase productivity.  Thus, for example, grants can be provided for the improvement of fishing fleets and fishery research.  This again should be of considerable advantage to us at the present stage of development of our fishing industry.  It will enable us to continue the expansion of our fishing fleet, to intensify the search for new fishing grounds, and to develop new fishing techniques.</P>
    <P>Now that a satisfactory solution has been found to the access issue, I am confident that our fishing industry will not only continue to expand but will do so at a more rapid rate than heretofore as a result of EEC membership.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> I will now turn to inland fisheries. The overall catches for salmon in 1970 were satisfactory being slightly greater than for the previous year, and on a level with the sustained high runs which have occurred since 1962, despite disease and other disturbing factors. The market value in 1970 was maintained at a satisfactory level, again somewhat higher than that in the preceding year.  The total weight of the catch for the year 1970 by all fishing methods was 31,345 cwt., valued at £1,228,762 as compared with 30,391 cwt., valued at £1,107,788, in 1969. These figures do not include those for sea-trout which are relatively of minor importance.  For 1971, the full returns of catches and compilation of figures will not be to hand for some months yet but the figures of exports of salmon up to 31st October were 18,966 cwt., valued at £1,170,712, as against 21,427 cwt., valued at £1,043,050, for the same period in 1970.</P>
    <P>The quantity of salmon exported in 1970 was 23,287 cwts., valued at £1,216,481, as against 20,101 cwts. valued at £1,172,694, in 1969.  Some of the salmon is, of course, exported in processed form which increased the unit value compared with landed value. Officers of my Department continued to keep a check on the standard of Irish salmon as exported.</P>
    <P>Conditions for angling were only fair for the season as a whole in 1970 because the weather was dry as in 1969 and did not favour rod fishing. The number of salmon rod licences issued at 11,446 showed an increase compared with 10,756 in 1969.  The weight of salmon taken by rod and line in 1970 was 136,849 lb., as compared with 182,248 lb. in 1969.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Inland Fisheries set up to examine the problems inherent in the development, conservation and utilisation of our inland fisheries in June, 1970, continue to investigate all aspects of inland fisheries. It must be accepted that because of the complexity of the subject some considerable time must elapse before they will have completed their work and made recommendations The commission have, however, submitted an interim report on drift net fishing which <Col N="870" /> has been published and comments sought from anyone interested.  This report recommends regulating drift net fishing for salmon at sea with the object of maintaining the livelihood of fishermen when salmon catches are of vital importance to the economy of many of our seaboard communities.</P>
    <P>The Joint International Working Group from the International Commission for the North East Atlantic Fisheries and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, who have been studying the implications of the high seas fishing for salmon which takes place in waters off Greenland and also in the North East Atlantic, continued their activities.  The catches in both regions are still a cause of concern. So far Ireland is less seriously affected than other countries with home water catches by the Greenland Fishery due to the fact that grilse forms the great bulk of our catches and these are not taken to any extent in Greenland waters.  The development of the fishery in North East Atlantic waters could affect Irish stocks as there is evidence that some of the catch consists of fish in the grilse age-group.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission in May. 1970, a recommendation was passed calling for restrictions by way of close season, <i>et cetera</i> on fishing for salmon outside national fishery limits.  This was implemented in this country by the making of an order which came into force on 1st January, 1971.  The commission in May, 1971, passed a recommendation for a total ban on salmon fishing in sea areas near the approaches of Ireland and the United Kingdom for a period of one year from the 1st January, 1972.  The necessary order to give effect to this matter has now been made.  It is to be understood, of course, that the major part of our drift netting for salmon at sea takes place within national fishery limits.  The restrictions are, therefore, very much in our overall interest.</P>
    <P>The work of protecting and developing the fisheries in fishery districts rests with the boards of conservators who do their utmost to preserve this natural resource.  It is difficult to eliminate <Col N="871" /> illegal fishing entirely but protection staffs succeed in keeping it under control to a reasonable extent.  The conservators deal also with the threat of pollution which gives rise to damage to fish life chiefly in the forms of industrial effluent, domestic sewage and farm wastes.  Poisonous or harmful discharges are punishable under fisheries legislation.  The efforts of my Department in common with those of other responsible agencies are in general directed to guarding against pollution by inducing a livelier awareness on the part of possible polluters of the damage that they can do to fish. In pursuance of this general policy my Department have organised measures to reduce pollution from agricultural sources by co-operation between the fishery conservators and the advisory staffs of the county committees of agriculture. My Department are also represented on the inter-departmental group set up by the Minister for Local Government to make an assessment of the problems of air and water pollution and to make recommendations for coordinated measures of control.</P>
    <P>On the development side, the conservators promote suitable work sometimes in collaboration with angling associations by arranging for the removal of obstacles to fish movement in rivers and clearing the spawning beds for better propagation.  For such situations river improvement works grants are readily available to cover most of the cost.  In any case in which technical advice is required the engineers of my Department give every assistance in the design and execution of the works.</P>

      <P>In order to bridge at least partially the growing gap between the expenses of conservation and the statutory incomes of the boards of conservators the Exchequer grant to the Salmon Conservancy Fund is being increased to £110,000.  Apart from the moneys made available for river improvement works&mdash;of which the conservators have in general been slow to avail themselves&mdash;by far the greater part of the fund is required to supplement the direct income of boards of conservators from the sale of licences and from fishery rates, the total of which fails to keep pace with the steadily rising level of salaries, wages and incidental expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A new feature of these administrations grants arises this year as on this occasion it is for the first time found necessary to make good the deficiency on the financing of the conservation service in the Foyle area.  Adverse cost factors similar to those operating in regard to conservation work generally have finally brought the Foyle Fisheries <Col N="873" /> Commission from creditor to debtor status.  The accounts of the commission for the fishery year ended 30th September, 1971, show a deficiency of some £6,000 subject to audit and it has been agreed that this will be made good in equal shares by the Dublin and Belfast administrations.</P>
    <P>The investigations conducted by the biological staff are directed towards the collection and assessment of fishery data with a view to the proper regulation of fisheries.  The investigations can be concerned with specific stocks such as those in the Rivers Erne and Lee where hydro-electric schemes have interfered with the fisheries, or the effects of drainage or other works on particular rivers.  The investigations can, on the other hand, be in the nature of basic research, the results of which can be applied to the global stocks.</P>
    <P>Investigations are being continued at the experimental station at Glenties into the application of electricity to fishery management and exploitation. These investigations include the development of electronic fish counters, electrical fishing apparatus and the exploration of the effects of various kinds of electrical stimuli on different types of fish.</P>
    <P>UDN continues to affect stocks of salmon in many rivers throughout the country although generally to a less degree than previously.  In most waters other species of freshwater fish are virtually unaffected with the exception of relatively small numbers of brown trout.  The outbreak of the disease in trout stocks which occurred during the spawning seasons of 1968 and 1969 in a tributary stream of Lough Corrib recurred on a minor scale in January, 1971, when 82 diseased trout were reported. No diseased trout were reported during February, 1971.</P>
    <P>During most of 1971 the incidence of UDN was low throughout most of the country with the exception of the Rivers Blackwater, Lee and Bandon and the rivers in the Limerick and Kerry areas.  As happened in previous years, with the advent of warmer weather conditions the disease tended to die out generally.</P>
    <P>The research into UDN continues to <Col N="874" /> be done mainly at the Veterinary Research Laboratory of my Department at Abbotstown, Castleknock, County Dublin where work continues on the effort to isolate the causative organism.  Although the work has not yet resulted in identifying the causative organisms it has been possible to confirm that the organism is filterable, that is to say, of very small size, probably a virus.  The investigations cover a wide range of topics embracing tissue culture, the study of the blood characteristics of salmon, transmission experiments and those relating to immunology.  Other aspects of the disease including serum changes associated with UDN in brown trout and the biology of a fungus and its relationship to fish disease, continued to be studied in the Zoology Department of University College, Cork, and in the Botany Department of University College, Dublin.</P>
    <P>Veterinarians of the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture continue to work in close collaboration with the Abbotstown Laboratory and liaison is maintained between the research workers of both staffs as well as with those in Great Britain and other countries.  Meetings of the scientific committees set up to co-ordinate research and information on the disease were held during the year. Regular Press releases are issued which give the latest information on the incidence of the disease in affected river systems.  All salmon and seatrout exported from this country are inspected to ensure that they are free from disease.</P>
    <P>The survey, including runs of fish, count of redds, <i>et cetera,</i> on the River Bandon in County Cork, to assess the full impact of UDN on fish stocks in a particular river system, began during the year and some data on the pattern of fish movement and fish stocks were collected.  This is a long-term project, however, and it will take some years to arrive at any conclusions.</P>
    <P>In order to combat the effects of UDN in Irish rivers my Department have continued with a programme of restocking diseased rivers with supplies of salmon fry.  Approximately 600,000 <Col N="875" /> ova were imported early in 1971, mainly from Scotland and Norway, in order to augment supplies available from home sources for the purpose.  A small quantity of sea trout ova was also imported from Scotland.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to arrange for further imports of ova next season.  Because of the increased demand for salmon fry for restocking river systems affected by UDN disease and the inadequacy of the existing facilities to cope with anticipated imports of salmon ova in next and subsequent seasons, the Department initiated proposals to extend Cong Hatchery operated by the Galway Board of Conservators to provide increased rearing facilities there.</P>
    <P>In order to offset the effect of the drainage scheme for the Boyne catchment it was decided to establish a salmon hatchery and rearing unit in the locality.  The Office of Public Works agreed to be responsible for the costs of the project and to subsidise it until such time as it becomes a viable unit.  A suitable site was procured at Virginia, County Cavan and it is hoped to have the hatchery in operation in the near future.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid sought for the Inland Fisheries Trust is for the same amount as last year, £220,000.  The House is aware of the excellent work done by the Inland Fisheries Trust in improvement and rehabilitation of angling.  On all sides I hear praise of their work and they have been in the public eye on many recent occasions when help was sought urgently to rescue stocks of fish in waters where pollution had struck and to assist where local angling interests needed help urgently with some unexpected problem.  From the trust's annual reports the trust members will know the varied projects undertaken so successfully by the trust.  At this stage their development work for trout has spread itself over a big area of lakes&mdash;150,000 acres&mdash;and more than 1,000 miles of river.</P>
    <P>In addition, they are doing a tremendous amount of work in the coarse fishing and sea angling interest. As a result a large area of fishable water has been provided for home and <Col N="876" /> tourist anglers and one direct advantage is seen in the income from tourist angling which, despite the difficulties encountered last year and this year, is just over the £4 million mark.  Anglers everywhere have welcomed the interesting booklets, maps and information on Irish angling which have been produced by the trust.  They are pursuing much biological research work which is such an important factor in planning the development and restocking of fisheries.  The fish farms operated by the trust have produced the stocks of trout needed for restocking where artificial stocking is considered necessary &mdash;that is, in waters where natural reproduction is inadequate or where there has been a temporary upset caused by unusual circumstances such as pollution or drainage.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that with the increasing number of persons taking up angling as a recreation there will be an everincreasing demand for good fishing waters.  Development of fishing is a costly business and is becoming more expensive each year with higher costs arising for wages and materials.  In the case of the Trust, the State grant-in-aid has increased steadily over the years while their membership has remained at a very low level indeed. When one considers the number of anglers in the country it is really most discouraging to see that only some 6,000 or 7,000 join the Trust.  It is obvious that some day soon the State must examine the relationship between the amount which is paid out of State Funds to provide what is virtually free fishing for our angling community and the amount which the anglers are themselves contributing.  Over the years repeated appeals have been made to the anglers of this country to join the Trust as, apart from any monetary consideration, membership is in itself a recognition of the Trust's good work. Once again I appeal to our angling friends to join the Trust.  In doing so I thank all those angling bodies and all sections of the community, who have helped the Trust in the past.  I also wish to express my appreciation for the excellent work done by the Trust and their officers.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputies will be satisfied from what I have said that steady <Col N="877" /> progress has been made during the year in the fishing industry.  As in any other industry problems exist in this case also but I am confident that given goodwill, determination and co-operation they can be overcome.  I accordingly recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to state the Fine Gael Party position in relation to the fishing industry.  It is our firm belief that this country is capable of maintaining a prosperous and expanding national fishing industry which should give a livelihood free from fear of the future to an expanding number of full-time and part-time fishermen.  This involves laying down a definite national policy in relation to the future of the fishing industry which has not been forthcoming from the present Government as evidenced here today by the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.  I see no reason why Ireland should not have a fishing fleet capable of going into the deep seas. If the Government had been serious about the proper development of a fishing fleet over the last few years substantial developments could have taken place in this sector.  We should have, especially in the context of the EEC, modernised and expanded our inshore fishing fleet and equipped that fleet far more quickly than has been the case. It is a pity that the Government have not over the past few years given a lead in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech and concerning that aspect of it which concerned membership of the EEC I was rather disappointed by the lack of detail.  To me it was a blasé statement.  Having regard to this country's application we should have got from the Parliamentary Secretary a far more comprehensive analysis of the situation existing within the EEC at this time.  There are many aspects of EEC policy which will affect this country on our entry. In view of the absence of a proper analysis I have decided to examine here in depth today the two council regulations which are of prime importance to this country and which deal directly with fishing.  The two regulations were not even referred to by the Parliamentary Secretary.  The first <Col N="878" /> regulation of 20th October, 1970, is the Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2141 70 on the establishment of a common structures policy in the fisheries sector. This was the regulation which was passed by the Council and which laid down the EEC policy in relation to the structure of the fishing industry.  I must admit from my reading of both regulations&mdash;the other one dealt with organisation of markets&mdash;that a common policy in relation to the development of the fishing industry in general within the EEC has only really begun. Indeed, part of the regulations were not effective until mid-1971 and I feel to a certain extent that they are groping towards a common policy in this sector.  Nevertheless, it must be stated that certainly after the transitional period in relation to the fisheries sector there will be a definite policy which will have a serious import for our own industry.  The document is essentially composed of a preamble giving the objectives and a number of regulations adopted under the headings of various Articles.  I am reading from an official translation of the original document. The common structures policy was laid down after consultation with the Commission, the Assembly and the Economic and Social Committee within the EEC.  It states specifically that there must be equal access for all the members to national waters although in the preamble it allows an exception to this rule to be permitted for certain types of fishing, for the benefit of local populations whose employment is closely dependent on inshore fishing and, indeed, it emphasises the importance of safeguarding the resources at present in the waters.  It also states that member States can be authorised to grant financial aids to achieve rational development and a fair standard of living for the persons who draw their resources from the fishing industry.  In addition, with a view to achieving these objectives more moneys can be forthcoming from the Community resources.  These moneys, I take it, would come from the agricultural price and guidance fund.</P>
    <P>A permanent committee on fishery structure is to be established which will be, so to speak, the governing body in relation to policy of structure <Col N="879" /> and marketing.</P>
    <P>The first Article states that to favour:</P>
    <P>The rational exploitation of the biological resources of the sea and of internal waters, a common system shall be introduced for the carrying out of fishing in maritime waters, together with specific measures with a view to appropriate schemes and the co-ordination of the member States, structure policies in this sector.</P>
    <P>Article 2 deals with conditions of access and exploitation of fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>Article 3 states that member states must notify other member states of the Commission in particular of any changes they plan to make in relation to the structure of fishing and in relation to Article 2&mdash;that is, in relation to access.</P>
    <P>Article 4 makes an exception in regard to certain fishing zones within a limit of three nautical miles, and I quote, &ldquo;if that population depends primarily on inshore fishing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This latter Article is, to my mind, a rather important one because it is under this that this country negotiated a special protocol in relation to free access to Irish waters.  Perhaps it is appropriate at this juncture to deal with the position in relation to access to Irish fishing waters.  I know from the circular issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the information of Deputies that the six-mile limit has been maintained for the protection of fishing rights around the coast and that limit is extended to 12 miles in respect of the north and west coasts from Lough Foyle to Cork in the south west and, on the east coast, from Carlingford Lough to Carnsore Point where shellfish are concerned. What has been a cause for grave concern and complaint amongst fishermen is the position with regard to the coastline off Wexford and Waterford down as far as Cork.  Only the six-mile limit has been set and fishermen regard this as a sell-out of the very rich herring resources in that area.</P>
    <P>No reason has been given by the <Col N="880" /> Parliamentary Secretary as to why the 12-mile limit was not negotiated for the whole coastline.  Indeed, not alone was there no reason given, but the Parliamentary Secretary did not even refer to the matter.  I find it difficult to justify this lack of information because this is the kind of information for which the fishermen are asking; it is the kind of information upon which they will base their votes in the coming referendum. The information was not given and the Parliamentary Secretary can justly be criticised for not giving the reasons why the 12-mile protection limit was not extended to these areas. I have my own reasons.  I believe the failure to negotiate the 12-mile limit throughout the herring grounds was because these are the grounds in which the fishermen of the EEC are particularly interested.  They have stated that quite plainly.  Over the weekend I was told that some French trawlermen have stated that they will fish permanently off Dunmore East after we enter the EEC.  The Dutch, the French and the Germans have far better equipment than our fishermen have.  They have bigger trawlers and more facilities on board even than we have on shore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be our facilities but there must be free and equal access to those facilities and that is why the French and Dutch will come over here and take over permanently. There has been a sell-out of our herring grounds.  There can be no doubt about that.  When the Parliamentary Secretary comes to reply I would like him to give us the reason why he did not mention this sell-out of our herring grounds here this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the review clause in the agreement will be based not necessarily on Ireland's position at the time of the review but on the report compiled by the Commission in the interim.  That report will set out the position as it then obtains.  It is then that the Council acting on the proposal of the Commission will examine the arrangements which will follow the derogations in force until 31st December, 1972.  We will, of course, have a say on the Council and on the Commission, but I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the ten year clause could have serious repercussions.  Our fishermen may not invest as much as they should in bigger trawlers and better <Col N="882" /> equipment.  The Irish fishing fleet has a future and a better future within the EEC than it would have outside it. An argument which might be advanced for Irish fishermen staying outside the EEC is the fact that from July to February there are no Common Market countries operating here.  I would hope that within the EEC the supply position would be such that the enlarged Community of Ten would, in fact, have a common external tariff against other countries supplying fish, such as herring, to the Community. This is something that must be negotiated. There was no reference to this by the Parliamentary Secretary.  It is solid, factual information like that, that everyone can understand, which is so important not only to this House but to those involved in the industry. That information has certainly not been forthcoming here.</P>
    <P>Under Article 5 of the regulation the Council voting on a proposal by the Commission according to the procedure provided for in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty may adopt the measures necessary for conservation, that is conservation of various species of fish. These measures may involve restrictions concerning the catching of certain species, fishing zones, periods, methods and gear.  The power of stock conservation is the most important thing in this regulation because if we are serious about keeping a proper stock of such fish as herring and the main pelagic and demersal fish species the position must be examined immediately in relation to present stocks, future likely stocks, what constitutes over-fishing, what types of nets and what types of trawling should be used in the different areas.</P>
    <P>Again, we had no attempt to discuss this aspect of the matter here today except in relation to salmon fishing and fresh water fishing.  There was no reference to the position in regard to pelagic fish.</P>
    <P>Article 6 refers to the co-ordination of policies in relation to the fisheries structure of the member states and each state must send to the Commission each year information on the state of structures, the links between structures and market policy, the <Col N="883" /> nature and scope of measures for the improvement of structures planned for the current year, annual and pluri-annual programmes and projects of research and scientific and technical assistance introduced by the public authorities or financially assisted by them and the various information which is necessary to have a regulation work properly.  Under this heading it occurred to me to discuss the whole future of Bord Iascaigh Mhara. The Parliamentary Secretary should have stated quite clearly what is to be the future of this State body.  I am forced to give my personal opinion which is that the Government would be entitled to appoint BIM as the Government agency under the regulations of EEC.  This important point should have been made clear here by the Parliamentary Secretary.  This type of omission leaves one stunned.</P>
    <P>I take it An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be the Government agency which will act at the withdrawal level in relation to the support price scheme and act as the Government agency in general in regard to the future structure of the industry.  We were entitled to a statement in regard to BIM, which certainly has done excellent work in the past few years in regard to the development of the fishing industry and I would be first to say so.  I am not criticising the board but I want to know how it stands under EEC conditions and the House is entitled to that information.</P>
    <P>Under Article 7 the Commission will submit a report each year concerning fishery structures to the Assembly and the Council.  This will be a comprehensive report in relation to various aspects of fishery structures, including finance, and will be important. Article 8 mentioned that it was necessary to co-ordinate member states' policy on research and scientific and technical assistance in the fisheries sector.  This is very true and research at present being done by such countries as England, Holland, France and Germany will be of great benefit in the light of our own inadequate resources in this field.</P>
    <P>Article 9 lays down the position concerning member states' financial aids <Col N="884" /> which I have already mentioned. Article 10 points out that it is necessary to give a fair standard of living to the population which draws its resources from fishing.  It states that it is necessary to increase productivity by restructuring such things as fleets and trawler types, the adaptation of production and marketing conditions according to market requirements. That is dealt with by another regulation to which I shall refer later.  It also deals with the improvement, hand in hand with the development of technical progress, of the standard and conditions of living of the population which draws its resources from fishing.</P>
    <P>Article 11 discusses the legal necessity for a number of reports and documents to be sent to the Commission from time to time.  Article 12 lays down that a Permanent Committee on Fishery Structures will be set up under the aegis of the Commission.  This is a body which will guide the various reforms in the industry.  We shall have a representative on it and the Committee will be under the chairmanship of a representative of the Commission. Article 13 provides that it shall be this committee's responsibility to ensure the exchange of information and to study the members' structural policy, to assist in reports, <i>et cetera</i>.  This is to be the guiding or management committee in relation to policies adopted by EEC. It also says that the conditions governing grant aid will come from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund which is the fund from which we will draw any funds we get from the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally, Article 15 states that the regulation comes into force on the third day after its publication in the official journal of the European Community, that is towards the end of 1970.  The system provided for by this regulation shall be applicable as and from 1st February, 1971, with certain exceptions.  That was signed on 20th October, 1970, by H.D. Griesau.  That document is of great importance and should at least have been noted in the introduction of the Estimate but was not.</P>
    <P>The other regulation, which is Council regulation EEC 2142/70 of 20th <Col N="885" /> October, 1970, is concerned with the common organisation of markets in the sector of fisheries products.  This regulation was made on the Commission's proposal and after getting the Assembly's opinion and the opinion of the economic resources committee.  This again lays down the various regulations in respect of marketing, such as marketing standards and rational disposal of production.  It tells us that the EEC member States are prepared to help finance the activities with a view to achieving rational development of the industry.  It is laid down here also that there will be a guide price for each product to be affected by this policy. Products are listed in a number of annexes at the end and I shall refer to them later.  Laid down also is the position in respect of withdrawal of products in the case of prices falling below a certain level.  It states that it is expedient to support the activities of producer organisations by granting them financial compensation for quantities withdrawn from the market. I shall discuss that later also as it is of importance to us.</P>
    <P>In relation to certain frozen products it is stated that it would be expedient to provide for private storage of these products.  The position in relation to producer organisations is important. These organisations can be financed to a certain extent by Member States both by way of grants-in-aid and by loan for a number of years and also from the EEC fund.</P>
    <P>The present position within the Six in respect of herrings is that there is a lack of supplies.  There is no tariff on the importation of herrings but when we enter the Community the position will be changed substantially. I had expected the Parliamentary Secretary to state that within the enlarged Community there would be a Common Market tariff on third countries who might be endeavouring to supply the Market with herrings.  This is an important aspect in so far as our fishing industry is concerned.  There is provision for an export subsidy in relation to certain species of fish for which there is a demand in third countries. This would be of help to the Community because there is an over-supply <Col N="886" /> of certain species.  It would enable them to maintain a proper market level within the Six.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Regulations deals with the marketing standards of fish. The only fish for which there would be compensation in respect of withdrawal would be those that measure up to a proper standard.  It will be the responsibility of member states to ensure these standards are maintained and this is being done at present in Ireland in respect of certain species of export fish but there must be further expansion.  Section 3 of Article 4 reads:</P>
    <P>Member States shall notify other Member States and the Commission at the latest one month after the coming into force of each marketing standard, of the name and address of the agencies entrusted with checks in respect of the product or group of products for which the standard has been adopted.</P>
    <P>I assume that in our case An Bord Iascaigh Mhara would be the agency. This should be stated specifically by the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with producer organisations.  As I see it, these organisations have an important role to play within an enlarged Community, especially in so far as we are concerned. The reason for the promotion of producer organisations is to have some co-operative and national element in the marketing and disposal of various fish species.  Of course it would be incumbent on members to dispose of the entire output of products through the agency of the organisation.  Regarding production and marketing it is stated that the rules adopted by the producer organisations with a view in particular to improving the quality of products and to adapting the volume of supplies to the requirements of the Market.  It is important that that would be part of a national supply scheme in relation to marketing of all species of fish, especially on the export market. Indeed, there is no reason why there should not be a rational disposal of the demersal species of fish on the home market.</P>
    <P>Under Article 6 member states may <Col N="887" /> make grant aids to producer organisations to promote their establishment and facilitate their operation.  However, it must be stated clearly that such aids would be given only for three years and that they are limited.  Nevertheless, the emergence of producer organisations should be of benefit to the industry.  During the first five years of establishment of these producer organisations, member states may grant to them, directly or through the agencies of accredited institutions, aids in the form of special loans to cover part of the foreseeable expenses connected with the interventions on the market.  These would be recoupable from the EEC funds.  Again, I expect this would be done through An Bord Iascaigh Mhara rather than that it would be under the aegis of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the price system.  There are two aspects of this which are important.  The regulations list the particular species of fish in respect of which compensation would be paid to member producers if quantities are withdrawn from the market and in relation to other types of fish it is stated that producer organisations may grant compensation to the member producers.  The fish in respect of which there would be mandatory compensation are listed in Annex 1 of the regulations and included among these are herrings, sardines, different types of haddock, whiting, mackerel, plaice and shrimps.  It is important that compensation is mandatory in respect of these species.  In so far as other species of fish are concerned the position is easier and it is a matter for the producer organisations to decide whether to grant compensation on withdrawal of catches or parts of catches.  It is stated that:</P>
    <P>For the financing of these withdrawal measures, the producer organisations shall set up intervention funds which shall be fed by contributions based on the quantities offered for sale or shall resort to an equalisation system.</P>
    <P>Of course the moneys would be recouped partially from the Agriculture <Col N="888" /> Prices and Guidance Fund.  Article 8 specifies that before the start of the fishing season a guide price shall be fixed for each of the products listed in Annex 1, sections A and C.  This is the fish to which I have already referred and on which it is mandatory to give compensation.</P>
    <P>I note from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that, on accession, we shall be coming up to the present EEC price level over the five-year period.  This is important, because under Article 8, section 2, the guide price shall be fixed on the basis of the average of the prices recorded on the representative wholesale market or port during the last three fishing seasons.  If we were to base them continually on the Irish price we would be at a disadvantage.  It is much better to go to the existing price level within the Community, as we shall be doing for other agricultural products.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 the intervention price shall be fixed at a level situated between 35 per cent and 45 per cent of the guide price, according to the production and marketing characteristics peculiar to each product.  This is a rather low level of intervention, and perhaps the consequences for the Irish fishing industry under this section should be analysed and spelled out to this House.</P>
    <P>Article 10 provides that the member states shall grant financial compensation to producer organisations to carry out intervention.  The financial compensation shall only be granted if the products withdrawn from markets are sold for purposes other than human consumption or under such conditions as do not constitute a hindrance to normal disposal of the products in question.  I wonder would the producer organisations be allowed to freeze fish &mdash;for instance, quantities of herrings&mdash; if the price was below normal, or would the State agency be allowed to purchase low-priced yet good quality fish which, as far as I am concerned, should not be used for purposes other than human consumption.  Even if the fish had to be bought by the State and shipped out as part of our national contribution to poor nations, so be it; <Col N="889" /> I am against destroying food, because it is wrong and unnecessary.  There is also a provision to the effect that the value of the financial compensation shall be equal to the amount resulting from the application of the quantities withdrawn.  Then it refers to a price equal to 60 per cent of the guide price when the level of withdrawal price is above 65 per cent of the guide price. This is somewhat technical and I would welcome a plain statement from the Parliamentary Secretary covering the various amounts of compensation which would be forthcoming in the event of withdrawal.  There are a number of provisions in relation to sardines, tunny fish and so on which are not really relevant to the situation in Ireland except in regard to the point that other countries have been able to get exceptional protection in relation to the supply of particular species of fish which this country has failed to get in respect of herrings.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is concerned with the system of trade with third countries. It provides that there shall be a common customs tariff in respect of imports. Quantity restrictions will not be allowed nor will the levying of other extra charges except in relation to tunny fish, which is used largely for processing.  Section 5 of Article 18 deserves comment:</P>
    <P>However, the suspension or limitation of imports shall not be applicable in respect of third countries which undertake to guarantee compliance with the reference price subject to specified conditions and which actually comply thereto in their deliveries to the Community.</P>
    <P>In this connection it is just as well that the four applicant countries are going into the Community together; otherwise they would be competing for the same market.</P>
    <P>Article 21 allows rebates for exports to third countries and states that rebates shall be the same for the whole Community.  This is important in situations in which the Community price is low and it will be of benefit to the Community to export fish to third countries.  Section 5 deals with general provisions.  Section 2 of Article 22 <Col N="890" /> states specifically&mdash;and this is worthy of note&mdash;that aids granted by member states in accordance with Article 6 (1) shall be reimbursed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund at the rate of 50 per cent of the amount.  It will not be a total reimbursement. Some expense will fall on the State in relation to aids granted by this country to producer organisations.</P>
    <P>Article 23 demands that there be equality of condition of access to ports. Then there is the point on which the Parliamentary Secretary took me up when I said that the French could fish in the six- to 12-mile limit at present under the London Convention of 1964. I was well aware of that when I said that some French trawlermen have stated that they would come to live permanently in Ireland upon our accession.  Under section 2 of Article 23, which I am summarising for the benefit of this House in the absence of a proper statement by the Government in this respect, it is provided:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to other Community provisions, Member States shall take the necessary steps to ensure, for all fishing vessels flying the flag of one of the Member States, equality of conditions of access to ports and primary marketing installations, as well as to all equipment and all technical fittings pertaining thereto.</P>
    <P>This is why the Six want the leeway to fish within the six- to 12-mile zone. They will have an extra advantage and extra facilities. They have better fishing equipment and better trawlers and, when we become a member, they will be allowed to have equal access to all our ports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I clarify the position?  Whether it was a six- or a 12-mile zone, it would not change the position of the French.  If the zone were 12 miles the French would still have the right, under the London Convention of 1964, to fish within the six-to 12-mile zone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Convention gives this right to fishermen from Britain, <Col N="891" /> Belgium, France, Germany.  The Netherlands, and Spain, I understand. That does not take from my argument that our Government sold out the rich herring grounds off the southeast coast to the stronger European countries in the fishery sector.  It was a disadvantage to us not to negotiate a 12-mile limit because our competitors will now be on an equal footing with our fishermen.  Our fishing fleet is essentially an inshore fishing fleet. Bigger trawlers which can catch fish within the six- to 12-mile zone can come in with their catches and take over the ports and facilities.  Our fishermen may not even be seen. Whether this is true or whether it is false&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there should be a 12-mile limit to protect our inshore fishing fleet.  The real point is that our fishing fleet is undersized. It has not got proper facilities. It has not got the proper ability to compete.  This lack of confidence, this lack of guidance from the Government, in the past few years, the lack of any really big development in our fisheries industry, the lack of confidence in our capacity to fish not only in our territorial waters but also in the deep sea, show the failure of the Government to protect our fishermen. That is the real point I am making. The immediate point I am making on Article 23 is that foreigners will have an advantage because they have a better capacity to ship the fish and they will now be able to use all the facilities available to us in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annexes which specify the fish species under which price guidance is given, under which intervention is <Col N="892" /> allowed and compensation paid, and exceptions can be made, can be amended by the Council, Article 26 provides:</P>
    <P>The council, taking a decision on a proposal by the Commission according to the voting procedure provided for in Article 43 (2) of the Treaty, may amend the Annexes as well as the percentages...</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the price percentages referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to establish a management committee for fisheries products &ldquo;which shall consist of representatives of the member States and shall be under the chairmanship of a representative of the Commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This will be a guiding committee in in relation to marketing and prices.</P>
    <P>Those are the bones of the regulations in relation to the marketing of fish.  I am sorry that I had to spend such a long time going into the regulations.  I had hoped that a full and proper explanation would have been forthcoming from the Parliamentary Secretary.  We should have got a full explanation of the position obtaining under the Treaty of Accession.  This should have been forthcoming from the Parliamentary Secretary but it was not.  I am very disappointed that the references made to it in his speech were of a general nature.  They were blasé in fact.  I am not satisfied with them.  We were entitled to expect that he would treat it properly in view of the seriousness of the subject.</P>
    <P>The information leaflet circulated by the Department of Foreign Affairs is very loosely worded.  It is better than the one circulated to Members only. It is slightly more detailed.  I have not got much of a &ldquo;barney&rdquo; with the rest of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech but it is deserving of some comment. The Parliamentary Secretary said that the net estimate for 1971-72 amounts to £1,775,000.  This is a very small amount when compared with the amount of State aid given to other sectors of industry.  This is an exporting industry.  It is only in its infancy and I am confident that it has a great future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="893" /> Reading the reports of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara I feel that development in the fishing industry is slow and grinding.  No major step has been taken.  There has been no effort to put a fleet of big trawlers into any port around the country which could engage in deep sea fishing.  No attempt has been made even to discuss the future of deep sea fishing.  There is another aspect in relation to BIM which I consider very important and on which I have my suspicions.  The latest BIM report available is that for the financial year 1969-70.  Why is the report for 1970-71 not available?  Why has there been an undue delay in circulating the 1970-71 report?  Was it because this Estimate was coming up in the House?  Is some type of information being withheld from Members of the House?  I do not know.  I want to know why there has been a delay in producing that report?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The important herring fishing, according to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech, got off to a slow start.  The herring season has not been up to last year's catches in the south off Dunmore East.  I understand that a new system has been developed for pinpointing shoals of herring at the deep sea level and also that they have noted the shift, whether temporary or permanent, down towards Cobh.  The deep sea catching of herring is an important development and I expected a statement on it by the Parliamentary Secretary.  If there has been a fall off in the quantity of herring caught, due to large shoals over the years, there must be good grounds for examining the situation in respect of the conservation of stock.</P>
      <P>The export of our fish is mainly to Europe.  This is very important in view of our entry into the EEC.  I am satisfied that it is in the interests of the fishermen particularly to enter Europe, not so much because of fantastic price increases but because within the EEC our fishermen would be on equal terms and be able to compete equally with other countries in the EEC.  If we remain outside steps will definitely be taken to make life awkward for our trawlermen.  I could see laws being enacted in regard to conservation, the type of fishing, quality of imports and other things like that.  The fishing industry is basically an export one, although we supply a fair quantity to the home market.  Our fishermen have more to gain by our entry into the EEC than if we remain outside.</P>
      <P>Experience is very important in relation to the training of fishermen.  I have noted political patronage in the granting of skipper's certificates.  We should all deplore this because it leads to bad spirit in the industry.  Any man's son is entitled to an equal crack of the ship in relation to his livelihood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scientific work done by various bodies is of prime importance.  This covers the work in relation to conservation of existing stock and this work must be expanded.  We are faced with very modern competitors, people with very modern trawlers and equipment <Col N="895" /> and we must be very careful to conserve existing stocks.  I should like to see an expansion in this scientific work done.  We will, of course, under the Treaty, have to lay down regulations in respect of the quality of fish.  I note the interest of the Institute of Industrial Research and Standards but I do not think that institute is necessary for laying down the general regulations under the Community's organisation. We need to examine the qualities that are necessary in particular fish species.</P>
    <P>We have major ports designated by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and we must ensure, if we are to benefit from the EEC policies in relation to fishing, that we have sufficient facilities at the major ports.  We must have enough processing facilities, freezing plants and the infrastructure necessary to avail of the openings in relation to the processing and the storage of fish.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara have a great part to play in this respect and also in relation to the general marketing of fish, which will be of crucial importance to Irish fishing.  An Bord Iascaigh Mhara must concentrate on what European markets are available for the various fish caught here.  The grants to this board should be expanded to allow a detailed study of the conditions in the EEC.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the position is in relation to boat building, which is satisfying a demand for our inshore fishermen. I would like the Department to examine the position in relation to deep sea fishing.  Various harbour works are important and the Department are to be congratulated for the progress they are making.  The Office of Public Works do most of the work but I feel they should work with greater haste in relation to development works.</P>
    <P>Coastal surveys are important and they relate not only to existing facilities but to potential facilities, and this work should be speeded up.  The Decca navigational system is something which should have been introduced years ago.  This is a very good aid to fishermen.  I was in a coastguard station last summer when a trawler went down somewhere between Waterford and Cork.  There was <Col N="896" /> no life lost but it was impossible to get telephonic contact between the two coastguard stations.  That is an archaic attitude.  There must be facilities for immediate and instant contact between all points along the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to salmon fishing and to inland fishing in general.  The disease to which he referred is, I hope, diminishing. He referred to the work of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  It is important that we have proper regulations to ensure that our rivers are not overfished. There has been a public inquiry into the position on the Suir which I think has been overfished.  It is important to examine early all situations and to control them properly.</P>
    <P>There are only five paragraphs in the recent White Paper on our fisheries.  This was a great disappointment to people who get their livelihood from fishing.  There were 5,600 in 1970, according to a publication by one of the European food and agricultural organisations.  At page 9 this publication states:</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing fleet, for example, numbers about 850 vessels in all but only 19 are over 75 tons and as many as 645 are under 23 tons.</P>
    <P>This is an important statement on the capacity of the Irish fishing fleet in relation to the fishing grounds available to them and it is an indictment of Government policy in this respect. The publication I have read from states that there are 5,600 fishermen and of these 3,800 are also farmers. This means that about 1,800 are full-time or nearly full-time fishermen. Those people are entitled to all the information available in regard to what faces them within Europe.  They have not got it from the Parliamentary Secretary and I cannot find it in any Government publication.  I had to go outside the Government service to get any worthwhile information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the fishermen realise there are more than five paragraphs in the White Paper referring to fisheries.  There are 12.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am open to correction in that respect.  Anyway, the contents of the five paragraphs are dry, technical and uninformative.  The phraseology is terse and does not in any sense attempt to deal with the problems of the industry when we become members of the European Communities.  That is why I was forced to analyse the regulations under which our fishing industry will have to operate.</P>
      <P>In relation to herring fishing, particularly off Dunmore East, I am not satisfied that there has been sufficient protection in regard to fishing inside the six-mile limit or the 12-mile limit, as the case may be.  Only last Saturday I was told that French trawlermen who had left the harbour immediately they were outside it put down their nets and commenced fishing.  I have complained already in the House about this lack of even elementary protection for our fishermen.  Particularly during the herring season, there should be a protection vessel permanently at Dunmore East for the specific purpose of protecting our fishermen.  I would go even further and suggest that there should be a helicopter there during the season to see that foreign trawlermen are not allowed to bully their way into Irish territorial waters.  Our fishermen are entitled to the protection provided by the law of the land and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to provide a fishery protection vessel at Dunmore East during the herring season.</P>
      <P>There is much work to be done in relation to the general development of our fishing industry.  We must develop central harbours; we must lay down a conservation policy in regard to all fish species; we must increase facilities for the processing of fish in all our harbours; we must update our attitude to financing those who want to go in for fishing and I am satisfied that An Bord Iascaigh Mhara should have a substantially increased grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of water pollution arises.  It is becoming an increasing source of public criticism.  We must lay down a proper antipollution policy and local authorities must ensure that the rivers within their jurisdiction are kept <Col N="898" /> clean and pollution free.  People are entitled to protection from this awful nuisance which we have seen time and again on television and which those of us who live or work near rivers have had experience of.  It is awful to see the waste products of industry and indeed of the agricultural sector finding their way into the rivers.  We must lay down tight laws and we must insist that they be enforced.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Fine Gael I must recommend to Irish fishermen that they consider favourably our application to join the European Communities.  It will give them an opportunity to avail of a price structure which will guarantee them better prices in relation to most of their catches.  In addition, it will guarantee them markets for their catches.  It will give them guaranteed prices in respect of species of fish important to the Irish fishing industry and they will be allowed compensation if they withdraw certain fish and they may get compensation if they withdraw others.  They will have a chance to get finance from funds available to the Community through the agricultural price and guarantee fund.  Outside the Community they will face a bleak future.  We have not got a future outside the EEC.</P>
    <P>The EEC is not a charitable organisation. It is an exercise in regionalisa-tion on a large scale and the enlarged Community, will, I have no doubt, take measures to protect its members against competition from outside countries. If we remained outside I am satisfied that they would take steps to damage our competitive position <i>vis-à-vis</i> their markets.  I am satisfied that within the context of the Rome Treaty and of the developing policies in relation to fisheries the Irish fishermen should support our entry into Europe.  Outside it they have nothing. Inside it they have an opportunity and I think they should avail of that opportunity.</P>

      <P>Though I disagree with the final conclusions of Deputy Collins, I think that everyone in the House and in the country is in debt to him for the trouble he has taken to provide us with some of the factual <Col N="899" /> information that was so noticeably lacking in what we heard from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I wish now to make a charge which I consider to be extremely serious.  I want to say that to alert you, Sir, because I trust you will guide me if I put myself outside the bounds of Standing Orders.  The words I am about to use I am choosing carefully.  The charge is that in the circulated text of the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary and also in the Government's White Paper on accession to the European Communities there is perpetrated, in almost identical terms, a lie.  I know it is not permitted under Standing Orders to accuse a Deputy of lying.  I am not making that accusation against the Parliamentary Secretary.  I have no way of knowing whether he is aware of the accuracy or otherwise of the statements he read out, and where there is a doubt he is entitled to the benefit of that doubt.  The particular form of words, which I consider to be more than just wrong, to be actually lying, occurs in the first paragraph of page 11 of the circulated text of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech and it occurs in almost identical terms at page 47 of the Government's White Paper on accession to the EEC, in the section on fisheries, paragraph 5.33.  I shall read it in the White Paper first.  It says:</P>
      <P>As a member of the Council we will be in a position to ensure that our national interests in the fishery sector will be provided for by appropriate arrangements including the maintenance of special limits.</P>
      <P>I charge, Sir, with all the seriousness I am capable of, that that is a lie perpetrated by a Government, not just an act of ignorance but an act of deliberate deception.  If we turn to the almost identical words&mdash;I am sure they did not emanate from him&mdash;read out by the Parliamentary Secretary this morning we see:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the Council, we will be taking an active part in all its deliberations and will be in a position to ensure that our national interests in the fisheries sector will continue to be safeguarded by <Col N="900" /> appropriate arrangements including the maintenance of special limits.</P>
    <P>That is deliberate and systematic misleading of the Irish people and of the Irish fishing industry by people who know the truth to be otherwise and that is as serious a charge as I am able to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, but it is more serious than that.  I am doing more than disagreeing.</P>
      <P>In trying to explain why this is not just mistaken but also deliberately misleading, let me indicate the precise nature of the arrangement which was entered into with regard to fisheries by our negotiators and which has been widely misrepresented in Ireland.  I have often said things in this House which I consider to be serious criticisms and I have waited for the reply which on any Estimate the introducer has the right to make.  Very often the points I considered most serious were not dealt with.  It is a convenient mechanism to get around a difficulty to pretend that it did not happen.  I am requesting that these charges should be replied to by the Parliamentary Secretary when he is summing up.  I want to give first, in brief terms, the nature of the agreement that we entered into with the Community in regard to fisheries.  I challenge him when he replies to indicate that my version of the facts is in any way incorrect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The common fisheries policy grants access to the territorial waters of all member states to all other member states and when that is said there are, of course, arrangements whereby this policy is not immediately put into effect.  These are referred to in the language of the Commission, as derogations and there are mechanisms by which derogations may be arranged. We have been given in our negotiations derogations for ten years the details of which we need not enter into now.  They have been set out and I have no quarrel with the factual details of the derogations granted. Before the ten years are completed a <Col N="901" /> report will be prepared by the Commission and that report will go from the Commission to the Council of Ministers on which we, if we join, will have representation.  That report will contain suggestions for various future actions in regard to our fisheries and the fisheries of other member countries. If there is not unanimous agreement between all the member countries, whether it is ten or nine or eight, in regard to the Commission's report at the Council then the actions recommended in that report cannot be put into effect and then the derogation lapses and the full fisheries policy of the EEC applies to Ireland and the other member states.  That is what is negotiated.  In the absence of unanimous agreement between the participants in regard to the protective steps taken in ten years time the derogation lapses and the fisheries policy comes into effect for Ireland which gives access to our territorial waters to every other member state.  That is what was negotiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  I shall deal with it when I am replying, but it is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine.  That fact in the end will come out and it will be seen whether the version I have given or whether the Parliamentary Secretary's version is the true one.  It may be that he firmly believes what he is saying.</P>
      <P>There is a common policy which we have agreed to.  There are derogations for ten years.  Unless there is unanimity in the Council at the end of ten years the derogation lapses and the common policy applies to Ireland.  We, therefore, do not possess a veto, as has been represented, to protect our interests but any other member country has a veto over us in regard to future protection. If the French want to get in anywhere they simply veto the suggestions of the Commission at the Council and the suggestions of the Commission fall.  The derogations lapse after their ten-year term and then the full fisheries policy applies to us.  That has been negotiated.  That is what has been agreed and to present anything else to the people is to mislead them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To say at page 47&mdash;I gave the <Col N="902" /> quotation at the beginning&mdash;in the last sentence of paragraph 5.33 &ldquo;...we will be in a position to ensure that our national interests in the fisheries sector will be provided for...including the maintenance of special limits&rdquo; is to mislead.  To say we can ensure the maintenance of special limits after the derogation period is a lie.  We cannot do so and our negotiators understood we could not do so but they came home and proceeded to deceive the people and that deception is put into the Preamble, a solemn, reputable and responsible document, and repeated word for word by the Parliamentary Secretary today.</P>
    <P>Contrast that with the Norwegian situation.  They negotiated the same agreement as we did.  Then they rejected it.  Then their Prime Minister visited a number of European capitals. Then they went back to Brussels and asked for new terms.  These were refused. They then accepted the same terms as those we were given.  But the Norwegian Minister for Fisheries knew he could not guarantee the future of the special limits and, in contradistinction to our negotiators, he went home and said so.  He then had the honour to resign.  If there were a scrap of honour&mdash;we do not really expect it&mdash;we should have had some resignations.  To say it will be possible to &ldquo;ensure&rdquo; the maintenance of special limits is to lie.  To ensure something is to make it sure.  To ensure the maintenance of special limits is not within the power of our negotiators and those who negotiated knew that.  But they came home and told the people the opposite.  This was quite scandalous in my view and, if there were any honour, we would have some resignations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of misleading the people.  The position has been put clearly before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary will have an opportunity of replying.  He can say there is no question of misleading the people, but it is the people who will judge.  I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that it will take a bit of wriggling, a bit of sophistry and a bit of twisting of words <Col N="903" /> to get our negotiators off that particular hook.  Either the Norwegian Prime Minister made an untrue statement and needlessly sacrificed his job or else the content of the White Paper and the Parliamentary Secretary's speech this morning are not an honest representation of the facts.</P>
      <P>In the miserable years I have been in this House I have become accustomed to blanket denials without any explanations.  The Parliamentary Secretary says there is no difference.  It would be abnormal for him not to assert this, but I want from him a clear indication, without sophistry and without any twisting of words, that the statement that the maintenance of special limits can be ensured is true.  I do not want just a shaking of the head or a statement that there is no deception. There is deception.  It is inescapable. I do not make that sort of accusation lightly.  I am not accusing the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think there is an inch of coastline in his constituency.  I do not think he has shown any particular interest in fisheries.  I think there was a political reason for making him Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for fisheries and putting a big black car into that constituency.  It had nothing to do with fisheries.  The accusation I make is against the person who wrote this, and that is a public servant.  I know that this White Paper was written by a great many people.  I have no way of knowing who wrote what and I am, therefore, accusing a public servant, nameless, and unable to defend himself&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Good.  I am satisfied, <Col N="904" /> for the reasons I have given, that this is a deception and cannot by any stretch of the imagination be made the truth.  We have got a derogation from the fisheries policy of the Community for ten years and I maintain that we have no possibility of ensuring the maintenance of special limits after that ten years.  If it had been said that it seemed probable that the concessions could be continued after that period, well and good, but we certainly cannot ensure anything.  That was the belief of the Norwegian Minister and, after the Norwegians had accepted, he resigned.  He said he could not guarantee the future of the limits, but that is exactly what both of these documents pretend we can do.  I shall await the argument of the Parliamentary Secretary on this aspect with interest. Assuming our negotiators are telling the truth, then they did not understand that to which they agreed.  It is perfectly clear from the fishery journals of a number of countries, including some of our competitors, that they understood perfectly what was agreed.  Those involved in the industry here at a high level of investment and knowledge also understood.  There is no ensuring of the maintenance of special limits after the ten year derogation.  This understanding and this knowledge on their part has already had a very significant effect on the plans for future investment.  We have an enormous coastline and a great continental shelf.  We have many reasons to reproach ourselves for the ineptitude of our economy particularly in relation to our fishing industry.  The capital starvation has been such that our fishermen until very recently have been unable to keep up with the technological advances of other countries, and instead of having a great industry like Norway we have a tiny, struggling one which is now making very welcome progress but from a very low base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tragedy about this agreement which is being so dishonestly peddled around the country is that it will have an inhibiting effect on the investments we so urgently need.  In an interjection about what was or was not in the three treaties of the three Communities we are proposing to join, the Parliamentary <Col N="905" /> Secretary said that such-and-such a thing was not mentioned in these treaties.  We had this argument last week when debating the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill. Over and over we are told in a number of debates that all we are doing is signing these treaties and that there is nothing in any of them about A, B, C or D and so we are taking on no commitments.  The regulations, directives, acts and decisions of the Communities are published and run to 41 volumes at present and are being consistently added to.  It is interesting that those 41 volumes are not in the Dáil Library, any of them; interesting that the briefing promised to spokesmen on EEC has never been forthcoming.  It is interesting that the details of, for example, regulation 4121/70 and its relevant sections were read out here by an Opposition Deputy who had himself arranged to get the translation because those regulations are not available to the Members in the Library of the House when we are expected to have serious discussions on what EEC involves. I do not want to dull accusations of dishonesty and there are so many that it can become repetitious but we are not discussing simply the terms of three treaties but the directives, decisions, regulations and acts pursuant to those treaties to the tune of 41 volumes which we are also accepting and are being asked to accept without any consideration of their contents.</P>
    <P>If we wanted an example of them we got it on section 4, Article 23 of Document 2141/70, the October, 1971, directive of the two fisheries directives, because Article 23 of section 4 gives access to Irish ports, to the marketing and technical facilities of Irish ports to any of the fishermen of the Nine.  That is given as of 1st January, 1973, if we sign.  There is no phasingin in that case.  When Deputy Collins put that to the Parliamentary Secretary I wrote down his reply.  He said: &ldquo;There is nothing to say that we have to provide them with facilities.&rdquo;  Those words are on record.  What does that mean?  One must analyse and parse sentences to find where the hypocrisy, evasion or deception lies.  There is <Col N="906" /> nothing to say we have to provide them with facilities but directive 2141, section 4, Article 23 says that we must provide them with the marketing and technical facilities of all of our harbours after 1st January, 1973, if we sign.  It is a directive which has the power of law if we sign.  Is that nothing? Though it is there as a directive, does it not exist?  Is that what the Parliamentary Secretary purports to say?  We have quoted the directive, the section and the article which says we have to provide them with facilities. So, the Parliamentary Secretary's interjection was wrong.  Perhaps he means we do not have to do anything special to facilitate them.  Of course not: we just have to give them treatment identical with that given to our own fishermen.  That is all.  This is word chopping or, perhaps, the Parliamentary Secretary did not know, and has never seen the two relevant fisheries directives one of which contains the undertaking I have quoted.  This is the level on which we are expected to function; this is the strategy of either lying or concealing the information and if there is anything further, either by lies or by concealment to say: &ldquo;But you have no choice; you must go in even though you may hate it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Revealing rather than concealing would indicate that we have a choice. There are strong hints here about how terrible it would be, how destructive for our fishery industry to be outside the Community.  To argue that in real terms, to which anybody would listen, not in bogus, propagandist terms, would involve talking about prices inside and outside, about restrictions by quota, about restrictions by tariff. None of this is done.  There are just hints of how terrible it would be.</P>
    <P>The Norwegian fishing industry is great, dynamic, sophisticated and employs economists doing detailed research on markets and possibilities and they do not believe, speaking as a fishing industry, that they must go in in order to survive; in fact they are convinced of the opposite.  The whole consensus of Norwegian fishing opinion is that they would be better off out than in.  The Icelandic fishing industry is much the most important industry <Col N="907" /> iceland possesses; in fact it is their whole economy and they agree with the Norwegians and not with us.  I shall not enter into a detailed discussion regarding prices, tariffs and quotas and the future evolution of policy which at present does not exist but which we would have to enter into if we were to argue seriously one way or the other: I am quoting against the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary the opinions of the Norwegian and Icelandic fishing industries.  Their opinions are especially well informed on a subject which to them is of vast importance.</P>

      <P>I move: That the Dáil do now adjourn.</P>
      <P>On Monday night on television and again on Tuesday in the Dáil I expressed the nation's grief at the happenings in Derry last Sunday.  I expressed sympathy with those who were bereaved, those who were injured and with the people of Derry generally.  I think it is true to say that grief and sympathy were hardly ever more sincerely felt, nor more widespread in this country, certainly not in my lifetime.  I also announced on Monday night that the Government had called for a special day of mourning and I appealed to everybody who could in any way contribute to, or facilitate, that mourning to do so.  I should like to express my appreciation of the manner in which those in positions of authority facilitated the day of mourning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to everybody to respond to these tragic events with dignity and with discipline.  There were demonstrations of sympathy in every part of the country.  People in their tens of thousands responded magnificently and they attended church services.  Indeed, it is true to say that the entire nation mourned.  What was important too, was that the vast majority marked yesterday in peaceful demonstration, a demonstration of their grief, of their sympathy and of <Col N="908" /> their solidarity with the people who were bereaved and with their friends and, in general, demonstrated their sympathy and solidarity with the deprived minority in the North of Ireland.  In this way they showed that in these difficult days there is a degree of unanimity and solidarity that was an example to the entire world and which gave encouragement and strength to the people in the North. For all this I commend all our people and congratulate them on the magnificent way they responded.  I thank them for their wonderful gesture of solidarity and unanimity.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, the situation had its dark spots.  In Dublin yesterday many thousands of our people representing the different organisations, the trade unions, State bodies, students and, indeed people from every walk of life showed their sorrow in a most disciplined way.  However, a small minority&mdash;men who, under the cloak of patriotism, seek to overthrow the institutions of this State&mdash;infiltrated what was necessarily a peaceful demonstration, infiltrated essentially peaceful groups and fomented violence. As we know the British Embassy has been destroyed but I want to say that the nation gains no credit from such an action.  It was the action of people who are dangerous, who, above all, are a danger to our freedom, our democracy and to our institutions of freedom and democracy.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately that incident was not the end of the matter and since then other danger signals have manifested themselves.  Groups proclaiming to be members of illegal organisations have gone around intimidating people and seeking to give the impression that these organisations are now to have a free hand here to do what they like by way of intimidation or destruction. At the outset of what I intend saying, I wish to reassure those of our people who, understandably, may be apprehensive or who may have become concerned at some of yesterday's events, that the institutions of this State will be upheld without fear or favour.  The laws will continue to be enforced and those who seek to usurp the functions of the Government will meet with no <Col N="909" /> toleration.  I reaffirm those fundamental principles here today and I ask every member of the community and every Member of the Dáil to support the Government stand on this.  The Government stand is the stand of the elected representatives of our people regardless of on which side of the House they sit and regardless of whether they are in this House or the other.  In the days immediately ahead there is no doubt that those to whom I have referred will seek to play on the sympathies and on the emotions of ordinary decent people so as to secure support for their own actions and objectives.  Many people in other countries&mdash;indeed throughout the world&mdash;are watching our reaction to the recent tragic events.  The present situation is a test of our maturity as a nation.  We must show the world that, with dignity and restraint, we can express our grief and our support for the minority in the North without, at the same time, playing into the hands of those who would destroy our own fundamental institutions.  Therefore, I ask all men and women of goodwill and of responsibility and especially those in positions of influence and, perhaps, those who are engaged in the communications media, to be on their guard against the kind of danger to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>This debate, perhaps, has been precipitated by the tragic events of last Sunday.  Before the Government took action on Monday, we had received reports from sources that we believe to be absolutely reliable and since then we have been able to check these reports against more reports and especially against reports made by people who were eye-witnesses of these events, people who were actually on the spot.  In this respect I would like to refer to the claim by the commanding officer of the British Forces in Derry last Sunday that 200 rounds were fired at his troops as well as nail bombs and other missiles.  So far as I know and so far has been stated publicly, not one of these troops was injured either by bullets or nail bombs.  They may have sustained minor injuries in scuffles but there were no casualties as a result of these alleged shootings and the throwing of bombs.  The same officer claimed <Col N="910" /> that shots had come from flats, that there were snipers on the roofs of these flats which, I understand, were high rise flats in the immediate vicinity, but the stark fact remains that all those who were killed or injured were people on the ground and people who were about to attend, and some of whom had already attended, a public meeting which had begun already.  Therefore, to that extent, what these people were doing then was not illegal according to the decrees of the Stormont Government. The march was banned.  Therefore, one presumes that under their laws it was illegal to take part in the march but it had concluded at the time the paratroopers fired on these people attending the meeting who, at that stage, were about their lawful business and demonstrating in a lawful way even by Stormont's standards.</P>
    <P>As I have said, reports that we received were confirmed by other independent sources and I would direct the attention of Members to the statement of an Italian journalist who must be regarded as being completely impartial and who, so far as I know, said that no shot was fired from the crowds that were demonstrating before the British paratroopers opened fire.  I would direct the attention of the House also to a statement made by a very prominent journalist of a very prominent British newspaper who said that he was there all the time, that he thought he heard one shot that might have come from the direction of where the meeting was being convened.  He wrote in his notebook &ldquo;sniper&rdquo; after which he put a question mark.  This gentleman has said that that was the only shot he heard before the paratroopers fired and, obviously, by his own admission and by the record in his notebook, he was not convinced that the shot had come from the direction of the demonstration.  It was on these facts that the Government took their decision on Monday to withdraw the Ambassador from London, to instruct our diplomats abroad to inform the Governments to which they were accredited of the facts of the situation as we had got them.</P>
    <P>I also put forward the three proposals with which the House is familiar.  I should like to repeat them <Col N="911" /> because I believe they are essential if any move forward is to be made. First, the immediate withdrawal of British troops from Derry and other areas in the North of Ireland where there is a high concentration of Catholic homes and the cessation of the harassment of the minority population. I believe that it was because of raids and repressive measures by the British troops in these areas that much of the violence that since has come about in the North of Ireland was caused.  In speaking about harassment, I intended to cover the cratering of Border roads, which, I am convinced now more than ever I was, have no military effect or benefit whatever.  It was done, as a result of repeated statements by a junior Minister in Stormont, to appease him, in the first instance, and to embarrass us in the second.  Not only has it done both&mdash;it obviously has appeased the one and embarrassed the other&mdash;but it has incensed decent people on both sides of the Border against this type of activity, and has not prevented one person who had evil intent from crossing the Border.  Therefore, not only was that kind of action undertaken for the reasons I said but it is militarily futile.  The other two proposals I made were the end of internment without trial and a declaration of Britain's intention to achieve the final settlement of the Irish question and the convocation of a conference for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I recognise that some of these proposals may not be immediately possible.  I am certain that the withdrawal of the troops from the areas I mentioned is immediately possible and would be a first step towards the restoration of peace and the elimination of violence in the North.  The second, too, the end of internment without trial, obviously will take some time because if those who are interned are brought to trial a suitable tribunal will have to be established. When I mentioned, having spoken to Mr. Harold Wilson on last Monday week, that I thought it might be possible to find a formula to induce the Nationalists and the SDLP <Col N="912" /> Members of Stormont into talks, and that this might be one of the ways.  I want to say clearly that I was in no way dictating to these minority leaders as to what their attitude should be.</P>
    <P>However, since the events which gave rise to these proposals resulted from a demonstration to establish civil rights, I would add one other proposal which I think would also be very quickly implemented.  As Deputies are aware, especially Deputies who are delegates to the Council of Europe, some time ago the Council of Europe Assembly made a recommendation to the Committee of Ministers:</P>
    <P>(1)  To instruct the Committee of Experts on Human Rights to draft an additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights which would secure the equal treatment of persons in the enforcement of the law and prohibit discrimination in the exercise of the following rights:</P>
    <P>(i)  the right to participate with equal voting rights in national and local elections based on the fair delineation of electoral boundaries;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the right of access to employment, particularly in central and local government services, in State and semi-State companies and public bodies financed wholly or partly out of central or local government funds and in private industries partly financed or sub-sidised by State or local bodies;</P>
    <P>(iii)  the right to the equitable allocation of dwellings and of resources required to provide dwellings wholly or partly financed out of public funds;</P>
    <P>(iv)  the right of access to the public service.</P>
    <P>The Assembly in their wisdom thought it necessary to add these to the Convention on Human Rights.  I would now suggest to the British Government that they could amend their Northern Ireland legislation, which they have authority and power to amend, that is, the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 or the 1949 Act, to include these <Col N="913" /> specific principles, so that, instead of depending on the goodwill, the declaration, or whims, as the case may be of an administration in which people have lost all confidence, these people would legally enjoy those rights, and enforce such rights if they were not accorded to them.  This, I suggest, could be done by simple amendment and done very quickly.</P>
    <P>May I say in reference to demonstrations that I hope it will be possible to hold next Sunday's demonstration in a way that will not provoke the kind of action that we saw last Sunday in Derry, that it will not provoke the deliberate shooting down of innocent people by paratroopers.  It may be that such a demonstration could be held within the law and equally effectively. That is not a matter for me to decide, but it is a consideration I would urge on those who are responsible and who rightly want to demonstrate to achieve those rights.  It is known by now that I had a visit from the British Ambassador and this is one of the questions we discussed.  It is not for me to say what passed between us.  We also discussed the burning of the Embassy and I reiterated the Government's regret and our intention, as is the practice, to provide full compensation.  He did not indicate to me whether there was any response so far to the proposals that I put to the British Government last Monday.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the suggestion that the Leaders of the three parties should go to London, which Deputy Cosgrave raised in the House here on Tuesday.  I had intended to discuss this matter with Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish, but unfortunately the changed Order of Business and the visit of the British Ambassador precluded me from doing so.  However, I hope to discuss it with them later.  We, as political parties representing the people here, have publicly stated our unanimity and our solidarity and I would say we have the support of the vast majority of the people in our approach to this question.  It may be that such a visit would endorse this solidarity, that as Deputy Cosgrave said, the meeting may do good but not do harm.  I should like to consider this very carefully <Col N="914" /> before I would make any comment on such a visit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not before I discuss the matter with Deputy Corish and Deputy Cosgrave.  There is more we can do in this present situation.  As I said, we are all solid and united in our approach to this problem.  We are committed to a peaceful solution of the Northern Ireland situation.  In talking of the future of Ireland, it is impossible not to reflect also on present policies being pursued in the North. Those lie at the heart of any discussions that we may have here amongst ourselves or otherwise.</P>
      <P>The attempt to reimpose traditional Unionism, whose vision is narrow and self-defeating, will certainly end in total failure.  I have no doubt about this.  The political leadership of the non-Unionist community in the North have no doubt about it.  Indeed, no objective observer&mdash;even though he might be British&mdash;European, American, or otherwise, doubts that this cannot happen either.  It would be fair to say, in fact, that the published comments of most journalists, and the private views expressed to me and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by most political leaders in other countries, are insistent that the policy of return to monopoly Unionist Government is now impossible.</P>
      <P>The State itself was founded for the purpose of ensuring the ascendancy of one community there at the expense of another.  I do not know of any other State&mdash;until the Eastern European countries were established after the last war&mdash;which was deliberately founded on the basis of keeping in power permanently one section of the population. I do not know either of any State which is less representative of the true meaning of Protestantism than the Northern State.  The right to freedom of conscience was a fundamental of the Reformation.  The practices of Government in Northern Ireland are certainly not in accord with these principles of Protestantism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know from many contacts I have <Col N="915" /> that a great many Protestants in Northern Ireland seek peace and justice as much as their Catholic neighbours do.  I also know that many of them have come to the belief that, within the limits of the Northern State, it is not possible to find peace with justice and that their minds, therefore, are turning in the direction of Irish unity.  I should like to assure these people publicly, as I have done privately, that the unity which we seek is one which will be determined to find room for their talents as well as their sensibilities.</P>
    <P>They owe it to themselves as much as they owe it to their neighbours to state how they would wish the institutions of Ireland to be formed.  They will be their institutions as much as anyone else's.  It is right that they should have a say in how they should be formed.  If we are expecting moves or sacrifices from the Unionist majority in the North we, too, will have to face up to some change from our present stance and policy.  In turning away from a failed system of government which was unworthy of them, if they do so, they will free themselves to undertake a task which is worthy of them, that of discovering out of the chaos of the present time the way forward to an Ireland which has been theirs for centuries and will be theirs again, as well as ours.</P>
    <P>In addressing them publicly in this manner I am asking them to share in and to play an essential part in determining what Ireland should be.  I have said harsh things about Unionism in so far as it has manifested itself in misgovernment in the North.  It has never been my purpose to show hostility to Unionists, nor have I ever had any such feelings.  To me the distinction is a vital one.  Unionists are Irishmen who, to my mind, took the wrong course when the Irish nation insisted that Ireland should take charge of her own affairs.  A moment of choice has come around again and Unionists can recapture their place in Ireland or continue down a road which will leave them without identity, without influence, and without happiness.</P>
    <P>There are movements in Unionist <Col N="916" /> circles which encourage me to believe that the right choice is on the brink of actuality.  Certainly many Unionists &mdash;perhaps most Unionists&mdash;are prepared to support a non-sectarian State in the North.  Many have the courage to advocate this despite the pressures exercised on them within their own society.  In doing this they represent and speak for people Ireland needs in order to set in train Ireland's fulfilment. I would put a question to them: If the North should become a State capable of embracing the two communities there, in what essential manner could this context not properly be applied to the whole of Ireland?</P>
    <P>It may be said in reply that the whole country is incapable of the resolution of problems in a manner satisfactory to the Northern majority for economic, social and other reasons. Laying aside the selfishness involved in a decision to keep a country divided for economic reasons, I consider that it can be truly argued that a united Ireland would not adversely affect the economic well-being of the North.  In recent decades our economic development has been substantial, so much so, that far from being afraid of entering into the European Community&mdash;which among other things is a vast free trade area&mdash;we look forward to it confident of the acceleration of our economic expansion.</P>
    <P>So far as social reasons go, Irish unity implies and, indeed, insists on a state of affairs equally satisfactory to the basic beliefs of all sections of the whole community.  The North has nothing to lose from that.  Therefore I would urge those thinking in the terms I have outlined to take the further step towards agreeing that their intention should be enlarged from trying to find a solution within Northern Ireland to one in which they will acknowledge that the proper goal is to find a solution for Ireland as a whole, agreeable to the Irish people as a whole.</P>
    <P>I realise that I am limited to half an hour so I will just conclude.  I want to refer again to the march next Sunday in Newry.  I said that I hoped it would not provoke the same kind of reaction <Col N="917" /> as the Derry march did.  I also want to say that I hope it will not provide any cloak or alleged excuse for the British Army to behave again as they did in Derry last Sunday.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say again to our own people: let not present emotion, absolutely justified and justifiable, turn them away from what the overwhelming majority of the people know to be the only way towards unity.  Above all, let not people who wish to exploit that emotion turn them away from what the great majority of our people seek, that is, the peaceful reunification of our country, the maintenance of our institutions, and the maintenance of our democratic institutions above all, so that all Irishmen, North and South, can enjoy living in economic well-being and happiness in a united Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us who still enjoy the gift of life carry a very heavy responsibility to ensure that the deaths of 13 Irishmen in Derry last Sunday and the grief of their relatives are not in vain.  Those of us who still live must also, as we endeavour to recover from the shock of last Sunday's cruel events, recall that more than 260 people have died as a result of the insane use of force by man against man to achieve political objectives in the North of Ireland in the last three years.  Those of us who come from the same national strain, who share the same views as those of the victims of Derry, must not in our sense of anger and frustration forget that there are on this island people who do not share, for the time being, totally in our outlook and we must have some thought for those who live in fear and dread of the threats of revenge and reprisal that were uttered by Irishmen in the last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to categorise the happenings in Derry as anything but vindictive force criminally and selectively directed against a harassed and infuriated minority.  When to that terrible injury which was inflicted you have the appalling and disgraceful untruths, to which the Taoiseach has referred, we feel thoroughly sick that there exists in this island such a deplorable situation.  As people understandably <Col N="918" /> vent their anger on the instruments of the wrong decisions which have been taken over the last few years, let us realise that the decisions to have the troops where they are, acting in the way that they are behaving, are the decisions of political persons like ourselves.  Let us realise that if we make decisions and if we make literal utterances they may have consequences.  Quite clearly, accepting the terrible realisation that all that involves, we must now bend all our energies on the political front so as to bring about a political transformation in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>As we know the first step towards that political transformation is the next to impossible need to convert Mr. Edward Heath and his Government from the suicidal policies which they are pursuing.  At best it can be said in defence of the present British Government that they do not know what they are doing, that they are incapable of understanding the problem, that they are no better and no worse than other British leaders that have gone before them.  One would have thought that after centuries of oppression and coercion in Ireland, oppression and coercion which failed, a British Government in the latter half of the 20th century would realise that coercion would not succeed now any more than it did in the past.</P>
    <P>Some people are saying that after Derry things can never be the same again.  I do not think that is entirely right.  Certainly many things will not be the same again.  After the terrible events of last week we see no change in the attitude of the British Government, no change in the utterances and attitudes of the British Army who are executing the policy for the British Government, no change in the hearts, minds and dispositions of the die-hard Unionists, who do a gross disservice to the Protestant majority in the North of Ireland because they alone are responsible for the misery which is shared by both communities in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must all have recoiled at the utterances of one Unionist MP whose only remark after Sunday was to utter congratulations to the British Army <Col N="919" /> on their marksmanship.  That indicated a dreadful state of mind; that the only good Catholic was a dead one.  Nobody who is a Catholic in this country would consider for a moment or lead anybody else to believe that a good Unionist or a good Protestant is a dead one.  If the dreadful happenings of last Sunday shatter some of the evil mythology under which our people have lived for so long then some good will come out of the evil.</P>
    <P>We agree with the Government that in the face of the seeming intransigence of the present British Government we must resort to international action to win the support of friends of justice everywhere to the need to move in a correct direction to achieve peace and justice in the North of Ireland.  We note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is at present in America, having visited the United Nations.  We consider that it is proper that he should make these visits but we should also like to see, as a matter of urgency on the Government side, moves to advise our European neighbours of the position in the North of Ireland.  It is quite clear that Britain now would dread any worsening of her reputation in Europe.  She is most anxious to get into the European Community. She is anxious to maintain friendships there.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have had the privilege of recently being representatives of Ireland in the Council of Europe are aware of the immense concern which exists in Europe about the situation in the North of Ireland and we are also deeply conscious of the fact that most Europeans are not at all happy about the manner in which the British Government are dealing with the situation.  We need now to bring more pressure to bear on our friends in Europe so that they will take the necessary initiatives to win the British Government away from the course of action which they are pursuing.</P>
    <P>We accept and understand that the EEC is primarily a commercial and economic organisation but it is one that has serious and sound legitimate political objectives.  It is not an organisation which can accept readily into its midst a country which is pursuing <Col N="920" /> the repressive and deadly actions which the British Government are pursuing in the North of Ireland.  Within the European Community you have for instance France, which is well aware of the inevitable evil consequences flowing from repressive measures and from depending on military solutions to achieve very difficult political ends.  France has had her Algeria; Belgium has had her Congo.  Most of the European nations are former colonial nations who are aware of all the difficulties which face big powers in endeavouring to deal with local difficulties.  There is in Europe an immense fund of goodwill and we should certainly endeavour to harness that goodwill in Ireland's interest as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of the fact that both the SDLP and the Nationalists have expressed their unwillingness to accept the proposed judicial inquiry to be established under Lord Chief Justice Widgery.  It is not for us to comment on the wisdom or otherwise of their actions, but we must accept that it is quite understandable in these difficult days that a purely British commission of inquiry will not be acceptable to the overwhelming majority of all Irish people.  The world has moved forward in the last half century from the time when national governments were presumed to have complete control over affairs within their own borders.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate enough to live in a world that accepts that human rights and individual freedoms transcend all domestic sovereignty, all individual loyalties.  This being so, we should forthwith bring international machinery to bear to ensure that we have an international inquiry into the occurrences in Derry.  What happened in Derry is in clear breach of Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights which guarantees the right to life.  That right is admittedly qualified within the Article by entitling a Government under law to punish certain offences by depriving a person of life and also entitling a Government to use violence, even though it may cause death, in case of riots or armed rebellions.</P>
    <P>These conditions did not exist in <Col N="921" /> Derry last Sunday nor can even the paratroopers succeed in convincing their own Government that they existed in Derry last Sunday.  We should not hesitate therefore forthwith to make this plain to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe for consideration by the European Commission of Human Rights.  It is regrettable that it took the Government from August until November to decide to take a complaint to the European Commission about the undisputed cases of brutality and ill-treatment of prisoners in detention centres in the course of interrogation.</P>
    <P>Do not let the same occur again.  It is quite clear on the facts, and the Taoiseach accepted this, that there was a clear breach of the European Convention of Human Rights in Derry last Sunday, and the way to get an international inquiry, without further hesitation, into the matter is to make a form of complaint in Strasbourg which will set the necessary machinery in motion.</P>
    <P>Speaking on Tuesday, Deputy Cosgrave on behalf of Fine Gael expressed our anxiety to present a united front in the face of this terrible national disaster.  He promised the cooperation of Fine Gael in the belief that the best interests of Ireland will be served by showing to the British Government and to the world that we are united in our sense of shock and horror at what occurred, and also in our resolution to ensure that as far as it lies within our power it will not occur again.  It would, however, be wrong for the Government to assume that Fine Gael can be depended on not to criticise the Government's actions.  Certainly the Government should not assume that we would be satisfied with any gimmicky contrivance at consultation or participation unless we are given some opportunity to influence the decisions which the Government want to make.</P>
    <P>As we say these things we do not for one moment detract from the right and authority, and indeed the duty, of the Government to make the necessary decisions and to have the necessary control over our affairs as far as lies in their power, but if there is to be a <Col N="922" /> united front, then there ought to be effective, worthwhile, genuine and sincere consultation.  This has not taken place to date, notwithstanding our repeated appeals in the past for consultation. We acknowledge that the Taoiseach spoke to Deputies Cosgrave and Corish this week.  In the past two or three years there may have been a measure of consultation immediately following some extraordinarily new development, some new emergency, but that is not adequate in this great national crisis in which the full cooperation of everybody is required.</P>
    <P>May I instance two examples of inadequate consultation in the face of serious developments?  I believe the Taoiseach saw Deputy Cosgrave and, I think, Deputy Corish on the eve of the day on which he sent off a telegram to Mr. Heath, that rather disastrous telegram which had farreaching consequences because it was a major change of attitude on the part of the Government.  When the Taoiseach had some difficulty in accepting that he should support the civil disobedience campaign, he suddenly changed his attitude and, without adequate consultation with the Opposition leaders, he sent off a telegram. Again this week we had the Taoiseach going on radio and again in the House making an announcement of serious import without any consultation with the Opposition as to whether it was the advisable course to adopt and, if it was being adopted, how the nation should go about doing it.  I refer to the announcement by the Taoiseach to seek in the near future Dáil approval to provide money for political and peaceful purposes to enable the minority in the North of Ireland to secure freedom from Unionist domination.</P>
    <P>That is a proposal which is certainly deserving of serious consideration, but it quite clearly would have been more helpful had such a matter been discussed with the Opposition parties before it was announced publicly.  We have had rather unfortunate consequences from the last time that this House voted money.  On that occasion it was for the relief of distress in Northern Ireland and the consequences, <Col N="923" /> we know, were unfortunate. The matter is at present being examined by a Committee of this House and therefore I do not want to say anything which might in any way presume to anticipate the report of that inquiry.  Suffice it to say that certain things happened which apparently should not have happened, giving cause for grave disquiet.</P>
    <P>Similarly, if money is now to be voted for the purpose which the Taoiseach mentioned, which is a deserving cause, it is essential that the necessary machinery to ensure the proper application of that money is agreed on and, to get the necessary agreement, there should be sincere and genuine consultation before any decisions are taken which cannot later be reversed.  Particularly the Opposition would want to ensure that there would be effective control over any money voted by this House for use outside its jurisdiction.  That control would necessarily have to involve representation on a committee for representatives of all parties in this House as well as representatives of all opinions and interests being assisted outside.  It is important that the credibility of recipients of money from this House should not be in question and unless there is that kind of consultation, which we hope the Taoiseach will now give, there is a real danger that greater difficulties may arise in the future.</P>
    <P>There is also quite clearly a need to have continuing consultation on the question of internal security.  When I speak of internal security I do not wish that any words of mine would be used mischievously by British or Unionist spokesmen to suggest that the cause of the violence and unrest in the North of Ireland is an attack on the North of Ireland based south of the Border.  They know that is not so but, as the Taoiseach quite correctly has said, mischievously there have been certain people in the governing Unionist Party and indeed in the British Conservative Party who want to suggest it.  It may be of interest to some Members here to know that so poisoned are the minds of some British <Col N="924" /> Conservative MPs that one of them accused the Irish people of being responsible for the throwing of ink at Mr. Heath at the EEC signing ceremony in Brussels.  Those words were uttered not in jest but in the serious belief by the man who uttered them that a Swedish girl living in Germany who had some opinion about some property movement in London was inspired by all the rebels in the South of Ireland.  It is an interesting incident because it reflects the state of mind of so many members of the British Conservative Party on whom Mr. Heath relies for support.</P>
    <P>I saw today a statement by Mr. John Taylor, one of the junior Ministers in the Unionist administration and one of the greatest mischief makers there, that he hoped the South of Ireland would take all security measures necessary to ensure that there would be no movement of the IRA from the South into Newry next Saturday.  That sounds rather extraordinary when within the last 24 hours I was in Derry and we found that there were virtually no security measures taken by the British Government, by the armed forces, who could be present in mighty numbers to slaughter people who were unarmed. Even the most rudimentary precautions were not taken by them yesterday and, indeed, as anybody in this House who crosses the Border regularly knows, more often than not they are not taken at all.  At the very time when those people who pretend to want to maintain control over security are not taking the steps necessary to secure their own territory they have the audacity to suggest that repressive measures should be taken in the South so that we could have in the South the evil that they, with their own criminal policies, have created in the North.</P>
    <P>Let there be no doubt in anybody's mind but that the maintenance of peace and the rule of law in the Republic of Ireland is the greatest single contribution which can be made to the return of peace in the North of Ireland and to the creation of a just solution to the divisions which at present beset our people.  Here, Sir, we are unhappy about the Government's action in this field.  We feel that the <Col N="925" /> Government have at last woken up to the terrible pit into which they have let the nation slip because of their lack of real discipline in the matter of internal security.</P>
    <P>The events of the last 48 hours, where a building of the British Embassy was destroyed, may perhaps have satisfied many of the feelings of frustration and anger and bitterness which were in the hearts of many of our people but we must look at what the lesson really is.  The lesson is that anarchists in our midst, those who in their own words are out to destroy the institutions of this State and of all Ireland, those who want to thrive on chaos, now know that if they get a sufficient number of unarmed civilians behind them, physically present, whether they agree with them or not, they can do untold damage.  I think it would have been perfectly reasonable for the Government to have anticipated what might have occurred, to have anticipated it by having the necessary physical barricades there to ensure that these anarchists and evil-doers would not have got within striking distance of the Embassy.  That simple precaution was not taken.  There was a clear obligation on the Government to take it not only to protect the building but also to protect our gardaí from the kind of attacks to which they were subjected.</P>

      <P>Those of us who first observed this incident on the earlier television broadcast yesterday were rather distressed that the building could be approached by people apparently in the presence of gardaí who did nothing to stop them but we saw later, of course, that the reason was that the gardaí were hopelessly outnumbered and that indeed had they endeavoured personally to intervene at the point at which developments had reached crisis proportions then there would possibly have been more serious injury to property and certainly most grievous injury, if not death, to persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This must not be allowed happen again.  The Government, if they want <Col N="926" /> to remain in government, must show they are a Government and they must govern in accordance with the wish of the people and that is that persons and property in this State be protected effectively.  That requires sensible anticipation on the part of the Government. If they have not got the funds necessary or the personnel necessary to do it let them come into this House and they will get it from the representatives of the people because the greatest contribution we can make to the return of sanity to this island is to keep this part over which we have control peaceful.  It is only by showing an example to the rest of Ireland, to Britain and to the world, that we can get the necessary support here and abroad for the sensible policy which we would want to see this country pursue.  I did say in the natural reaction to the appalling tragedies of last week we have perhaps given insufficient thought to the views of 1,000,000 people in the North of Ireland who until now have been labelled as being opposed to Irish unity or not wishing to work with us.  I agree with the Taoiseach when he says that there are now larger numbers than ever in the North of Ireland who want to see an end to the system which brings this evil upon them time and time again and which they realise will inevitably bring similar tragedies upon them unless something is done to change the system.  This is not an occasion to propose anything in any specific detail because ultimately the mode of the Government of the North of Ireland, or of all Ireland, will have to be decided with the voice of the people of the North of Ireland clearly heard and clearly understood.  I have suggested on other occasions and I again repeat &mdash;I think the events of last weekend underline the common sense of what I am saying&mdash;that the tragedies in the North arise out of the fact that you have there nearly 60 per cent of the people who profess loyalty to Britain although the loyalty of some of them is indeed very shallow because they have indicated from time to time that they are prepared to kick the British Crown into the Boyne rather than submit to direct rule from the sovereignty which they profess to respect.  Nearly <Col N="927" /> 40 per cent of the people, however, feel no attachment to the British sovereignty but do to the sovereignty of a Republic of Ireland.  Are these two desires incompatible?  I think they are not.  A way out can only be found in a solution which recognises the two loyalties, the two outlooks of these two communities, and such could be found in a condominium in which the sovereignty over the North of Ireland would be shared by both Britain and the Republic of Ireland.  Such would be an interim step which might restore peace then and at least would allow our people to begin to think about how they could live with one another.</P>
    <P>That, Sir, is what we must do and our emphasis now must be on the way to live with our fellow Irish men and women.  We must, as we have already in this House, say that arms are no answer and the message from the tragedy of last weekend is that the moral force of the unarmed mass is greater and more enduring than death inflicted by man upon man.</P>

      <P>I should like to join in offering sympathy to the relatives of not alone the 13 who were killed in Derry last Sunday but the 260 odd who have lost their lives since this tragic affair started at Burntollet over two years ago.  The tragedy is a great one.  When we remember that already this year 28 people have lost their lives needlessly in Northern Ireland it brings the matter home to us how desperately important it is to get a solution to the whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things which has rather surprised me in the two speeches we have heard this afternoon is that there did not seem to be that sense of urgency which I feel should be in what they were saying.  While I could not disagree with what they did say unfortunately I felt that it was just as if the matter has to be dealt with some time.  I believe it has got to be done now.  I believe the initiative must be taken and that tomorrow is too late.  Right from the time the tragedy was brought to a head on Sunday afternoon it became obvious to everybody that we could never go back, <Col N="928" /> that we would never again have the situation which we had at that time. While I agree that the Government have taken certain steps.  I believe they are not doing enough.  Having said that, let me point out that, as far as we, in the Labour Party, are concerned, we are giving one hundred per cent support to anything the Government do.  There are three major parties here who differ in certain matters of policy, but in this there is no difference.  This is the old battle of Ireland v. England and we will give every support we can to the Government, to Fine Gael and to anybody else inside or outside this House who wants to bring a peaceful solution to this problem.</P>
    <P>The unfortunate part of it all is that up until this week the Government were doing a &ldquo;soft line&rdquo; act with Britain.  I sometimes feel a little bit ashamed when I hear some of the comments made by Government spokesmen and learn of some of the approaches made to Britain.  Britain reciprocates as she always did with the old cliché of &ldquo;Croppy, lie down&rdquo;; this country, the poor relation, does not count; we are small people and we should not have the temerity to stand up, look Britain in the eye and tell her what we want.  Britain forgets, apparently, and will continue to forget until we bring it home to her, that this is our country, all 32 counties of it. This is not some place out in Africa or in South America where there is a difference over borders.  This is an island, 32 counties of Irish soil, and we are entitled to every square inch of it.</P>
    <P>When the Treaty was signed, nobody, not even those in favour of it, suggested for one moment that it was a final solution.  In fact, the British admitted it was a temporary solution, a stage, and from thence onwards we were eventually to have a 32-county country.  But Britain took every opportunity to get out of that subsequently and it is now our job to see to it that she is brought back to square one.  In my opinion we are not alone back to the 1921 situation but to the 1916 situation and, whether we like it or <Col N="929" /> not, Britain considers herself at war with this country.  I do not think we are exactly prepared to accept that situation or to allow it to continue any longer.</P>
    <P>It is only right at this stage that some fairly well-known facts, though they are not repeated often enough, should be put on the record.  The tragedy in Derry last Sunday was caused by a promise given by Mr. Faulkner, the Prime Minister of the puppet Six County State, to the Orange Order that, under no circumstances, would the march be allowed.  Following on that, instructions were given to the Army that, under no circumstances, was the parade to be allowed.  The difficulty appears to have arisen because when the parade was stopped, as it was stopped, and the marchers succeeded in persuading the 20,000 odd who were on this march that they should go back to Free Derry corner and have a meeting, as they were entitled to have a meeting even under the law in Northern Ireland, nobody told the British Army that it was not a parade and the gentlemen who were waiting in the background and who were to fire on the parade were apparently brought along and fired on the meeting.  It is as simple as that. These facts cannot be stated too often and Mr. Faulkner, who likes to smile on the television screen and tell the people how serious the situation is, should never be let forget that responsibility for the deaths of the 13 people in Derry and the injuries to the others rests on his shoulders first, last and all the time; he was responsible and he must carry the responsibility.</P>

      <P>We did not have to get into the Cabinet and spend other people's money to become rebels.  We were always rebels.  My people before me suffered for Ireland and I do not want any snide remarks now from anybody on the Fianna Fáil benches or anywhere else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position about the shooting in Derry last Sunday is that there is incontrovertible evidence that that shooting not alone took place by the hired assassins who went in there to fire at a <Col N="930" /> peaceful meeting but it took place, in fact, at short range and people were fired at not just once but several times. Even children were picked out and shot.  If what occurred in Derry last Sunday occurred in any English city, in Glasgow, or Liverpool, or London, or Swansea, what would have been the result?  We know quite well that Mr. Heath would be on his way to the Palace to hand in his resignation within two hours of the facts becoming known. Not alone did this carnage happen in Derry but they are now, in fact, prepared to say that it was done in the interest of peace-keeping.  The peace-keeping these people were there to do was not in fact carried out and those who committed these murders must be brought to justice.  There is no point in saying they were acting under orders. These assassins are in the very same position as the Black-and-Tans were because they were selected and brought to the Six Counties from Britain to commit this act.  In the last day or so I have seen a report that more of their kind will be coming in.  If they do then the situation will be very, very bad indeed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the day of mourning yesterday.  It was indeed heartening to see the way people all over the country went to church services and paraded to show their solidarity with the people in the beleaguered North.  It was heartening to see the thousands who marched and did exactly what they were supposed to do, demonstrate their solidarity with dignity.  It is regrettable, very regrettable, that a small section, a section who will march at any time and for anything and who are, apparently, well used to this sort of thing, should have taken it on themselves to blacken the good name of this country by their actions.  I am not talking about the destruction of the British Embassy.  As far as that is concerned it may not do Mr. Heath one bit of harm to give him a kick in the pants and show him we do not have that much respect for his Government here.  But it was unpardonable that public and private property should be damaged.  Worst of all, was the attacking of the gardaí, whose job it is to protect people and <Col N="931" /> property, and that applies even to those guilty of this blackguardism.  I would like to pay a tribute to the gardaí.  They do an excellent job.  It is too bad they should have been subjected to all the abuse they got over the last few nights.  I would appeal to the hundreds of thousands who went out to protest peacefully to show that they were not involved and do not want to be involved in this sort of thing.  It is too bad that the &ldquo;odd-bod&rdquo; should spoil the dignity of the silent parades.  I hope that, so long as there is need to parade over injustices, there will never again be a repetition of this sort of thing by people who are in the parades but are never of them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the leaders of the three major parties here travelling to the United Nations, to the Council of Europe or to visit Mr. Heath&mdash;whether or not that would be any use I do not know&mdash;it is a good thing to have discussions. As a trade union official it has been my experience that, no matter how bitter the dispute, it is eventually settled sitting around a table.  Even when it appeared two sides would not meet eventually they did meet and reached agreement no matter how bitter the discussion was beforehand. Nothing can be lost by having the facts put to all the important people to whom they can be put inside and outside the country.  It is important to remember that if the Taoiseach takes a leaf out of Mr. Mintoff's book he might possibly wake up Britain to the fact that she is not the only pebble on the beach.  I am sick and tired of people preaching, particularly in regard to the Common Market, that we must do what Britain does because she is our best customer.  This morning one of the British newspapers suggested Britain should take the strong action open to her to deal with Ireland.  Is it not fair to point out that we are Britain's best customer also and that we buy much more from her than she buys from us?  So, two can play at that game.  If Britain realised that there was somebody to replace her if she wished to try out an isolationist policy on this country she would perhaps be much easier to talk to.  I am glad of the <Col N="932" /> sterner line the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are taking with Britain.  This is the only way in which Ireland will get justice from Britain.</P>
    <P>The Newry march question has been mentioned.  I wonder if the incident we are now discussing will not be repeated again.  I am aware that Mr. Heath has appealed to Cardinal Conway and Cardinal Heenan to use their influence to have the march called off.  He says it would be an excuse for hooligans and would damage relations.  The Stormont Security Office says the march will be stopped and the Northern Civil Rights Association say the march will go on.  The one person who can stop the march is Mr. Heath.</P>

      <P>All he has to do is to say that he is prepared to give concessions, that he is prepared to talk at top level and in a meaningful way about the problem.  If he does, the march will not be necessary; but I believe the citizens of Northern Ireland have the right to march or demonstrate and if the death sentence is to be imposed on them again then I think the world will show Britain that she cannot carry on in this way.  After all it is 1972 and not the time when Britain with her big empire was able to slaughter what she called the natives in other countries to prove she was the strongest power and that what she said had to be obeyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned the Italian journalist or photographer who gave evidence about what happened in Derry on Sunday.  I suppose all of us have met people who were in Derry on Sunday and had their own version of what happened.  It is extraordinary that with the exception of the British Army representatives all the stories seem to be the same.  It is extraordinary that hundreds of people who have never met could have the same story of how it happened and that a small number of the British Army have a different story.  A few questions asked particularly of the major of the paratroops showed that the man was feebly lying.  The story <Col N="933" /> he told was not acceptable even to a BBC interviewer who spoke to him on Sunday evening after the tragedy, when he said that in fact only three shots had been fired.</P>
    <P>In the old time movies there was a character called Gabby Hayes who was always able to talk of all the Indians he killed with one arrow.  The paratroopers apparently with three shots killed 13 and injured 16 or 17 more.  Even more extraordinary, they were firing up at the flats where the snipers were alleged to be but shot people on the ground.  They should be taken back to Britain and given a course on the range.  If they are such bad shots I do not know what they will do if they ever come up against the real thing.  They were shooting, and they knew it, at unarmed people. When I hear some people talk about defending the Nationalist minority in the North with arms I feel it was rather a pity that a few of those defenders did not happen to be around at that time and perhaps the paratroopers would not have found such easy meat.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that there should be an inquiry and Britain has again produced the rabbit out of the hat.  Last year at the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Paris I made a speech, which was not very popular with some people and I believe with some members of the Government party, in which I said that the Commission then being set up consisting of three Englishmen would not be accepted by anybody in Ireland. It has never been accepted that we can take from Britain evidence collected by three Englishmen as being the truth.  When the report was made it turned out that we were right and that the British report was, as usual, a concocted affair.  At that time there were three men involved; we now have one and, as was pointed out by John Hume early this morning, surely they do not expect us to believe that that one man who was a former high officer in the British Army will bring in a report saying the British Army were in the wrong.</P>
    <P>There should be an international <Col N="934" /> commission set up to find out, as the Taoiseach said, whether human rights have been violated and if so the British Government and particularly Mr. Heath should stand trial.  He is responsible for anything that has been done in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>There has been talk about the necessity to prove to our Protestant neighbours in the North that they will be safe and will get the freedom they require in the Republic when a united Ireland comes, and I say when it comes deliberately because it must come.  We must all admit that there are some matters in our Constitution which need changing and arrangements must be made to have them changed but they are not so vital that they can hold up unification.  The story that all the Northern Protestants are afraid to come into the Republic in case they would not get fair play is a lot of hooey. The Protestants who are living in the Republic are living evidence that it is hooey.</P>
    <P>Many of these people say, and I think Mr. Paisley is the one who repeats it most often, that it is because of their loyalty to the Crown that they do not want to come in with us.  The only Crown to which these people had any loyalty is one which has now gone out of existence, the one they jingled in their pockets.  The only reason they want Britain to remain is that they want British money.  They have absolutely no loyalty to anybody except LSD.  Now that that has changed perhaps they could also change.  The time has come when we must attempt to get the Protestants in the North to realise that we have given them living proof in the Republic that there is equal freedom there for Protestants.  The Tánaiste now sitting in the Front Bench is one man who can give living proof of this as also can the Fine Gael Deputy from his constituency.  In a constituency like Monaghan we have two Protestant representatives out of three.  Yet they tell us: &ldquo;We would not get fair play if we went into the Republic.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No greater evidence can be produced to prove to them that the freedom which they say they want is here already. It is my belief that we are getting quite close to a solution to this <Col N="935" /> problem.  I do not say that because of reaction to what has happened in Derry but during the past six months in particular there has been an expression on the part of ordinary British people that the time has come for a change.  They are sick and tired of what is going on.  I think that if the matter were put to the British public now, there would be a very substantial majority in favour of freedom for all of Ireland.  This is the basis on which we must work.  It is very wrong for certain people to vent their spleen about events in Northern Ireland, against individual British people either here or elsewhere.  They must remember that the majority of the ordinary British people are in favour of the reunification of our country.  Those who take action against British people or British interests here who have been carrying on a fair trading relationship with this country for many years seem to forget the hundreds of thousands of Irish people who are working in Britain.  If they could encourage the Irish people working in Britain to use their not inconsiderable influence in persuading everybody they can contact in Britain of the justice of our case for a united Ireland, they would be doing a lot towards solving the problem. This petty hooliganism that has been carried out by a small number of people should be and must be stopped.  If we set ourselves towards doing that, there is a hope that we will reach a peaceful solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer, too, to something that has happened during the past few days.  The events of Derry seem to have wiped away everything else from the minds of the people and, in particular, from the minds of those in this House.  I refer to the incident which occurred at Narrow Water outside Dundalk when the British troops shelled a house in the Republic.  This was sheer audacity.  Imagine the British Army having the temerity to shell a house in what they call &ldquo;another country&rdquo;.  Imagine them being allowed by their officers to attack and burn property on this side of the Border. The British Government were not so <Col N="936" /> quick to notify the Irish Government that they would accept responsibility for the damage done as were our Government who did not wait until this morning but who last night assured the British Government that they were prepared to pay for any damage done to the British Embassy.  I suppose the niceties of inter-Government play ensure that the Government had to make that assurance but they could have waited until today to do so. Indeed, as they were doing so, they should have pointed out that property on this side of the Border was damaged by British mortar fire and that regardless of whether the condition of the house concerned was good or bad, our Government should have demanded compensation for it.</P>
    <P>Concerning the events in Derry, many of us are inclined to believe that the incident there was something that just happened because somebody became excited.  I believe that the British paratroopers who are trained for such work and who have many people in their particular trade who are paid to kill thirsted after blood and that once they started shooting they could not be stopped.  There was a report that before they opened fire, 200 rounds had been fired but it is evident now that no shots were fired at them until after they had killed the 13 people.  For some peculiar reason all arms in the area that were held by the other people seem to have been withdrawn for the purpose of allowing a peaceful parade to go through. With that in mind we must remember that if the British Army had not intervened at all and had stayed out of sight as they did on previous occasions, the Derry march and meeting could have passed without incident. Remembering this, we must make an appeal that the British Army be kept out of Newry on Sunday.  Unless Mr. Heath can offer something that will solve the problem and unless he will say that he is prepared for talks in settling the problem, the march will take place.  Like the portion of Derry where the event occurred last Sunday, the town of Newry is, in the main, a nationalist or, if you like, Catholic area and any <Col N="937" /> effort made there by the British troops to inflict the same sort of punishment on people who believe they have a God-given right to protest may not be dealt with in the same way as it was on the previous Sunday by the recipients of their missiles.  Therefore, I would conclude by saying that no matter what happens, people in this part of the country must keep their heads.  We are all grateful for the combined efforts in making a dignified protest yesterday.  We are glad that steps are now being taken by the Government to ensure that a stronger line will be taken with Britain rather than the one we had been taking so far of asking them whether they would consider this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>Although we are a small nation, our country is respected throughout the world and we should be able to enlist the help of those people who are important in world affairs.  We should prove to Britain that they cannot over-ride us simply because of the fact that they are Britain and that in the past they were great.  The British Empire is almost gone.  Britain has given freedom to areas all over the world which were held in thrall for centuries.  It is about time that she granted the same freedom to the portion of Northern Ireland that she holds still.  The British Army is welcome no longer in this country and they should get out.  Their going would bring a certain amount of peace in the area.  In addition.  Britain must make available the money that will be necessary to repair the damage she has done to this country during the past number of years.  That, also, is her moral responsibility.  When Deputy Corish is replying to the debate he will cover a number of other items with which I did not have time to deal.</P>

      <P>The sympathy of the entire country has gone out to the people of Derry who suffered such grievous injustice on Sunday last and the sympathy of the Government and of the other parties in the House has been conveyed personally to these people.  However, sympathy in itself is <Col N="938" /> not enough.  The relatives of those who were murdered need our help and we have a duty to help them in every way possible.  I refer to the help that we can give very effectively by ensuring that no person in Derry who is in need of help will be refused that help.</P>
      <P>There are many ways in which we can help.  First of all, the people of Derry need money, because in the much-vaunted British welfare State there are families in Derry who, as a result of the punitive action taken against them by the Six County regime, are living on as little as £3 a week because they will not bend to the whims of the Unionists and be good little citizens according to the Unionist rules.</P>
      <P>The people who protest here in the streets have a right to protest, but the protest should take the form of some definite help for the people in Derry, Belfast and the rest of the Six County area.  It is all very well to demonstrate in Merrion Square or to shout in other parts of the city, but the most effective protest against British injustice is to give help to the victims of that injustice until such time as we can end that injustice effectively.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and Deputy Tully referred to acts of blackguardism in the city last night.  I support their condemnation of the small minority who smashed windows not of British firms but of an Irish firm a quarter of a mile from this House whose founder played a big part in the fight for freedom. That was the thanks he got from some of these people last night.</P>

      <P>I am not in the least confused.  What I am saying is that the windows of one Irish firm were smashed last night for no apparent reason.  We remember that in the 1916 Proclamation Pearse, Clarke, Connolly and the rest appealed to people not to besmirch the cause of Irish freedom by looting and rapine.  In this House today we have to make the same appeal to the small minority who burned a motor car, smashed windows and so on.  I do not know how they think they are helping people in the North who are oppressed.  We saw enough burned motor cars in Derry yesterday, broken houses and, indeed, broken lives.  If we want to help in the North, our greatest need is for a disciplined approach to the problems which are caused by Partition, always remembering that it is not the British firms who are operating here who are our enemy.  As Deputy Tully said, many of these firms carry on a good business here and have been good employers.  The enemy and the cause of Partition is the British Government. The Tory Government today is as much to blame as were those who first formulated Partition.  Therefore let us direct all our efforts against Britain and its Government and try to bring some sense into their activities in 1972.</P>
      <P>The people of all classes and all creeds in this country are starting to question whether their approach to this problem has been right.  I speak as a moderate, as a person who does not like violence, but we have seen the violence in Derry yesterday and last Sunday.  There is continuing violence, and it may not always be shooting; there is the violence of denying basic rights to the minority in the North. We have tried to impress on the people of the world the terrible injustice. People may say that very little progress has been made in achieving peace and that things are getting worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one sees that 13 people were shot in Derry last Sunday for holding a march, that there are two or three concentration camps full of men, all because they exercise the right of free men to choose the form of democratic government they desire, one almost despairs of the British Government ever <Col N="940" /> listening to reason, and one asks what can we do here in this House to end this state of affairs.  We cannot go to war.  The use of force is so futile eventually, having regard to the fact that for the past 300 years, since the Plantation of Ulster, force has been used against the people in that part of the country and, indeed, in the whole country. Yet the people of Derry or Belfast or any other part of the country are not beaten.  If the British Government have done one thing it is to show that force is not a solution to this problem. We have impressed on the British Government again and again the need for some political initiative, and at times one sees a hope that in Britain they are thinking along these lines.  But the British Premier seems to be in the hands of the old die-hard Tories who will not give one inch to this country. I suppose we are very lucky that we have not got dark skins or they would really go to town altogether.  In the eyes of Britain it is wrong that the people in the North, who like ourselves, have not got dark skins, should have the hope of establishing a nation and a society to conform with their beliefs and their ideals, and in the eyes of Britain this is wrong and must be smashed.</P>
    <P>I have never accepted the suggestion that the situation in the North of Ireland was a matter of Catholic <i>versus</i> Protestant.  I have always seen it as a battle of the haves and the have nots.  We see the Unionist junta in the North wanting to hold on to the spoils of office.  They want to give out the jobs and the rewards to their camp followers. It must be remembered that the Protestant worker in the Shankill Road or Ballymacarrat or Fountain Street in Derry has no place in the Unionist aristocratic scheme of things, but they use them in a very cunning way in order to bolster up their own regime. The Protestant worker in the North has been so brainwashed by the Unionist that he has gone on supporting and voting for Unionist candidates. However, the Protestant worker is starting to think more for himself and I believe that soon we shall see the Protestant backlash, not the one to which Northern speakers refer but one that will come against the Unionist <Col N="941" /> regime in the North who for many, many years have used these men in the Queen's Island Shipyard and the linen mills and told them that should they ever dare to vote against a Unionist candidate or to enter a united Ireland, they would pay for it by being denied basic rights in the South, or in a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I wonder what rights have the Stormont Government ever given to the unemployed in the Six Counties or to the workers in general.  They have always had an unemployment rate of almost 7 per cent.  Some time ago the Rev. Paisley spoke about housing in the North and showed us how bad matters are there.  Of course the Faulkners and people like that do not live in these houses.  They are reserved for the people in the working areas, in the Shankill and other areas in Belfast and in areas in Derry.  It may be said that we are also short of houses, which is very true, and that we have got unemployment here, which is very true.</P>
    <P>On those very points we have an affinity with the Protestant workers in the North and a basis for building a society in which there will be no place for the Faulkners or the Unionist regime, a society in which each man, irrespective of his religion or his political beliefs, will have a place in the scheme of things.  We should direct our efforts not to speaking to Mr. Heath or Mr. Faulkner but to the ordinary people in the North.  We should show them what we have in common with them and we should assure them that, when they come in here, they will be treated as equals, not because they are Protestants or Catholics or anything else, but because they are Irishmen and this nation is for the Irish.</P>
    <P>When one goes to the North one feels very resentful at being stopped and searched in one's own country by British soldiers.  Of course the British soldiers are merely cogs in the British machine.  I am convinced that those soldiers who murdered 13 people last Sunday did not do so by accident.  I watched these men in the Bogside before.  When a march or a meeting took place the British Army came as far as Rossville Street or William Street and stayed there.  The people went into <Col N="942" /> the Bogside.  There might have been cheering and shouting and perhaps some stones thrown, but there were no killings.  Why was the pattern changed last Sunday?  On whose instructions was the order given to fire on these people?  The British Army said they were fired on first but that has been denied by many impartial people.</P>
    <P>On a BBC programme last Sunday an interviewer questioned the officer in command.  It was plain that the interviewer was a man with some human feelings.  He asked the officer how many shots the Army had fired and, when the officer said three, the interviewer said: &ldquo;I saw at least three bodies&rdquo;.  The point I am making is that I believe there are still millions of decent people in Britain who feel like the rest of us that each man should have his rights and should be guaranteed his rights. Our task is to try to get the British people to bring some sanity into the actions of their own Government.</P>
    <P>We must get help for the people in the North.  Our people down here who are living in comparative comfort do not appreciate what the people of Derry are suffering.  You may think that the barricades across the streets are ugly.  You may think that the barricades are made up of somebody's property.  Then you speak to the people and you realise that, if the barricades were not there, nobody would live in the Bogside or Creggan because the British soldiers, acting on the instructions of the British Government, would be in there night, noon and morning to persecute and, indeed, to kill the people living there.</P>
    <P>I know there are differences of opinion in this House on our approach to the North, but we all share the basic belief that something very definite must be done.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has gone to the United States to enlist whatever support he can get there.  Let me state this.  We expect something from the Americans, and especially the Irish Americans, in this dire hour in our history.  I want the most powerful nation in the world, the United States, to be our guarantor until democracy is restored in the Six Counties, until each man, irrespective of his beliefs or his creed, is as free as <Col N="943" /> any American, and until a Bill of Rights like the American Bill of Rights applies in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>While this festering sore continues in existence we cannot start to build a new Europe.  We cannot start to build a new Europe until justice and freedom are available to all people in the older Europe.  I heard Deputy Ryan, Deputy Aiken and the Minister for Justice speaking in Strasbourg last week.  They pointed out to the Council of Europe a few salient points about the situation here and in the North, particularly in the North.  I am glad to say that, when the three speakers had finished, we found that 90 per cent of the Council of Europe were very appreciative of the points made, and had a better understanding of the whole question.</P>
    <P>In the attacks made on us both publicly and privately by the British Tories we were made aware of their hatred of this country.  This was a revelation to me because never before had I seen a British Tory in such a state of anger. It did not frighten me but I had hoped that that type of thing had disappeared with the old British Tory Party.  That feeling is still there against this country. It reminded me of a very old bully who is dying.  In his death throes he can be vicious and cause damage.  I hope that I am witnessing the end of British imperialism.  We have often been given the credit for having started the fight against British imperialism.  It may be that we will have to wait for a few months or a year until we see the end of British imperialism.  Then the people in the North, Protestant and Catholic, will be able to unite and build the new Ireland which we seek.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that in the meantime the people of Derry are suffering grievously. To anyone who did not appreciate that, yesterday showed how deeply they are suffering.  Our freely elected Government must be in the vanguard in creating the new order in the North. In the country there are many divisions on what we should do.  In this very grievous hour for the country, North and South, we must look for and expect the support of all our people.  Pearse, Connolly, Clarke and MacDiarmada called for the support <Col N="944" /> of all our people, which they eventually received, when they set out in 1916 to throw off the British yoke.  We have a duty to the people in the North both Catholic and Protestant.  Our duty to the Catholic is to provide immediate help so that they will suffer less the torment and the persecution of the British.  Our second duty is to the Protestant from the Lagan to the Bann, to set out on a crusade to show these people that the Faulkner regime is just as much their enemy as it is ours, that Stormont must go before we can go on the onward march.</P>
    <P>We must convince the less well-off people of the Protestant community in the North that our only desire for a united Ireland is so that we can guarantee to each citizen of that new Ireland full rights and no persecution, that we will create a society in which we can guarantee employment, housing and an opportunity to the boys and girls who come from Protestant schools or Catholic schools the same opportunities here to better the society they live in and that they will have their rights guaranteed to them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully mentioned that there is a demand for changes in the Constitution. Perhaps there are changes needed but I do not think that they are at the moment any barrier to unity.  I believe that things are so dire in the Six Counties at the moment that even a Protestant in Belfast or Ballymena is not worried about our Constitution. He may be worried about getting a job or a house or he may wonder what future there is for his children in a country like ours at the moment.  It may well be that he would point to us and say that we have made mistakes.  I am sure we have but they were only mistakes.  We did not set up any deliberate policy to persecute anybody. We did not try to set the Protestants against the Protestants.  The mistake which we very often make is that we equate Protestantism with Unionism but there is little affinity between them. There is only the fact that the Unionist leaders who have had the benefits of wealth can get the message across much better than the lower-paid workers can.</P>
    <P>When we go to the North and talk to <Col N="945" /> those people, although they are not madly rushing into a united Ireland, we find that the business element and the middle-class people are those who are beginning to realise that the British promises may help them for a while, may ensure that the higher rank Unionist has a good job and a fair share of wealth but there is no guarantee for the future.  The Protestant workingman in the North who up to recently would never think of a united Ireland is beginning to think that way.  I suppose this is quite natural because I am sure there are many of them in the Shankill and other such places who are asking themselves what could be worse than what they have at the moment.</P>
    <P>When Britain accuse this Government of not controlling the Border, which they put there, we realise how ineffective their Army in the North is. It can be very effective if it is attacking unarmed people.  However, Derry last Sunday has shaken quite a number of people who up to this could see no good coming out of the Bogside.  I feel we should make more demands on Britain.  They cannot give back life to the people who were murdered last Sunday or to over 200 people who were previously murdered.  Surely Britain with their huge army and police force could have prevented a public-house being blown up and killing over a dozen people in the heart of Belfast. The British are in no position to point to the shortcomings of the Government or of the people here.</P>
    <P>I hope we may get a leader in Britain of the same calibre as the late General de Gaulle who may see the wisdom of effecting a settlement with this country as de Gaulle did in relation to the settlement between Algeria and France. There is a very broad analogy there and we should begin our preparation for the new Ireland.  One of the first things we should do is to total the amount of compensation which Britain must in all fairness pay us for both North and South.  Let Britain pay compensation and we can guarantee that the Northern people will enjoy, if that is the word, the same social services as they do at the moment until such time as we have a united 32-county Ireland and then we will draft our own social <Col N="946" /> order in a democratic way which will provide employment, housing and the right to pursue their own happiness for all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said earlier today that this debate has been precipitated by Sunday's happenings.  Perhaps to a degree this is so but I would remind the House&mdash;I do not do so merely to say that I was right&mdash;that I sought and asked for a debate here on the first day the House resumed after the Christmas recess.  The reason I did this was not to sound off but rather to warn the Government and through them we hoped to warn Britain that her new initiative in opening a further internment camp, a further concentration camp, which it properly should be described, at Magilligan in sight of County Donegal was not only wrong but was provocative.  This plea was not only not heard but was totally and completely ignored.</P>
      <P>Perhaps had we had such a discussion, perhaps had we taken some action as a result of such discussion we might not have had the Derry episode, the massacre and the murders that we have experienced only last week.  I say to the Government and I say to every Member of each of the parties in this House that if they think by what they have been saying in this House in the last few days about their new-found unity they are representing this House, then they can count me out and they can count hundreds of thousands of the people of this country out as well, because this new-found unity of purpose, this getting together of the three party hacks to do nothing about the situation, except by mutual consent to protect themselves in their own inactivity, is not representative of the people of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not let them get away from this.  I will express exactly what I feel on this occasion in the very short time available to me.  I will not be overcritical but I cannot help but say that there is no unity of minds in this House as expressed by the Leaders of the three parties here last Tuesday when we adjourned the House as a mark of respect for the deaths in Derry.  When <Col N="947" /> I say that, I am saying it on behalf of the people throughout this land who are not represented by those views no matter how well held and how well believed they are by the Leaders of the three parties.</P>
    <P>At this late stage can I appeal to the Leaders in this House to come alive and to come awake to the real situation that has been so evident to some of us for so long and about which I have given warnings time and time again since 1968, before there were any heads cracked, before there were any people shot and killed.  I want to remind the House of the facts now. Instead of cognisance being taken of what I was then reading into the situation, I was misrepresented to say the least of it; I was condemned and I was branded as a violent man because I was trying as best I could to read the circumstances, to read what was coming, to warn this House and our people of what was coming in order that we might take action to prevent it.</P>
    <P>In 1968 I indicated that the civil rights movement then emerging strongly, seeking reforms of the laws and the institutions of the Six Counties, was not enough, that the true civil rights was unity of this country and nothing short of it.  I was blackguarded in the House for saying it.  Twice in 1969 I was condemned roundly in this House; I was rapped over the knuckles time and again by my own Leader and the Leaders of the other parties, merely because I was reading the signs and conveying to this House what those signs indicated.  All my predictions have, unfortunately, come true.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the reforms. We have been given a list of the reforms. We had the B Specials stood down shortly to be replaced by the UDR which is the same wolf in another sheep's clothing.  The UDR were formed to take up the slack when the B Specials left off.  We had the British Army being welcomed in place of the B Specials and today we have them abhorred, properly so, by the whole minority population of the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="948" /> We have the IRA being condemned by many of the people who wished them into existence when there was nothing to stand between the minority and the hordes of the B Specials and the Orange mobs who were backing them up except the IRA.  The IRA have gained in numbers as the British Army have lost the respect they had when they arrived there first.  They have lost respect not because of anything that we do not know about but because of the fact that they became a partisan force very shortly after arriving, as any such force of the British Army must do because the brass who came in with them have Unionists as their associates and Orangemen of the junta that is acting as the Government in Stormont.  Therefore they must become flavoured, they must become coloured.  This is the only contract they have.  They did become coloured; they became the tools and the weapons of Mr. Brian Faulkner and his regime in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Where are the searches that were to be carried out to uproot and to weed out the arms that are held in their hundreds of thousands in the Six Counties by the Orangemen and by the extreme Unionists?  Where is Mr. Taylor, this warmonger if there ever was one?  I seldom criticise individuals in the Six Counties, whether in the Government or in Opposition, but this supreme warmonger of the Six County Government, where is he and what is he doing in his new-found office, with his 102,000 licensed arms in the Six Counties held mainly by his own supporters, by the so-called gun clubs which have sprung up like mushrooms in the past two years?  Where was Mr. Taylor when among those 102,000 licensed arms we know there are at least two and half score of heavy calibre machineguns which Mr. Taylor has licensed to civilians?  The reasons given for those licences is to protect the salmon fisheries by shooting otters. Are the otters all Catholics, are they all Nationalists?  Is this the purpose of these heavy calibre machineguns?  Let Mr. Taylor go and clean up his own nest before he starts telling us here what to do.  Mr. Taylor is a warmonger of the first order.</P>
    <P>There are those who condemn <Col N="949" /> Paisley and Craig and such people. Those men are men of conviction, whether you agree with them or not, and one of these days they are the people, and those whom they represent, whom we will have to deal with, but at least when dealing with men of conviction you know where you start and where you finish and you know that if you reach agreement you have an agreement.  But if you are dealing with fiddlers on the roof, such as Faulkner, Taylor and others, politicians in the lowest sense, merely holding on to the graft, holding on to the influence, holding on to the jobbery in order to perpetuate themselves, they are not people you can deal with because even having done a deal, as somebody said, having done a deal an honest man is alone, when he is bought he stays bought, but those boys do not stay bought.  They would have the same respect for us as they would for the British Government, and the same loyalty too.  Their loyalty is worth as much as the money they are getting from the British taxpayers, worth as much as the protection they get for their own nefarious deeds from the British Army.  They are the people we must beware of.  They are the people we should tell to clean up their own nest before they start talking about what we are doing or not doing.  Let Taylor call in his 102,000 licensed arms, his heavy calibre machineguns for shooting otter, and then let him come back and start talking about what is being done here.</P>
    <P>Let us leave that for the moment and go back to some of the other warnings I gave to the House and to the country. Let us recall the efforts I made by public speeches to try to get the three Governments of the Six Counties, Dublin and Westminister to sit down as far back as 1969 in order that the holocaust now being visited on the Six Counties could be avoided and that we would begin to find a way towards a solution and towards the unity of the country and ultimately of our people. Let us recall those.  I will not do so because they are there on record and the comments on them are on record and I hope those who are now convinced of the truth of what I then said <Col N="950" /> will at least continue to recognise that truth and to do something about it, to get down to the brass tacks of the situation today and not to confuse themselves and the country further by talking about a peaceful solution when the violence is being prepetrated by the British Army on behalf of the British Government and the Six County Government here and now.</P>
    <P>How can we have peaceful solutions unless we are advocating the complete clearance of every Nationalist and every Catholic from the Six Counties? Is that what we mean by peaceful means in these dire circumstances of extreme violence being perpetrated upon us?  Or are we to do what any red-blooded people would do, stand up and tell Mr. Heath and his Government that we seriously represent the voice of our people and that we are getting our Army put on full stand-to? We want our entire reserves to be called and we want the FCA, all 20,000 of them, called into full service.  We want the Army on the Border and we want Mr. Heath to be told by this House without question that we are not having any more of the Derry episodes of last Sunday.</P>
    <P>Surely to God it must come into the minds of the people here that we are only fiddling at the whole problem, that we are only trying to get ourselves out of our dilemma by talking about it and not acting seriously?  People will throw their hands up and say &ldquo;This would be war&rdquo;.  There is war in the Six Counties.  Mr. Maudling said it last August.  We who are associated closely with it know that there has been war there for the past two years, that there is war today and there will be war tomorrow and there will be more marchers and there will be more deaths.  That is why this debate was urgently needed today, not next week, in order that there might still be the opportunity of bringing home to the British Government, to Mr. Maudling, to Mr. Heath, that there will be more marches, that so long as there are nationalist-minded people in the Six Counties who have seen what has gone on over these last generations, who have tolerated and suffered under what they have endured in these past few <Col N="951" /> years, that they will march while there are any of them left to stand and that their laws prohibiting those marches are not going to be allowed to stick, that protest is not going to be allowed to be wiped out even by the bullet shooting down innocent people.</P>
    <P>Premeditated murder was the action of the British Army last Sunday and let there be no doubt about it.  Let them have their inquiry, let them have it international or all British, whatever way they like.  It does not matter a damn.  It was murder, murder in the first degree, premeditated, arranged, with their troops deployed, these boyos with the wine-coloured berets, these trained killers, these shock troops were brought in and deployed around the city from as early as 11 o'clock. They took over parts of the city, parts they were never in before.  They departed at half past three, did their dirty work and returned to the same points of deployment and stayed for a further two hours, from half past five to half past seven.  What doing?  Playing record players, playing their radios and singing bawdy songs.  They are the boyos who went out and butchered the people of Derry last Sunday.  We are asked then to have dignity, to have discipline, to have no emotions.  We have got to be emotional certainly if there is any feeling in us.  There is nothing wrong with being emotional.  Without emotion in a time like this we cannot reach the proper conclusions because these conclusions may be too terrifying for us to take in cold logic as we are advised to do.  Emotion plays a big part in matters such as these.  I am sorry, indeed, that all the Members of this House and many thousands more should not have been in Derry yesterday or the day before during their days of grief and mourning, to go and see and witness for themselves on the spot.  It is all very well from down here to talk about what should be done logically, what should be done unemotionally, what should be done disregarding what has already happened.  When you see those coffins laid out side by side, when you see the very men who have fought with bare hands carrying their own comrades out, to see those men yesterday with tears streaming down their cheeks, <Col N="952" /> to see the bereaved widow, to hear her, to find her trying to get into the grave beside her dead husband, to see the young widow following, hanging on to the coffin of her dead husband, and to hear above all the six year old in the church as the coffin of his father was being removed, calling for his daddy, and then we talk about no emotions.</P>
    <P>Surely we here as an Irish Government, not that long established, but with the proud tradition of being established on the memories and the blood of our dead patriots, surely we in this House after 50 years of control of our own destiny on this side of the Border, are not going to stand by and see more of the butchery and the murder done by these troops or any other troops to our people while we have any means at our disposal to deter such continuance and such happenings.  This is what you are being asked for today.  This is what your people whom you represent want you to do.  They want you to stand now, even if you did not stand before, to do what we said we would do in 1969, not to stand idly by.  Let us remember 1969, at the beginning of this terrible time our people have gone through. Let us recall it.  Let us recall how our Taoiseach then truly was representing the vast majority of the people of this country when he made his now famous speech in those dark days of August, 1969 and if we have strayed since then from that declared intention which I have no doubt was right then, has been right since and is truly right now, surely even though we have strayed we must at least learn from our experience, from our mistakes and have some regard for the real dilemma in which the British Government must find itself. There is Mr. Brian Faulkner and, despite what I have said of him before, I will say this for him: he is playing the Unionist game as well and as good and as truly as ever a Unionist in the Six Counties did in his position.</P>

      <P>We are not countering the game he is playing and he is being heard in London.  He is being believed. They are acting in London on his <Col N="953" /> advice because we seem to have been agreeing with him instead of countering him in every item and every iota everything he has been carrying to them.  If the British Government are to blame, as I believe they are to blame, completely for Sunday's massacre because that was what it was, murder premeditated by the forces of the Crown, then that Government can point a finger at this Government and say we are to blame considerably because we did not make them aware or combat Brian Faulkner's propaganda to the degree that we should in order to give them an opportunity of realising that there were two sides to this story and not just one.  Let us consider that not in any vindictiveness or spitefulness but rather as a hard reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and again I have said it outside&mdash;I am saying it again today&mdash;will we be at least fair to those people in Britain who do not know and do not care what happens to us here, who never have cared unless when they could use us to their own advantage? Let us at least try to get through to them by acting as any people should and would act in our circumstances by putting all we have got on the slate in the morning and saying, as I have said to Mr. Heath: &ldquo;You cannot do it again, you must not do it again and you must take your army out of this land of ours once and for all.&rdquo;  That we owe to the people of the Six Counties; that we owe to those who have died that we might freely talk here today. Let us consider that and try to act on it even yet.  It is not too late despite the fact that the number is now creeping towards 300 dead since this whole business started three years ago.  Let us also ask that the paratroops should be taken out now and that the appalling information that has been circulating last night that instead of this battalion going there is a hold-up in Hollywood Barracks and they are being joined by a second battalion of these Red Caps. Let us try to get to Mr. Heath before this madness is further perpetrated and he doubles the number of these murdering blackguards that have come in his name to this land of ours before it is too late.  Let us ask that they be taken <Col N="954" /> out even as a token immediately, before the week-end, before the next Civil Rights march that is going to take place without any doubt and that is going to have among its numbers as many from the South as from the North.</P>

      <P>Do not forget that our veneer has now been broken and if the British Embassy has been burned let me say that I shed no tears for it. Let me say this, and I do not say it in viciousness or bitterness to the British people or their Government, the Gardaí or the forces of peace in this country behaved in a manner that was exemplary in the circumstances when these places were being burned.  Because, what the hell could we do with 25,000 of our people screaming for some manner of ventilating their own frustration that we have been the cause of building up for the past two years? Would it not have been madness, would not our hospitals be full today, not only of our people but of our fine Garda force as well?  I do not know what was the motivation.  They are being accused of doing nothing.  By their action or inaction, I regard their behaviour the other night as the best example of wisdom that any Garda force has ever displayed in this or any other country in the circumstances that were facing them.  The cost of the embassy building being destroyed is a small price to pay as against what might have happened if there had been madness enough at the top of our police force to say, &ldquo;Go in and wall up those people&rdquo;.  It just cannot be done.</P>
      <P>The people in this country have, as I say, broken through the veneer, prompted by the murder and the bloodshed in Derry and there is no force in this land that could have stopped them.  Let there be no doubt about that.  Let us not run off conveying our sympathy to the British, although we may express our diplomatic regret.  Let us be realists in this matter, if on no other.  This is something that, in fact, ended cheaply for us in the burning of the British Embassy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="955" /> Let me say also that in so far as our Government's action is concerned in the past few days, it is a beginning but it is a very puny, insignificant beginning. Withdraw our Ambassador; take him home.  What do they care whether we take him home or not?  What difference does it make?  We still continue to operate over there and I am not advocating that we should not.  What is a gesture?  Whom are we trying to impress?  Certainly, if it is the British Government, who are the people in the key role here and the only people who can begin to bring an end to the trouble in this country, then, withdrawing our Ambassador for some weeks or some months will not make the slightest difference to them.  They only understand the obvious and that is what we have got to put on the line.  We should say to them that we are having no more of this and at the same time we should ask every person in the service of the Crown in the Six Counties who has any Irish blood in him to resign, and withdraw in protest immediately.  We should ask them to get out of the RUC, the UDR, the British Army, we should ask the titled people not only in the Six Counties but particularly in the South to renounce their titles.  Let us have away with their titles, decorations and medals much though they may be prized and much though they may have been merited by those who now wear them.  I say, &ldquo;If you are Irish, let it be seen at this time that you are Irish and do not wear the regalia of the Crown or of the Queen whose forces are butchering your own people in your own land at a time such as this in 1972.&rdquo;  Let us have from those people on this side of the Border a renunciation of their titles, a returning of their decorations and medals.  If they do not want to send them back, I would be quite happy to receive them and to do with them what should be done.  The same as the flag was symbolically burned the other night, we can burn those too.</P>
    <P>Let us get after the EEC countries whom we are about to join.  Do they mean anything?  Does that association mean anything?  Will it mean anything <Col N="956" /> in the future?  Now is an excellent time to find out.  Now that we are on the threshold of opting to go in, by the wishes of our own people, let us ask the help of the Six&mdash;and there are friends there; remember their protest yesterday as far away as Germany.  One of their citizens was killed when they were demonstrating against what is being done in Derry.  Then we down here are cavilling and half-crawling and apologising because of the fact that our people are beginning to show the spirit that left us the freedom we are enjoying here at this very moment. Let us ask the people on the Continent to use their very decided influence on Britain today.  Britain is also going into the Common Market.  She believes she must get in in order to survive.  Let the Six tell her that she has got to settle up and get out and take her baggage with her out of the Six Counties now.  If they do that, it will be more effective than all the other spiels we may give, no matter from what corner of the globe.</P>
    <P>We have sent our Minister for Foreign Affairs abroad to seek, as he said last night, help from anywhere he can get it.  That is a very laudable thing to do and a proper thing to do. We did it in 1969 but got very little return and will get less return now unless we are prepared to help ourselves. We must help ourselves by displaying to the world that we are prepared to risk what we have got here for the sake of our people in the Six Counties and that we are not afraid to risk it and that we are not concerning ourselves with holding on, to our own benefit and to the exclusion of the other citizens of this land who are divided from us by an unnatural boundary.  Let us put it on the line.  Let the world see that we are serious.  Let Mr. Heath see that we are serious.  It is my firm belief that we will then get action to begin to dismantle this Border that is the problem and the trouble and will continue to be so long as there are people up there and down here with any red Irish blood flowing in their veins.</P>
    <P>Negotiations are now being called for.  I have been calling for them for years.  I am glad that there is the suggestion <Col N="957" /> that negotiations should be set on foot immediately.  I am also glad that the amendment of the Ireland Act is being mentioned in this House because this Act is not relevant.  It is not relevant in my book because we are not going back in this country, either North or South, to where we have been for the last 50 years.  There is no going back.  Let us be quite clear about that and let us be clear that if our House here does not give the leadership the people are now demanding, then, unfortunately, there will be twenties of thousands in many parts of the country who, instead of being led by this House, will lead the House or change it to their way of thinking. Do not let us think that we have any particular right to be here other than to represent the people from whom we come.  We are not representing them and have not been representing them up to now.  Despite any manner in which we have tried to prevent them from seeing what is going on in this land, they are now seeing for themselves, thinking for themselves, and we had better get out in front and lead them instead of being pushed from behind and finally overwhelmed.  That is the one danger that is now evident to me on this side of the Border, that because of our own reluctance as a Government to lead, we will be led and we may be led in directions that none of us wants to go.  Let us remember that and try to do something about it.</P>
    <P>Above all, may I make a final plea, release the Republican prisoners on this side of the Border as a gesture to their dead comrades in the Six Counties. Let us have no more collaboration &mdash;and I say no more collaboration&mdash; with the police forces of the Six Counties or M15 or the legal system in London or elsewhere when any of these people are being charged.  We have no obligation in any way to collaborate with those people in these matters at this time.  Let us ask again immediately for the withdrawal of the paratroops as a gesture, as a beginning.  Let us ask our own Army to go to the Border, to be there in time of need and tell Mr. Heath why they are there.  Let there be no equivocation about it.  Let us call for the end of internment as a further gesture.  Let us, above all, make <Col N="958" /> up our minds that we cannot wish this sad, unfortunate thing away, as we have been trying to do.  Much as we may try for, and much as we would all like a peaceful solution&mdash;much as I am non-violent, despite what I say&mdash; I ask this House in their wisdom to realise and recognise what is in front of them, that they must lead or be overwhelmed.  If they give the right leadership, the Six Counties is ours now for the taking and the bringing back into the fold of all Irishmen, whether Protestant, Dissenter or Catholic does not matter to me.  As I have said elsewhere, I have more regard for my Protestant neighbours in the North than I have for many of my Catholic friends in the South.</P>

      <P>This debate has been precipitated by the tragedy in Derry last Sunday.  The whole nation was rightly shocked and deeply grieved by the enormity of that tragedy and by the savagery displayed by the British Army and the purpose of this debate now must be to examine what this nation can do towards ensuring that what led to that tragedy and to those savage incidents will never again recur in any part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I listened with attention, indeed, rapt attention, to Deputy Blaney.  His speech, because of its emotionalism, its conviction and its fire, deserves earnest and careful attention.  I listened to him, knowing that he represents a point of view which he claims himself has been badly misrepresented in the past.  I listened carefully to find out what his answer is to the problem of Northern Ireland and to the tragedy that occurred last Sunday.</P>
      <P>He commenced his speech by criticising and denigrating the new-found unity between the three parties here and by saying that &ldquo;Do nothing&rdquo; is the policy of these parties.  He went on then to indicate that he was speaking on behalf of those people who are not represented in this House.  I waited anxiously for him to spell out with conviction who those people are.</P>

      <P>He painted a sad and moving picture of the scene in Derry and of the tragedy inherent in the funerals there.  As he described it, it was a highly charged scene, and he gave indications of the high degree of emotionalism that prevailed.  In particular, he painted for us the harrowing loneliness of a six-year-old, not understanding what had happened, calling for his dead father.  What is Deputy Blaney's answer to the problem that confronts this country?  It is to call up our Army.</P>

      <P>A warmonger he called a politician from Northern Ireland.  I was appalled that the earlier part of his speech should be directed to inciting this country to a state of war, a war in which fellow-Irishmen will be killed, a civil war.  That solution by Deputy Blaney deserves to be condemned and condemned roundly.  The only problem that faces us, north and south, and faces Britain is how to effect a reconciliation between different types of Irishmen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the kernel of the problem.  One will not effect reconciliation by sending an army to the Border and making threatening noises. Surely Deputy Blaney is sufficiently realistic as a politician to know that we have not got the armed might to do the things he implies our Army should do.  Reconciliation is what we must aim at and I deprecate speeches that put the day of reconciliation further away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> We have then to consider how reconciliation can be effected.  While many of us have feelings of anger and frustration against Britain, and never so much as in the past few days, we have, nevertheless, in accordance with the tradition on which we pride ourselves and which is so often trotted out of being a Christian people, to ensure that the philosophy we practise as a nation will not be a pagan philosophy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, a death for a death, a father for a father and a brother for a brother.  We must use moral persuasion.  The strength of our moral case at the moment is immense.  We must use it as a united nation to impress on the rulers of Britain that their policies up to now have failed and, if they are pursued, they will continue to fail and will lead only to a greater bitterness and more deaths.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing, when considering the history of the troubles in the North, to think that the representations of this nation have carried so little weight in Westminister.  It is disappointing but it is not surprising because the status of the man making the representations has been diminished by the actions of erstwhile members of his Government, who have destroyed his strength as Taoiseach and who have left to represent us a man known in Britain to be the Leader of a party full of dissidents and to be hanging on to office in contravention of every code of constitutional conduct.  It is no wonder that the response from Westminister has been negative.  We can only hope that the welcome development in the past few days of a united Dáil sending the leaders of the Opposition and of the Government to London to impress on this intransigent Tory who heads the Westminister Government the urgent need for a change of direction in his policies will bear fruit, to impress on him that we here are willing to be reconciled with our brothers in the North, to impress on him that, in order to effect that reconciliation, he must, and he has the power to do it, indicate to the Unionist regime in Stormont that the policy of internment and repression must end and end instantly. Above all, he must cease the deliberately provocative policy of cratering <Col N="961" /> Border roads.  The British Army cannot be such fools as to imagine that that policy will be effective in stopping terrorists crossing, if they have a mind to do so; neither can one imagine that the wishes of John Taylor carry such influence in Westminister as to enable such a crazy policy to be continued.  I see that policy as deliberately implemented in order to provoke confrontations between the British Army on one side and the illegal armies on the other in such a glare of publicity and with such frequency that the Government here will be forced to take certain actions, actions they have been loath to take.  I believe this is the real and dangerous reason underlying the British policy of cratering Border roads.  I would hope that the message will get across to the corridors of power in Westminister that that policy is both crazy and dangerous.</P>
    <P>There is one other way in which we can put pressure on Westminister and, to my mind, Westminister is the key to the solution.  It is one of the parts of Deputy Blaney's speech with which I agree.  We should use all avenues open to us through our impending membership of the European Economic Community. It is ironic to think that the British Prime Minister only last week received a prize for his European statesmanship, a man who has two European nations at loggerheads with each other, a man who can send armed soldiers of his army to fire on citizens of his country.  If this ridiculous situation were highlighted in the European capitals and if Europeans were made fully and urgently aware of the danger to Europe of a continuance of the situation in Ireland, they would be able to exert pressure successfully which when added to pressure from a united Ireland, might achieve results.  I have no doubt it would hit at the vanity of that man, the Prime Minister of Britain, if he had to go to Europe as the man who led Britain into Europe and find himself taxed on all sides with his conduct of affairs in Ireland. That would be effective.  Such a policy should be pursued urgently through all channels available to us in Europe.  At last I think the message is getting out from this country of the intense anger and frustration which is growing <Col N="962" /> among the people here at British policy in the North and that on the other hand there is a danger that if the anger and frustration are not relieved by a solution to the Northern problem they may grow to a dangerous extent.</P>
    <P>It is our duty in this House not to say or do anything which might fan those flames of anger and frustration. My experience, moving among the ordinary people as Deputy Blaney has moved, is that there is no wish for physical revenge.  The Taoiseach's statement that while we cannot forget what happened in Derry we will, out of charity forgive it, is a statement that has impressed many people and I think represents the feeling of the vast majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>To achieve reconciliation there must be some positive signs and gestures by the parties to that reconciliation.  What signs and gestures we can seek or expect from Belfast are a matter for the regime there to show us.  It was disheartening, and there is no point in not mentioning it, that in Stormont, following the massacre in Derry, even liberal Unionists displayed a regrettable intransigence.  That was a regrettable development.  It should highlight for us the fact that those people are afraid and were frightened by the massive reaction to the Derry tragedy.  It should highlight the need for us to do something to reassure them so as to diminish or remove their fears.  From my contact with what I may call Protestant people though non-Unionists up there, I am satisfied that while the idea of unity is not altogether anathema it is some distance from being accepted by them.</P>
    <P>They have lived as a separate community for 50 years and in this age of fast development and rapid evolution half a century is the equivalent of, perhaps, a couple of centuries some hundreds of years ago.  One cannot dismantle overnight the sense of community, the sense of separateness they have gained for themselves over 50 years and which has been compounded by the attitude down here in that we have failed to engage in cross-Border activities with these people.  We have allowed the two parts of the country to drift apart and it should be no surprise <Col N="963" /> to us to have to acknowledge that there is another community up there and one to which I hope we could say: &ldquo;You may continue to be a distinct community but please no longer be a separate community as we all live in one small island.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In opening the debate the Taoiseach briefly adverted to the question of change down here so as to assist reconciliation. If we have virtue on our side to the extent we claim we should have a surplus and should be able to give some of our virtue and make a magnanimous gesture to the other side. I do not know what it could be but it is the duty of the Taoiseach as Leader of the nation in consultation with his experts to devise some magnanimous gesture of reconciliation.  I have no doubt the House, and through it, the people, would accept that.  It is the duty of leadership not just to indicate, as he said, that there should be a change of stance and policy down here, but that is not enough.  He must spell out the details of the change.</P>
    <P>One small example which came to my notice very forcibly in the last few days of how our stance down here is wrong if we want to achieve unity is this: a townsman of mine who served for over 30 years in the Army was born in Omagh, received primary and some technical education there but never learned Irish.  On retiring from the Army he was invited to apply for a Civil Service post.  He was found suitable but because he did not know Irish he has been informed that he cannot be recruited as an established officer. Yet, we are saying to the people in the North: &ldquo;Come in; things will be just as good here as they are with yourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may be only a small matter but it is one of those things that can lead to powerful propaganda to influence doubting Thomases in the North who are afraid of the Republic. It is one area in which a gesture of reconciliation could be made.  It will call for courage on the part of the Taoiseach to make this gesture because he will have at the back of his mind the so-called Republican backlash.  But if Republicanism means, as those who profess to practise it so unctuously tell <Col N="964" /> us, uniting all religions under one flag and if his motive is to achieve that end he need not fear the speeches of demagogues.</P>
    <P>I look to the Taoiseach as the nation's Leader to make such a gesture or series of gestures as a matter of urgency to show the Northern community that there is a place for them in a united Ireland.  It would ease his position in making representations to the British Government to do their part and would ease their task also.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that we had to have this debate following such horrifying events in Derry last Sunday.  It was proper and right to have a day of mourning yesterday throughout the land.  It is proper and right that we should lobby throughout the nations of the world to bring home to them the injustice perpetrated in this country, but above all, we must not take it on ourselves to take revenge.  We must be extremely careful not to indulge in a philosophy or a course of action which will put back further the day of reconciliation because the day of reconciliation is the day of real unity.  I disagree totally with Deputy Blaney when he says that the task is that of uniting our country and, ultimately, our people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It could not be done in that order.  The ideal is to do it simultaneously but I do not think that is possible.  Consequently, the aim must be to unite first our people and, then, a united country will follow.  We cannot achieve a united people if, in this part of Ireland, the doctrine being preached is one of revenge and reprisal. We may sorrow and we are entitled to a justifiable anger but we must never allow our emotions to spill over into physical revenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that this House should not give way to an emotionalism or to any philosophy that could lead to such a course of action and one would hope that the incidents of the past couple of days which are understandable and explicable will not be repeated.  The message must go clearly from this House, as enunciated by Deputy Ryan, that the preservation of the rule of law and the preservation of public order in this part of the country <Col N="965" /> are an essential precondition towards unity.  It is important that this House should reject absolutely and unequivocally the use of force.  Deputy Blaney, in the course of winding-up his speech, made a further reference to our armed forces along the Border.  His words were &ldquo;to be there in time of need and let there be no equivocation about it&rdquo;.  These were equivocable words&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in a statement that pleaded for plain speaking.  There is no half-way house between peace and war.  There is no half-way house between a peaceful settlement and an imposed settlement of the Northern situation.  It cannot be said too often that an imposed settlement is no settlement. I am glad that this debate, although emotional at times, is being held because I have no doubt that the message which will go out from the House loud and clear is that in so far as the people of the Republic of Ireland are concerned they only want the unity of Ireland that can be achieved through reconciliation of all Irishmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very upset and disturbed by Deputy Blaney's speech. If what he advocated were to be adopted by our people, I would be very much afraid for our country.  I hate to have to say this about a colleague in this House but the impression I got was that Deputy Blaney was a warmonger, that he is spreading the seeds of discontent and war.  He was preaching the same form of bigotry and hatred that he was condemning in the Northern part of the country.  If his policy were to be adopted, it could lead only to total bloodshed and to the slaughter of our people.  I was astonished that he should have been applauded for his speech because if this insanity were to spread through the country, the consequences would be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would hate to think that last Sunday's happenings would be exploited but Deputy Blaney's display was scandalous.  It was a scandalous exploitation of the sad emotions of our people.  The real tragedy for the relatives <Col N="966" /> of the victims will manifest itself today when they find themselves alone. We know that the victims were innocent people who were protesting against tyranny.  We know of the intransigence of the Westminster Government and of their attempts to bolster up Mr. Faulkner and his regime and it is this that is responsible for the problem. The British Government stand indicted for what they did.  It was a cold, calculated act.  I would say that the paratroopers had their orders and all the evidence suggests that their action was not defensive.  It stands to reason that it could not have been defensive.</P>
    <P>I am sad that no political moves have been made.  We all talk about the problem and offer various suggestions but nothing concrete is being done. Unfortunately, and regretfully, Britain is determined to proceed with her military solution to the problems of the North.  I had discussions on the problem while I was in Britain and I was appalled at the intransigence on the part of the British and of their determination not to have political moves or initiatives under any circumstances that would bring about a solution to the problem.  I was upset, too, that they should abide religiously by what Mr. Faulkner says and that they would not look beyond Mr. Faulkner and beyond what he and his crumbling regime offer for Northern Ireland.  I am disturbed when they say they cannot be under threat.  They cannot afford to talk like this especially when people are being killed.  It is up to us to arouse British public opinion as to what is happening and to make them aware of how the problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>I said yesterday that reunification was on the horizon.  We have reached this irreversible stage; but I would say that if reunification were to be effective tomorrow it would be a disaster for our country.  I say this because the Governments of this country during the past 50 years have not prepared for reunification. Not an attempt was made by any of them to prepare for reunification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We have confined everything within the Twenty-six County boundary, all our legislation and our social codes; we have not looked at the problem from a practical point of view.  When I was in Northern Ireland last week I spoke to Unionists and to people from all walks of life and I realised that they have objections to a united Ireland.  Their objections are practical ones.  They talk in terms of our social welfare code being far below what is normal.  They talk of our health services and of our underdeveloped economy.  I know they are being subsidised by Britain&mdash;and, perhaps, taking into account the small country that ours is, we may have done a lot&mdash;but we have not looked further than the Twenty-six Counties.  We have not considered how we might develop our services so as to put them on a par with services in the North of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I talked in terms of 5 per cent of our people owning 71 per cent of the wealth of the country.  Are these 5 per cent prepared to redistribute the wealth of this country so that we can have a proper social welfare code?  I am asking our Government what we can do to ensure a more equal distribution. Are we prepared to make the sacrifices or are we going to continue to pay lip service to reunification? Are we, as TDs, going to continue to talk in rural areas and lead public opinion on changes in the Constitution, which might be unpleasant at first sight but which are vitally necessary for the people in the North of Ireland?  We much change every aspect of the Constitution that is offensive to them and we must be prepared to grasp the nettle.  When Deputy Dr. Noel Browne and I introduced a Bill on contraception the Government did not take the initiative but were prepared to relegate it to Private Members' Time where it would fade into oblivion.  They are afraid to grasp the nettle.  If they are sincere about reunification, if they want to bring about the changes that <Col N="968" /> will reorientate the people of the North towards the people of the South, they have got to bring about the necessary changes in the Constitution so that this will not be called a theocratic State.  We must have a separation of Church and State in this country.  We must be prepared to stand up and talk about this even if we incur unpopularity and the displeasure of our own constituents.</P>

If backwoods men refuse to accept this and still talk about reunification I say they are hypocrites. If we are sincere about this we should be prepared to stand up and be counted among those who want the changes that are vital in the interests of our country.  We should scrap the Constitution and prepare a new one.</P>

      <P>I say that Mr. Faulkner's days in Northern Ireland are numbered and that he must come to the conference table and talk.  If he is not prepared to listen we should talk to Mr. Desmond Boal and Dr. Paisley who are realists and who are orientating their minds towards the South and towards reunification.  However, they have fears, and I say this despite the ridicule and the amusement of Deputy Aiken.  They have fears that this is a Popish State, that this is a Roman Catholic State.  They are entitled to have fears, but we must allay those <Col N="969" /> fears.  We must be prepared to tell them: &ldquo;You have a rightful and meaningful place in this country.&rdquo;  These are the talks I have had with people in the North.  But they say: &ldquo;How many of your colleagues really believe this or are prepared to do this?&rdquo;  We should be discussing with them how we might bring about reunification, and I would suggest that in a new Parliament for the first number of years we should give them equal representation to prove to them that we are sincere in our attempts to give them a meaningful say in this country.  That is how far I would go in setting up a new Parliament.</P>
      <P>The IRA have carried on a campaign in Northern Ireland, some of them against the British Army, some of them against innocent civilians.  I do not think that their way is a democratic one.  They could have a democratic role to play.  Their aim is a united Ireland, and I agree with them in that, but I think they should pursue their aim along political lines. Their members could be elected to Dáil Éireann or to a new Parliament. I would sincerely ask them to think along those lines and to talk about changing, from within a Constitutional Parliament, our country and the defects they see in it.  I do not think they will achieve their objects by an abstentionist policy.</P>
      <P>The IRA propose regional parliaments, and I say, yes, regional parliaments by all means if we have a central parliament overriding them. The regional parliaments to which they refer will perhaps solve many of our problems, but they must come as a mandate from the people.  The IRA would be well advised to consider this as the only possible and proper way to bring about the changes they want effected.  It must be along democratic lines.  I would see Dr. Paisley having a lot in common with the IRA, strange as it seems.  They both would think in terms of a proper country for the people.  I know this, and therefore I would appeal to them to do as I have suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was appalled, as I said, at Deputy Blaney's speech, especially when I think that he was one of the architects of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area <Col N="970" /> Agreement, when he sought closer and closer union with Britain.  I do not think he made a constructive speech.  I listened to every word he said.  He denounced the three parties here; still the only constructive suggestions he put forward were ones which had been outlined here by the Taoiseach, the leader of the Fine Gael Party, and Deputy Corish of our own party.  When Deputy Blaney was in a position of power to bring about the changes he talks about, to bring about reunification, what did he do about it?  I do not know of anything positive he did, or perhaps I am too naïve and I do not know what really constructive work was done towards reunification.</P>
    <P>As I said, Deputy Blaney is breeding the same bigotry and hatred which he condemns in Northern Ireland.  When he talks about the call-up of the Army and the FCA I would say maybe we should give him a gun, because that is exactly the line he is pursuing at the moment.  Perhaps I am a little harsh on him.  Perhaps he is over-emotional and that because of where he lives it is understandable.  However, I would appeal to him not to let emotional nationalism destroy him and destroy the rest of the country.  He talked about the days of grief and mourning, but his answers would extend those days of grief and mourning much more.  I would appeal to him to exercise restraint because, unfortunately, his voice still carries a lot of weight in this country.</P>
    <P>He denounces the Protestants in the North; then he talks in terms of our sitting down and talking with them. How can this be brought about as long as we denounce them as we do?  How do we get them to talk if we instil fears in them?  We should be allaying their fears.  A constructive suggestion was made by Deputy Corish when he said that we should go to Mr. Heath.  I would hope that through his speech Deputy Blaney suffered an emotional catharsis.  I would hope that this would save the country.  He said we should not be afraid to risk what we have here to save the people of Northern Ireland.  To me that would spell bloodshed.  It would be a tremendous gamble that could only harm the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="971" /> At this moment moral courage is much more important than courage in battle.  Moral courage is a rare commodity, a rare quality.  It is the courage that may incur the displeasure of your colleagues.  It may have you denounced as a radical.  It may make you very unpopular because you may be endeavouring to lead public opinion rather than follow it.  Unfortunately in this House we have been content too often to follow public opinion.  I ask those people with moral courage to stand up and be counted and to see what we can do to bring about the changes that are necessary.</P>
    <P>It is not enough just to talk here for the sake of talking.  The Taoiseach made a very good speech today.  I hope he will keep his word.  I hope he will bring about the changes which he said are necessary&mdash;the social, the economic, the political and the constitutional changes that are necessary before we can talk about a united Ireland.  I hope he will not put them on the long finger and say they will come after the unification.  That would be disastrous.  It would be a retrograde step.  I hope he will have the courage of his convictions.</P>
    <P>I saw an advertisement in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning from Mayo saying that 10,000 people will be marching and that it is expected that 250,000 people will be converging on Newry next Sunday.  I would ask the British Government to make a declaration that political initiatives are on the way so that this march may be postponed. This is the only thing that will bring about a postponement of that march: a declaration by Britain today&mdash;and I have told them already that this is vital if we are to avoid further bloodshed next Sunday.  I fear that the tragedy in Derry will pale into insignificance compared with what may happen next Sunday if 250,000 people march on Newry&mdash;that political initiatives are on the way which will bring about talks.  It is up to the British to do this.  It is necessary for Britain to make that statement if we are to avoid a further tragedy.</P>
    <P>There is a danger in what happened yesterday that the dogs of war have <Col N="972" /> been let loose.  I was frightened at what happened yesterday.  I should hate to see a day of national mourning exploited by elements in our society who are interested only in disorder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is excellent that Dáil Éireann has been given a full opportunity in this two-day debate to get down to the fundamental issues involved in the basic national problem that has been with us for 50 years now, wrongly imposed on us, and artificially created in the form of the partition of this natural island of 32 counties, with a population that can work with each other, as we have proved very well over the past 50 years in the type of society which we have evolved here in this part of Ireland, which is almost totally nonsectarian, classless and devoted to the common good and the achievement of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my fundamental belief that this can be done equally in a 32-county Ireland.  We have built in the proper protective measures both in the statue law and in the Constitution to protect the lives and liberties of people, to ensure their rights before the courts and to ensure that these rights are fully protected by law and by the Constitution. This type of society which we have evolved is one of which we should be proud and one we can certainly evolve in a 32-county Ireland if we are allowed to work out our own salvation. We have not been allowed to work out our own salvation in this respect and our persistent claim to a 32-county Ireland, which has been ignored over these 50 years by the British Government, has now been shown by recent <Col N="973" /> tragic events to be fully justified.  It has been shown, thanks to modern communications, to be a right and proper claim before the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the unnatural division of our country in recent times begat violence and will beget more violence.  This is the lesson of the present situation.  This is the lesson of the tragic events that occurred in Derry last Sunday and the other tragic events that have developed and worsened since August, 1969.  Any action done to protect and further perpetuate an unnatural division among people is bound to create the type of situation which we have seen developing in the six North-Eastern counties since August, 1969.</P>
    <P>Added to that, over the 50 years of Stormont administration there have been the constant injustices, the denial of human rights, the denial of civil rights, the denial of everything that is proper in a fair and open society, to a substantial section of the people in the Six Counties, 40 per cent of the population there.  There has been the entrenchment of an establishment in the interests of the members of that establishment and the people who support it, and support it at the polls.  That is not a democratic society.  Sixty per cent may vote for a Unionist establishment at election time but it cannot be called a democratic society in any sense of the world.  It is merely the power of one group over another entrenched through the polls and buttoned down, and pinned down, and fastened down, by injustice and patronage and jobbery of every kind.</P>
    <P>This is now out in the open.  It is out from under the carpet where successive British Governments swept it conveniently.  It is out now fully and openly before the eyes of the world and exposed for all the injustices it contains.  The moral and administrative violence, which can be worse than physical violence, of making a people less than they should be, which has been the essence of the Stormont administration over 50 years, has now resulted in the present confrontation situation, a situation in which the British Army has had to be hired, <Col N="974" /> in effect, by the Stormont administration and paid for by the British administration to copperfasten a people to whom basic civil rights were denied.</P>
    <P>This is the situation now, starting from the moral and administrative violence of a people exercising their majority control in a wrong way over another community which has now escalated into physical violence of the very worst kind.  This is what we have here now, what we must look at and assess in a sane way although it is very hard, as any of us who were in Derry yesterday can aver, to be sane and sensible in view of the horror we saw in the minds, the eyes and the very gestures of the people.  We have to assess it as the elected representatives of this part of Ireland and decide what we can do about it in a sane and sensible way and what contribution we can make towards this endeavour.</P>
    <P>There are certain basic truths in this matter that we must acknowledge in honesty here ourselves.  Because of the size of our population, the facts in regard to what we believe in anyway in the ultimate, we cannot meet the type of violence exercised on us by Britain and the Stormont Administration.  We cannot employ violence against that sort of violence.  Apart from the morality of the matter, these are the facts of life.  Morally it is wrong to escalate a potentially dangerous situation into a civil war situation and actually we do not have the fire power to do it.  Let us be honest with ourselves about this.  We are not in a position here from any point of view, either moral or practical, to meet violence with greater violence.</P>
    <P>This is the situation we are faced with.  To be honest, it would be a totally counter-productive attitude on our part here to suggest that in any way we could meet British Army violence with greater violence.  Effectively, what can we do?  I would suggest&mdash;and modern communications, television and radio are a help to a great extent&mdash;that we can exercise enormous moral power and pressure in regard to our just case.  We cannot be seen to have a just case if we meet injustice with injustice.  We can be seen to have a just case if we meet injustice with justice.  This is the Government <Col N="975" /> attitude and I think it is the attitude of every right-thinking person in this House and outside it.  I believe we should fully exercise every possible pressure short of violence and we must fully back it.</P>

In particular, he will make known the fact that the British Government through its agency, the British Army, so far from helping the case in any way has completely exacerbated the situation to such an extent that the British Government, the British Army, the British administration and the British people, who are not responsible at all, were brought into total disgrace through the events of last Sunday.</P>

      <P>The further violence that has taken place has been the result of massive internment without trial introduced in an arbitrary way by the Stormont administration last August and supported by the British administration.  This total violence, worked in a discriminate way on people without any justification whatsoever and in every section of the community representative only of the minority section of the community, I might say, has merely triggered off a worse situation since last August.</P>
      <P>On top of the continuing 50 years of violence against the minority population in the Six Counties by both Westminister and Stormont, we had in recent months internment by the Stormont administration and now the total excesses on the part of the British Army which have brought shame on Britain. We must use every pressure to shame them into doing something about this problem which is their problem.  This is the type of moral pressure short of violence which we must exercise now.  I would suggest to Deputy Harte that we now have a situation which did not exist to anything like the same extent in the past 50 years where we can, by reason of their actions of violence and their acts of injustice, shame them into doing something about it.  This is what the Government propose to do.</P>

      <P>Thank you, Deputy.  I appreciate your courtesy. This situation now quite clearly out in the open is a situation we must meet not with violence, not in any counter-productive manner of that kind.  This is a situation where injustice has been clearly seen not just in Ireland, not just in Britain, but throughout the world; not just glaringly seen but so obvious that we must proceed straight away to work on this situation as an independent Government, and remember that where the injustice is out in the open, where the excesses on the part of the British and Stormont Governments are out in the open, where the excesses on the part of the British Army are out in the open, it is now a situation in which we should not meet injustice with injustice.  It is precisely a situation where if we are to sustain the justice of our case we must meet violence not with violence, injustice not with injustice, but we must meet the whole case with the justice of our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is where I suggest every pressure short of violence must be fully exercised and tapped.  It can be done externally by the Government and through the various Government agencies which we propose to utilise <Col N="978" /> to do this.  At the moment the Minister for Foreign Affairs is engaged in this matter.  We will shortly be taking further steps to intensify this publicity abroad so as to ensure that the justice of our case is seen.  It is pretty well acknowledged both in North America and in Europe to a far greater extent than we imagine.  We tend sometimes to think that the only foreign Press is the British Press.  This is not true.  The British Press has been for centuries the arm of the establishment in Britain and the British Press at all levels has been under the thumb of the establishment in Britain and has consistently given us here in Ireland a bad press, with certain honourable exceptions, such as <i>The Sunday Times</i> in recent times.</P>
    <P>Beyond and apart from that, in Europe, all parts of it, East and West, in North America, throughout the various emerging countries in Africa and Asia, the justice of our case is recognised. It is up to us as a Government to use every means and every agency to make sure that the facts which we can place on record, the results of British injustice and British violence, are fully put on record by us as a sovereign independent Government.  We can thereby meet injustice with justice, with the justice of our case, and have this case fully displayed and put on record before the countries of the world.  This is a task in which we must engage and we have now for the first time the brutal, the horrible facts to place before the world of this injustice and we propose to make the fullest use of the facilities which we have as a sovereign independent nation to make sure that these brutal and horrible facts being wrought by British injustice and by Stormont injustice will be brought to the notice of the Governments of the world on the basis of justice on our side meeting injustice on their side.</P>
    <P>The only way we can harm that case is by in any way using violence to meet violence, or injustice to meet injustice. I am certain that in this manner we can do the best justice to our case abroad with the governments of the world who are now coming round to our point of view.  We can use all the aids of modern telecommunication, telenised <Col N="979" /> vision and radio, to help us in this endeavour.</P>

      <P>I had the great pleasure yesterday to meet Fr. Edward Daly who was associated in their last moments with the unfortunate people who died in Derry last Sunday.  He has gone to America.  He is going on the various American media tonight and tomorrow to tell the story which he told very fully, very clearly and without emotion but with total truth, to the Irish people on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme last Monday night.  We hope to have him relating that factual story of what happened in Derry on all the major American media today and tomorrow.  That is a practical example of one of the many steps we can take at all levels of Government activity to ensure that the justice of our case and the injustice of the British case are brought fully to the notice of every country in the world.</P>
      <P>The other way in which we can help practically is internally to support those forces in the Six Counties who are concerned about establishing a true and a just Thirty-two County Ireland and who at the same time have repudiated violence.  I refer in particular here to the political representatives of the non-Unionist minority, the SDLP and the Nationalist Party and indeed any other party or individuals who are opposed to Unionist violence and Unionist injustice.

      <P>It is the function of the Government to take the immediate steps that are required to be taken to meet the situation at any given time.  It is only with governments that the power and the facilities lie to take immediate steps and immediate action. Where I would see inter-party co-operation having a more fundamental meaning in furthering the talks that <Col N="981" /> have taken place between the Government and the Fine Gael and Labour Parties is, in the long term, to work out the sort of society which we propose to have in a Thirty-two County Ireland, the sort of practical amendments to our Constitution, the sort of social and economic steps that are required to be taken now to ensure that the transition into a Thirty-two County Ireland can be eased, the sort of steps that we have to take in regard to many of our laws.  All of these are matters in which I could see a great field of opportunity not just in the immediate future, now or next week, but in the long term, looking ahead to the sort of society in which we want to live as a Thirty-two County Ireland.</P>
      <P>It must be emphasised that that type of society must be an open, nonsectarian society and I should like to say categorically that however we deplore the acts of both the British and the Stormont administrations in recent times&mdash;we deplore them vehemently for the injustice that has been inherent in their policies in recent years &mdash;we must remember one thing here: it is that we have built in this State during the past number of years a society in which there has been no sectarian tinge, in which all classes and creeds have had an equal right to make progress.  This can be improved to contain a Thirty-two County Ireland.  It can be improved in many ways, by amending our Constitution, our laws, our attitudes and policies.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally, we have evolved here a fairly open, a fairly clear nonsectarian society.  We have evolved here a society in which we are seeking, even if we have not always achieved it, to have justice written into every aspect of our administration, our laws and our Constitution.  This is in direct contrast to the type of situation where injustice has been heaped upon injustice in the six North-Eastern counties.  There is that clear distinction between the attitude of minds of the people in the Twenty-six Counties compared to the people of one party who have governed for 50 years in the six North-Eastern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will have to do more in this <Col N="982" /> direction, and this is where the three parties meeting together can propose practical ways and means of how we can make our society more open, more acceptable in every sense of the word, so that nobody in the six North-Eastern counties can say this is not a society into which we can go.</P>
    <P>This, in my view, is a practical, fruitful area of co-operation in which we should engage immediately between the three parties represented here in this Parliament.  That is the longer-term aspect.  The shorter-term aspect is to take the immediate steps which only a Government can take and which we are taking, both externally, as I spelled out, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and other governmental agencies and internally through our own co-operation with and leadership of the responsible people who are opposed to Unionists in the six North-Eastern counties.  It is on these two fronts that we can work and work in the recognition that this is not an easy task.  The people who say that we can just drive the British Army and the British administration out of the six North-Eastern counties and can drive one million Unionists into the sea at the drop of the hat are people who are talking dishonestly.  Let us have some honest talk here.</P>
    <P>The honesty, I believe, lies in working along the immediate lines on which the Government are working and along the more long-term lines in regard to which I believe the three political parties can closely co-operate.  We must recognise that ultimately we must get the British Government to a firm declaration&mdash;Mr. Harold Wilson has proposed 15 years, but I believe that is too long in the context of what has developed&mdash;that in five years or ten years time we will have a definite date by which Partition goes, by which a Thirty-two County Ireland must come about.  We must direct the energies of all responsible people in the two islands who believe in democracy, who believe in political parties, in parliament and in laws to protect the individual.  All of us in these two islands who believe in these fundamental matters which make for what is called a democratic society must set a timetable, set down an agenda and set down a period of <Col N="983" /> years&mdash;five years or ten years&mdash;within which period there must be a united Ireland and we must now sit down and devise the ways and means of achieving that.  It is only in that way that we will achieve a united Ireland and in the meantime we must exercise every moral pressure, every pressure of every kind short of actual violence, to ensure that the British injustice is brought fully home to every country and every nation and to the peoples of every country and every nation&mdash;not just the governments and the administrations but to the peoples&mdash;through the media now there.  We must exercise all the pressure at our disposal in the meantime and on that level pursue that way of activity externally and at another level pursue a way of activity in regard to helping the responsible people opposed to Unionism in the six North-Eastern counties.  On the final level we must sit down in co-operation with other responsible and democratic parties and people in the other island and in the six North-Eastern counties, and start to work out ways and means for creating the fabric for the united 32-county Ireland we want to see operating in five or ten years time.</P>

      <P>The situation in our country which has existed for many years and which has been highlighted by events&mdash;and, we must admit, inevitable events&mdash;since 1969 is very much in my mind and indeed in the minds of many others who bear the title of Irishmen.  Just in case anyone might make the error of thinking that my speech here is an echo of someone else's words, I would like to make it quite clear, especially to correspondents who might think otherwise, that I am expressing my view and opinion on this and other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to indicate to the House that when I stood as a candidate in the by-election for what I thought then was the republican party I was elected by the people of Dublin South-West as a republican member of this House.  I remained in Fianna Fáil to the point when I was absolutely convinced that they no longer held the republican traditions on which they were founded. I think that indications that this is so <Col N="984" /> must be taken to be represented by the actions of Kevin Boland and Deputy Neil Blaney and others who dispute what Fianna Fáil are as against what they were.</P>
    <P>What we witnessed in part of our country last Sunday is nothing short of a national tragedy.  It is a national tragedy that Irishmen should continue to be killed by Her Majesty's forces, but it is equally tragic that we have a so-called republican Government who are only prepared to talk, to act inadequately, to act late and slowly, and, above all, to be seen, or seem to be collaborating with British interests. Last Sunday brought home to every Irishman the realisation that there is a war being waged, and when Mr. Maudling announced that war was in fact being waged in Ireland he was not joking.  The logical conclusion, the logical consequence, of that war is that people undoubtedly will be killed.  It must be admitted by us that a great number of people in this part of Ireland really felt as if the Six Counties were a thousand miles away, but I think that since last Sunday many of these people who might have made the mistake of believing that they were detached, uninvolved and with no capacity to be involved in that struggle have changed their minds.  We have certainly seen evidence of the people's reaction on our streets in Dublin and in different parts of the country.</P>
    <P>We must all sincerely sympathise with the relatives and friends of those who were killed in Derry, but what do we do as a Government and as a people?  Deputy Blaney spoke here earlier today and asked that we should not be over-confused by the events of last Sunday, and I would like to say that lost in the tragic events of the bloody Sunday of our time is an interview between John Taylor and Bill Craig on our Irish radio on last Sunday between 1 and 2 o'clock.  During that interview, compliments and criticism crossed the floor.  Bill Craig and John Taylor complimented our Government and our Taoiseach for having done what they asked him to do, that is, he arrested seven men who were found to be in possession of arms on the Twenty-six County side, and although they remarked that this was <Col N="985" /> late and inadequate, because there were so many people they knew to be on the loose or on the run in the South from the North, they still thanked our Government for this co-operation. Just as Deputy Blaney called on the Government for a fundamentally sincere and unequivocal gesture to the people's struggle in the North, I call on the Government to release these men who were arrested, on very technical grounds, by our Government and who are being held back from the defence of their friends and fellow-citizens within the Six-County area.</P>
    <P>We must very clearly consider the consequences of our actions here and the logical conclusion which the British and Stormont authorities will take from our actions down here.  It is not so long ago since another person was arrested by our Government in the South.  That man was John Kelly.  He was then the chairman of the Belfast Citizens' Defence Committee.  His arrest, not on the streets of Belfast by the Stormont regime but by our Government here, gave the Stormont regime and the British a clear indication of what they could expect in the crunch from the Irish Government.  The Irish Government despite what the Taoiseach had said the previous August dismissed members of the Government and arrested John Kelly. Up to that time the British soldier was acting in an impartial manner, he was acting in a peaceful role keeping two sides apart, but the consequences of what happened were seen in the actions of the Army.  They became very partial to the authorities in the North and loyal to the British Government's policy in the North.</P>
    <P>We must consider then what would be the consequences of the arrest in recent times of seven men who, let us be quite honest, were technically arrested.  These men were not fighting against the Government here or the people of Ireland.  If they were guilty of anything it was of being overenthusiastic in relation to their activities in the North.</P>

      <P>In his broadcast on last Monday night the Taoiseach did not go far enough to express the feelings and the mood of the people of Ireland.  He spoke of a final solution to the Irish question.  I wonder and I question what is his final solution because if he is thinking of one which does not accept a firm commitment by the British to the reunification of the <Col N="987" /> country he is wasting his time and indeed deceiving the people once again. He spoke also of an all-party conference. I wonder who would take part in this conference.  I should like the House to look at the reason why we are talking here today, why any protest from the people of Ireland against British authorities in Dublin should take place, why we as Members of this House attended a funeral in the North.  It would be futile to think of a conference without recognising the right to participate in that conference of the people who are responsible for bringing this situation to a stage where a conference can even be considered. Those men and women who are fully involved and active in this regard are legitimately entitled to be at that conference table and if it should be drawn up without the participation of these people this will be yet another nonevent.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that internment should go.  It has taken him six months to say unequivocally that it should go.  We have read his description of internment as a terrible thing but it has taken him until now to say that it must go. I wonder did it take 13 deaths to make him make this demand.  The Taoiseach spoke of the need to get the British soldiers out of the Catholic ghettos of the Six-County area.  Why did he stop <Col N="988" /> there?  Why did our Taoiseach, the leader of the supposed Republican Party, not go so far as to say that the British soldiers should be removed completely from the Six Counties of Ireland?  I cannot see how he can be excused for confining his remarks to the ghetto areas of Belfast.  Does the same thing not apply to areas which have a mixed population?  What about the Catholic or the Nationalist Republican on a street in Belfast where his neighbours are Protestants?  Is he not perhaps more likely to experience the brutality the soldiers have inflicted on the people in the Catholic areas?  I would suggest that these people are more in danger of the discriminatory powers of the British and Stormont regimes.</P>
      <P>It is not right or proper that the Taoiseach should be talking about asking the British troops merely to get out of the Catholic areas.  Anyone who has travelled up to the Bogside and Creggan knows that Creggan is not a ghetto area.  Other parts of the Six Counties where the Catholic population live can be so described.  The Creggan estate, to which we went yesterday, is a fine housing estate, very similar to any part of my constituency.  In referring to Catholic areas as ghettos the Taoiseach should bear in mind that he is perhaps insulting communities. The people of Ballyfermot, where I live, are very proud of their community. That area got a bad Press heretofore.  It is not a nice gesture for our Government to describe the Creggan area as a ghetto but that is a very minor point to make when we are talking about the absolute horror of the situation as it has escalated in the North.</P>
      <P>In reference to the Taoiseach's speech on Monday night, when he mentioned the need to get the British soldiers out of areas where Catholics or Nationalists are in the majority, it is fair to say that even Deputy O'Brien, of the Labour Party, demanded, as we have demanded, that the soldiers be completely withdrawn from the Six Counties.  Our Republican Government, through their Leader, have not gone as far as that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said yesterday that if the British soldiers' tactics did not change then his Government would dedicate themselves to getting the British out.  I should like to refer to the question that I had on the Order Paper today asking the Government to give the people of Ireland information as to the number of statements, tape recordings and other information in the possession of the Government since internment was introduced.  There was implicit in that question the question as to how these statements indict the British authorities and the Stormont regime in the North.  We are talking here after the event.  Thirteen have been killed.  It is suggested that this is justification for being tough.  Many months ago the Government had even more gruesome details of the tortures the British authorities inflicted on the community in the Six Counties but the Government did not see fit to take action.  I wonder why.  I suggest again, as I did this morning and on Tuesday, that the Government are proving themselves to be three steps behind the people.  But for the fact that the people of Ireland reacted in the way they did and protested as they did sincerely and with true feeling, the Government would not have made the statements they have made over the last couple of days.  Of course, the people had not got the information that was entrusted to the Government by persons who were tortured and brutally treated by soldiers in the Six Counties.  I put down the question to which I have referred so that some indication would be given of the volume of information that was given to the Government and some explanation as to why they took so long before making any comment or taking any action in regard to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement last Monday the Taoiseach referred to the minority and to the need to rid them of Unionist misrule.  Surely the Taoiseach appreciates that the minority in this country are the 25 per cent of the total population <Col N="990" /> that Stormont was established to look after and that the minority that he refers to are, in fact, part of the majority of the people?  Are the Taoiseach and the Government slightly confused on that matter?  They continually refer to the Nationalist population of the Six Counties as the minority or part of the minority.  It must be very clear that they are part of the majority of the 32 counties and that the minority in this country are the 25 per cent of the population in the various religious groupings.</P>
    <P>I agree with all those who suggested that we should have a Constitution that would protect everybody's interest.  It is worthless and a waste of time for Ministers, like the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lenihan, to speak of amending our Constitution so that it would incorporate the wishes of the people of the Six Counties.  In this very advanced stage towards reunification it is trite to talk about anything less than a completely new Constitution.</P>
    <P>We have tried over the years to establish the claim to jurisdiction over 32 counties, that our jurisdiction is not confined to 26 counties.  It is weakening that claim to talk about the right to exercise jurisdiction over what is commonly and continually referred to as the minority of the Six Counties.  They certainly are a minority in the Six Counties but we must remember that when nine counties were offered to the British they realised that the Nationalists and Republicans in those nine counties would very quickly out-number the Protestant or Unionist vote and that therefore the Stormont regime, which is guilty of so many of the atrocities that we have seen over the past number of years, would falter and, consequently, that British influence in Ireland would falter.  It is not altogether right to single out the Stormont regime and to blame only them; the British put the Stormont regime there and it is the British who can take them out.</P>
    <P>We shall learn later in the debate from the Minister for Finance about the allocation of money which the Taoiseach mentioned was to be made towards the peaceful activities of political groups in the North.  It is fair <Col N="991" /> to ask: will there be another inquisition as to the use to which the money will be put, such as we have proceeding at the moment?  When the current inquiry is over the cost of the inquiry will probably be in excess of the original allocation.  Will the new allocation have the effect of buying over support and of buying off the criticism that has been recently levelled by members of the SDLP?</P>
    <P>Through this House I would appeal to the SDLP under no circumstances to allow themselves to be bought over with this money.  When we talk about the struggle of the people in the Six Counties against British occupation of their territory we cannot, if we are honest with ourselves, separate the IRA from the rest of the community.  If anyone here who visited Derry yesterday took the time to speak to some of the locals instead of getting into their State cars and returning to Dublin they would know, since they would be told very clearly, that every man, youth and boy throughout the length and breadth of the Six Counties is now a member of the IRA.  When we talk about the IRA leaving it to the politicians to take over we are talking about a whole community because the IRA are now firmly implanted in the community and firmly established as the defenders of that community and in no circumstances, therefore, is it justifiable to refer to them in a separate way.</P>
    <P>I regret, as others have regretted, the violence that took place in Dublin yesterday.  I believe, however, that it was necessary that this violence should take place in order that the people could show their real feelings to the British Government.  Our Government have never so far done that adequately. It was noted that the greater proportion of the men and women were young people of my own generation and it is, I think, relevant to point out that when people get aged they become very conservative and they slowly but surely miss out on representing the younger generation's point of view.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Blaney's speech was a valuable speech because it showed us just precisely where the emotions of the last few days could lead if they are not channelled in the interests of the people. May I say to him, through you, Sir, that other people share his emotions?  He has no particular monopoly of emotion where national issues are concerned. Others, as well as he, in this House have Ulster blood and, even those who have not, care for all our country.  I, <Col N="993" /> too, felt as he did yesterday at the funeral.  My heart, too, was with the suppressed and sorrowing people.  I saw the same coffin-bearing, weeping boys that he saw and I heard that child cry, a cry all the more heartrending because its tone clearly betokened that the child did not fully realise he would not see his father again.</P>
    <P>What those scenes mean to me now is that this cannot go on.  There must be an end to these deaths.  This violence is leading us to a human disaster and we must forget our differences here, forget our fears of unpopularity, ignore the pressures of demagogy displayed in this House today, stand firm against the voice of unreason, prevent more families being destroyed and more desolation of human heart and mind.  I wondered, listening to Deputy Blaney's speech, was it entirely sincere, despite the supercharging with emotion.  He is a man we all know whose actions have always been over the years very calculated.  He is a man who, in Government, would lock up the IRA, up to 1961, as a Government Minister, for four years, sharing responsibility for it and who has the nerve to come into this House and ask us to release the Republican prisoners.  Is that honesty, sincerity or hypocrisy?  I know what I think it is&mdash;hypocrisy, hypocrisy of a kind which does not come well from someone putting forward the sentiments he put forward here today.

Was that because they were so concerned to show sympathy for the people in the Creggan or was it for political motives?</P>

      <P>Indeed.  It was predictable all along that if enough arms and enough explosives could be got into the hands of the IRA and enough British soldiers could be blown up there would be a reaction no matter how good the initial relations might be between the troops and the Catholics. The policy he propounded to this House today was a war policy.  Blood he spoke of three times: once about a redblooded people, again about people with red blood coursing through their veins and, later, he told us we should not take cold-blooded decisions. Cold blood or hot blood, it is always blood.  He wants the Army out and the FCA to be mobilised.  He wants them sent to the Border &ldquo;for a time of need&rdquo; and there was to be no equivocation as to what this time of need is but, equivocally, he would not tell the House what the time of need was.  He also mentioned the word &ldquo;war&rdquo;.  What he means is civil war.  What he means is to send our soldiers so that there would be death and destruction in the North knowing, as he knows perfectly well, that our Army and our fully organised FCA could not reach Belfast and could not do anything to save the 120,000 Catholics in Belfast as a consequence of Deputy Blaney's war policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate that Deputy Blaney does not like being reminded of the four years when he was the jailer of republican prisoners but he over-reached himself today. Many people in the last few days have been swept by momentary emotions and have cried for something positive to be done&mdash;have we not all felt the urge to do something?&mdash;but many of those people will be shocked into sober reality by the bitter, bloodthirsty speech here today.  Deputy Blaney is right in one thing, in a sense of urgency.  The pressures of emotion and unreason are now powerful, fomented by men like Deputy Blaney.  Time is desperately short and another massacre like that in Derry on Sunday could bring us to the brink.  This message must reach the British Government from this House and from us all, including Deputy Blaney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks very much, Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The message must reach the British people from whom the truth has been kept by the British Press and communications media who are ever fearful of criticising their own defence forces, a fear which I think the Press and media in every country feel. I am sure that if ever a similar occasion arose here&mdash;we know it would not&mdash;there would be the same inhibitions. But these inhibitions are dangerous. The British people do not know clearly what has happened in Derry.  Even though some of their reporters did report plainly what they saw in honesty, at times the sub-editing left something to be desired and the editorials suggested that the men who wrote them never read the reports of their own journalists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must reach the British people <Col N="998" /> in any way we can, through the media, through articles, letters, interviews on radio and television.  They cannot suppress them all although they suppress some of them including one that I was in on this very subject.  We must reach them also through friendly nations, through the countries with whom we and the British are about to ally ourselves in the EEC, countries which cannot be, and which we know are not happy with the situation created by British policy in Northern Ireland.  To me, that seems the most hopeful channel of external pressure on the United Kingdom.  I do not think this pressure will come from the United Nations.  Britain is a blind spot where the UN is concerned and pressure from that source is likely to be counter-productive, but where Britain is sensitive is in relation at this moment to the European Economic Community.  Pressure from France or Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands or Italy and countries like that could have its effect.  That is where our Minister for Foreign Affairs should be today rather than performing on television in the United States to an audience friendly to us in any event in that country.  I hope the Taoiseach will bring him back and send him with representatives of the Opposition to show a united front in the countries of Europe to persuade these countries to use their influence to bring peace to this country so that a peaceful Ireland may, with Britain, enter the EEC on 1st January next year.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, it is to British politicians we must address ourselves.  We must get them to see and admit what happened in Derry, to see the folly of their policies of turning a friendly neighbour into an enemy.  To get them to see how we feel, we must bridge a gap in understanding.  The great problem here is the gulf in understanding that has arisen partly because when emotions are aroused reason disappears and people see things only from their own point of view&mdash;I am sure we are guilty of this here today also&mdash;and partly because the media are not always good at ensuring that both sides of the case are heard in each country.  Some of the media in Britain have been particularly unfortunate <Col N="999" /> in this respect.  For these reasons a gap in understanding has arisen.  When you talk to fair-minded British people and politicians and to British politicians who are very well-disposed towards this country and towards ultimate Irish unity, one finds at times an inability to understand how we think and feel.  At times I think we share this inability.  Certainly, when I listen to men like Goodheart on television the other night I find it hard to understand how he thinks and feels, a man like that who in the face of the evidence before him blandly asserted as an absolute fact that the troops behaved perfectly in Derry on Sunday.</P>
    <P>It is hard to understand people like that and they find us hard to understand. Anything that is done in this country or in this House that makes understanding more difficult makes it harder for us to understand them or for them to understand us, and any obstacles created to that understanding are obstacles to peace and unity.  Does anybody think that burning down the British Embassy will make the ordinary Britisher more likely to see our point of view?  Is it not obvious that it will merely hold up the evolution of understanding?  They will come to see the truth: they are slow people to learn: they find it hard to understand other people's point of view.  We know how long it took us in the years before independence and it is taking a hell of a long time now.  But in time, as weeks and months pass, they are coming to see the truth.  The tone of their politicians' comments is changing even visibly day by day.  There was a different note sounded by Lord Carrington in the House of Lords than that sounded by Mr. Maudling in the House of Commons.  Visibly they are coming to realise that within the Northern Ireland area, for the period that it remains separate from our administration, there must be community government, something which they did not see six months ago and which they are now beginning to see clearly.</P>
    <P>But the pace of events so far as they are concerned is far too slow. Growth of understanding of our problem <Col N="1000" /> is far too slow and the pace of events here and the danger it creates for us here is far too great.  It is the disparity between these two that threatens us at this time.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we must do whatever we can together because we can work together on this if sufficient confidence can be created between the different sides and I think that can be done.  We must make what dramatic gestures we can to get across to them.  That is why the other day the Leader of Fine Gael, the Leader of the Opposition, proposed a joint visit to London by the Leaders of the three parties to see Mr. Heath. Of course, he recognised that there are dangers in this.  The chances of Mr. Heath suddenly being enlightened by such a visit and changing his policy overnight are pretty slim, judging by his performance over the past 18 months.  Yet, it would be an opportunity to make some progress, an opportunity of getting across to the British people through the publicity such a visit would arouse and the impression it must make on them that parties so divided as we are here can unite in putting to the British people the situation as we see it and pleading with them to have sense at last and realise what they are doing to this country, doing to themselves and to relations between the two countries.  It is not in the interests of Britain to have an inimical Ireland on their flank.  They can be brought to see this, this is where we must apply ourselves rather than in making the kind of gesture of moving troops up to the Border and threatening war.</P>
    <P>We can do something at home also &mdash;something I have pressed in every speech on this matter that I have made here since 1969, but to no avail so far.  There are things about the way we run our part of Ireland that are an obstacle to understanding with the North and which stand between us and the Protestant people of that part of the country.  While there is a recognition of this, a recognition that extends to the other side of the House, it has not led yet to any kind of action. The Taoiseach told us today that we must face some change in stance and policy here if there is to be unity, but <Col N="1001" /> he said the same thing in much the same words each time he spoke on this subject.  What action has there been?  Is there any sign of a sense of urgency in this matter?  I see none.  Six weeks ago it was proposed and shortly afterwards agreed that a committee of the three parties be established for this purpose but nothing further has been heard about it either publicly or privately.  No progress has been made but yet the situation worsens as each day passes.  How, then, can the Government excuse inaction when, if that committee had been set up at the time it was proposed, it could be reaching the point already of agreeing on some kind of proposals that would show to the Protestant people of Northern Ireland that we are prepared to create in a United Ireland a society of which they would be proud to be members? It is open to us to do that.  Nobody is stopping us.  It does not need any action on the part of the British for us to sit down and do this job but we have not done it.</P>
    <P>This does not suggest any great sense of urgency on the part of the Government and yet they claim that they recognise there is a sense of urgency. Could we have some genuine consultation? We have not had any so far. There is a whole range of issues which this committee will have to consider. Some of these issues were referred to by Deputy O'Connell but there are others and these include the whole Church-State relationship which, of course, is central to the fears of Northern Protestants.  This must be on a basis that they find acceptable.</P>
    <P>There is the problem of the Irish language which was adverted to by Deputy Cooney.  We cannot impose this on Protestants of Northern Ireland and tell them that they can serve in the Civil Service of a federal Irish State only if they have learned Irish.  They would regard that as discriminatory as the kind of tactics which they have wielded against the minority in Northern Ireland.  When will this matter be tackled?  Are we serious about unity or do we, in our hearts, go on believing that it will not happen and that we can continue with our policies down <Col N="1002" /> here which in their effects are often sectarian and divisive?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">

But is anybody going to tell me that a million Protestants from the North of Ireland would look forward to coming into a country where they could not get their school-leaving examination without passing an examination in Irish?  We all know that that cannot be imposed on them.  Could we not make the gesture now of ceasing to impose this on people down here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the level on which this debate is to be conducted, God help Ireland.  Protestants in the North are beginning to think again on this issue and if we could show them at this stage that we are genuine it could have an effect at this dramatic moment but they have had no evidence of this in anything that we have done or said during the past couple of years.  It is possible now to see the way towards some kind of agreement which, over a period, would lead us to a united Ireland, a united Ireland achieved by consent.  This will not be easy and neither will it be quick. Those politicians and those newspapers which suggest that unity can be achieved overnight are rendering no service to the Irish people.  We could set ourselves in that direction with success and with a fair expectation of arriving there if we are prepared to make the changes here that would <Col N="1003" /> indicate to the people of Northern Ireland who are not of the same religious persuasion as the majority of the people here that they would be acceptable in this part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>To sum up, Deputy Blaney during his contribution showed the utter bankruptcy of extremist policy and that such policy has nothing to offer but war.  Thank God that that has been exposed clearly here today for the Irish people to see.  We, who do not seek to kill other Irish people, must lead the Irish people in unity towards the radical changing of British opinions and decisions.  We must help to do this by showing our sincerity in our actions at home, but time is desperately short. We must show that we measure up to this occasion.  We must show this by our willingness to drop our differences and to have a genuine unity of approach between those who share the concern for peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not seen that yet.  We have heard talk of consultation but it must be said that it will not be possible to have a united approach if consultation means that in a crisis or every few months the Taoiseach has a hurried consultation in the middle of a Government meeting with Deputy Cosgrave, promises to come back again but makes no further communication for days or maybe weeks.  That is not consultation.  If we are to act unitedly, the Taoiseach, in replying to this debate, must show that he is prepared to bring the Opposition into his Cabinet in matters of internal security and in matters that concern the development of our Northern policy so that we could all work together towards this end.  If he does not measure up to that, if he wants to keep all the cards in his own hands for political reasons&mdash;that may be the case; I do not know, but there is no evidence to the contrary&mdash;let that be clear so that we will know where we stand.  It should be clear to everybody that there is willingness on our part to work with the Government towards this national end if we can have the genuine consultation that will make that possible. That is the message that should go out from this party and from this House today.  The message is one of <Col N="1004" /> urgency.  Above all there is the urgency of getting through to the British, and that is a hard task; but if we cannot get through to them to change their policies quickly, this country faces a disaster towards which it will be led by men, one of whom we have heard speak in this House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume we would not be having this debate at this time if it were not for the tragic events that occurred in Derry on Sunday last.  To some extent this debate should be taking place, at least in spirit, at the gravesides of the young victims of those events.  I would hope that the tribute which the elected representatives of this Assembly could bring to the graves of Derry would consist in an attempt to be constructive, to face up to the tragic, serious crisis before the whole country.  The dead of Derry would be better honoured if the living, instead of giving way to emotion would attempt to avert greater tragedy and to protect by their statements and actions the lives of other young people throughout the country.  I do not know whether all of us in this Dáil are aware of the serious situation facing us all, of the dread abyss in prospect for the whole country.  It is a situation in which one might legitimately give way to despair.  The elements are present that give honest reason for despair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can civil war be averted?  That is the question before us.  Earlier this century there was another debate in which another assembly gave way to the pressures of civil war and people left that assembly and took part in that civil war.  The coming civil war, casting shadows before it in certain of the speeches heard here today, could be more calamitous both in its size and in its effects.  That other civil war took place when the territorial outline of the State was known and concerned the prizes to be won within the confines of that State.  The coming civil war is about an ideal on both sides, and nobody can tell how many lives it would claim.  Therefore, the question before us is whether we are for or against civil war.  Without calling it that name, some people have opted for civil war and <Col N="1005" /> they have lined up on that side.  On this issue, I do not see it as an indictment of this House, but rather as the duty of Parliament to eschew party politics and unite to give the people a lead at this time of crisis.</P>
    <P>Certain Deputies taking part in this debate have the idea that the old politics can continue, that we can continue to make party points on this occasion.  I believe the situation is far too serious for that attitude.  Emotions are high as a result of the Derry shooting and further events may result in galvanising this whole country in the direction of war.  By establishing an all-party committee this Dáil can take a much more purposeful line in dealing with this problem.  If it is considered that conditions are not yet perilous enough for the formation of a national Government, we can certainly have unity on this question between all the people elected to this House, because there is a great measure of agreement between us on the direction to be taken in seeking a solution.  If the all-party committee suggested already is to be fruitful there must be a certain ceding of sovereignty on the part of the Government in the functions of this committee. The issues before us are larger and more important than the fate of any political party or Government.</P>
    <P>Recommendations on unity should be advanced as soon as possible and this Dáil all-party committee should be the agency for contact with Britain and other foreign Governments on this issue and the immediate priorities of achieving political talks.  I do not believe the Government can maintain any longer the sole responsibility for this question.  There are divisions in their ranks and there are divisions in other parties.  There is also a great deal of division of opinion in the country, and people are looking for a clear lead.  Above all, we must set our faces against the emotion giving way to the forces that are looking for armed confrontation. We should leave no diplomatic stone unturned.  We are very much alone in the world as a result of the foreign policies we have followed, and I would not hesitate to go to the East European camp, to the Soviet Union or any other country in <Col N="1006" /> an effort to get the right diplomatic pressure exerted on Britain to grant us the political conditions in which talks can take place, internment can be ended and some settlement achieved that will lead on towards a united country.  Short of actual war I am for any initiative that puts pressure on Britain to come to the conference table to negotiate.</P>
    <P>There is no use fooling ourselves that the British Government are in a co-operative mood.  They are not.  To believe that peace can be totally restored and that Irish unity will be on the agenda with the departure of British troops is to be deluded.  From the little contact I have had with Northern problems over the years, I believe that the real crux in our struggle for unity is the division in political allegiance between the Unionist and Nationalist elements of the population of this island.  There are Deputies here who can pretend that problem does not exist; I wish I could so pretend.</P>
    <P>I would have hoped that people would not use this debate as a means to vindicate opinions which they allege they held previously.  It requires no great crystal-ball-gazing talent to know that relations between the British Army and the minority have broken down.  Any good relations that existed between them broke down more than a year ago, and it required no particular insight to foresee that the army without political initiative by their Government must end in disaster. Any illusions that anybody might have had that the British Army would act in a disciplined fashion at a time of public excitement were dispelled last Sunday by the conduct of the paratroopers in Derry, and we have made a call that those men should be court-martialled for the murders perpetrated.</P>
    <P>This, of course, will not bring the dead back to life.  The people killed in Derry were ordinary working-class people, and the count down of those killed in the North of Ireland indicates a preponderance of casualties on the civilian side.  If this violence extends from Northern Ireland the same preponderance of civilian casualties will apply.  I do not think any Deputy here <Col N="1007" /> should indulge in the traditional kind of politics that have been indulged in on the Northern issue over the years. I would hope that after Derry we could say goodbye to the practice of using that issue as electoral fodder in the Twenty-six Counties.  I do not know one Deputy out of any party present in the House who is not for unity. I do not like the political or economic policies of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, I am critical of his methods, his dilatory approach but I do not question his sincerity on the question of Irish unity, nor do I question the sincerity of any other Deputy on that issue.  Therefore, I would hope that we could say goodbye to this super-patriot cult which would suggest that some people in this assembly think more deeply about and long more strongly for Irish unity than other Deputies.</P>
    <P>The problem is how to achieve the unity we all desire.  It must be admitted that it will require the British Government's co-operation.  I think even Deputy Neil Blaney admitted that in the past few weeks.  However, the present British administration appears to be locked in total collusion with the rump of the Unionist Party in Northern Ireland on security matters and all other vital matters affecting the area.  We are up against the enormous problem of how to get through to Mr. Ted Heath.  The all-party committee to which I have referred must be the agency for contact with the British Government and any other international institutions.  The times are too dangerous for the Government to manage this on their own.  All of us should say clearly to our constituents: &ldquo;There is no division between any of the political parties in Leinster House on the Northern issue.  Nobody claims to know all the answers.  Nobody can claim to be more zealous than any other party.&rdquo;  Quite frankly, not one amongst us knows all the answers.</P>
    <P>Plainly, the British Army must go. What comes in its place?  I have no clear answer.  It is clear to me, however, that our problems do not disappear with the departure of the British Army. We must get some form of security force in the area.  I believe that it will not be possible to avert civil war unless <Col N="1008" /> we can get some political shortterm settlement which, for a period, will create a sharing of power between Unionists and anti-Unionists in the North of Ireland on an equal basis, so that they may learn in a preparatory period what it would be like to live together in a united Ireland.  We will not wake up one Monday morning and find ourselves in a united Ireland, which has happened without an intermediate stage of the most intense political effort.  If a civil war takes place I do not believe that a united Ireland will be possible in this century or in the next.  Not a great deal would be achieved by a civil war.  We would have hundreds of dead and political boundaries altered minutely, perhaps, but substantially the problem of division would remain the same.  But there would be many more Derry funerals.</P>
    <P>I get the impression that many of our people are like children who are afraid of the dark, when looking at this problem: &ldquo;We want our war with Britain but we want our totally dependent trading relationship with Britain to be retained intact.  We want a war by resolution and manifesto, but not a war by bullet and bomb.&rdquo; Apparently the mental picture of some people is that the British Army departs, the subsidies are withdrawn, and unity is then ours&mdash;as Deputy Blaney said, we can take them over.  I do not believe we can.  I admit to the limitations of my view.  I cannot fool myself.  I cannot believe that this would be so.  If ever we reach the stage where that happens and where those people come in with us without any trouble, I will have been totally wrong and I will admit it.  I make the following admission: I am convinced of the present intransigence of the Unionists towards coming into a united Ireland.  I do not believe they will be deserted by the British Tories in their intransigence and in their opposition to a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that Border incidents can be very dangerous indeed.  I believe we could find British tanks reach nearer to Lucan than we think if these Border incidents developed. I believe this about British Tory thinking.  I do not think British Tories would greatly care about intervention <Col N="1009" /> and penetration deep into the territory of the Republic.  The question I put to the House is: to whom would we appeal in that eventuality?  Where are our friends in the world to whom we should appeal on the head of British invasion or British penetration of our territory?  What would be our stance internationally if the British penetrated 50 miles into our territory and then withdrew, just to let us know exactly the kind of wogs they thought we were? What would be our reaction?</P>
    <P>I get the impression that, in thinking about this situation, many of us have the idea that some miracle will take place, or that there will be some flash of recognition and all that was troublesome before will be rendered smooth.  I do not believe that.  I wish I could.  I may be wrong, but I think the times are too serious for any of us to begin to criticise one another on the basis that some are less sincere than others about our desire for unity.  We in this Assembly should come together and pool our resources, our contacts and our opinions.  This all-party committee should be serviced by a full-time secretariat.  It should not just be a casual weekly meeting of politicians of different parties smoking their pipes and talking about the weather.  It should demonstrate to the people that it is the unified focal action of the Dáil parties on the whole issue of unity, the living expression of the agreement of Dáil Éireann on how the matter should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that there is this danger in the period immediately ahead of us, and I have referred to this danger before, the possible destruction of free institutions of democracy.  So far we have shown a determination to resist any tendency in this direction.  One consequence of the continuing impasse in the North, an impasse created by the British Tory Government with the continuation of internment without trial and the impossibility therefore of seeing the SDLP taking part in talks&mdash;a determination we support&mdash;one consequence of this continued confrontation between the streets and the British Army, must be a growing movement away from Parliament and free institutions in this part of the country.  There is a very serious <Col N="1010" /> danger that this could happen down here.</P>
    <P>In such a situation we will have to consider something like a national government.  That time has not yet arrived, thank God, but it may not be very far away.  I see no service to the cause of a united Ireland if democracy fails and free institutions wither away here.  This could happen very rapidly. The people who would be responsible for the withering away of democracy on this side of the Border would be the elected representatives in this Assembly if they were unable to sink the party differences that belong to more peaceful, normal times.  They would be responsible for burying democracy. They would be accessories to the burial of democracy.  It would be no fitting tribute to the dead of Derry to see democracy fail in the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>These are testing times for all of us. We must all do our best to avert what could be a disastrous turn of events in our history.  We must bury party differences and come together to provide a unified approach to this whole question.  There may be some unforeseen intervention which could avert what I fear; there may be a change of Government in Britain but that looks doubtful at present.  The question remains whether the Taoiseach and the Government really appreciate the gravity of the situation we are now in, the furnace which the future may hold for us all.  I wonder whether the journalists, the media generally, know what the future may hold for them and the freedom of expression which they have at present to comment on public affairs.  Quite obviously if democracy goes, if there is an end to free institutions, the limitation on freedom will not simply apply to this assembly.  It will apply to every institution, to newspapers and free expressions of opinion in the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>My despair is this: I do not think the Tory Government give two hoots what happens to democracy in the rest of Ireland.  We owe it to the Derry dead not to despair, to keep control of our emotions.  What the people of Derry want from us is a constructive contribution.  Our tribute to their sacrifice should be to discover how <Col N="1011" /> we construct the peace, how we get a unified people on the basis of that peace?  If I am right in thinking that the crux of our problem is a division in political allegiance between Unionist and anti-Unionist on this island, who but a madman could suggest that war would settle our problems?  Who but a madman would suggest that 3,000,000 people have the digestive tract to swallow 1,000,000 people? Because that is what we will be asked to do.  Forged with blood what kind of unity would result?  It would be the unity of the abbatoir.</P>
    <P>The last funeral in Derry which evoked such interest was the funeral of Cusack and Beattie in the summer. Now we have had the funeral of 13 people.  No man should be rash enough to say: &ldquo;I have been proved right by this event or that event in the North.&rdquo; Let us grow accustomed to one thing. If the present course of violence continues, there will be many more deaths to mourn and many more gravesides to prove who was right and who was wrong.  We are an emotional people.  If the elected representatives at this time are not seen to have regard to the gravity of the situation, to the kind of sacrifice it demands, then other agents will act, other agents answerable to no creed or principle will take over.  The legitimacy of democratic institutions will be overthrown here and any possibility of a peaceful solution will be totally eliminated.  There is no doubt that these violent agents will not be so scrupulous, will not be too worried about means and will not be too worried about results, because finally I am not unconvinced that many of the people calling for change in the North are, in fact, even more interested in political change in the South.  In many of the most revolutionary slogans we find lurking an ambition to run the old State, the Twenty-Six County State, rather than trying to do what others of us are trying to do: facing up to the problems that must be faced if we are to create a united Irish political state linking Unionist and anti-Unionist.</P>
    <P>I did not intend to speak this long because there is nothing original in <Col N="1012" /> what I have to say except that I believe that this Dáil must have a far more purposeful role to play in giving leadership at this time.  I believe we should sink political differences.  If we cannot have a national Government, if conditions do not call for it at this time, I believe we can have a national Government in effect on the most important question before us, that of the North.  I believe the minority in the North would welcome this. We would be giving an effective answer to the forces of anarchy and disorder, who in fact, if they win through, will bring no real unity to the Irish people, nothing but death, destruction and graveyard slogans.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's decision to give financial aid to the alternative assembly in Dungiven.  It is the very least we can do.  It is a democratic forum in that area.  It is a democratic assembly and, as far as I am concerned, I am prepared to stand or fall with the elected representatives of the minority of the Six County region, with the SDLP and the other elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I began by saying I hoped, if our debate does not shine for oratory this time, that we will make up for it and we will be paying fitting tribute to all the young people, all the civilians, both Catholic and Protestant, who have died in this terrible conflict in the North over the last three years.  We will be showing that our Parliament here is not worthless or a vain enterprise if we show our people that we are serious and ready to make any sacrifices necessary in defence of the future unity of our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to all the speeches so far, some of them highly intemperate and more of them cool, calm and collected.  We on this side of the House have always expressed the view that war was not a solution to the reunification of our country.  There is no doubt but that we have a ginger group and if this ginger group had its way it would land us in the position where we should find ourselves faced with solving this problem without weapons.  It has long been held that force is not a solution for our difficulties but this does not deny the fact <Col N="1013" /> that we need a Defence Force here.  We need to strengthen the arms of State and we need to recruit extra men for the Department of Defence.  We need extra gardaí as well.</P>
      <P>A good plea has been made by Deputy O'Leary on behalf of the institutions of State.  Most Members of the House, no matter how they differ otherwise, will subscribe to this view. There has been a good deal of criticism in this debate today about lack of initiative on the part of the Government, not merely in this period but in the past.  I would point out to those who make those assertions that many times during the last 30 years the Government made overtures to the North but regrettably the extreme left wing movement made up of the IRA and others stepped in to spoil any movement towards unity.  All members of the House are well aware of this and it is, therefore, untrue to say that the various Governments here did not make the most of whatever opportunity presented itself to try to promote a better relationship with the North.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable also that when the Labour Government in England left power and the Conservatives came into power the hardliners in the North seemed to sense that they had acquired a new lease of life.  I went to the House of Commons to hear the former Home Secretary introduce the legislation necessary to send troops to Northern Ireland on 13th October, 1969.  I cannot help but contrast the attitude of the present Home Secretary, Mr. Maudling, with that of the then Home Secretary, Mr. James Callaghan.  In his speech he gave a summary of the fears of the Northern Protestants and he referred to the recommendations of the Cameron Report, which brought about the move at that time to police the North in a more favourable way, as it was then thought, by sending in the British Army.  The British Army came and regrettably, when Mr. Maulding came in, the first night he appeared on TV he said that the British Army were sent in to defeat the IRA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our long history and in our dealings with various British Governments, we had a good deal of duplicity; we went through periods of high propaganda, <Col N="1014" /> periods when British politicians spoke in the House of Commons with one tongue and outside with another. This time we had the British Home Secretary suggesting that he was sending the British Army into Northern Ireland to defeat the IRA.  It was the height of folly.  He did it for one of two motives, either as a Conservative Home Secretary seeking justification for the presence of the British Army in Northern Ireland, or deliberately to strengthen the hands of the IRA so that the militants among us would be seen to react.  It is not always possible in this House or elsewhere to profess peace, to profess unity through peaceful means, and I have my doubts of the genuineness of the British Home Secretary when he went deliberately before a large audience and stated that the British Army were being sent in to defeat the IRA.  The IRA at that stage were a very small unit and I am charging the Home Secretary with malice aforethought.  He said his purpose was to bring the IRA under control and I charge him with being an accessory to the addition of thousands of recruits to the IRA.  This was often done in the past by British Prime Ministers and Home Secretaries.  We should all regret that it should be repeated in 1971.  I suppose it was to be expected from an introvert Englishman who had never looked outside his own shores except, possibly, to deal with some remote colony or another.  He made a terrible mistake in that statement.</P>
    <P>All of us regret the dreadful incidents of last week.  In general, most people fear many more such incidents in the future but we cannot get away from the point that in a time of crisis we have to stand on our own as the people did in 1918 when another serious challenge faced the country.  I am glad to see all Members of the House, with the exception of a tiny minority, subscribing to this point of view.  We should not allow extreme militants to make the pace for us.  In this context the Government have been criticised on the grounds of inactivity in so far as making representations on our position abroad is concerned.  This is part of the usual desire to blame the Government for events over which we <Col N="1015" /> have very little control.</P>
    <P>If a Government purport to be a Government they cannot delegate responsibility to any committee of the House.  No doubt they may work in unison with the Leaders of the major parties in the House but I suggest to the House that it is not possible for any Government worthy of the name to divide responsibility for decision-making. If the country so wills, the Government can be put out of power. That is another story, but so long as the Government retain power they have to act accordingly.  In this context a good number of people seem to think the Government are not in power and, perhaps, this was responsible for the enormous parade, the enormous show of strength through the streets of Dublin yesterday.</P>
    <P>Be this as it may, I suggest we should not allow the extreme militants among us to make the pace at this stage.  Therefore, I was pleased during the past fortnight when the announcement was made that the strength of the Garda was to be increased and that the Army also were to be strengthened, because in times of national stress one has to preserve the law.  The institutions of State must be upheld at any cost and those who would try to pull them down must be put under.</P>
    <P>On many occasions in the past, in 1798, 1801, 1916 and subsequently, we had those among us who could be termed splitters.  We have them today.  Splitters are splitters no matter how one looks at them.  They split for a purpose.  We have them in abundance today.  This is why I was glad to see the Opposition in general coming to stand behind the Government at this time.  I must pay a tribute to the senior members of the Opposition for their stand at this time.  I also command all members of the Opposition as well as the actions of all others who have the real interests of the country at heart. One does not start off by knocking down the house one builds.  There is no place at this stage for burners, looters or robbers.  We will have to make this very clear in the coming period, that if we are to help the minority in Northern Ireland, we can only help <Col N="1016" /> them through the institutions of the State, not surreptitiously by unofficial means, not by violence and certainly not by acts of aggression as suggested by certain members of the community and a few Members of this House.</P>
    <P>If I gathered right from my visits to the House of Commons at that stage, Mr. Callaghan felt, when he was sending in the troops, that he was sending them in to separate the communities in the no-go areas, as he called them, but he did not bargain for the fact that there would be a change of Government and that the hard-line Unionists would get the upper hand and regrettably we have hard-line Unionists.  It is a regrettable fact that while we have intermingled and crossed the Border to and fro now and again even to various social functions, for upwards of 48 years, we had the people who purported to be the leaders in the North, people who were educated at public schools, some of them at Oxford and other higher centres of education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>And we have some of them here, people who, at the same time, marched behind the big drum and gave the ordinary worker in Northern Ireland the impression that if the Catholic population outgrew the Protestants, that was the end for them.</P>
      <P>Mr. Callaghan on that day summarised the position very well.  He dealt with those fears but he dealt also with the fears of the minority and the fears of the minority far outpaced the fears of the majority.  The general fear of the majority was, and is today, that if they lose power, if the Unionists lose power in Northern Ireland, that is the end.  They should be aware of the fact &mdash;I presume they are and so are their leaders&mdash;that the minority here are treated in the same way as the majority.  This is why I never cease to wonder&mdash;if Deputy Thornley wishes to comment on that, we have had a mandate for it time and again and he will get a chance of going before the electorate and putting his views; if he gets that mandate, all right&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope so.  It is these men who, as I said, acted up in a comic opera atmosphere&mdash;going out to celebrate the Battle of the Boyne, walking with the Apprentice Boys and so on&mdash;whom I blame for the debacle we are faced with at this stage after 50 years, and I also blame the ultra-patriots, who time and again when we tried to make overtures across the Border shot down our efforts.  It is not today or yesterday that we had these extremists amongst us, these pseudo-patriots, these true-blue republicans, setting out to climb the heights and secure the ultimate freedom, but what have they done?  They have provided a vehicle for the British Government to send their paratroopers into the no-go areas, as Mr. Callaghan said, and have provided a vehicle, in my opinion, for the murders which took place in Derry last week.  We cannot have it both ways.  We either subscribe to the democratic institutions of the State or we do not, and we cannot go about preaching pacificism with a book in one hand and a revolver in the other, and the sooner all of us get this clear the better.  This should not prevent us from adopting what this House and the Government deem to be the proper measures to deal with the present menace, the present position in the North.  This will not prevent us from helping our fellow-citizens there; this will not prevent us from sending all the aid we can to them; and this will not prevent us from providing shelter and refuge for them, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point we cannot subscribe to the view that we can shoot our way into unity.  The Taoiseach time and again, and especially since 1968, has made it crystal clear that Unionists or Protestants have nothing to fear from the Government here, or any Government established here.  He made it quite clear that there were equal rights and equal opportunities, but despite that, the teachings of those, who, as I say, should know better, down the years apparently are going to prevail and this fear of the dominance of the Catholic population is the root cause of this whole matter.  It is too bad then that the Unionists are going to <Col N="1018" /> insist that ultimately the whole of Northern Ireland will be a no-go area; it is too bad if the mounting deathroll is to go on; it is too bad if the British Government do not see the end of the road in regard to violence; it is too bad if the British Government do not see that they are feared and hated from the Continent of India, round about Africa and right down by the Bay of Biscay; and it is too bad that a dense Government in 1972 present that picture because I do not think this is the general aim of the ordinary British citizen.  But at this time this is the image which is being presented by the British Government.</P>
    <P>I remember 1940 when we were assembling an Army.  We did not have much of an Army before that but it did not take us long to assemble a fairly good Army and to equip it.  We also assembled a local defence force. I think we can do it again; I think we should do it, not with any ulterior motive but for the purpose of providing for law and order at home and ensuring that the elected Government, whatever Government that may be, carry the assent of the electorate, and will carry the assent of those who are violent among us and who believe that by bomb and bullet we can solve our difficulty.  What we did before we can do again and we should do it as rapidly as we can.</P>
    <P>We should not be too critical of a Government who have faced very difficult problems in the last three to four years, not merely problems abroad but problems at home.  When we refer to the under-strength of the Army or Garda it is my submission that we had priorities and we could not divide the money we had in such a way as to build up the forces.  If we did we would have neglected some other arm of our economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of the North of Ireland, the division of our country and the hope for unity of our country, there is no side in this House, no Deputy in this House and no party in this House who can with justification deal with the subject confident that he or they have always been right.  The division of our country and the problems arising from it have, unfortunately, found nothing but a <Col N="1019" /> sort of studied interest in this House in years gone by.  It has been an area of considerable neglect for many decades in relation to the functioning of this House and in relation to the administration of different Governments. In this debate when I hear any Deputy saying: &ldquo;Our point of view has always been correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;I foretold this&rdquo; or &ldquo;I said something was going to happen and I am entitled to a pat on the back for that&rdquo; I suspect such an approach because we have to bring to the problem of the division of our country a great deal of humility and I hope a great deal of dedication and sincerity.  It is a problem which has grown by reason of neglect over many years past and it is a problem which is today much more acute and much more difficult of solution than it might have been some time in the recent past.</P>
      <P>We have this debate today because of the shock everybody felt at the events that took place in Derry last Sunday where by reason of the inevitable logic of an unjust situation defenceless people were shot down, murdered&mdash;and I do not think we should be the slightest bit reluctant to use that word &ldquo;murdered&rdquo;&mdash;by British forces, by soldiers of the Queen, acting presumably on orders, firing directly at defenceless people and having done the damage, having killed 13 people, then proceeding, through their officer, to create a web of deceit, trying to suggest that events had occurred which had not occurred and trying to prevaricate and set up the usual kind of excuse for those who have done wrong, that it was not their fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are having this debate because of that, because from the dreadful events of the last two years or three years, there is now a situation in part of our country where violence and killing are so common that people scarcely are concerned or surprised or shocked at events of this kind.  This is dreadful.  It has come about because in the last three years those who ought to have listened to the voice of reason did not pay heed in time.  Many opportunities have been missed.  Much could have been done in 1968, much could have been done in 1969, in 1970 and 1971, <Col N="1020" /> but what might have been is now just so much more added on to the problem that we have to face.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no point in this House in trying to get the ear of the British Government, or trying to speak out from here to those in charge in Westminster, but let us at least state here and have it to say that we were able to say it, the sands of time are running out very fast in so far as the North of Ireland is concerned.  There has been lip-service to the desirability of a political initiative, of breaking the deadlock situation, of some new political intervention.  People say that. When is it going to take place?  The facts are known.  Internment was wrong. It has been declared by the elected representatives of the minority that as long as internment is there they will not talk or meet or discuss the common problem with others.  That is a fact and, if words mean anything, presumably that is a fact that everybody has to live with.  It is no good wishing that their attitude might be otherwise.  It is no good saying that perhaps if they put it in a different way a whole lot of other things might be possible.  The plain fact is that they have put it on the line that as long as internment remains they will not be in a position to talk or to discuss what is a common problem facing all of us.  Does that mean that things are to end in that situation and that with internment continuing there will be no talk but just a continuance of a deteriorating situation in which one incident follows another and there is the cumulative effect of a whole lot of incidents into a situation of almost complete civil war?</P>
    <P>I do not want to make any suggestions from here but it appears to me that this is a situation in which farseeing and big-minded intervention is required from the British Government. I do not think anyone now regards the Stormont situation, the Stormont Government, as important.  The tide has receded from that position.  I do not think anyone could imagine the possibility of the restoration of the Stormont situation as it was three or four years ago.  It just is not on; it cannot happen.  Whatever is going to take place in the future, everybody realises that there is going to be a very <Col N="1021" /> drastic and profound change.  In that situation, if we are not to foresee more bloodshed, more killings, more funerals, more distress, this is the time if ever there was one, when the Prime Minister of England should take this matter entirely into his own hand and initiate a new movement on the political stage which may bring some prospect of success.</P>
    <P>The British troops are there.  We will not go back over the circumstances in which they arrived in 1969 or the climate in which they arrived or the way in which they were greeted by the people at that time, but it is perfectly clear now that the British troops in the North of Ireland are regarded with hatred by the people in the minority there.  It is clear that if there is to be any stage set for fruitful discussion, some decision must be taken to change the troop situation in the North.  A phased withdrawal has been mentioned. Whatever it may be, they are now a source of provocation, of fear and a source of division and polarisation in the North.</P>
    <P>I know there are difficulties about a United Nations force.  It may be that it is possible for some other international police force to be made available in the North.  I can appreciate that you could not, at least, in my view you should not, withdraw British troops without providing some other force in their place but, if confidence is to be restored in this part of our country, some form of police force or security force must be there to give a feeling of protection and security to both the majority and the minority.  I should like to see some steps taken in that direction and I believe that can only be done by the personal intervention of the Prime Minister of England.</P>
    <P>Many of us were there in Derry on Tuesday.  As other Deputies have mentioned, I think anyone who was in Derry, in the church, at the funerals, will always carry with him the memory of the poignancy, the dreadful sorrow, the awful calamity and the tragedies that had afflicted the people of Derry and the unfortunate families concerned. As I was there, I could only wish that in that church on that occasion at that funeral there might have been <Col N="1022" /> some representative of the British Government or, indeed, of the Stormont Government, somebody there to see what had happened, this tragedy that had beset a community and 13 different families.  Anyone who was there and saw it must feel a responsibility to do something to avert a repetition of a tragedy of that kind.  Unfortunately, there was no one there to see from those Governments and one can only hope that public opinion can convey the message to the British Government and to the Government in Stormont of the immensity of that tragedy.</P>
    <P>We declared a day of mourning. The purpose in doing that was to emphasise the shock felt by, it is fair to say, everybody on this island, in relation to what happened last Sunday. It was a national day of mourning on which our people mourned with the relatives of the 13 persons killed in Derry.  That day of mourning and the fact that it was held and that these deaths were marked in that way must have some effect on public opinion outside this country, outside this island. Is it too much to hope that the message in some way may get home to the Government in Britain and to those who have present responsibility in relation to the North of Ireland?  A nation does not go into mourning for nothing and this nation went into mourning because a tragedy had occurred, something dreadful had happened and we marked it in that way because that was the only way in which a small country can ask for justice from a more powerful neighbour.</P>
    <P>The cry for justice that went out from the national day of mourning yesterday was a cry that can, I think, be fairly said to come from the 13 graves of these 13 victims.  It was a cry for justice from the future government of this country, a cry which, I hope, will be listened to by those who have responsibility.  That day of mourning was, of course, used by others here in this part of the country for their own fell purposes.  They were not concerned with the division of our country, with Partition, or with the eventual reunification of our country, North and South, and they used this opportunity to turn an honourable, decent expression <Col N="1023" /> of sympathy and sorrow into an occasion for rioting and destruction. I should like to join the Taoiseach in condemning those who used the occasion for the purpose of destroying the building occupied by the British Embassy here.</P>
    <P>In his speech today the Taoiseach recognised, belatedly perhaps, that this State is threatened by forces, groups and movements which operate under the cloak of patriotism but which are concerned only with the destruction of democracy.  I share the views expressed by Deputy M. O'Leary who referred to this a short while ago.  We have got to be very certain where we are going. The division of our country and the deprivation of citizens of Ireland of normal civil rights are things about which we know and things about which we feel.  These are things with which we are concerned.  We would like to be able to solve these problems. Unfortunately there are those who use the frustration we feel in order to try to destroy this institution of parliament and the democracy we have here in this part of our country.  They are people willing to use the North as a sounding board for all sorts of destructive views and aims.</P>
    <P>Do people, I wonder, realise the dangers involved in this?  We had Deputy Blaney's speech here today. He came in to preach what?  War. What kind of war?  Civil war.  What kind of gospel was he preaching?  The gospel that Irishmen should get guns into their hands and shoot fellow-Irishmen. He stood up there and he said: &ldquo;As I said before I say now.  I was right then and I am right now.&rdquo; This is the Deputy who denied in this House time and time again that he ever advocated violence in relation to the North.</P>

      <P>Very well.  I accept that and I apologise to the Deputy. May I say that there is talk about republicanism. We had it from Deputy Sherwin to day and we will probably have it from other Deputies.  The implication seems to be that there is some benefit conferred if one can say: &ldquo;I am a true republican.&rdquo;  No matter what one's political affiliations may be, I think that on both sides of this House, in our own way, we all seek and strive for the betterment of our country.</P>

      <P>There is no particular virtue in anyone saying that he is a better republican than somebody else.  If one works for Ireland, if one is concerned for Ireland, if one strikes sincerely for the betterment of the country, then, whether one is a good republican or a bad republican, one is certainly a good Irishman, and that is the important thing.  I would urge those in the Fianna Fáil Party who have their own differences and troubles&mdash;Deputy Haughey, Deputy Blaney and others&mdash; I do not know whether or not Deputy Blaney is in or out of the party&mdash;not to make a fetish of republicanism because, once one does that, one is merely cheapening the possible work one can do for Ireland and Ireland at this time needs, I believe, the services of all parties and of all Deputies in this House if we are to achieve any solution to our problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a debate in which it is impossible to speak with any pleasure.  I think we would all agree about that.  I should start by congratulating Deputy Blaney on something and while I hold no brief for Deputy Blanev, I think Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy O'Higgins descended from their normal impeccable standards of Parliamentary debate by implying that Deputy Blaney was <Col N="1026" /> advocating war here.  I do not think he was&mdash;as will be seen if his words are analysed when the Official Report comes out&mdash;nor do I think that Deputy Haughey, who as a very senior and important Member of this House waited here to listen to the debate, should promptly have been made a cockshot by Deputy O'Higgins.  I think we should congratulate Deputy Blaney on one thing and that is that it would have been absolutely disgraceful on the part of the Government if this debate had not taken place.  It must be recognised that we came in here to conclude the Defence Estimate and take up the Estimate for Fisheries. We owe it principally to Deputy Blaney and Deputy Sherwin, with all their faults&mdash;I am no particular ally of theirs&mdash;and to this party that this debate is taking place at all.  But for them it would not be, and we would now be within some hours of concluding Fisheries, presumably.  Let us at least put that on record.</P>
      <P>Like everybody else, I feel this is no time for point-scoring or &ldquo;I-told-you-so's,&rdquo; no time for hawkishness for the sake of hawkishness, no time&mdash;I agree with Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;for republican, holier-than-thou breast-beating.  I promise the House I do not intend to indulge in that.  At the same time, one must recognise the national mood at this moment and make allowance for it even if at times one thinks it is wrong.  Deputy O'Higgins referred to a mood of euphoria; I do not think that is the right word.  I think it is more a mood of horror and, above all else, frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was not in Derry on Wednesday; perhaps I should have been.  I was one of those in the crowd outside the Embassy.  I certainly was not a petrol-bomb thrower nor do I believe in petrol-bombing, either throwing petrol bombs at animate targets, which I regard as murder, or at inanimate targets, which I regard as rather pointless but, in the mood which prevailed in the city of Dublin that day, I could not find it in my heart to condemn those who threw bombs into the British Embassy.  I am glad we did not apologise for that action.  We had to accept the expense consequent upon it. <Col N="1027" /> I suppose this is a diplomatic necessity but I am sorry in a way that we did not say to the British Government that while we regret the destruction of their property, so long as they continue to send uniformed assassins to murder Irish people they must realise that by preserving an embassy in the city of Dublin they are running something of a risk.  It is no more than a statement of fact to say that yesterday the temper of people was so great that it would have required more than the army of police possessed by Mayor Daly in Chicago to turn aside the sense of horror and outrage expressed by the people.</P>
    <P>If anything sums up this debate for me and sums up yesterday's experiences it is that one word &ldquo;frustration&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;euphoria&rdquo;.  To me this is what the people were doing outside the British Embassy: expressing above all else the sentiment that there was nothing they could do, that they were irrelevant, that each of the parties here was, in a sense, irrelevant, that each of the parties here had failed in a sense to provide the leadership for them which they sought.  They could not, even if they morally so willed, march upon the North and destroy 17,000 British soldiers and dragoon one million Protestants into the South. In effect, they could do nothing.  That explains the petrol bombs, the bricks and the cheers and shouts of &ldquo;More, more&rdquo;.  Frustration explains that more than any sinister infiltration by armed groups.  It was a natural, incoherent, spontaneous reaction.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald said there must be an end to deaths.  This is true but what power do we possess to end deaths?  We cannot will an end to deaths by asserting in this House that we are opposed to them.  I have made this point again and again and I have been accused of being sympathetic to violence by making it.  Condemnations of violence in themselves do not stop violence; constructive solutions must be found.  It is not sufficient for us in this House to say we are ready to help the Government to do precisely what I am not clear; that we are ready to form an all-party committee to do precisely what I am not clear either. <Col N="1028" /> We must recognise that to those tens of thousands who thronged the streets of Dublin yesterday we have become a largely irrelevant institution and expressions of solidarity among us&mdash; and I do not wish to rock the boat of amity as it swims around this semicircular Chamber&mdash;do very little to palliate or relieve either the grief of the people of Derry or the frustration of the people of Dublin.  They serve only to remind us that perhaps the kindest thing that can be said of some of my colleagues is that the mahogany has entered into their souls.</P>
    <P>This poses the frightful dilemma of the moderate at this time when the shots are being called literally by violent men.  Does one accept this as a fact and embark on a process led by violent men with whose political, social and military principles most, indeed all of us, including myself, have nothing in common?  Or, does one, on the other hand, ignore the outrage and frustration of the people and allow oneself to be washed away in the tide of history like Dillon and Redmond were in Ireland and Kerensky was in Russia? I am not saying these are the only two polarities but they are the two frightful polarities facing not merely us but also unfortunate people like Hume, Cooper, Devlin and others in the North.  They have a similar problem. Do you join them or do you sit back and let them beat you?</P>
    <P>In between there is constructive leadership, a demonstration to them of our total involvement in their problems. Where do we find this?  Have we yet found it in this House?  I am not sure we have.  I assert again the pointlessness of simply condemning violence. When I said this before in this House in the context of the killing of an elderly man in the North I was accused of being a &ldquo;Provisional&rdquo; or an &ldquo;Official&rdquo; or something like that.  Now the mood of the House has changed. Why?  Basically, let us face it, because it is our lot who are getting it this time and not their lot.</P>
    <P>Violence can always be condemned particularly when it is provocative.  If evil men had shot from that crowd in Derry at the British Army I would have been the first to condemn them but in this instance no provocative violence <Col N="1029" /> was used.  Calculated, mass-murder, naked and unashamed, was revealed on television films and in the reports of those present, not merely Irishmen and women who are suffering the violence of the British Army, but people as detached, objective and removed from this conflict as an Italian journalist with no axe to grind, whose reports are striking in their starkness and honesty.  I suggest that a point which has not been made too often in this House is that we face a new and still more horrible situation because of the nakedness of the violence which took place on Sunday and because of the source from which it emanates, to wit, direct, as we can all accept it to be, and deliberate use of violence by the British military forces in that area. I shall return briefly to that point.  I do not want to go into it at any greater length at this stage in case I appear to be in any way sustaining violence, which I do not.</P>
    <P>What do we do?  That is the constructive question.  We take initiatives. Some of the initiatives taken by the Government have been good.  It is good that we should demand direct rule.  The Taoiseach is right to have sent the Minister for Foreign Affairs Deputy Hillery to New York and he is right to contemplate that Deputy Hillery should visit the EEC countries.  It is also correct that the last remaining vestige of our forces in Cyprus should be withdrawn.  No man of goodwill could fail to commend these exercises and hope that they worked but which, without wishing to make party political points which I am not doing, they must see in the present national atmosphere and in this crisis situation which we face to be both too little and too late. I called for the withdrawal of troops from Cyprus last August.  I was not supported on this even in my own party.  As far as I recall, Deputy Haughey also called for this withdrawal at that time.  Done then, it might have been more effective as an international gesture rather than now.</P>
    <P>I thought Deputy Sherwin made a very good point which I did not expect him to make and which I had down to make myself.  That was when he deplored the Taoiseach's suggestion that the troops should be withdrawn <Col N="1030" /> from&mdash;I quote&mdash;&ldquo;the predominantly Catholic areas&rdquo;.  This is a line of argument which I find personally intensely distasteful.  As far as I am concerned, the troops should be withdrawn. The public admission by our Prime Minister that there are things called predominantly Catholic areas, which should be treated in some way different from other unspoken things which presumably are predominantly Protestant areas, is not a chain of reasoning which is acceptable to me. The troops should be totally withdrawn, and not just the paratroops, and should be replaced by a United Nation peace-keeping force.  I realise all the attendant difficulties of this and I cannot go into these difficulties in what remains of my half hour but I consider these exercises to be absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>I disagree totally with Deputy Blaney in one respect.  I cannot quote him precisely, although I was listening intently to his words.  He seemed to imply that this issue, this turmoil in our country was one which ultimately must be settled locally.  I would put seriously to Deputies the complete opposite, that is, that the key to this whole question is on the level of international politics.  The British are concerned deeply with their foreign image, but not where it affects us.  It is no great secret that on the telephone on the night of the murders Mr. Heath told the Taoiseach more or less what he could do with himself with regard to the complaints about the horrific events of that day.  When I say that the matter should be dealt with internationally I do not think it can be dealt with by negotiations with Britain.  The time for cups of tea with British leaders, whether they be Tory or Labour, has passed.  I am glad Deputy Dr. Hillery has gone to the United Nations.  I would say that he should address the General Assembly and that he should do more than that. He should, with straightforward determination, demonstrate our independence of Britain&mdash;an independence which for a considerable time was demonstrated in the foreign policy of our former Minister for External Affairs, Deputy Aiken.  He should reassert that independence by appearing <Col N="1031" /> suddenly in Moscow to proclaim that we might indeed have friends in parts of the world other than those that we would seem to have.  In our home and foreign policy we have tied ourselves so closely to the British in respect of international and European affairs, with specific reference to the Common Market, that now when we find ourselves in conflict with the United Kingdom of which we have been, speaking effectively, a client State for so many years, we are at a loss to understand how to deal with the situation.  I suggest that this is because we have never understood the role of British imperialism in this country.  I suggest that the Minister should go to Moscow and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There are examples both of the effectiveness of such action and of precedents for it.  As an example of the effectiveness of it one has only to think of what the Prime Minister of Malta, Mr. Mintoff, succeeded in securing from the British and the Americans by threatening them not merely with the mighty presence of the Russians but with the rather less significant presence of the Libyans.  Also, there is an historical precedent for this.  Almost 51 years ago, when our nation was suffering similar stresses, the bones of a treaty were laid down by our present President and Dr. McCartan on the one side and the representative of the Bolsheviks on the other, a treaty guaranteeing reciprocal assistance on the basis of Bolshevik support for the recognition of the Republic of Ireland as an independent State.  Therefore, anyone who wishes to throw the accusation of Communism at me for making this suggestion had better check back on the history books and on the conduct in those days of our present President.</P>
    <P>We should hammer at the doors of the headquarters of the European Economic Community, although I fear that this would be a fruitless exercise because we would be speaking as an insignificant nation, as a nation which has expressed so much enthusiasm for the EEC that now its detachment from Britain will not be effective.  These things should be tried. Perhaps some of us do not realise how <Col N="1032" /> much the implications of this turmoil are being discussed around the world and to what extent they are being understood. One of my students, who is a German, was able to tell me this morning that she stayed up late to listen to German news bulletins last night in which the implications of Irish affairs were discussed.  We are not utilising these measures sufficiently.</P>
    <P>I know I may be accused of militism in what I say now.  I agree with Deputy Blaney on one point.  Not merely should we recall our troops from Cyprus but we should call up the reserve and put the FCA on a stand-by basis.  I know that I will be told at once that the fighting strength of these forces is almost minimal.  I will probably be asked: &ldquo;Are you really urging that we should march on Newry?  Are you suggesting that we could take on the might of the British Empire?&rdquo;  Of course I am not.  At the same time, let me repeat the point that this battle is being fought on an international level and unless we can alert the attention not merely of the British, who are largely disinterested in our problems, but of the whole of international public opinion, we will not succeed because we are too small.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the situation has now been reached that before the demonstration in Newry takes place on Sunday&mdash;and I do not know whether it will&mdash;the Taoiseach should issue a solemn warning that, if Newry on Sunday produces another Derry or another Sharpeville, we will not treat this lightly, that we will regard it as the creation of a major international incident.  I know this is dangerous.  I know there are evil men in the illegal armies who could provoke an incident which, in turn, would bring about the doomsday situation that we all fear. If the Taoiseach is to stand over seriously his role as second guarantor of the rights of the beleaguered minority in the North, he must issue this stern warning.  What faces us now is a situation none of us expected.  Deputies on every side of the House fear the horrific prospect of a doomsday situation provoked by the IRA either sincerely or wilfully on their part, the hoisting of the tricolour in Newry. <Col N="1033" /> This is what we feared in 1970 and 1971.</P>
    <P>We are faced now with a different situation.  The history of the question &ldquo;who provoked who first&rdquo; is now academic.  Was it the IRA or was it the British during the past two years? The excellent research carried out by <i>The Sunday Times,</i> of all people, would suggest it was the British Army which first changed from the role of impartial arbitrator to the role of aggressor.  However, the historians can discuss that after the contemporary citizens are dead, but we are now in a situation where the British Army have not merely assumed the role of aggressor but where they may provoke a doomsday situation.  This is a horrific thought and something we must consider.</P>
    <P>It may sound strange but we know the British military mind.  We know that professional soldiers, particularly of the type of commandos, marines and paratroopers, are taught and trained to kill and that no man who has acquired a skill likes to allow it become rusty but enjoys the opportunity to practise it.  We saw that in Derry on Sunday last.  We must accept the consequences of this.  We must accept that one of the consequences of this is that the heroes in the Creggan, the Falls, Ballymurphy or Ardoyne are not us; by now they are not even the official IRA; they are the Provisionals.  This is a horrific thought, a thought which leads me to the conclusion that these people, who in some cases are sincere and honest men but who in many cases are mindless exponents of fascist violence, enemies of democratic institutions both North and South, may yet some day so capture the public imagination in this island that all of us can carry our reverence for democracy into the dictating of our memoirs in the manner that Redmond and Dillon did in the early twenties of this century or that Kerensky did for 50 years in Russia. Let no one say I welcome that prospect. It is perhaps something that our own inertia here has brought about as much as anything else.  I detest it but I am trying to bring home to the House that it is something we face.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the military mind <Col N="1034" /> of the British.  What about the ordinary British people?  These are the ones we must reach.  This has been said by many people during this debate, including Deputy FitzGerald.  I know the ordinary British people better perhaps than anyone else in this House.  I was born in England.  I was brought up amongst them for 15 years; individually they are a likeable, decent, rather humourless race; collectively they have the longest record of mindless imperialism of any country in the western world.  Ireland, as far as they are concerned, is a remote, rather pleasant place of whose exact location they are not quite sure.  Its troubles derive from the peculiar whimsicality of the Irish and it is in no sense the job of the English working-class man to try and penetrate what those troubles are.</P>
    <P>However, this is changing and this is one of the few hopeful signs.  That very British Press which all of us have correctly condemned for its biased reporting of the events in Ireland is slowly changing, and more important the British popular press.  It is no good if we have <i>The Sunday Times</i> or <i>The Guardian</i> on our side, but today's <i>Daily Mirror,</i> a mass circulation newspaper, can bring out a five point plan calling for the withdrawal of British troops, a UN force, the end of internment, talks on the constitutional future of Northern Ireland and the appointment of a special Cabinet Minister to deal with the North.  When you get that into a paper that is bought by virtually every man who follows horses and soccer&mdash;and these are the English we have to deal with &mdash;then you are making progress, and I hope that we in the Labour Party will contribute with our links with the unions in making progress here to make the British realise that what is happening in the North is not &ldquo;our brave boys being shot down by masked murderers&rdquo; which undoubtedly is the impression that they have largely been allowed to acquire over the last six months.</P>
    <P>Let us finally be self-critical in the very few minutes remaining to me.  I hope I have been reasonably constructive here, and I hope I have left no <Col N="1035" /> one with the impression that I in any way endorse or approve of violence.  I simply perceive it as a phenomenon which is a hateful fact of life today in Ireland and which is daily winning more support.  The most unpleasant thing you can say about the horror of Derry on Sunday is that it was the greatest recruiting episode in the history of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>Let us then be self-critical.  What have we done to justify demanding that the Unionists come in?  &ldquo;British out&rdquo; is an easy slogan.  It sounds good chanted on a march.  In some cases here today we have been as two-faced as we have been over the last 50 years. We live in a socially unjust and denominationally unitary State.  The Protestants of the North have genuine fears of the constitutional and other biases we have here against them.  Dr. Paisley, with whom somebody rightly said in this debate we shall have some day to deal, has expressed these fears repeatedly.  Deputy Carter, in one of his lovely solecisms, said that in this House the minority was treated exactly as the majority.  That is the point, they are; they are treated as if they were Catholics, expected in the main to have Catholic schools, Catholic hospitals, a Catholic Constitution, Catholic laws. What have we done about this?</P>
    <P>Whenever we speak here of the repeal of Article 44 or the Article on divorce, or the laws on contraception and censorship then the other side of our sincerity is seen.  Can we really be receptive towards Northern Protestants and still take this double-faced attitude? Much is made of the necessity for a declaration of intent by the British that they will do certain things &mdash;for example, get out of the North over a period of 15 years.  How about a declaration of intent from the Taoiseach that he will set up a representative commission to remove all traces of discrimination in our laws and institutions?  We talk here about an all-party committee.  How about an all-party declaration of intent that we will do that?  Let us open a book and see how many of the 144 Deputies here will sign to that.  At least Griffith and Collins, to do them justice, faced with <Col N="1036" /> not a dissimilar situation, took into their closest and most intimate confidence the Protestant leaders of the day, the Glenavys, the Andrew Jamesons, before they set up the Constitution of their time, and not merely the Constitution but the whole complexion of the State.</P>
    <P>Let us show our goodwill to the North by calling in to Dr. Buchanan and saying: &ldquo;What do you think would be the correct way to run community schools?&rdquo;  Let us change the complexion of our State education. Let us cease to have a situation in which the hospitals are virtually in the hands, with a few exceptions, of a single group.  Let us raise our social services to a level where we can look on our industrious Northern brethren and ask them to join us.</P>
    <P>I have spoken very rapidly and intensely, not so much that I wanted to sound vehement but that I wanted to get a lot in in half an hour.  In the main, my feeling would be two-fold: first, if this conflagration is to be averted, then all the issues leading up to it must be transferred to a massive campaign the like we have never seen before.  We can no longer talk of civil rights simply.  Many of us would wish for the situation of 1969 when civil rights were the issue, but you cannot propound the solutions of 1969, 1970 and 1971 in 1972.  Even Harold Wilson has shown that the unity of our country is now on the agenda of one of the two great political parties, which it has not been since 1893.</P>
    <P>We must face up to our obligations, and we shall not face up to them either, on the one hand, by the empty green republicanism of associating ourselves with the dead who cannot speak for themselves and claiming their virtues as our virtues, as some of us tend to do; nor, on the other hand, by asserting the historic unity of this island as if it was an absolute statement to be accepted by the Unionists on any terms.  We must marry the two together and show that, while we cling to the historic determination that our island is one and indivisible, at the same time we accept that there are faults and flaws in our system, and we must make declarations of intent such as will allay the fears of <Col N="1037" /> the Unionists of the North, some of which are provoked artificially by British imperialism but some of which have been provoked by our own sloth and cowardice in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an appeal to the Members here to speak without emotion.  Having been born in January, 1922, I am one of the first free-born generation of Irishmen. Conscious of the efforts that have been made down through the years and the lives that have been given in order to achieve freedom, many of us will have some ideas that are generally accepted but also other ideas which are broadly different.  We were horrified to see this tragedy in Derry last Sunday.  How different has the tragedy of Derry been from the previous tragedies in Irish history.  The road to freedom and to basic human rights has been paved with the bodies of countless thousands of Irish men and women, added to by the 13 young men who died in Derry last Sunday.  This road to freedom is a difficult one.  We have not yet attained the ultimate freedom and nothing less than that will satisfy the great bulk of our people.  We shall achieve that ultimate freedom.  The methods that have been suggested are acceptable to me.  I do not believe in mob-law.  I believe that every effort should be made to ensure that there will be no further bloodshed, that Irishmen whether Catholic or Protestant, will not meet the end which those unfortunate people met in Derry last Sunday.  This bloody massacre in Derry by the British soldiers in this never to be forgotten bloodbath will certainly inspire many people in future generations to be conscious of the efforts made by people in the past, and of the attitude of British soldiers and British politicians to Irish men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These foul assassins have been applauded by the British Government and by the puppets in the North.  They have been publicly applauded for their efforts in peacekeeping last Sunday. This solution was adopted by the British and put into operation 50 years ago and it now takes regiments of the British Army, regiments of paratroopers, to be pumped into the North to maintain peace.  This shows clearly <Col N="1038" /> the failure of the settlement that was foisted upon us by Britain in the not-too-distant past.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in the type of brutality meted out by uniformed butchers last Sunday.  It is difficult to speak with restraint on an occasion like this, particularly when one feels for the unfortunate, innocent people who were shot down in cold blood. This human suffering and human misery we witnessed in Derry yesterday is a repetition of the tragedies of the past.  Deputy Sherwin said that every person up there is now a member of the IRA.  The mothers and families of the young men who were brutally shot down last Sunday repudiated that and said their sons were not a party to gun fights in any shape or form.  To suggest now that everyone there is a member of the IRA is to give licence to the British to shoot down innocent people at random.  I hope Deputy Sherwin will correct this.</P>
    <P>The relatives of the innocent people who were done to death last Sunday, and the people close to them, have repudiated that suggestion.  The funerals yesterday were a clear indication that they took no part in gun battles and that they were not members of organ-isations. To suggest that everyone there is a member of the IRA is to give licence to the British Army to shoot again at unfortunate innocent people. There are many people there who believe in peaceful means and who believe that they have a right to make a peaceful protest in their own country, and this they have.  They have a right to march in Newry next Sunday if they so desire.  It is their country and our country and impostors from outside have no right to tell us when or where we can march.</P>
    <P>We had the explanation given last Sunday by Major General &ldquo;Three-Shot&rdquo; Ford.  After the event he indicated that his troops fired three rounds at snipers on the roofs but shot 13 unfortunate people and injured 16 others on the ground.  This is the type of justification we get from British Army majors and this is the type of justification that has been given in the past.  We are well aware of the type of individuals who have been sent to this <Col N="1039" /> country both now and in the past.  We had Major &ldquo;Pitchcap&rdquo; Sirr, for example.  Yesterday I was told in Derry that many people believe that these people who shot down in cold blood the unfortunate victims last Sunday were high on drugs at that time.  It could be an explanation that these members of the British Army were high on drugs.  Major Ford and Major Tugwell and thugs of this type who made erroneous statements which have been repudiated time and again since are the type of people who are sent in to do the dirty work of Health and his companions.  I do not trust British politicians either in or out of office, no matter to which party they belong.  In the past they have not shown any great consideration for us.  I am quite certain they will not show any in the future.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the atrocities that took place during the arrest of personnel and later on in the confines of the internment camps.  We also know of the other types of individuals, the lords and the ladies, who have spoken out in the past few days.  We in this country have had our quota of lords and ladies, like Lord &ldquo;Cut-throat&rdquo; Castlereagh who imposed the Act of Union on this country.  It was said at that time that the Irish people had to pay for the very knife with which he cut his throat, just as they will have to pay for the burned out shell of the British Embassy.  I hope he got a good one on that occasion.  I have no regrets about any action taken by frustrated people if they take it in an orderly fashion.  I can well understand the utter confusion in the minds of the people who attempted to protest in this way.  I do not condone it but I can understand it.</P>
    <P>We also remember another General, the &ldquo;Butcher&rdquo; Maxwell who in the not-too-distant past dug his limepits up at Arbour Hill and was fairly free with the distribution of ammunition, and the Black-and-Tans and other people who were sent here to crucify this nation over the years.  Last Sunday was a repetition of this type of foul and dirty deed.  On this occasion it was an unforgivable offence that unfortunate innocent children were gunned down <Col N="1040" /> at a range of one or two yards.  The attitude of soldiers in gunning down people at a range which was indicated by priests and others whose word I accept was the attitude of a savage or a cannibal.</P>
    <P>Those are the types of individuals who were sent here as a peacekeeping force.  They are not a peacekeeping force; they are an occupation force, occupying this country and buttressing the wall of partition.  I hope that the day is not too far distant when they will be gone completely from the country. We should tell Heath to get his murderers out of this country.  It is our country and we do not want them.  I am quite certain that in their own way the people in the North could do a far better job than the gang that was foisted upon us, the paratroopers and others.</P>
    <P>To further indicate the attitude to these murders, Mr. Heath and his advisers have indicated that they have further plans to send in more paratroopers and to pump into this country a greater number of troops to proceed on this foul trail of destruction against innocent people.  Too many people have lost their lives in this country down through the years by the assassin's bullet or in some cases at the hands of the British hangmen.  The British were never any friends of ours.  They are not concerned about us today.</P>
    <P>I heard many stories yesterday. When the paratroopers entered the Bogside many people who were close to them believe that they were high on drugs.  If people were playing &ldquo;Mauser music&rdquo; on the top of the flats, I am quite certain that a number of the paratroopers would not be around today.  Heath should be told to get these people out.  I am quite certain that the puppet Government in the North, bad as they are, could do a better job than the paratroopers and possibly do it in a more humane way.</P>
    <P>I do not condone mob law.  The institutions of this State should be upheld and we should do everything to ensure that they are upheld.  The word has gone out and should go out from each and every politician here that we stand behind the lawfully elected Government, that we will ensure that the people will have the <Col N="1041" /> freedom and the protection necessary, that we will not tolerate other forces taking the law into their own hands, that we will suppress them in every way possible, and that we will do the job we were sent here to do in an effective way.</P>
    <P>The brutality of last Sunday has meant that the true story of the occupation of this country has penetrated deep into the hearts of many people. Many men served this nation honourably in arms, Old IRA men and others, and played their part effectively down through the years to get for me and for many others the freedom we have today. We want to see the young men of Derry and Belfast and the young men of the occupied counties enjoying the same freedom as we have.  They are entitled to that freedom.  I want to say to the Taoiseach that I hope this Government will go forward now knowing that we are united here, except for one or two Members of the House. Unity of purpose is what we require. We must show the country, Britain and the world that we are united in this matter.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear some of the speeches from the Fine Gael and Labour Members today endorsing the actions of the Government and the speech of Dr. Hillery.  His appearance on television cleared the way for many people who had doubts whether the action taken was decisive enough.  We are well aware that decisive action will be taken in order to ensure so far as we can that we will work towards the unity of this nation.  I hope this House will be completely united in their thinking. I hope some of the erroneous statements that have been made by some of the speakers will be erased from the record and that they will be repudiated so that no unfortunate innocent people will be the victims of further gunfire because they have been branded in the way they have been here today.</P>
    <P>We require a strong and united effort because divided we are weak.  We must show on this occasion that we are strong, that we are united and that we will follow the policy laid down here today.  If this policy does not succeed then we must sit down and think out another one.  This policy must be given <Col N="1042" /> a fair trial in order to ensure that the people in the six occupied counties will have the same freedom that we have.  There may be some defects in the set-up here, as Deputy Thornley stated.  I do not agree that contraceptives will entice people into this part of the country.  I believe it is an insult to indicate that this is one of the factors.  There are many other major factors but that is not one of them.</P>
    <P>From this House a call should go to Irishmen serving in the British Army to throw off their uniforms and so show that they are not a party to this brutal murder which took place and that they will not endorse those tactics on fellow Irishmen.  If there are people in the British Army who are prepared to do this and to protest against this type of brutality we should find a place for them here.  We should ensure that they will be at no financial loss even if it means absorbing them into our own force here.  There is a recruitment campaign going on at the moment and I am quite sure if men are honourable enough to throw off their British uniforms and say that they do not endorse the butchery which took place in Derry last Sunday then we must ensure that we will find a place for them in our Army here, that they will be at no financial loss and that their service will be properly compensated.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the House to be completely united in our approach to show the world at large that we are united in relation to this matter, that we will ensure if a tragedy such as Derry takes place again we will have to rethink the situation and think out another means of dealing with a desperate situation such as that we witnessed last Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, may I say in relation to what Deputy Dowling said, so that he will not go home tonight believing what he said was what I said, that in speaking to people from the Creggan they informed me that their menfolk were members of the IRA.  It was not I who said it. It was the people from the Creggan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This emergency debate is being held here today because 13 unarmed <Col N="1043" /> civilians were indiscriminately shot by members of the British forces in Derry city last Sunday while holding a protest meeting to protest against internment without trial in Northern Ireland.  The slaughter of those 13 men has shocked the people of this country.  Indeed, it has shocked the people of the world. The publicity which it has received over the world and the world reaction to it demonstrates forcibly the enormity of what happened.</P>
      <P>One can understand the feeling of Deputy Dowling but I do not think that his contribution to this debate or the manner in which he delivered it can be calculated to bring the troubles in Ireland to an end, particularly when it came from a Member of the Government party.  I want to say that in my opinion responsibility for the present state of affairs in Northern Ireland and the terrible happenings on last Sunday must rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the British Government and the British people because the British Government represent them. I say that because the evil of Partition was created by the British Government over 50 years ago and having created that evil they tolerated a system of Government in Northern Ireland for the last 50 years under which discrimination against the minority there was tolerated, under which the minority there were treated as second-class citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was inevitable that the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland would sooner or later rise up and refuse to continue to be treated as they have been treated.  They did that in 1968 in a peaceful way through the Civil Rights Movement with John Hume, Ivan Cooper and the others.  The violence in the North was not started in 1968 or 1969 by the minority.  It was the people who had oppressed them for over 50 years who started the violence. One would have thought at that time that the British Government would have come in and seen the folly of their ways, have seen the evil of their own creation and that they would have brought about effective reforms at once which would have for the time being and as a temporary measure enabled the people residing in the Six <Col N="1044" /> County area to live in comparative harmony.</P>
    <P>The British Army were invited in there because certain sections of the minority were in real danger of being annihilated and the British Army were welcomed when they came because, as I said, they were supposed to come to protect the minority who were living in real danger.  I regret to have to say, and I think no reasonable person can contradict me, that when the British Government sent in their army, as a peace-keeping force supposedly, they bungled their way from one mistake to another.  In the short time they have been there it cannot be denied that the British Army have rendered themselves totally unacceptable to the minority in Northern Ireland whom they came there to protect and that as from last Sunday never again will the British Army be acceptable in Northern Ireland, never again will there be any confidence in them.  On the contrary, there will be hatred for them, and they have only themselves to blame.</P>
    <P>The first major blunder that was made was internment without trial.  I believe internment without trial was introduced as a package deal.  It was introduced in order that the Apprentice Boys' march in Derry might be suppressed and with internment came allegations of brutality against the British forces and the police in Northern Ireland who enforced internment. I have heard people denounce the Compton Report as not being impartial. As far as I am concerned the British Forces stand condemned on the findings of that report and I do not mind whether the findings are related in terms of excessive force or excessive brutality.  I do not mind what one calls it, but I believe the findings of the report, of men being made to stand against walls, of being subjected to excessive noise, amounts to brutality. I was shocked to look at a television programme in which responsible people in Britain seemed to stand over the findings of the Compton Report and to say that what was done was necessary.</P>
    <P>The next stupid thing that was done &mdash;it was referred to by the Taoiseach &mdash;was the cratering of Border roads. That was a senseless operation calculated <Col N="1045" /> to do no good but every harm. It was a senseless operation that could not possibly prevent people passing from North to South.  My native parish was divided by the cratering of roads: the road from one part of my parish to another was cratered.  That started up a lot of anxiety on both sides of the Border. It was another example of British Government bungling.  It is no use blaming the British Army.  They are a body of paid men operating under the British Government and it is that Government which must take responsibility for these things.  Many of the people in the British Army are young fellows earning their money in that way and following orders.</P>
    <P>Finally, there was the catastrophe of Sunday last.  I believe extreme force was used last Sunday as part and parcel of another deal.  That package deal was that in the predominantly Catholic city of Derry there was to be this march and there were to be speeches against internment.  Then militant Unionists decided they would have a march and that there would be a confrontation, and the Unionist march was held off by an undertaking that such force as was necessary would be used to put down the other demonstration. One might say that that force was used with a vengeance.</P>
    <P>They are three examples of the complete mishandling of the Northern Ireland situation by the British Tory Government.  I might be asked what solutions I have.  Of course, the long term one is the reunification of the country.  That will come, in my opinion, quicker than most of us think, notwithstanding recent happenings. I believe our entry to Europe will speed that up because once the economic border goes, as it will, the political border will be meaningless and will disappear.  However, until that happy day comes about, when the country is united by the general consent of the people of the country, steps will have to be taken to create a state of affairs in which all the people of the North can live without fear of intimidation and in comparative harmony.</P>
    <P>I believe the first thing that must be <Col N="1046" /> done is to withdraw the British forces. I have given the reasons why that must be done.  The British forces have lost all respect and I am surely making an understatement when I say that.  It is too much to expect that they could be accepted by any of the minority in the North.  I do not say for a moment that the British forces can be withdrawn leaving the people of Northern Ireland to work out their own salvation because if that were done I believe there would be prolonged civil war in which this part of the country would be involved, but a case can be made for bringing in a United Nations peace-keeping force and I think that if a case were made properly to the UN they would send in such a force.  I appreciate that an argument could be put up that the UN will not interfere in the domestic affairs of a country and that England is putting up that case within the UN. Northern Ireland never was a part of Great Britain, is not now a part of Great Britain and never will be.</P>
    <P>An argument can be put forward that a peculiar and exceptional set of conditions exists here, in the sense that the Six Counties are not really a part of the United Kingdom, that there has been this resentment of 40 per cent of the people of that area at being treated as part of the United Kingdom, that none of the people of Ireland ever agreed by their votes to the establishment of the Six County area.  Therefore I believe that immediately the British Army should be withdrawn and should be replaced by a United Nations peace-keeping force.  Circumstances have changed since that proposal was made before, have changed substantially and in such a way as to make an unanswerable argument for bringing them in now.  I believe, too, that the government of Northern Ireland should be shared on equitable terms between the majority and the minority there.  Indeed, I believe that even the Northern Ireland Government, if one may call them such, accept that.  The Prime Minister there is on record as having said not so very long ago that a Government in power for 50 years is bound to create problems.  He is also on record as making statements which <Col N="1047" /> would suggest to me that he concedes that government and power in Northern Ireland must be shared and shared immediately.</P>
    <P>Therefore my proposals are that a United Nations force should be brought in, and we should not accept that a case cannot be made for bringing them in, and that power should be shared and shared immediately.  I also believe that the British Government should interfere immediately to have reforms on the question of housing and to put these reforms into operation; to have reforms on the question of jobs and employment and see that they are put into force immediately.  We are living here and we are very concerned for the minority in Northern Ireland.  We are very concerned to see that all the people in Northern Ireland should be able to live together.  That was demonstrated this week by the spontaneous reaction of the people of Ireland to the happenings of Sunday last, the demonstrations we have had during the week, and I am very pleased to be able to say that in my own town of Cavan, there was a very gratifying demonstration from all sides and all creeds and all classes.  There was a Requiem Mass in the Cathedral at 11 o'clock and there was a Service for peace in our country in the Church of Ireland church at 11.30.  This is as it should be; this is the sort of relations we have between the different communities in this part of the country, and long may it remain.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for the Fine Gael Party on Justice, I would be failing in my duty if I did not refer to one major incident and some smaller incidents in this city of Dublin which marred the generally peaceful protests which were conducted yesterday.  I refer to the burning of the British Embassy, and I do not care whether it was the British Embassy or whether it was a factory, whether it was a private house or any other building that was burned. I say that I was absolutely appalled to see on the television screen that private individuals were acting as prosecutors, judge, jury and executioners, in complete and absolute defiance of the law. The Embassy was burned to the <Col N="1048" /> ground, but that is not the only case. We know that windows were broken in other houses and that people were threatened and we have to ask ourselves at this stage: Is democracy to prevail here?  Is this country to be ruled from the streets of Dublin by people who represent nobody, people who have not gone through the ballot boxes and obtained authority to rule? It would be a sorry state of affairs if the Government of this country were to renounce and renege their rights in favour of mob law.</P>
    <P>I do not accuse the Garda Síochána for standing by yesterday and the day before.  As a matter of fact, they have my sympathy.  They were left there without any protection, in the pouring rain, for 48 hours.  There was nothing they could do, but I think that what happened&mdash;I have not spoken in a political fashion&mdash;and what we saw happening on the screens yesterday and the day before is the inevitable result of a drift in the Government of this country over the last two or three years.  We have a weak Government, presided over by a weak Taoiseach. During the first few years of his office, he allowed things to drift within his own party and within the Cabinet, with the result we all know.  He has been allowing things to drift within the country.  I know that the position and the happenings in Northern Ireland have created a delicate situation, but delicate situation or no delicate situation, the events of the other day should have been anticipated.  I know that the happenings in Northern Ireland and the injustices which have been perpetrated on the minority there make it difficult&mdash;more difficult than in normal circumstances&mdash;for the Government here to rule, but I say that the Government have to decide as of now, at this point in time, whether they are going to rule, whether they are going to rule this country pursuant to the mandate they received from the people on 18th June, 1969, or whether they are not.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the burning of the British Embassy or violence of that sort in this city is doing any good to our kith and kin in Northern Ireland. <Col N="1049" /> I believe, on the contrary, that it is doing a lot of harm.  I believe that the burning of the British Embassy took the heat off the British Army in so far as public opinion was concerned in Northern Ireland.  I looked at the BBC television news yesterday evening. First of all, we had the burning of the Embassy given a very considerable period of time.  It was highlighted.  The fact that the security forces stood by was flogged to death.  And then came the funerals in Derry.  If the foolish people who burned the Embassy had not done that the British public on their television screens would have got the funerals in Derry.  As food for thought they would have had the 13 people who were done to death but instead of that their attention was distracted from the killings of last Sunday and the burials yesterday by the people who, even if they were well-intentioned, thought fit to burn the Embassy and distract British public opinion from the cause of the whole thing.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about spending money here for the relief of the people of Northern Ireland.  I believe that we have not yet got across to the British public or to the European public the causes of the troubles in Northern Ireland, the injustices that were there.  I for one will stand over the spending of very considerable amounts of money on propaganda, on bringing before the people of England, the people of Europe and the people of the world, the injustices that have been inflicted on the minority in the North and which have brought about the calamities about which we have been speaking in this debate.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by repeating that my solution is the withdrawal of British forces, their replacement by a United Nations force, the sharing of Government in Northern Ireland on an equitable basis between Protestants and Catholics and the immediate implementation of reforms there.  I again appeal to the people in this part of the country, to this small minority who have no mandate, to refrain from these acts of violence here because they will do no good to the cause of the re-unification of this country; they will do no <Col N="1050" /> good to the minority in the North but, on the contrary, they will take the heat off Northern Ireland and will project us as a people who are not governed here, who are living in an unsettled society, people who, as the British love to say and used to say, are not fit to govern ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming in at this stage there is no need for me to dwell on the demonstration of unity yesterday, the demonstration of the feeling of grief and of outrage through a very large part of the country.  There is one aspect I should like to mention, the fact that under trade union auspices &mdash;I am particularly proud of that&mdash;in Belfast, Catholics and Presbyterians prayed together, with each other, and not at each other as is so frequently the case.</P>
      <P>The sense of shock and outrage has been amply described by speakers from all parties but we could usefully pause a little to look at the situation that is unfolding as a result of what happened on Sunday in Derry.  We must ask ourselves whether it was a bunch of berserk soldiers getting out of hand or an act of deliberate policy. It is not possible at this time to be certain but I think the balance of evidence indicates that it was an act of deliberate policy, whether it emanated from a decision of Mr. Heath's or not. We cannot know whether he actually decided to let off a whiff of grapeshot, that to shoot down some of the natives was the way to carry out his policy, but the deaths of those 13 people at the hands of his paratroopers I think is an extension of British policy as expressed by Heath, the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One expects, if one has the sort of outlook about the British Army that I have, senior officers to lie about what happens.  That is not new, it is not shocking.  They have been lying solidly, in my view, since the British reinforcements went into Northern Ireland in August, 1969.  But then they have been lying pretty solidly about what they were doing all over the remnants of the British colonial empire since the end of the second world war.  It is not surprising or shocking, <Col N="1051" /> it is in character.  It is a little more shocking to see the front page of Monday's <i>Daily Telegraph</i> where the situation, contrary to what journalists had to say, was presented as a confrontation between the IRA and the army, a battle with shots fired by both sides, started by the IRA.  But again one expects the organs of British imperialism, if one has my outlook, not to tell lies every day, only to tell lies like that at moments of crisis, at moments of difficulty.  One expects them to be completely loyal voices of the British Government at moments like that and the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> and some other British newspapers were that on Monday.</P>
    <P>One expects commissions, not just in Britain but in Ireland and in other countries, particularly judicial commissions, to peddle whatever version of the truth their Government want.  The mechanism of selection of judges in many countries is such that one does not expect them to take a position hostile to their Government.  They would not have got there if they were the sort of people who could take that position anyway.  You cannot try the devil if the court sits in hell so nothing that any British commission will say will carry any validity with any people anywhere in the world except for British home consumption where it will be very valuable.</P>
    <P>All this indicates a tactic.  The British Prime Minister has shown himself to be a 19th century Tory in many ways since he came to power in his economic policy, in his willingness to see, quite ruthlessly, quite calmly, a million people out of work and I think he has decided that it is possible to get back to the <i>status quo</i> as it was before 1968 when the civil rights campaign started and the way to do this is the same technique which consolidated the statelet in the early 1920s, which is to kill some hundreds of people and then the rest of them are frightened and they acquiesce for a while, maybe for ten or 20 years.  If they start to raise their heads again kill a few more of them.  This is not new.  Hundreds of people were killed in the 'twenties, we were preoccupied and we have forgotten <Col N="1052" /> it, and not so many were killed in the 'thirties.  I think that Heath and the Ministers around him, the 19th century Tories&mdash;I would not even blame that attitude on contemporary Toryism which has evolved a little&mdash;but, the Selsdon men feel that if you kill a few hundred the rest will be frightened and you can go back to the <i>status quo</i> and that you need not reform Stormont and you need not bring in any of these inadequate and tiny little reforms that started getting under way at the end of 1969.  That is where we are at with Heath's policy.  That is what is revealed.</P>
    <P>Wednesday, indeed, Monday and Tuesday, but Wednesday particularly, in this part of the country, I thought was very revealing but I feel that, perhaps, I am reading the situation differently from any other people in the House because what came over to me talking to people, listening to people, going about, was the sense of impotence down here, the sense that we could do nothing, the sense of fury that we were powerless to do anything serious, apart from uttering angry words, to help or to defend the people of Derry.  That was very widespread through the country.  The burning of the British Embassy and the looting of some shops in Dublin and the rest of it is not an indication of strength but an indication of profound weakness and hopelessness.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney used a phrase where he said people were searching for some manner of ventilating their frustration that had been building up for two years.  Yes, they were but I think that Mr. Heath when he sees the sacking of the British Embassy in Dublin will laugh all the way to his yacht.  I do not think it moves him a little bit. I think it does indicate to him that we will use lighting conductors for our emotions, that we will go through the forms of protest, even to burning a building and looting some shops, but that having done that we feel we have made our protest and can go back to the situation as it is.  I think that it is an action of despair, an action of weakness.</P>
    <P>The tragedy about despair and weakness is that then you get the glamour <Col N="1053" /> of the reality which says: &ldquo;There is a gun.  At least that is real&rdquo;.  That is the equaliser, in the language of the detective stories.  So, you take a gun in your hands and you feel strong and you feel big and you kill somebody and the only person you kill is either somebody like yourself in income and outlook, of a different religion, in your own country, or else he is a poor, half-educated, ignorant, unemployed young man, often a decent, lost young man, from another neighbouring country.  That is who actually gets killed and, again, I think Mr. Heath is laughing all the way to his yacht because that solves nothing at all.</P>
    <P>I think that often the people are ahead of the politicians in their understanding of a real situation.  Perhaps, we understand the situation, too, and we do not dare to say it.  There has been great posturing and threatening in this House and elsewhere in the recent past which to me is pretty hollow, pretty unconvincing.  I do not think that within the present framework of policies that we possess, there is very much we can do because I think the British have the most ferocious leverage over us, that we have permitted them to have over the last half century.  For example, our official external balances are held in London in sterling and the private balances, vastly greater&mdash;the total together of public and private is getting to the order of £1,000,000.000&mdash; are in Britain, in sterling, capable of being sequestered, of various things being done to them.  That is a most enormous leverage that we have chosen to leave in British hands for the past half century.  A great deal of the ownership of our industry, on which the jobs of the ordinary people of Ireland depend, is in British hands. Our banks are very largely British. Two-thirds of all our export trade is with Britain.  So that the industries here that are not actually owned by the British are depending on British trade.  We have left all these different national hands in the mouth of the British dog all these years.  We have taken away these freedoms from ourselves. We have failed to establish these freedoms.  So, indeed, we are very weak <Col N="1054" /> and the joke to me is this: I think the realist is the Taoiseach.  I think that he has been taking what one might call a low profile over the last year or so, realistically.  That has been the profile he could take.</P>
    <P>I do not like being sharp about somebody in his absence so I am sorry that Deputy Blaney is not here but to me, today, the most ridiculous and most unreal speech was the speech of Deputy Blaney, well delivered, full of sincere passion but coming from a man who had been the organisational mainstay of a party that with two little breaks have been in power all my life and the party which had never asserted the economic or financial or commercial independence that would give us the right to take an independent posture, his position is a profoundly weak one.  The weakness of it was indicated by the two things&mdash; when you boil it down&mdash;that his speech contained.  I admire the passion and the rhetoric but when you boil it down he said two things: first, mobilise the Army and the Local Defence Force and send the Army to the Border.  If you do that, you enter the possibility of having a war.  That is the reality.  If you want to put the Army on the border, then the reality is that there may be a war with Britain. We leave aside for the moment the question of who would win where the Irish and British armies met up with each other.  We might have an opinion about who would win.  That is to leave aside the question of what would happen to the Catholics in the ghettos of Belfast and other cities. O.K., you might just blow the bridge at Derry and capture Derry; with luck, you might get Newry at the same time, but there is not any realistic hope of getting anywhere near Belfast.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney was eloquent about the number of arms there were in Unionist hands through gun clubs and other bogus methods of arming people and the number of heavy machine guns up there.  Does he not know that he is delivering the Catholic population of the ghettos of Belfast and other cities into the hands of these people? If you want the Irish Army to fight <Col N="1055" /> the British Army at the Border, that is the formula for civil war.</P>

      <P>Indeed, he did not. To be fair to him, of course he did not. But, there is no point in posturing unless you are prepared to follow the posture with reality.  There is no point in putting the Army at the Border unless the sequel is that if you get an event like the mortaring of a house inside the Republic or an event like the events in Derry last Sunday, you are prepared to use the Army.  If you are not prepared for the reality of confrontation, then you should not take the steps that lead to that confrontation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to those points in due course.  The full weakness was then revealed by the suggestion that the other important thing to do was to burn the medals and to give up the titles.  I despise titles of any description, in common with Bernard Shaw.  I think they are rather silly. People merit respect through what they are and they have personal names and family names.  That seems enough to me.  I do not admire titles but I do not think it is a significant contribution on a dramatic day in an important speech on a profound problem to suggest that they should send the medals to him and that he will burn them, and that they should give up the titles.  That is a measure, in fact, of the irrelevance and of the extent to which Deputy Blaney is a prisoner of the same problem.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is a dove; Deputy Blaney is a hawk today, both of them from an equally impossible position, a position of weakness, because we do not have the economic independence that would give us the power to take significant action against Britain.  We are in pawn to Britain in the ways I have mentioned and which I will not elaborate.  Obviously, it would be easy to spend a lot of time elaborating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1056" /> On the question of the EEC, again one sees the anomaly of the position of the Minister for Labour.  He could not say he is against it.  Presumably he is not against it.  Yet, joining the EEC will abolish any sort of sovereignty we possess at this moment.  Any opposition to Britain in EEC circumstances is utterly impossible.  There is a great deal of empty rhetoric.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have to have that and we should not have it after the 50 odd years of so-called independence.  The question arises then as to whom our opponents are.  I remember the Taoiseach saying this was a matter between the Irish and the Irish would settle it between themselves. I think the Taoiseach still adheres to that view.  Certainly I do. We may mean slightly different things when we talk about imperialism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was pleased by the human, decent and civilised reference made by the Taoiseach today, at a time of great emotion, to the Orange, or the Protestant, or the Unionist groups&mdash;many different names for overlapping sections of this island.  It took some political courage to do what he did and I welcome it.  I would, however, make an addendum.  Deputy Fitzpatrick said he thought Mr. Faulkner was willing to let the Catholics into government.  Mr. Faulkner has said repeatedly that he will let in only those people who promise they will not try to change the <Col N="1057" /> constitution.  The great impetus which is still giving a certain vitality to Orangeism is precisely the same impetus which achieved in the glorious revolution in England the greatest change in the constitution that Britain has ever known or, indeed, that the world has ever known, the overthrow of feudalism and the establishment of bourgeois monarchy.  The heroes were the Orangemen who gave their lives then to change the constitution and they might now usefully look at their own past for valuable and real lessons. The enemy is not the British people.  It is not the people of Northern Ireland&mdash; above all, not the working people&mdash; whatever their religious or political conception.  We have some political independence, but the division of Ireland was designed the better to rule both parts from Britain in the name of British imperialism.  This is the enemy. This is where one directs one's opposition. One does not have to degrade oneself by hating any person.  Those who do that are desperately in need of pity.  The British officers telling these thin lies are, in fact, pathetic and miserable people.  We have a need to hate oppression and institutions and a need to be charitable towards persons in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>Is there anything that we can do? We have heard a list of things from these benches.  We have read the five points in today's <i>Daily Mirror</i>.  Wholly admirable.  No problem.  But will it happen?  Can we make it happen?  Is there anything we can do to bring about the situation?  I believe that the something real we can do is to structure the sustaining of civil disobedience. We must not be frightened off because certain people will use it to engender a different type of violence.  For example, the people of Dublin were not deterred from demonstrating yesterday because certain people smashed a few windows.  Valid protest must not be put off because a few undesirables abuse the protest.</P>
    <P>We should use the resources of the State to sustain and help the civil disobedience campaign designed to make Stormont unworkable.  At this moment, more than ever, we have to put out the hand of friendship and trust and, dare <Col N="1058" /> one use the word, love towards ordinary Unionists in Northern Ireland who hate us and despise us and who believe that we have nothing to give them except forcing them into a state in which the rule of the church, which they reject and fear, will prevail.  There are two ways we can do this.  One is by the constitutional changes mentioned by many speakers.  Deputy Dowling in this regard said that contraception was not important.  It may not be important to him.  It is not important to a great many people, but it is important to others.  We know it is important to many of the people with whom we want to talk.  It is their belief in its importance that makes it a real issue and not our personal assessment. That applies also to divorce and to Article 44 and a great many other things.  Because certain people believe these things are important they are important.  I hope I have time to deliver myself of something that is to some extent a new thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>It may not be worthy of consideration, but I think it is.  One of the reasons for the desperate sharpness of the situation in the North is the chronic unemployment, a situation which has been made worse by the actions of Mr. Heath.  Industries based on the British economy fold up and people lose their employment.  We have a policy of spending money on Irish firms.  We have always understood that these firms were Twenty-six County firms.  I think we could usefully put the revenues of this State towards increasing the level of employment and the economic viability of undertakings in Northern Ireland.  It could be argued that many of these are British companies.  So are the companies down here.  There is precious little to choose from.  We should at this moment be putting out the hand of friendship in the most practicable way to the workers in the North, using our resources and the economic power of the State, slender as it is, to protect and expand employment in Northern Ireland.  This would be a gesture of goodwill of the most concrete kind.  It <Col N="1059" /> is a gesture that is possible and it is more necessary now than it ever was. We spend hundreds of millions every year.  If we want ships built, then go to Cork by all means first but, if Cork cannot cope, then go to Belfast; the people there are our people.</P>
      <P>We make claims of sovereignty in regard to them which, personally, I think are ill-judged because I do not think it helps unity, but that will be debated another day.  Those claims bring responsibility to help economically and this is a time of desperate need for that sort of help, gestures of friendship, of trust, of love.  At the same time&mdash;and this is very difficult&mdash; we can use our economic power if we will it, to coerce Britain a little.  In my view we can use it by systematically taking into public ownership British assets in Ireland.  I am perfectly well aware of the threat of disruption of the jobs of Irish workers in doing that but nonetheless it is possible and from the taken-over British assets we could build a national development corporation like IRI in Italy.  We would get the nucleus of a publicly-owned sector of the economy.  I think Britain would heed that.  I do not think she will heed burning Embassies or the three party Leaders going to Mr. Heath.  I do not think Mr. Heath is amenable to that sort of reasoning but I think British business is amenable to coercion&mdash;and I use the word explicitly&mdash;by the planned taking into public ownership of British assets in Ireland in such a way that jobs will not be lost here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we go on and use our political sovereignty to get real sovereignty by taking over sections of the economy, and the sort of economic sovereignty I have indicated, we would have some power to improve our social services. We would have some power to help the Northern economy.  We have always had power to change our Constitution so as to make it acceptable. We could therefore extend a hand of friendship, which is important, and we could therefore put real pressure on the British Government which we are not doing now.  In that way we might conceivably build some unity here.  At least we are united in wanting that. <Col N="1060" /> Having established political sovereignty, which we did nearly 50 years ago, we can go on from there to establish economic sovereignty with a considerable content of socialism.  We need a strong public sector.  We can either do that which would give us the power, the muscle and the genuine independence to take action <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain that will influence the North, or else we can go back to an EEC, a common market and, indeed, to an old UK position in which we were originally part of the United Kingdom and we shall get into a bigger economic United Kingdom in which we shall have no power to influence anybody.</P>
    <P>The dignified and impressive thing would be to stop whining, stop blustering, which does not impress anybody, and accept that we have no option but to be a tiny, non-sovereign, nonindependent cog in a much larger machine.  It might conceivably make us better off economically and it would mean that we squarely face the abandonment of dearly held aspirations towards unity and sovereignty which lie at the root of the conflict in the North at the moment.</P>

Ag an am gcéanna, tá sé feiliúnach go mbeadh focal amháin Gaeilge ar a laghadh le cloisint sa dhíospóireacht seo.  Luadh gur dochar a dhéanfadh sé.  Táim cinnte go raibh dul amú ar an Teachta FitzGerald agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh sé in iúl dúinn amach anseo nach é sin a bhí i gceist aige.  Admhaím go mb'fhéidir go bhféadfaimis feabhas a chur ar an bpolasaí a bhí againn maidir le foghlaim na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>It is difficult on occasions like this to marshal and express one's thoughts so that they may be useful and it is very difficult to make them appear original.  It is difficult to say anything that has not been said already in connection with the agonising and tragic farce that masquerades in an area of our country as democracy.  However, I avail of the opportunity to re-state the position as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> It is fundamental to any discussion of this matter that nobody here can accept&mdash;certainly I do not&mdash;that the terms and regulations which govern the freedom of any Irishman in this country should be found in the statute book of an alien power.  That is fundamental in this discussion and bears repetition.  When we discuss how the Army might have behaved better in this way or that way, the mistakes that have been made in the recent past, and the possibilities in regard to how the farce should be continued, we should be very careful not to depart from the fundamental principle that is shared by this country and every other country, that no power, however mighty, has the right, no matter what they claim, to decide where the destiny of any man born in another country lies.  The sooner that the English Government&mdash;and here I distinguish between the English Government and the English people&mdash;recognise the fact that this is the problem here, the better.  No solution, military or political, can be attained here so long as they hold that they have any right here.  I am prepared to accept that we accord them certain tolerance until such time as the sins they have committed have been repented but what is fundamental here is that which is accepted as being fundamental by the British people.  At mention of this question we are taken back invariably along the road of history and we are told how the problem came about.  While that may be factual I am not bound to accept it.</P>
    <P>I often wonder what the reaction of the British Government and people would be today if any of those groups of people, such as Germans, Scandinavians and French, who were planted in England in the past, set themselves up in different parts of England attempting to make the case that, notwithstanding that they and their forebears have lived for many years in England, they were entitled to reject English authority over them, if they attempted to establish that the terms and the conditions which govern their freedom were to be found in the statute books of France, Germany or any other country.  I do not think the British people, in their <Col N="1062" /> sense of justice, could accept that what they would not tolerate at home from these other people is something which we here should tolerate from the erstwhile English or Scottish.  As other speakers have said, it is easy to be critical of the situation but not easy to offer a solution.  No human problems are amenable to easy solutions. I am prepared to accept as Irishmen and women those people who came to reside on our island but I will not accept those who, while wishing to claim any advantages there might be and claiming that they are Irishmen and women, criticise the shortcomings which, in their opinion, exist in this part of the country but who will not allow others the right to be critical of them.  As I see it, much more of the blame and of the guilt lies with them than with us.</P>
    <P>While I do not consider contraception to be a major issue I would endorse what Deputy Dowling said in this regard.  If I could go from this House tonight in the knowledge that there was nothing between me and Irish unification except the matter of contraception, I would be very happy.</P>
