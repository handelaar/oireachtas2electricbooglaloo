    <Title>Inter-Party Committee on the Implications of Irish Unity.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of the inter-Party Committee on the implications of Irish unity have been agreed by the leaders of the three main parties in this House.  They are as follows:</P>
      <P>With a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland situation it has been agreed to set up an inter-party Committee to establish the common ground between the parties represented on the committee on the constitutional, legal, economic, cultural, social and other relevant implications of a united Ireland and to make recommendations as to the steps now required to create conditions conducive to a united Ireland.</P>
      <P>The following are the names of the members nominated by the party leaders to constitute the committee:</P>
      <P>Representing Fianna Fáil:</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael O'Kennedy, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education,</P>
      <P>Deputy Patrick Smith,</P>
      <P>Deputy Vivion de Valera,</P>
      <P>Deputy Frank Carter.</P>
      <P>Representing Fine Gael:</P>
      <P>Deputy Thomas F. O'Higgins,</P>
      <P>Deputy Richie Ryan,</P>
      <P>Deputy Patrick Harte.</P>
      <P>Representing Labour:</P>
      <P>Deputy James Tully,</P>
      <P>Deputy Conor Cruise-O'Brien.</P>
      <P>It has been agreed that the chairman will be one of the Fianna Fáil representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee are an informal committee consisting of members of this House: they are not a special nor select Dáil Committee.  Secretarial services for the committee will be provided <Col N="1603" /> by my Department and, in the course of the committee's deliberations, they can call on the assistance of the inter-departmental unit, which acts as a clearing-house for the activities of Departments generally in relation to the North.</P>
    <P>The formulation and implementation of policy is the responsibility of the Government.  The consideration of legislation is a matter for the Oireachtas. In setting up this committee we are acknowledging that there are difficulties to be resolved in attaining Irish unity and that these require careful study and, above all, a concerted approach by the three major parties. This Government and their predecessors without exception have declared their abhorrence of violence and their opposition to the use of force as a means of achieving Irish unity.  This is not just the policy of the Government: it is fully shared by the two main Opposition parties in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The task of the committee will be to identify other areas of the common ground we occupy and to give expression to a common view so that we can all work together constructively to bring our aims to fruition.</P>
    <P>So that we might better accomplish that task I expect that the members of the committee will report back to the leaders of the respective parties, to keep them informed and to seek their guidance where necessary.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the first meeting of the committee will be convened in a fortnight or so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This committee have at last been set up.  We have been advocating the setting up of this committee for some years and although there has been delay in getting them established their establishment is a welcome development.  It provides for a review of the matters referred under the terms of reference.  There are a number of matters which this committee can usefully discuss and ultimately, I hope, report on.  Under the procedure which is to be adopted, the usual Dáil procedure of a Select Committee does not apply.  That may, in certain circumstances, restrict while in other ways it may allow the committee to consult other interests not represented on it.</P>
      <P>In reviewing within the terms of reference the proposals outlined, I believe that this committee should embark on their task without any feeling of restriction in any way on their operations.  It is our view that the time has come for the introduction of a new Constitution.  The old Constitution which has been the subject of some comment in recent years was divisive, and should be buried quietly.  Since it was drafted the world has moved forward in many ways.  The Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Conventions of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms have all come into being.  As a State, we have adhered to these organisations and we have operated within their framework for a number of years now.  In that connection it is obvious that any document which will be redrafted should take these changes into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other areas as well as the question of unity in which steps might be taken by this committee to convince those who up to now have refused to accept the inevitability of a united Ireland that we are anxious that they should play a full and effective part.  We should consider the whole question of the Seanad: whether it should be abolished, or whether <Col N="1605" /> there should be a radical reform in the method of election.  Nobody can be satisfied with the present set-up in the Seanad.  Without going into detail, it was designed for one purpose, and it does not even serve that purpose. If this committee is to consider the whole question of the unification of the country, the position of institutions like Queen's University in Belfast must be taken into account.  We must endeavour to convince the people in the North of Ireland that we are anxious to reconcile the establishment of institutions here to enable them to play a full part, a part in which their rights and their position will be recognised, based on the acceptance by all of allegiance to Ireland.</P>
    <P>While there has been verbal approval from the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers for the concept of a peaceful solution to the unification of the country, we must carry conviction to everyone that there can be only one elected authority, that is, the Dáil, and that the Government elected by the Dáil and the institutions established under the authority of the Dáil are the only legitimate institutions.  There can be no double thinking about this such as is evidenced from time to time either in comments or in pin-pricks by some representatives of the Government party and other people who have no authority to speak or act for the people throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This is not the occasion to speak at length on this matter.  It has been the subject of many references over the past few years.  We are glad that at last the recommendation we made almost three years ago has now come to fruition in some form, if not in the precise form originally intended.  On behalf of this party, I have nominated a formidable, competent and experienced team.  I could not do more and I need say no more on that aspect of the matter.  I believe that if it is approached in the spirit in which it is established, we can look forward to progress being made by the committee. It would be a mistake to expect too much from it.  It would also be unwise not to make a definite attempt to use <Col N="1606" /> all our resources here and elsewhere to try to solve this problem which has bedevilled Anglo-Irish relations and caused so much loss of life and suffering.  So that we in our time will be worthy of the traditions we have inherited, we must try to secure a lasting peace in which all our people can live together in harmony and in justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to discuss the matters which will be the subject of debate over the coming months as part of the work of the committee.  There will be ample time to discuss them.  We all have our own views and I am sure they will be fully discussed when we meet to decide what is to be done.  There are a couple of very brief points I should like to make.</P>
      <P>Having been a member of the last committee on the Constitution, I am particularly anxious to see that we do no have the same exercise as we had before.  Having sat for quite a considerable period and discussed matters at great length, we found that the committee was used by the Government as a political device to try to beat us over the head when we had finished. I expect that will not happen again but it did happen the last time and we all have very unhappy memories of what transpired.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I am quite sure that the matters which we will be discussing will be discussed in a very frank manner.  Any decision reached by the committee will be on something that has been talked about.  So far as I know there is no vehicle for making recommendations which would be binding on anybody.  I was hoping that this would have been clarified a little more but I suppose at the first meeting of the committee it will be decided on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, I am particularly anxious that the committee will not be used to take this very important question completely off the floor of Dáil Éireann.  There is a grave danger that it will be used, or could be used, for that purpose and, if an attempt were made to raise it here you, Sir, would be in the awkward position of having to say: &ldquo;This matter is being discussed by the committee and, therefore, it cannot <Col N="1607" /> be discussed here.&rdquo;  We should be very careful not to usurp the authority of Dáil Éireann particularly since we are not a select committee.</P>
    <P>I should also be glad to know if there will be a time limit on the deliberations of the committee.  The last committee was open ended.  It met occasionally over a considerable period and eventually, when it suited the Government, a decision was made that the committee had to be finished within a week.  We burned the midnight oil to finish.  We then found that the matters we had discussed were completely ignored and something which we had decided against almost unanimously was used by the Government and some people were left with the impression that it was a recommendation by the committee.</P>
    <P>I should be glad to have these matters clarified.  As I said at the outset, I will not try to discuss what will be discussed by the committee when we meet.  Every member of the committee must have his mind clear at the first meeting on what exactly our powers are, what exactly we are trying to do, what the end result is likely to be, and on whether the final decision will be a recommendation which will be discussed in the House or will be decided on by the Government irrespective of the views expressed by the committee. If that is to happen, there is no point in having discussions.  I believe that discussion like this can bring results and can deal with matters which possibly could not be dealt with in any other way.  I want to be sure that this is the intention.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the committee having no authority to call people.  I do not believe that is terribly important.  We can get information. People who do not want to give information would be of very little use to the committee in any case.  On the question of whether we should invite people from the North, it is important that we should know the point of view of all those who will be affected ultimately. It must be remembered that, if the Constitution is to be changed, the people in the Twenty-six Counties will be affected also and not only the people in the North.  Some people seem to <Col N="1608" /> think that we should aim at pleasing a certain section in Northern Ireland only.  I believe that we should take account of their views but we must also consider what is best for all the people in the country.</P>
    <P>We should know when we start what exactly we are trying to do.  I should also like to have some idea whether there is to be a time limit on the deliberations of the committee or whether they will drag on and on until somebody decides: &ldquo;This is a good time to stop it&rdquo;, and something might happen which would upset completely all the discussion which had taken place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three points arising from Deputy Tully's speech.  First, there is the question of a time limit.  It would be wrong at this stage to impose a time limit on the committee.  Secondly&mdash;this will answer the first point also&mdash;so far as the activities of the committee are concerned I would suggest that the deliberations of the committee, which would then have a life of its own, ought not to be the subject of questions in the House but that the whole subject of the reunification and the Northern Ireland situation should not be ruled out thereby from questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point I was making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Thirdly, there is the Deputy's reference to the former committee. His reference is timely in that the former committee operated on its own.  The other Members of the House knew nothing as to what was happening.  Even I, as head of the Government, did not know, although there was a member of the Government on the committee.  I have suggested in my statement that there should be repeated references back to the leaders of the parties so that they be kept informed.  As is indicated in my statement, the purpose of the committee is to define areas of common ground so that we can move forward from that common ground to the aims that we all share.  I would not like to be more specific than that because it would be wrong to bind the committee. As I said yesterday, the committee will <Col N="1609" /> consist of mature Deputies who will know how to behave and I am sure they will be anxious to bring their work to an end at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one question: Can the Taoiseach say whether he considers that, if the committee reach a unanimous recommendation on points, that should be considered to be a good reason why it should be accepted by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Of course, the reference-back procedure would ensure this.</P>

    <Title>Unit Trusts Bill, 1970: Second Stage. [Seanad.]</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I would like to say that this Bill, which deals with a complicated subject on which we have had no previous legislation in this country, has received a searching examination in the Seanad and a very large number of amendments to the original draft were tabled.  I am glad to say that these amendments have improved the Bill in many important respects.  In addition, I undertook to examine further a number of suggestions which were made on Report Stage in the Seanad and I propose to introduce <Col N="1610" /> amendments on some of these on Committee Stage.  Legislation on unit trusts and similar investment schemes has also been under discussion in the Council of Europe and I have had regard in the drafting of this Bill to the consensus reached by the Council on a number of points.  I propose to introduce a few further amendments to the Bill as a result of the meeting of the Council of Europe committee in October, 1971.</P>
    <P>A unit trust scheme is an important medium of saving, particularly for people with small amounts of money to invest.  The money collected from the investors is invested by the managing company in stocks, shares, gilt-edged securities and other property which are put into a fund in the custody of an independent trustee company and administered in accordance with the terms of a trust deed for the benefit of the participants.  We are not concerned with private trusts but only with schemes which invite participation from the public.  Each subscriber acquires a fractional interest in the fund and dividends from the investment are paid to subscribers or credited to their account in proportion to the size of their holding of units.  The value of a unit will vary up and down as the value of the investments varies.  As subscribers buy more units, managers acquire more securities and, conversely, if there is a net withdrawal of units the managers sell off securities.  The advantage of this method of investment is that it gives a small investor the benefit of a spread of risk combined with skilled management; normally a fund should not contain the shares of any one company to the extent of more than 5 per cent of the total.</P>
    <P>The scope of this Bill is comprehensive in that it embraces not only the normal type of unit trust scheme in which investment is confined to company shares and gilt-edged securities but also schemes for the collection of money from the public for investment in real estate, usually buildings used for flats and offices.  In this I believe that I am going farther than other countries have done up to now.  The growth of property schemes is a very <Col N="1611" /> recent phenomenon and legislation for their supervision brings up problems such as those of valuation and liquidity which are different from those encountered in the normal unit trust type of operation.  I am satisfied, however, that the Bill which is before you is flexible enough to deal with diverse problems of control.</P>
    <P>Unit trusts have been subject to regulation by legislation in Britain since 1939 and in the USA, where they are known as mutual funds, since 1940.  More recently the idea has spread to the Continent of Europe where, however, the concept of a trust does not exist in the legal systems. The investment arrangement in European countries is governed by a set of fund rules and includes a managing company, but instead of the trustee there is a depositary bank which holds the investments.  I am convinced that the unit trust from of collective investment is the firmest framework in which to operate the three-cornered relationship of manager, investment holder and subscribers.  The development of these institutions in other countries has stimulated interest here and some schemes have been already established in this country while a number of groups are, I understand, contemplating the establishment of others.  It is necessary, therefore, to provide legal safeguards for investors on the one hand, and, on the other, to provide that the money collected under schemes of this kind will, to an adequate extent, be invested in the development of our own economy.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill provides for the registration of unit trust schemes and only registered schemes will be permitted to carry on business or advertise in this country.  The conditions for registration are designed to ensure that registered trusts will be run by persons of satisfactory probity, competence and financial backing.  I attach particular importance to the provision that the trustee should be independent of the manager.  The trustee holds the investments in trust for the investors and it is desirable that he act in their interests and that he should not be subject to <Col N="1612" /> any pressure which might be exercised if he were dependent on the manager.</P>
    <P>An application for registration may be refused, and this would arise if a manager or trustee was unable to meet one or more of the conditions for registration.  Registration of a unit trust may be cancelled under section 4 for breach of a provision of the Bill or if any of the conditions under which registration was granted were no longer being fulfilled.  The manager or trustee may appeal to the High Court against refusal of an application for registration or against a proposed cancellation of registration.  As a safeguard for unit-holders, I will have power under section 5, in a case where cancellation of registration is contemplated, to replace the manager or trustee and, in the interim period before the new appointment takes effect, to require the manager to suspend the sale of units and the publication of advertisements. The right of appeal to the High Court also applies in relation to the exercise of this power.</P>
    <P>The operation of unregistered unit trusts is prohibited under section 6. The prohibition extends to arrangements, resembling unit trusts, which provide for the participation of persons in profits or income from securities or any other property.  Such institutions may be similar to unit trusts but there is the vital difference that they do not contain any provisions for trusts, and if they are not prohibited the legislation could be very easily and completely rendered ineffective.  I feel that the inclusion of a trust is desirable in the interests of investors and that any arrangement not including a trust should not be allowed.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not prohibit investment by Irish citizens in the unit trusts or investment funds of other countries but it does provide, as I have already said, that these funds cannot carry on business here, and in addition, section 7 prohibits advertising by them.  There is nothing in the Bill that affects the present position in regard to the establishment of a company, so that nonnationals will not be precluded from participating in the operation of a unit trust provided it is duly registered in this country.  I would like to point out also that any unit established in <Col N="1613" /> this country which proposes to attract funds from abroad will face restrictions on operation of business and on advertising in other countries similar to those proposed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Advertisements relating to investment funds appear not only in Irish newspapers but also in a number of foreign newspapers and periodicals circulating in this country.  Some of these periodicals are high-class, and specialise to such an extent that they have a relatively small readership.  I do not wish the Bill to have the effect of preventing such publications from entering this country in view of their value to the commercial community and to those interested in the economy.  Section 7, therefore, provides for the grant of an exemption in any case where the cost of producing a special edition of such a newspaper or magazine for circulation in this country would be unreasonably heavy.  I do not intend to grant exemptions lightly and I would require adequate evidence to support a case that the production of a special edition would impose an unreasonably heavy burden on a newspaper owner.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned to ensure that persons contemplating the establishment of a unit trust will find in the legislation as much of the requirements which they will have to meet as it is possible to put into an Act and Deputies will find these requirements set out in detail in sections 9 to 15. They will appreciate, however, that it is not possible in legislation of this kind, where it is necessary to allow flexibility, to put all the requirements into an Act and provision is, accordingly, made in the Bill under section 8 to give me power to make orders in relation to a number of other requirements which may prove to be necessary for the protection of the interests of the unit-holders.  An indication is given in section 8 of the principal matters which may be provided by order.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House particularly to the fact that it is proposed under section 8 to give me power to provide by order that not less than a specified proportion of a trust fund shall be invested in Irish securities or other property in the State.  Deputies are well aware <Col N="1614" /> that an expanding economy such as ours needs investment capital and it is my intention that unit trusts should make a contribution to this investment as insurance companies do.  The two Irish life insurance companies have invested in this country a substantial proportion of the amount of their liabilities to Irish policy holders.  Under an informal agreement, the external life assurance companies operating here have undertaken to invest in Ireland to an extent increasing from a sum of 66? per cent of their outstanding liabilities to Irish policy holders in 1969 to 80 per cent by the end of 1977.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not prescribe the minimum level of investment by unit trusts in Ireland but instead leaves it to me to determine by order.  This method has the advantage of enabling me to vary the appropriate level of investment in accordance with changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out here that a requirement to invest in domestic assets is not exceptional and, in fact, several European countries have similar requirements.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage in the Seanad, amendments were adopted which had the effect of excluding from the scope of the Bill schemes of collective investment associated with policies of life or industrial assurance effected with assurance companies licensed under the Insurance Act, 1936.  As I explained to the Seanad when I introduced the amendments, these schemes fall into two categories.  The first is a fund for investment either in securities or other property which forms an integral part of the insurance company's funds.  The second is an arrangement whereby a separate management company, which is a subsidiary of the insurance company, manages a separate fund under a trust deed and the investments are held by a trustee.  I am satisfied that the exclusion of insurance-linked schemes will not affect the two main objectives of the Bill which, as I have already pointed out, are the protection if investors and the promotion of investment in this country. Investors in these schemes will have the protection provided for life policy holders under the Insurance Acts.  If <Col N="1615" /> that protection is thought to be lacking in any way in the light of modern practice and modern developments, I would expect that the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry, which is sitting at present, would make recommendations for improvements or a general tightening up of the insurance law.  The second main objective of the Bill, namely, investment in this country, is secured by the informal agreement to which I have already referred. I have therefore concluded that it would be unnecessary to oblige such insurance-linked schemes to be registered. At the same time, as I expect there will be some managers who will prefer to register even though not legally required, I propose to introduce later an amendment which would permit them to do so.</P>
    <P>The appearance of unit trusts in Ireland in recent years and the prospect of the development of the movement on a larger scale render it necessary to legislate for their regulation.  I feel that the enactment of this Bill would provide a suitable framework of control, and that it will be welcomed by Deputies.  I am anxious that it should provide for the establishment of a system of control which will be at once effective and conductive to the growth of unit trust schemes in this country and I shall be open to suggestions from Deputies on all sides of the House as to how it might be further improved.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been dealt with in great detail in the Seanad and those of us who have read the Seanad debate will realise that quite a lot of the work which would have had to be done here was done there.  Therefore our burden is somewhat lighter this morning and, the matter having been dealt with here on the Second Stage, there will probably be less to do on Committee Stage on what would have been, without doubt, a Committee Stage Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the Minister mentioned that the minimum capital which he indicated in the Seanad for such a unit trust would be £500,000.  I would not be competent to say what is the correct minimum amount but I presume <Col N="1616" /> that experience and investigation has indicated to the Minister and his Department that this is the correct amount.</P>
    <P>With regard to the safeguarding of the rights of investors, whether a small or medium-size investor invests in a unit trust fund or in an industrial share he is at risk anyway.  What is being done in the safeguarding clauses of this Bill is, first to make certain that not too great a risk is taken with his money and, secondly, that the managers will operate along a certain set of rules clearly defined, which will safeguard the investor, who very probably is somebody who neither has the time nor the opportunity to examine carefully exactly what is happening when he invests his money in a unit trust fund.  That is a good thing.  I am sure the headline was taken from the operation of unit trust funds in other countries. If unit trust funds have operated in Britain since 1939, in the USA since 1940 and are now developing in Europe, then a great deal of experience must have been gained.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Council of Europe has taken an interest in this matter and that he will be introducing amendments here based on the conclusions arrived at at meetings of that body.  He made it clear also that we are not concerned with private trusts.  Then he said that normally shares in any one company in a trust fund should not be more than 5 per cent.  An extremely well-placed safe industrial share is something that might be included as to far more than 5 per cent and shares that might appear to be more speculative could be supported within the 100 per cent holding of the unit trust fund by the fact that quite a large slice of the fund was taken up by almost gilt edge if not properly so-called gilt edge investment.</P>
    <P>At first sight, it may appear that the greater the number of units and the greater the spread the less the risk.  At the same time, areas of great safety can support areas of risk.  Perhaps the figure of 5 per cent indicated by the Minister is not the sort of figure that would be wise in our situation where there are certain industrial companies &mdash;perhaps not more than ten&mdash;which could be regarded as of great safety <Col N="1617" /> because of the nature of our economy and also because of their size and the nature of their manufacture.  It may be that these could be included at more than 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that he has gone one step further than anybody else in allowing the inclusion of real estate in a unit trust fund.  In this city the demand for new offices appears to be insatiable.  I suppose the same will apply in the case of Cork in a few short years.  One can visualise many offices being built in our cities.  These offices are taken up immediately they are available.  There is always a risk in regard to office property in that a person who is not the owner cannot set it and the income disappears and the value of the office drops but experience has been that the value of office blocks has not dropped but has increased. All the modern office blocks built in the last ten years have increased in value and also in rental and that seems to be the trend.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate when replying the percentage of a unit trust fund that he would like to see tied up in real estate.  If there were 100 per cent of a trust fund in real estate in this city what would happen in the unlikely event of there being too many offices and of their being empty?</P>

      <P>Every investment that is not gilt edge is a risk.  If this occurred it might be a case of having all our eggs in one basket, whereas the Minister is quite definite that he does not want all the eggs to be in one basket in relation to company shares and would consider that normally 5 per cent is the correct maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the question of foreign trust funds not being advertised here.  The Minister says that if at first sight this may appear somewhat unfair the fact must be taken into consideration that other countries do precisely the same thing.  We have then got to consider our size in relation to other countries and whether or not small and inexperienced investors should not have the advantage of seeing advertisements <Col N="1618" /> of foreign trust funds in the daily papers such as <i>The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent</i> or <i>The Irish Press.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  We are a very small nation and investment opportunities within the nation have some limits.  I could not agree more with the Minister when he says that we want to get all the investment at home that is humanly possible and do not want money going out of the country.  There is a possibility that we might be operating unfairly as far as the small investor is concerned, the person who does not read the <i>Financial Times</i> every day.  That matter must be balanced against the need to keep money at home.</P>
      <P>The Minister is taking pretty strong powers in this regard.  He has told us that in relation to the Irish Life Insurance Companies he has an informal agreement, not backed by legislation, that, by 1977, 80 per cent of their liabilities to their policy holders will be invested in Ireland.  That is a fair proportion. In the case of unit trusts the Minister will, by order, specify the percentage by volume that will be invested in Ireland.  Will the Minister tell us if he has in mind what that percentage will be or if, as in the case of the insurance companies, it is progressive and whether, in the first instance, it might not be possible for unit trusts if they arrive here in large number and large financial size, suddenly to get into the Irish market and successfully make a large volume of investment without distorting prices and buying from investors, therefore, at a bad price?  I should like to know the percentage the Minister is thinking about.  He makes it quite clear that he does not prohibit investment by Irish citizens.  He could not.  It would be unconstitutional and the flow of money from one nation to another is a matter that it is difficult to restrict. To prohibit Irishmen from investing in a British security is something that would have very serious repercussions. It is something that would be unlikely to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, an excellent job was done on this Bill in the Seanad.  It is <Col N="1619" /> quite clear from reading the debate in the Seanad that there was no disagreement or difficulty as between the Minister and the learned Senators.  It was a case of everybody trying to help. The debate is well worth reading That debate did a great deal to make the Bill a satisfactory one.  Therefore, particularly on Second Reading, there is not much point in carrying on a protracted debate here.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Second Reading speech here was largely on the lines of what he said in opening the debate in the Seanad.  He referred to the changes that were made.  So far as we are concerned this Bill is a necessary piece of legislation which we accept and welcome.  Although much Committee work has been done on it, the Minister will be introducing amendments and we might also introduce amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Donegan has said, the spade-work on this Bill was done in the Seanad and we are glad to see the good Senators doing a bit of work for a change.  Perhaps it is an example that might be followed with other complicated Bills; many of the Senators may be better equipped the Dáil Members to deal with the backbreaking work involved in Committee Stage&mdash;I include myself in that.</P>
      <P>Unit trusts are a good idea for small investors.  The only snag I see is that directors could have their arms twisted by some of their friends to make investments that might not be sound.  I hope the Bill will help in a small way to ensure that this cannot be done on a large scale.  We are dealing mainly with the small investor.  A loss of a few hundred pounds to him is of far greater moment than the loss of a few thousand pounds to a richer man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the idea should be to encourage investment in Irish industry.  It is a pity that so much of our money is invested abroad.  We hear sweeping statements about repatriating external assets but I do not know how we could do that except in the small way envisaged here.  I should like to see an effort made to try to ensure that this could be done with other classes of investors <Col N="1620" /> also rather than only with the small investor who is putting money into unit trusts.  The scope here is more limited than in Britain and, for that reason, there is a greater risk here than in Britain.  Deputy Donegan has said that real estate may be an outlet which is not normally accepted as being appropriate for unit trusts and even though there is a danger of our entry into the EEC I think the office blocks are a good investment.</P>
    <P>I object to legislation by ministerial order.  This is wrong because, where possible, the details should be written into a Bill even though they may sound very complicated.  There is one man who was a Minister&mdash;he is no longer a Member of this House&mdash;who made a habit of introducing ministerial orders on various matters. Frequently a Bill which was passed in this House turned out to have a completely different effect when that Minister and his draftsmen had finished with it.  It is a pity that any Minister should have wide powers to change the contents of a Bill simply by making a ministerial order.  Even though they are supposed to be put before this House, usually these orders go through without anyone noticing them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested certain safeguards with regard to investment outside the country and outside investors in this country.  Is the Minister satisfied that in the event of our entry into the EEC he can operate the regulations laid down in this Bill? Personally I do not see how he can. If we are unfortunate enough to go into the EEC all these things will be swept aside.  Overnight we will find that the contents of a Bill such as the one we are discussing will be useless. Perhaps the amendment to the Constitution will allow the Government to say that this was what the people decided they could do when they voted.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us if this is so.</P>
    <P>Deputies on this side of the House represent most of the people who have small investments.  Every effort should be made to encourage them to invest and to protect their investments. If that is the object of the Bill we support it fully.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1621" /> With regard to advertisements, the Minister has stated:</P>
    <P>Section 7, therefore, provides for the grant of an exemption in any case where the cost of producing a special edition of such a newspaper or magazine for circulation in this country would be unreasonably heavy.</P>
    <P>I am not clear about this.  Quite a number of English papers are sold here.  I have mixed views about them; some of them are all right but the same cannot be said for others.  Many of the English Sunday papers and the <i>Financial Times</i> contain advertisements for unit trusts.  Is it suggested that they should be precluded from including these advertisements?  Are these the matters the Minister says he can exempt?  For instance, will he require the management of the <i>Financial Times</i> to make a statement saying that it would cost too much to print a special edition omitting the advertisements and asking for an exemption? I am not clear on this point and I would ask the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had the advantage of reading the Seanad debate on this Bill, which I understand from my colleague has been informative. Therefore, I must apologise for my lack of briefing on the matter.  There are a few points I should like to put to the Minister and perhaps he might give me the information I seek.</P>
      <P>The unit trust movement has received a tremendous impetus in the last decade, particularly in Britain.  It was the first time that the small investor could dabble on the Stock Exchange without undue risk and without having a very informed background.  He was not forced to go to a broker who, in any event, usually was not interested in the small investor.  The unit trusts have a huge amount of money at their disposal and they have the finest financial advice available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was how the unit trust movement started in Britain.  A similar movement entitled &ldquo;mutual funds&rdquo; has been in operation in America; in fact, in that country the Stock Exchange system has been more open to the public than in Britain or this <Col N="1622" /> country.  The unit trust movement has started here and presumably it will develop.</P>
    <P>In so far as it encourages saving it is desirable.  Britain has found it necessary to introduce legislation in the past decade to govern this movement and it is appropriate that we should move on the same lines.  The Minister mentioned that apparently there is not the same control over unit trust movements on the Continent.  We have all read about the different speculators on the Continent in the last few years who have made large fortunes.  This Bill may achieve the purpose of control and thus prevent any such occurrence here.</P>
    <P>In the development of the unit trust movement here, it is appropriate that we should try to secure as much investment as possible in our country.  The unit trust movement should not be used as a means of siphoning away such investments to other countries.  At the same time, a unit trust movement must have a large, diversified portfolio. The ordinary small investor has the safeguard of a large spread of investment.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a point in his speech.  He said that the Bill would provide that unit trusts and investments funds of other countries could not carry on business here and that neither could unit trusts here, which propose to bring in money from outside, be allowed to do so in an uncontrolled way.  He said:</P>
    <P>I would like to point out also that any unit trust established in this country which proposes to attract funds from abroad will face restrictions on operation of business and advertising in other countries similar to those proposed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not quite understand this.  Will the restrictions come from here or outside? I am sure my failure to understand this is due to the fact that I have not read the debate in the Seanad and, had I done so.  I probably would not be seeking an explanation of this paragraph.</P>
    <P>On the question of advertising in Irish newspapers, we have all the cross-Channel papers coming in as well as <Col N="1623" /> American and continental papers, all containing financial articles and articles about unit trusts.  Some are general newspapers and some purely financial papers.  I do not know what restrictions the Minister has in mind.  I am sure he does not propose to restrict the movement of that type of newspaper or take any special control over their movements.  Perhaps he would clarify what particular advertising for investment funds he intends to restrict.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the question of restricting the movement of money into or out of the country, in the long term would the Minister tell me how he will reconcile the purpose enshrined in the Bill with the Rome Treaty?  If we enter the EEC, the fundamental concept is free movement of men, money and materials.  I know there will be a short period during which money from here will not be allowed to move freely but I think after five or six years&mdash;I forget the actual date&mdash;there will be free movement of funds.  We are moving into a common fiscal and taxation structure and perhaps we may have a common currency.  How will the Minister reconcile the restrictions, which appear to be basic to some of the points made in his speech, with the concept of freer money movements which the Rome Treaty will bring to us?  The movement from gilts and equities, the movement to control unit trust investment in real estate is interesting because up to now the unit trust movement has been largely confined to gilts and equities.  I once heard Deputy Donegan say that the only safe investment in the world was gilts. Is that right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In my introductory remarks I paid tribute to the Seanad <Col N="1624" /> for the manner in which this legislation was polished up there.  The Bill, as it emerged from the Seanad, was quite different from what I introduced. The Deputies who have spoken suggested that perhaps the Seanad was better equipped to deal with such a Bill than this House.  If the Senators had said that we might feel insulted but there is no doubt that I am indebted to the Seanad for its contribution in regard to this Bill and it would be improper if I did not give due credit to Senator Alexis FitzGerald for the major contribution he made.  It came from the Seanad as a far better and more comprehensive, although perhaps no less compact, Bill as a result of his contribution.  This is a type of legislation in which I am wide open to suggestions from all sides of the House.  The three Deputies who contributed here said that the best way in which this House could deal with this measure would be in Committee when we get down to details.  I can fully accept that.</P>
      <P>The Bill is generally welcomed for the two purposes for which it is specifically introduced, the protection of the investor in the first instance and also to try to ensure that the maximum amount of investment can be reserved for investment and development within the State.  As regards whether the legislation was examined to find out if we have the power in an EEC situation to maintain the effectiveness of the controls we propose to impose, I should say that this has been done and nothing contained in this measure conflicts in any way with the present manner of applying the Rome Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain how the simple arrangement of free movement of men, money and materials would be reconciled with his proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>You have the situation whereby a number of the items at present written into the Rome Treaty, as such, have never got to the actual implementation stage.  Certainly, as far as insurance companies and various other financial institutions of this nature in regard to which the free movement is envisaged in the Treaty. <Col N="1625" /> are concerned, there is the situation still whereby there are effective controls operated within the Community in this regard.  There is nothing to prevent me from making regulations.  I say this in reply to questions by Deputy Donegan as to whether I could indicate the amount of money I would insist on unit trusts reinvesting within the State.</P>
      <P>In regard to advertisements and the power I want to take in this Bill to control the advertising of outside unit trusts in this country which encourages small investors to invest outside the State, at the present time, as Deputies Hogan and Tully said, many of the popular daily and Sunday newspapers in the UK come in here carrying such advertisements.  I was asked whether I seriously think I could make arrangements to prevent them coming in carrying such advertisements.  That is my intention.  I said in my introductory remarks that I intend to be extremely rigid on this.  The exception would be financial periodicals which are important sources of information to business people here.  They might be exempted.  Most of the popular newspapers which come in are Irish editions.  They carry so many pages dealing with Irish soccer and rugby&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is speaking about their news content.  Their advertising content might very well contravene the provisions of the Bill and customs might have to open them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with these matters more appropriately on Committee Stage.  Deputy Hogan referred to this passage from my introductory statement:</P>
      <P>I would like to point out also that any unit trust established in this country which proposes to attract funds from abroad will face restrictions on operation of business and on advertising in other countries similar to those proposed under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He queried this in an effort to find out whether this restriction is built into the Bill.  At the moment an Irish unit trust or a European trust cannot advertise in an English newspaper and surely it <Col N="1626" /> is not unreasonable to ask that we would have similar arrangements to protect Irish trusts in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a further guarantee on the question of his right to prevent funds from being invested outside?  I question his reply on this because I do not think he is interpreting correctly the EEC agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The details can be dealt with on Committee Stage.  I claim to have positive knowledge in that respect.  Deputy Donegan asked a question on which I was pressed very strongly in the Seanad.  He asked if I were yet in a position to indicate the ceiling I propose to put on outside investment, on the amount that can be invested outside the State.  I have said we have had an informal arrangement with the external insurance companies who have been willing to invest here from 66.66 per cent to 80 per cent of their liabilities to Irish policy holders by 1977.</P>
      <P>In the Seanad Senator FitzGerald asked me whether I would write that into the Bill.  On this point, we did not have legislation of our own to go back on so we looked at legislation covering unit trust schemes in Britain and the US and we looked at reports of discussions in the Council of Europe.  Even at this stage I am not in a position to spell out the kind of ceiling I should lay down.  On the one hand, the manager of a unit trust, in his effort properly to invest and to do the best with his investors' money, might be restricted to reinvest totally in Irish securities, thus limiting his ability to do the best for his investors.  We must here try to determine a proper balance, the objective being to reserve as much money for investment in the country as possible but at the same time to give the manager of a trust sufficient scope to be able to play the market for the benefit of his investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Seanad I was asked whether I would fix on a percentage of 30, 50 <Col N="1627" /> or 70.  I was not very anxious to give a positive indication.  On this matter I should welcome a straightforward across-the-House discussion in the Dáil on Committee Stage and what I have vaguely in mind at the moment might be thrown out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  They want to attract investment and it would not be attractive from their point of view to have restrictions.  The European countries have restrictions at this stage.  Deputy Donegan asked me about the 5 per cent limit.  I mentioned this in my opening remarks. That is not built into the Bill.  It was an expression of opinion on my part. I look on this limit of 5 per cent as being primarily designed to provide security for a fund to prevent too many eggs being put into the one basket.  There is no doubt that the range of properties and shares available in this country is wide enough to make it practicable for a trust fund to find attractive outlets without any hope of being more than 5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to gilt edge Deputy Donegan said it might be no harm to have more than 5 per cent interest or involvement.  The value of gilt edge might not justify that high investment. Deputy Tully objected to the question of legislation by ministerial order in relation to the question of 5 per cent, which I already said is not written into the Bill.  That could be fixed by order.  We have only three unit trust operations within the country at the present time.  To introduce <Col N="1628" /> legislation for the protection of investors that might turn out to be too strictly aimed at protecting them, might have the effect of preventing the development of this within the country.  The aim should be to make it more attractive to the small investor.  We should not have the type of legislation which will act as a deterrent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister at the back of his mind that the Treaty of Rome regulation may be brought in and, therefore, it might be necessary by regulation to alter the whole thing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>A straight answer is that I am not influenced by that in endeavouring to have certain sectors of this controlled by order rather than by legislation.  I believe we want flexibility here whereby with development it should be possible for the Minister to change arrangements by order rather than have to change the legislation to meet it.  I spoke about the 5 per cent maximum investment of a fund in one company and I spoke about the question of a ceiling for investment outside the State.  In section 7 it is mentioned that it is necessary to have a degree of flexibility to be able to deal with the situation as it develops.  I agree that very often orders are brought into the House and the House may not be aware of a particular thing until it has happened.</P>
      <P>I am willing and anxious to make the fullest use of an open Committee Stage discussion in order to improve this legislation.  The Seanad were very helpful and there is no reason why, collectively, in this House we cannot be equally co-operative.  I have no preconceived ideas in relation to this matter.  This Bill is a pretty comprehensive measure having the dual purpose of protecting the investors and aiming at maximum reinvestment in the State.  I will welcome anything the House can do in relation to this on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this small Bill is to remove with effect from 14th July, 1971, the provision requiring the warehousing of certain British vodka for a period of three years.  Vodka of the type involved is required to be matured in warehouse for at least three years under section 2 of the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1947, as amended by section 1 of the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Act, 1969.  The corresponding Irish-produced vodka is not, however, subject to a maturation requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement <Col N="1630" /> this provision was held to be discriminatory in relation to British vodka and it was decided that it should be removed with effect from 1st July, 1971.  A section providing for this was as Deputies may recall, included in the Finance Bill, 1971, as introduced in this House.  I was advised, however, that the section affected the Money Bill character of the Finance Bill and, in the circumstances, I did not proceed with it.  I indicated at the time that I would introduce legislation at the first suitable opportunity removing the warehousing requirement with effect from the following day&mdash;14th July, 1971&mdash;and that in the meantime I was asking the Revenue Commissioners to remove the requirement administratively on this understanding. The Bill now before the House provides for the amendment of the immature spirits legislation to give statutory effect to this undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that this Bill is in fulfilment of obligations under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  One hopes a similar spirit of co-operation is to be found on the other side of the Irish Sea.  In respect of some provisions of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement the British Government would appear not to take them too seriously.  Cheese is one case and I think there is the problem of cream as well. Another issue that arises on that is whether they have taken seriously the obligation imposed on them with regard to the question of giving preference in state contracts to goods.  I have heard it said that in Northern Ireland this part of the agreement has not been implemented by the Northern Ireland Government, now suspended, and taken over by the British Government.  I should like to feel that if we are implementing loyally and legalistically every provision of this agreement we are insisting that the British Government do likewise in Britain and Northern Ireland.  We are entitled to that if we are to introduce this kind of legislation here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Bill itself&mdash;the Title of which has given rise to some levity, increased <Col N="1631" /> perhaps by the Taoiseach's references yesterday and today to mature politicians&mdash;we recognise the need for it but there are a few points of clarification which we might have been given in the opening speech.  I find persistently in dealing with legislation that the opening speeches by Ministers do not clarify aspects of the Bill and therefore make it very difficult for us to decide whether any action is required on Committee Stage.  When I try to raise points I am told: &ldquo;That is a Committee Stage matter.&rdquo;  One cannot know whether there is a matter for the Committee Stage unless one understands the reasons for the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I note that the Bill as drafted talks about vodka&mdash;</P>
    <P>that consists of spirits which have had a flavour communicated thereto or an ingredient or material mixed therewith.</P>
    <P>Does this mean there is a special kind of vodka which is adulterated in some way and that the Bill does not apply to pure vodka, or is all vodka adulterated in this way and, if so, why is it necessary to define the vodka in question in this way?  The wording must have some significance and we should be told whether all vodkas are adulterated, in which case the definition would appear to be tautologous, or whether the Bill applies only to certain kinds of vodka.  I know nothing about vodka, I speak in complete ignorance, but we should have some explanations given to us for the reason for that.</P>
    <P>At section 1 (2) the drafting follows that curious method of having three negatives, one inside the other.  It reads:</P>
    <P>vodka shall not be deemed to have been manufactured in the United Kingdom unless it has been made in the United Kingdom from spirits which have been manufactured there from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 22.08 or Tariff Heading number 22.09...</P>
    <P>I often wonder why it is necessary to work in such a devious way in drafting <Col N="1632" /> legislation.  The Parliamentary Secretary should tell us what are these materials under Tariff Headings 22.08 and 22.09.  It would appear here that the type of vodka we are dealing with is not only vodka which has the flavour communicated to it or ingredients or materials mixed with it, but that it must not be made from particular materials.  What are these materials? Why do they have to be disguised in this way?  Clearly there is some restriction here.  What kind of vodka are we excluding and why?</P>
    <P>I note that the UK is defined as meaning Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.  I know the Parliamentary Draftsman can do anything and can deem anything to be anything else but, as a simple matter of fact, the United Kingdom does not consist of these places, it consists of Great Britain and Northern Ireland legally and in international law.  The Isle of Man and the Channel Islands are not part of the United Kingdom.  Why we in this House should wish to add them to the United Kingdom and to deprive them of the degree of independence they have I do not know.  If the British Government do not feel it necessary to incorporate them in the UK I do not think it is up to us to get involved in this political activity.  It may be merely a case of drafting convenience but I prefer drafting precision.  The fact is that this Bill applies to vodka imported from the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and from two other territories associated with the Crown&mdash;the Channel Islands, which are part of the Duchy of Normandy, the only remaining part of it, and the Isle of Man.  It is an issue on which we in Ireland are often unclear. I recall in my time in Aer Lingus, after the Suez crisis in 1957, a problem arose of restriction of fuel supplies for aircraft.  The British introduced a system under which you could pick up at any one point only X per cent of the fuel you had picked up at that point in the previous four weeks. To simplify things it was decided to generalise this so that in the UK as a whole you could pick up X per cent of the amount of fuel you had picked up in the previous four weeks.  I pointed <Col N="1633" /> out to my superiors in the company that this did not apply to the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man but they paid no attention to me and consequently an Aer Lingus plane landed on the Channel Islands and found it was not entitled to pick up any more fuel because it was not part of the UK and had to limp back to Exeter and stop there to pick up fuel.  That is what can happen if you are imprecise in your use of language.  We should be clear as to what the UK is and what it is not.  We may wish to disintegrate the UK in its present form, a legitimate ambition if carried out peacefully, by removing from it Northern Ireland, but we should not at the same time be trying to add to it the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.  It would have been quite simple to have said that this Bill applies to vodka imported from the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands without having to purport to annex them to the UK.</P>
    <P>I also noticed from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that the Minister asked the Revenue Commissioners to remove the requirements administratively on the understanding that he was going to introduce legislation.  What was involved in this?  Are we talking of that curious power of the Minister to direct the Revenue Commissioners to do things, which emerged in the course of the events that led to the arms trial when inquiries by the secretary to the Minister for Finance disclosed the fact, hitherto apparently unknown to Ministers for Finance, that they could interfere with the Revenue Commissioners? Is this power, thus curiously discovered, now being employed in order to persuade the Revenue Commissioners not to apply the law?  I would have thought that the job of the Revenue Commissioners is to apply the law until this House changes it.  I am surprised that a Minister can ask them&mdash; a nice word&mdash;to make the changes administratively which are contrary to the law.  Is it the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have, at the Minister's request, been acting contrary to existing law for a period of ten months? This should be explained to us.  How extensive is this power?  Can the Minister tell the Revenue Commissioners to <Col N="1634" /> break the law in any and every respect?  Are there only certain laws the Minister can ask them to break?</P>
    <P>This Bill is a small one.  We are not objecting to it in itself but the presentation of it, as is the case in so many instances, is slipshod and inadequate and it does not conform to the standards this House should require.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to deal with the points I have raised.</P>

      <P>I suppose, to be consistent, in view of the fact that the Labour Party voted against the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, I should challenge a vote on the Second Reading of this Bill.  I wonder what the result would be.  Fine Gael having abstained on that occasion would probably vote with us this time and we could have a general election.  If I thought it would have that effect I would be only too glad to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I will.  It is not really important in my opinion whether the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands are lumped in with Great Britain.  My objection is that the Six Counties are lumped in there and there is not very much we can do about it.  I wish we could drown Britain in vodka and get them out of it.</P>

      <P>I do not think it matters a whole lot.  I do not think we should waste the time of this House discussing this.  Whether vodka has to be held up for three years or not is not terribly important to the ordinary people and they are the people who really count.  Even the date has changed.  It was originally supposed to be from 1st July, 1971.  There is some peculiar reason for this.  I suppose the people who drafted the Bill decided this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy FitzGerald that we seem to be meticulous about dealing with our breach of the agreement but it is a pity the Government were not a little tougher <Col N="1635" /> when they found that the agreement was being breached on the other side.</P>

We did not say anything to them at all.  It does not matter to me or to many people whether or not this is passed in this House.  It would be a pity if we wasted too much of the time of the House on it.</P>

      <P>The Bill only applies to the type of vodka as defined.  It does not apply to vodka consisting of a pure spirit; only the vodka as described in <Col N="1636" /> section 1.  Home-produced vodka is relieved from the restriction by virtue of the fact that during the manufacturing process the spirits are delivered to a licensed rectifier.  Section 1 (1) (a) reads:</P>
      <P>(a) that consists of spirits which have had a flavour communicated thereto or an ingredient or material mixed therewith,</P>
      <P>This is a very small Bill.  Deputy Tully raised the question of the dates 1st July to 14th July.  The matter was raised here in this House by the Minister.  He was advised by the Ceann Comhairle that the section of the Bill was not appropriate to a Money Bill and it was withdrawn.  Reference was made in volume 255, No. 7, column 1168 where the Minister said:</P>
      <P>In view of the Chair's ruling, I propose to remove section 27 but I also propose to introduce legislation at the first suitable opportunity bringing the provisions which were contained in section 27 into operation with effect from tomorrow, 14th July and in the meantime, I am asking the Revenue Commissioners to remove the restrictions administratively on this understanding.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners agreed to give administrative effect to the Minister's proposals from 14th July, 1971. It was not a question of directing them.  In fact, the Revenue Commissioners responded to the Minister's suggestion.  Between 1st and 14th July no vodka to which the Bill applies was removed from the warehouses.</P>

      <P>In this situation the Revenue Commissioners decided to act on the Minister's suggestion and there was no opposition to it in this House on 13th July.  Section 1 (2) lays down the origin criterion of determining United Kingdom manufacture. It is a process rule which requires that vodka must be made in the United Kingdom from spirit manufactured there.  The exclusion of the materials of Tariff Headings Nos. 22.08 and 22.09, which are the headings for spirits and liqueurs, is to ensure that the full process of manufacture is carried out in the United Kingdom.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1) (b) it is provided that no person shall keep any explosive at any place except (a) in the licensed factory in which it is manufactured and (b) in a magazine licensed by the Minister for the storage of explosives.  What regulations are there governing such type of magazines? I have memories of magazines being little concrete buildings out in the country with no guard on them and while there might be a steel door to prevent them being opened and a very effective lock, somebody with a pick-axe could get in the back way and take out anything that was in them.  Is there any specific regulation?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, after line 41, to insert a new subsection (4) and Table as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) As and from the 1st day of July, 1972, a dangerous substance for the purposes of this Part includes any of the substances mentioned in the <i>Table of Dangerous Substances</i> appended to this section to which employees are exposed or which employees are expected to handle or dispense, except under conditions prescribed in regulations made by the Minister.</P>
      <P>TABLE OF DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES</P>
      <P>Demeton, dimefox, mazidox, amiton, dinoseb, disulfoton, D.N.O.C. endosulfan, endothal, endrin, mevinphos, mipafox, parathion, phorate, schradan, sulfotep, TEPP, azinphos-ethyl, azinphos-methyl, demeton-methyl, dichlorvos, ethion, mecarbam, oxydemeton-methyl, phenkapton, phosphamidon, vamidothion.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> It is my opinion that section 24 is not being used in such a way that would ensure protection for employees.  For many years my trade union have been making representations to various Ministers about the question of protection for employees handling certain substances.  So far little or nothing has been done.  The result is that a man, maybe with a young family, goes out spraying weeds and, because certain precautions which should have been taken are not taken, he contracts dermatitis or some other disease; after a while he has to stop working and is left drawing social welfare benefits for the rest of his life.  This is apart entirely from the consideration that employees may be affected accidentally by the handling by other employees of these substances.  It should be written into an Act of Parliament that more care and attention would be taken.</P>
    <P>I attempted by way of question to have this matter raised here on a number of occasions.  Each time I was told there was a special Bill being introduced to deal with agriculture and that it would include these substances, but when such Bills are introduced they are again omitted.  A man engaged in agriculture is entitled to the same protection as a man engaged in another industry.  This amendment is one way of ensuring that we shall not have a recurrence of the tragedies we have had, deaths, but more particularly injuries.  I can cite for the Minister dozens of cases in which unfortunate people have had their skin or eyes injured, or their throat injured, through noxious fumes, simply because there was not a regulation laying down the way in which these substances should be used.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the Deputy, but I cannot accept the amendment just to include these substances specifically in the Bill.  There is a huge list of substances to which the Bill must apply.  The Minister has power under section 24 (1) to declare a substance to be a dangerous substance.  I shall definitely keep Deputy Tully's list in mind. <Col N="1649" /> They are already contained in a 79-page list published by the EEC which, when we become members, we must accept along with the substances covered by this Bill.  There may be many others from time to time which we must add.  For that reason I am sure Deputy Tully will understand my reason for not accepting the amendment is that I want not merely to include them but to widen the scope to include everything that can possibly be added from time to time.</P>
      <P>The whole purpose of this legislation is to bring up to date existing regulations in order to cover new chemicals and substances which are dangerous to health.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to section 24 (3) which requires the Minister to publicise his intention of making an order declaring a substance to be a dangerous substance and to give interested persons an opportunity of making representations about them. We can visualise cases in which certain substances will be declared to be dangerous substances to which declaration there will be some opposition. Therefore, I should like to leave it open without specifying a particular list of agricultural insecticides or chemicals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point, but our technical people have gone through the list that was published and have taken out the ones which we know have been causing trouble here.  We want to include those specifically and we do not care how many more the Minister includes afterwards.  While I should love to think the Minister would make an order including all these other substances, I am not happy that he will. I am sure he will take that in the spirit in which I mean it.  The provision to which the Minister refers, section 24 (3) gives an opportunity to people to object to these things being included, not to suggest that they should be included.  The subsection says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before making an order the Minister shall publish in such manner as he thinks fit notice of his intention to do so and give persons desiring to make representations in <Col N="1650" /> relation to the proposed order an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Does he think that is for the purpose of people writing to him saying: &ldquo;We agree with putting them on the list&rdquo;? Is the object not for people to write to say: &ldquo;You have included so-and-so, and we do not think it is dangerous&rdquo;? Practically every one of the substances we have included has caused injury to members of ours due to the fact that they were not handled according to the regulations.  The workers or the people who employ them did not realise they were handling dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make a start on this; he can add anything he likes afterwards by order and we shall give him full support.  I have asked so many times in this House about this but the attitude always is: &ldquo;They are only farm workers.  It does not matter.&rdquo; They are not included in safety regulations of any kind.  Right down along the line there has been the same opposition to having this type of worker included.  We must make a start somewhere and I suggest we make it on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill lays down the procedure by which dangerous substances are identified, and I think it would be silly to put in a few and leave out the many that must be included later.  These all relate to agriculture and they are exactly what are contained in the Northern Ireland agricultural regulations relating to poisonous substances.  I do not see what point would be served by just putting in these substances and not including others at this stage.  I can assure the Deputy we shall bear in mind the substances he has mentioned.  In the collection of data for the purpose of draftig this Bill and drafting the regulations afterwards we have obtained copies of different regulations from other countries, including the North of Ireland agricultural regulations relating to dangerous substances.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is quite obvious.  This is a small country. If firms that are employing persons were shut down for three days it would cause considerable hardship.

This would not give the same degree of control. The amendment actually meets the wishes of the Minister for Justice who is anxious to ensure that the Garda continue to vet applications for licences to hold explosives.  It is intended to make suitable provision to this purpose in the regulations in relation to the licensing activities of local and harbour authorities.

      <P>A person might depend on getting a licence from the Minister under section 31 or from a local or harbour authority under section 32.

    <P>In the normal way he must first get a warrant from a district justice but in an emergency situation, where life might be in danger if there was a delay in getting such a warrant, he could proceed without one.

The exact function and power of the Garda under paragraph (b) are not clear in that &ldquo;serious obstruction&rdquo; is not defined.  It is considered that a <Col N="1657" /> provision of that kind will enable a garda to arrest if necessary anyone who tries to prevent an inspector from entering a premises for the purpose of carrying out an examination.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following amendment to the Minister's amendment:</P>
      <P>After &ldquo;authorised&rdquo; in the last line to add &ldquo;provided that he is accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>From what the Minister has said I gather he considers this point is taken up by subsection (b) of section 39.  To allow an inspector who is a civil servant in the Department of Labour to enter a premises without a warrant and without an official or officer from the Department of Justice extends the powers of the inspector too far.  I can see the point that it might not be easy to get a warrant at night time but there is a garda in every part of the country.  The fact that the inspector was accompanied by a garda would offer further safeguards and give some control over the inspector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular desire to give this power to inspectors, nor did they require it.  I would not be too opposed to the amendment except we must allow common sense to prevail here.  We know that normally the inspector would be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána; one could hardly visualise some exceptional situation or circumstances in which he would not be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  However, if such circumstances arise I think the inspector should have the power.  Normally he would be accompanied by a garda and I do not consider the Deputy's amendment is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister cannot visualise such circumstances there does not seem to be much point in the subsection.  Certainly I cannot visualise any circumstances where an inspector could not get at late notice a member of the Garda Síochána to accompany him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the Deputy that normally he would be accompanied by a member of the Garda Síochána.  Although it may be difficult to visualise a situation in which he could not get a member of the Garda it might occur and the inspector would have the necessary power.  I think that provision is worth retaining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be satisfied if the Minister could tell me that some situation arose in the past which has prompted the necessity for a subsection such as this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if it happened in the past but on balance we should decide to leave it as it is. I do not think this extra precaution is likely to be used but one could visualise a doomsday situation in which it might be necessary.  This power is not likely to be abused; in fact, it is not a power the inspectors wish to have but, at the same time, I think we should leave it.  Having read all the other sections, the Deputy will agree that the inspector would normally be accompanied by a member of the Garda.  I would ask the Deputy to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all of subsection (1) (f) is taken from the Factories <Col N="1659" /> Act, 1955.  However, I should like the Minister to explain why the wording of (1) (f) has been changed from the 1955 Act.  Section 94 (1) (f) states:</P>
      <P>to examine, either alone or in the presence of any other person, as he thinks fit, with respect to matters under this Act, every person whom he finds in a factory, or whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be or to have been within the preceding two months employed in a factory, and to require every such person to be so examined and to sign a declaration of the truth of the matters respecting which he is so examined;</P>
      <P>The words the Minister has substituted are not as clear as the original Act.  Section 39 (1) (f) states:</P>
      <P>for the purpose of any examination or inquiry under this section to require any person whom he finds on any such premises, or whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be, or to have been within the preceding two months, employed at the premises, to answer, in the absence of persons other than a person nominated by him to be present and any persons whom the inspector may allow to be present, such questions as the inspector thinks fit to ask, so however, that no answer given by a person in pursuance of a requirement imposed under this paragraph shall be admissible in evidence against him in any proceedings;</P>
      <P>The words used are &ldquo;in the absence of persons other than a person nominated by him&rdquo;.  Does the word &ldquo;him&rdquo; refer to the inspector or to the person being examined?  The section also refers to &ldquo;any persons whom the inspector may allow to be present, such questions as the inspector thinks fit to ask, so however,...&rdquo;. Is that legal terminology that makes it more clear for the courts and the lawyers to interpret?  To me that paragraph is confusing.  I cannot see what improvement it is on the Factories Act.</P>

      <P>To require any person whom he finds on any such premises to give such information as it is in his power to give as to who is the occupier of the premises;</P>
      <P>It is a question as to whether the person might be nominated by the occupier or substituted by him.  Obviously, the person referred to is the person occupying or owning the premises.  I do not think there would be any legal difficulty in defining &ldquo;him&rdquo; there.</P>

Is he aware that at the moment some of these people are now in military hospitals because of the ill-treatment they received at the hands of the RUC Special Branch?  In view of this, would the Minister not consider a matter of urgency the immediate presentation of a further complaint?

Surely the mother of a child is entitled to apply for children's allowances?

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the communication to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>This country can accept the obligations of the ILO convention concerning the avoidance of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, as far as its provisions relating to race, colour, religion, political opinion, national extraction or social origin are concerned.  However, the position as regards the employment of women is not fully in line with certain provisions of the convention, accordingly it has not been possible, up to now, to ratify the convention.</P>
      <P>The Government recently considered certain recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of Women.  The Minister for Finance, in his budget statement, indicated what it is intended to do as far as public service employment is concerned, but as he pointed out, progress on this front depends on the will of the entire community.  The question of ratifying the ILO convention will be examined again in the light of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in his budget speech indicated, to our amazement, that equal <Col N="1679" /> pay was now a national aim and that marriage bars, <i>et cetera</i> were to be eliminated.  The Government have finally accepted that these features were quite discriminatory.  They should just sign the convention and ratify it.  We would give whatever leeway was necessary in terms of one year or five years to bring the matter finally into line.  There is no good reason why the ILO convention should not be signed to bring us into line with other Western European democracies which have all signed and ratfied this convention.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I will take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to continue its development programme in the current year the ESB needed to borrow some £10 <Col N="1680" /> million for a ten-year period at least. The ESB has continual contacts with the Irish banking system and having discussed the matter with various banks accepted an offer from an Irish bank, the Northern Bank Finance Corporation, to raise the £10 million.  A sum of £4 million was raised from Irish sources and £6 million from cross-channel sources. The proposed agreement was made known to the Central Bank who will take it into account in setting out credit guide lines.</P>
    <P>My approval to this borrowing was necessary and, in fact, I have given my guarantee to the payment of the interest and to the repayment of the loan. I am satisfied that the terms are favourable.</P>
    <P>I have indicated my policy towards foreign borrowing in two recent questions by the Deputy.  It is that following discussions with the Central Bank and the banking system it will be decided what amount should be borrowed externally and what amount will be invested by the Irish banking system in the public capital programme, these amounts to be consistent with the aim that the supply of money and credit to the private sector will be such as to give maximum support to output and employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, where possible, the money should be borrowed here at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, preferably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the £6 million could not have been borrowed at home without jeopardising the private borrowing sector of our economy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular terms involved for this loan meant that some of the Irish banks were not terribly keen on it because of the term required. Furthermore, we know from the figures available that the foreign borrowing that will be necessary will certainly exceed the amount here and the recent loan in Germany, so that it does not interfere with the total amount that we will have to borrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1681" /> The concern is to ensure that there will be sufficient credit available for the private sector.  This money would have been over and above the amount to be invested by the banking system in the public capital programme.  Therefore, it will not affect the amount available for the private sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state that he could not have got this £6 million from the Irish banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that would be going too far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean, he could not have got it having regard to the demands made by the private sector.  I know the Minister could get it, but is he convinced that it could not have been got having regard to demands made by the private sector on the lending facilities and abilities of the Irish banks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as this matter can be calculated at the moment, the position is that the amount that will have to be borrowed from external sources will certainly exceed this amount plus the other loan recently negotiated.  In that sense, it does not matter very much whether this particular loan or another one comes from abroad as far as the overall economic effect is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr O'Connell Dr O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how he reconciles the statement he has made with the fact that in the past year the private sector have reduced their borrowing from the Associated Banks and the Government have taken up the slack and that has still left the banks in a more liquid position than was expected.  I find it hard to see how that position, which is adverted to in the Central Bank bulletin, can be <Col N="1682" /> reconciled with what the Minister has just said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite correct to suggest that the private sector's borrowing was down by the amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in the budget statement, this gap was made up through some of the foreign banks operations here with the money concerned, in the main, going into the private sector.  I do not follow what Deputy FitzGerald has in mind when he says we cannot reconcile the two statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the Central Bank report and other statements, including the Minister's, have made it clear that the Associated Banks faced a situation during the past year in which the demands for private credit actually fell instead of increasing and the slack was taken up, in part, by the Government borrowing additionally.  Nevertheless, the amount of credit extended by the Associated Banks was still less than the Central Bank had intended or thought desirable. It said so plainly in its bulletin. In the circumstances the rationale of borrowing abroad rather than from the Associated Banks is a bit obscure, and the reference to the non-Associated Banks seems to me to be largely irrelevant.</P>

      <P>I had a meeting with the Association of Widows of Civil Servants on 7th April last at which it was represented that pre-1968 widows should be granted the terms of the contributory widows' and children's pension scheme for the Civil Service.  I indicated that the terms of the contributory pension scheme had been agreed with the staff associations in 1968.  As the admission of pre-1968 widows and other potential widows to the scheme would undoubtedly affect its structure, I pointed out that it would be necessary in the first instance for the widows to consult with the staff associations on the matter.  I understand that the widows have since been in contract with the staff associations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be a separate question but it is much too important a matter on which to allow Deputy Tully to mislead the House. This scheme will have to vary at least in some details in so far as this country is concerned by comparison with the way in which it operates in existing EEC countries.  I am not suggesting that Deputy Tully is trying <Col N="1693" /> deliberately to mislead the House but I am telling him and the House that the scheme has not been finalised yet. The broad details are there but the final details are not settled yet.  We know enough about it to be able to tell the Irish farmer roughly what way this scheme will operate but there will have to be differences between the way it operates in Europe and the way it operates here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fair question.  I think the best answer I can give the Deputy is to say that a reexamination of the entire situation in regard to the land structural programme is going on at present.  I would not like to make assumptions because the referendum is next week, but should the Irish people decide to go into the EEC the results of our deliberations in regard to the whole land structural programme and the agricultural programme generally will be speeded up and the results will certainly include careful consideration of a revamping of this pension scheme.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The selection of allottees for land is a matter reserved exclusively to the Lay Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the person referred to in the question was migrated because his lands were required for the relief of congestion in the immediate vicinity.  The nearest other lands in the possession of the Land Commission is a 44 acre holding about a mile away. The nearest large block of land held by the Land Commission is a group of estates, aggregating 206 acres, some four miles away, situated in a very congested area.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in a reply to a previous question on 13th of last month, the congestion in the vicinity of the Smith estate was investigated and all local deserving smallholders were provided with allotments to bring their holdings up to current standard.</P>
      <P>The person in question applied first for migration in 1967.  In January, 1968, he was accepted in principle by the Commissioners as a prospective migrant but without any decision being taken as to the particular holding which might be offered to him.  On 24th March, 1972, he was offered the holding on the Smith estate and. having viewed it on 27th of that month, agreed to accept the exchange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the requirements of the brucellosis regulations the migrant has <Col N="1696" /> not yet been able to give up possession of his Galway lands&mdash;cattle are being held there pending testing and clearance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that within a reasonable distance of the farm from which this man was transferred there were 1,200 acres in the possession of the Land Commission, some of which could have been allocated to him if it was considered necessary to transfer him?  Will he not agree also that in the area around the Decoy farm there are 41 applicants for land, 11 of whom have more than 40 acres and the remainder of whom have less than 40 acres and that 31 have herd numbers to prove they are engaged in farming?  After the Minister had given an assurance in this House that migrants would no longer be brought to the midlands or to the east, does he consider it to be in order to bring somebody to this part of the country whose only reason for changing was, I understand, that he had a dispute with his neighbour over a right of way?  Is that the way the Land Commission should carry out their work?  Is this sort of stupidity to continue to operate in the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out in the reply, the migrant in question was accepted in principle four years ago.  I said to the Deputy in the House and, indeed, in private conversation that after the existing pool of land which was taken up for migratory purposes had been exhausted no further migration from county to county would take place.  But the lands here were among those lands which have been earmarked for migration, and the migrants and some others as well who have not yet had any lands actually allocated to them have been accepted in principle for migration purposes.</P>

    <P>In regard to the other matter raised by Deputy Tully and Deputy Bruton in a supplementary to a question asked the last day, I asked the Land Commission to reinvestigate the charge that there are within the vicinity of the Smith estate smallholders who are entitled to allotments.  I am assured again that all local smallholders were <Col N="1697" /> provided with allotments to bring their holdings up to current standards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept from me, after Question Time, a list giving the acreage, the valuation herd number, <i>et cetera</i>, of the people to whom I am referring, and have the matter reinvestigated?  Would he not agree that the Land Commission officials interviewed those people as recently as a few weeks ago and gave them the impression that they were still in the running for portion of the farm, while, in fact, the Land Commission were making arrangements for the transfer of a migrant and in their office interviewed a group of them in my presence as well as that of Deputy Bruton and Deputy Hilliard, and were making arrangements that portion of the buildings attached to the Decoy farm could be taken over by these people under certain conditions?  In view of that, is it not terribly dishonest to do what has been done in this case? I am not blaming the Minister or his predecessor.  Is he aware that it is well reported in the area that the only reason why this gentleman was brought along was that he had a dispute with his neighbour over a right-of-way and he is a relative or his wife is a relative of a former Minister for Lands? If that is the way the Land Commission are allocating farms in County Meath, it is about time they changed their tactics.</P>

      <P>I do not know anything about these extraordinary, regrettable allegations made by the Deputy, but if he has a list of farms in the area I shall certainly cause further investigations to be made, because this is a matter exclusively for the Land Commission and I am only entitled to ask them for a report on the farms in question of which the Deputy says he has a list.</P>

      <P>When was this estate earmarked for migration?  If it was earmarked for migration before the deputations from the local smallholders were received, why were they given the impression that they were at least considered to be in the running for allocations of what remained of the estate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the situation, the decision to offer the lands was made by the commissioners on 24th March, 1972, and that any discussions that had taken place with the deputations had taken place well before that.  They would, therefore, deny that at any stage they were giving the impression to a deputation that something was going to happen when they had already decided otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that long before 24th March it was agreed that this estate should be given to somebody who was a migrant, not necessarily this particular migrant, and that while that decision had been taken these deputations were still being received and still given the impression that they were considered to be in the running, and that they feel considerably aggrieved that they were, to some degree at least, if not misled, put under a false impression?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it to the Minister that the only reason why the ratio for County Westmeath is 31 is that there must be a large number of small rural schools; that the position in Athlone Town is critical, that there is no class with fewer than 40 pupils and that in the infant school every class has an excess of 50 pupils; and that there is a great need for extra accommodation for these unreasonably large classes in the infant school, so much so that the headmistress will have to hire a local dancehall to take pupils for the coming year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (a) whether the EEC farm modernisation directive of 24th March makes provision for 65 per cent community assistance in backward regions as stated in the communiqué published by the Council of Ministers; and (b) whether this assistance extends to the administration of the proposed scheme by the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley (for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries) Mr. Colley (for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley (for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries)</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a contradiction between the EEC communiqué of 24th March and the terms of the directive on this point and clarification is being sought in Brussels.  The EEC directive on encouragement to leave farming and allocation of land to improve structures <Col N="1712" /> clearly provides for a 65 per cent refund for handicapped areas and this would apply to any appropriate scheme operated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry I missed part of the Minister's reply, but it is important that this point be clarified. My understanding is that, although the statement issued in the communiqué in the Council of Ministers indicated that for backward regions a 65 per cent grant would be paid, in fact this was an error and, as a result of inquiries I made to Brussels, I understand, although I have not seen the text, that it has been corrected. Is the Minister not in a position to clarify this point at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  As I stated, there is apparently a contradiction between the communiqué and the terms of the directive in relation to farm organisation, and clarification is being sought. I have also pointed out that in regard to the second directive concerning the encouragement to leave farming and allocation of land to improve structures, there is a clear provision of 65 per cent.  However, in regard to the first one, there is a contradiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say if, in fact, this is only given on certain conditions which will rule out assistance to farms that are not considered to have a chance of being viable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Is the Deputy referring to the first or the second of the directives now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In that regard it would appear if the 65 per cent referred to were to apply that it would apply to most of this country but, as I have said, there is a contradiction in this regard between the communiqué and the directive and clarification is being sought.  Definitive clarification has not yet been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the question. Does it apply to all farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Tully will appreciate that, first of all, all of these <Col N="1713" /> matters are entirely voluntary and, therefore, they do not apply to all farms.  They can only apply to those who wish to take part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>OK.  Will it apply to all who wish to take part?  It would.  The Minister might as well say he knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree with me that, in fact, it will apply to any farmer submitting a modernisation plan whose income is at present below that of the average non-agricultural worker in the area in which he lives or is threatened with falling below it and in the latter case the farmer will get only 80 per cent of the benefit; and that the only requirement is that he can put forward a plan that over a period of six years, or longer in certain regions, that could bring his income up to within 80 per cent of the average non-agricultural income and Irish conditions if the EEC applies to us should bring within the framework of the directive an average farm of 20 acres or upwards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  That is the sort of nonsense being trotted out to farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree substantially with Deputy FitzGerald.  I must add the qualification that taking the position to be as stated by Deputy FitzGerald, and I think his calculation is reasonably accurate, it could mean that some farms below that level could be excluded.  This is true.  But I want to make it quite clear that it does not matter what the size of the farm is, unless the owner is willing to participate, nobody is going to force him into this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister also agree that farms which do not fall within the scheme can still get State aid with interest rates subsidised down to 5 per cent, even if they do not come within the category eligible for grants?</P>

      <P>At a meeting on 10th <Col N="1715" /> April of milk suppliers to a County Limerick creamery, an inspector from my Department spoke about the need for improvement of milk quality.  Commenting on the results of the quality premium tests carried out at the creamery during 1971, he pointed out that 25 per cent of the total intake had failed to pass three of the four tests applied each month and that 15 per cent of the intake had failed to pass two such tests.  These results approximated to those at most other creameries.</P>
      <P>It would appear that some of the inspector's remarks at the meeting have been misquoted.  The tests concerned do not relate to the acceptability of milk at creameries and the term &ldquo;putrid&rdquo; could not appropriately be applied to milk which had merely failed to pass the test involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, in relation to the information which was given by that particular inspector, he was referring to quality milk which would qualify for the special quality bonus or premium but the fact that milk might not pass the test to qualify for the quality bonus does not at all mean that it is unsuitable for acceptance or for use by the creamery.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the number of patent and trade mark applications which were pending in 1965 when the staff complement of the Patents Office was agreed; and the total number of similar applications which were pending on the date on which that staff complement was recently filled.</P>

      <P>The number of patent applications pending on 31st March, 1965, was 4,428 and the number pending on 31st March, 1972, was 6,826.  I must emphasise that a large proportion of these applications await action by the applicant before they can be examined.</P>
      <P>The number of trade mark applications pending on 31st March, 1965, was 2,238 and the number pending on 31st March, 1972, was 3,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the reply and the fact, that the Minister has taken note of, that the number of patent and trade mark applications is now 50 per cent higher than it was in 1965, does the Minister seriously consider that he will make an indent on the backlog of work in the Patent Office by having, in 1972, for the first time, the complement of staff which was considered sufficient in 1965 to perform work which was 50 per cent of what the work is now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking a question arising from the complement <Col N="1718" /> of staff which is mentioned in a later question.  In fact, the difficulty about trying to deal with a problem like this is that to examine it on the basis of the figures presented does not give an accurate impression of the position. I have already conceded on a previous day that I am unhappy with the backlog but, on the other hand, there is no doubt that applications remain on the file as applications even though further information is required.  That information must be supplied by the applicant.  This is unattended to.  There are a number of applications in a pileup of cases that cannot be attended to until further information is supplied by the applicant.  In many cases this information is not forthcoming.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that applicants for patents and trade marks in Ireland frequently are required by the Irish Patents Office to furnish information, explanations and additional material which they are not required to furnish in any other country?  Would the Minister accept that this is probably a cause of the delays in the Irish Patents Office, that we are unreasonable in the demands we make on applicants?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that this is the situation.  Since the Deputy raised this matter in the House some time ago I have had the opportunity of reading an exhaustive report of a similar situation in the United States where the problem of coping with a backlog of applications is being tackled.  I am not aware that our Patents Office ask for information that no other Patents Office seeks.  In relation to the question of delay, I would point out that normally an applicant for a patent here also applies to the Patents Office in London for a patent for the United Kingdom. From the point of view of applicants the English market is regarded as more important and a patent here is no good if a patent is not obtained in the UK. Having submitted an application to our Patents Office they make an application for an English patent.  Normally, they do not follow up with the fullest information to our Patents Office until they get their patent in England.  It may take three years before they further process their patent here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that frequently a year passes between the date of the original application here and the application in England?

I should like to inform the Deputy that from the research I have carried out in the past fortnight I have not found that any part of the world was happy about the manner in which patent applications are dealt with.  I am not speaking as a legal man, but I have never found that a sufficiency of legal men in any Department has had any effect in speeding up matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would probably find it would speed up matters in the Patents Office.  From my experience of some years as a member of the Science and Technology Committee of the Council of Europe, I can tell the Minister that the only thing that makes other countries happy in this regard is when they compare their services with the confusion and chaos that exists in the Irish patent service.</P>

      <P>That may be so but can the Minister tell us what he is doing to increase the staff complement in order to cope with the increased demand and the backlog, which we have on the record of the House? The figures justify at least a 50 per cent increase in the staff as compared with 1965 and possibly more in order to clear the backlog.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will make a statement on the claim made by a firm (name supplied) in Ballybay, County Monaghan that they are manufacturing rubber-moulded sole units for boots and shoes made in this country; and if he will state why he is continuing to allow the importation and use by semi-State bodies of Italian vibram soles on boots supplied by them to their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Rubber-moulded and plastic sole units are free of duty and may be imported and used by Irish footwear manufacturers without restriction. Our international commitments would not allow of the imposition of a tariff on these products at this stage.</P>
      <P>Without further information I cannot comment in any detail on the second part of the Deputy's question but I assume that the semi-State bodies he has in mind purchased the footwear supplied to their employees from an Irish footwear manufacturer who would be free to import the vibram soles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his Department received a letter on 19th April last from Hypp Products Limited, Ballybay, pointing out that they were making the same type of soles that were being imported from Italy and Czechoslovakia for the purpose of putting them on footwear which was being sold mainly to semi-State bodies such as the ESB?  If the Minister cannot put a tariff on imported soles, surely he can advise the semi-State bodies that they should buy Irish-manufactured soles in preference to foreign goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is suggesting is that there is a danger to employment being given by shoe manufacturers who import some section that goes into the manufacture of the shoe. I can assure the Deputy that at present there is a common external tariff within the EEC on the units we are talking of and which we are importing now, the complete sole and heel units, and where we have not a duty now we shall have a duty of 6.5 per cent if we succeed in entering the EEC.  That will go on any imports from Czechoslovakia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is of course, aware that the main import is from Italy?  I just mentioned Czechoslovakia to show that foreign products seem to be preferred by some of the Irish manufacturers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to think it is a little unfair to fling out that.  As <Col N="1729" /> I said, the Deputy did not indicate in the question what State or semi-State bodies he was referring to and so did not give me the opportunity of making the fullest inquiries.  If a semi-State body is ordering shoes from an Irish manufacturer they must automatically assume that the finished shoe is an Irish product and to tell them to cancel the order when they find that the sole has been imported is a little bit difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If that body is accused of having said to the manufacturers that they prefer Italian soles and that &ldquo;Made in Italy&rdquo; is stamped on the sole, the only part of the shoe or boot which is imported, would the Minister not agree that that is extraordinary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>If I had that this firm have had to dismiss 40 per cent of their employees as a result of a preference being shown to mainly Italian footwear, will he not agree this means that this is another industry which is likely to fall by the wayside and the EEC will certainly not help it and that, in fact, it will hinder it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has just mentioned the ESB.  This is the first time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I had a question down to the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power in regard to the same matter, the shoes made in Italy.  That is why I put this one down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, there is no doubt that the semi-State bodies are constantly reminded and, I am satisfied, are aware of the necessity to purchase Irish-made articles.  I should be surprised if there was any question of any semi-State body indicating that they would only take a firm's products if they insisted upon fitting some sort of foreign-made part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  I believe if I get information about these things, the proper place to put it is on the plate of the Minister who is dealing with it. Then he cannot say that he does not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the quickest way to do it.  I hate to use the State postal facilities for the purpose of transmitting something that can be handed over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is fair enough.  Let me say quite clearly that I always felt up to now that I had proved as accommodating as possible to the Deputy from the point of view of being available but apparently that does not do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Very accommodating, and I have paid public tribute to that, but I am sure the Minister is not offended if I say that this is something that might be of interest to him.  He does not object to handling it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to handling it but there is the implication that it is the only way to get a message to the Minister &mdash;by raising it in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that the advance factory at Granard, County Longford, is nearing completion; and if an industry to occupy it is in prospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the factory in question is expected to be completed shortly.  I understand that a project has not yet been earmarked <Col N="1731" /> for the premises but the Industrial Development Authority are doing their best to secure one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister do for Granard what he did for Clara on a famous occasion?  Unemployment is nearly as high at Granard and it is traditionally so and it would be a great boost to the morale of the entire area of north Longford if an industry could be directed to that factory as soon as it is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I was unaware that Granard had a disastrous closure such as that which hit Clara.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a traditional area of high unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Clara was not a traditional area of high unemployment.  It suffered the closure of an industry, a fact which makes a difference.  The decision to place an advance factory in Granard was and is an indication of the State's interest in ensuring that the earliest possible opportunity will be taken of establishing an employment-giving industry there.  As I said, the IDA are actively engaged in doing this at present.</P>

      <P>As I mentioned in introducing my Estimate on 12th April, the welfare service to St. Patrick's has been substantially increased.  All boys sentenced to detention there are interviewed on committal and those of them who require advice or guidance are given it.</P>

      <P>The incidence of recidivism among former inmates could not be properly judged by finding out how many go back because most of them, if they go back, go back to Mountjoy or to some other prison.

    </Speaker>
    <P>When a youth who has been in St. Patrick's is being discharged, the appropriate welfare officer endeavours to find employment for him if this is necessary and tries to keep in touch with the youth for at least some time afterwards.  In this work the welfare officers are assisted by a number of voluntary helpers, of whom there are about ten at present.  All of these voluntary helpers, I may say, not only devote much of their spare time to the <Col N="1736" /> work, but have attended a special series of lectures in this field.  To place this fact on record is I think of itself the best tribute I can pay them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <P>Undue delays do not as a rule occur in paying grants for the reconstruction and erection of houses in County Wexford. However, the volume of work under the grants schemes rose sharply in recent months and this could have given rise to delays in some individual cases.  For example, 9,677 new house grants were finally paid last year, as compared with 8,771 in 1970-71, which, up to then, was an all-time record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to the usual grants from my Department and local authorities for the installation or extension of sanitary facilities in a house, the local authority, at their discretion, may advance a loan to meet the balance of the cost of the work. The loans are advanced on the security of the house and are usually repayable over a period of up to 15 years.  Where the amount involved does not exceed £200 a special shortterm loan may be advanced without formal security.  Such a loan would cost only about 76p a week to repay. Loans for these purposes are also available from other institutions such as credit unions, banks, building societies and life assurance companies.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate: Hospital Charges.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy L'Estrange and I had a question down on yesterday's Order Paper about the 50 per cent increase in voluntary hospital maintenance charges, an increase of £2 per day.  By way of supplementary question I asked the Minister why he did not advert to this substantial increase when his Supplementary Estimate was going through the House some weeks ago so that we could have had an opportunity of discussing fully this involved question. In his reply the Minister told me that he was not responsible for the amount charged by voluntary hospitals to private patients.  That was not a reply to my question and, consequently, I am raising the matter here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This increase of £2 per day came as a shock to everybody.  My main bone of contention with the Minister is that he did not deal with this particular problem when he had an opportunity of doing so on the occasion of his Supplementary Estimate being discussed here.  He must have known then that some such changes were imminent, although he may not have had the particular figures.  It is possible that the matter was under discussion at that time.  The gap between costing for treatment in hospitals and hospital charges has been widening in recent years and of an expenditure of £76 million in 1971-72, 70 per cent of that went to hospitals.  In 1972-73 our bill was £84 million of which 76 per cent <Col N="1772" /> went to hospitals.  Therefore, it was obvious to the Minister that the gap was widening and he must have been aware that something would have to be done about it.  However, he chose to make no reference to it on the occasion of the Supplementary Estimate going through the House and the news of the increase was burst abruptly on the public a few days ago.  The general charge for our non-teaching hospitals has been about £17 per week and in respect of teaching hospitals, the figure has been about £30 per week.  These figures are being advanced now to £28 and £44 respectively.</P>
    <P>All that information was available to the Minister and he should have taken the House into his confidence. I know that we have only limited resources of money to finance the health services&mdash;our Exchequer, rates, returns from voluntary health insurance and from private persons plus a little from the Sweepstakes and, recently, the compulsory hospital insurance which bring in about £5 million per year.  As the Minister mentioned, we have a three-tier system.  The lower income group constitute 30 per cent of the population, the middle income group, about 60 per cent and the upper income group, the remaining 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister introduced a hospitals contributory Bill. This was criticised at the time, but at least we were allowed to discuss it. There is no thanks to the Ministers for that because he had to come before the House in order to get the necessary moneys.  I criticised the Bill at the time on the basis that it meant double insurance. Our upper income group constitutes 300,000 persons but there are 350,000 voluntary insurance contributors. Therefore, there is an overlap. I cannot say how many people there are in the middle income group who are now being compelled to insure themselves; I do not know how many people in the middle income group who were covered happily previously by voluntary insurance but from the figures I have given, the number must have been substantial.  I made the point at the time that, even allowing some small concessions, in respect of the overlap, there was here a position <Col N="1773" /> whereby people who already had free choice of doctor, consultant, specialist or hospital will be compelled to subscribe to compulsory insurance.  My point was that when they were already covered by voluntary insurance they should be exempt from compulsory insurance.  However, the Minister did not see it that way and an insurance of £7 per year was imposed on 60 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>This particular matter raises a different issue.  In this instance we had no opportunity for discussion and the first we knew of the increased charges was by way of an announcement in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>I accept that something would have had to be done to bridge the gap to which I have referred, but I object to it being done by the <i>diktat</i> of a Minister for Health who did not allow this House an opportunity of discussing the matter.  In a democracy such as this an increased charge of 50 per cent should be discussed here, especially after an increase having been made only two years previously.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister has consulted either the Voluntary Health Insurance Board or the National Health Council on the matter. Perhaps he will let us know when he is replying.  I do not know, either, whether he intends to restrict voluntary health activity and coverage.  If that is his intention he should say so openly.  If it is his long-term objective it would be better if everybody knew of it.  On the other side there is the question of the public sector&mdash;the question of the local authorities and of the ratepayers.  Again, we are left in some ambiguity here.  Under this increase in voluntary hospital charges I understand that there will be an extra £4 million coming from the health boards, in other words, from the local authorities, to the voluntary hospitals.</P>

      <P>That is the point I am making and I am asking whether we have any guarantee as to where the money is to come from.  The only source that I am aware of, other than the rates or the Exchequer, is the £7 per annum compulsory hospital contribution. Is that to be increased?  Will there be a supplementary budget next autumn when these contributors will be told that their payment is being increased to £10 per year?  These are the questions to which we want answers. The Minister withheld information from this House which he should have brought forward.</P>
      <P>This is a democratic assembly.  It does not matter about Fine Gael but it does matter about the people in general.  It is through this House that information like that should come.  An adjournment debate is no substitute for an Estimate debate but this is the only channel available to us in a case like this; it is the only course a person in my position can take in order to get the Minister to explain what he has done and what he intends.  The Minister said in his reply:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional expenditure involved for the health boards in consequence of the current revision has been provided for in full in the grants payable from the Vote for my <Col N="1775" /> Department and the ratepayers will not have to pay any part of the increase.</P>
    <P>That, as Deputy Coughlan says, may apply to one particular year only.  We appreciate the Minister did try to hold the subvention from the rates in respect of last year, but it applies to only one year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have dealt with this substantial rise, which applies from 1st April, 1972, when he was dealing with the Supplementary Health Estimate here in mid-March. I could not catch all that was said in yesterday's debate but I understand the Minister said that it was not worked out, that he did not understand what was coming.  Let us recall that on April 1st, 1970, there was a similar increase in hospital charges. Therefore, when the Minister was carrying his Estimate through in mid-March of this year he must have been aware that hospital charges were becoming a difficulty, that something would have to be done to meet them. Since two years before, on 1st April, 1970, an advance was made, was it not likely a similar advance would be made on 1st April, 1972.  However, the Minister did not tell the House that or give any information in his Estimate speech as to what was lying ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must advert now to the evasive nature of the Minister's reply to this question and his replies generally.  This Minister was formerly the Minister for Transport and Power in which capacity he had a number of semi-State bodies under his control.  He was well known in the House for his invariable reply to those questions: &ldquo;The Minister has no function in the matter.&rdquo; This became a hackneyed phrase and was an easy way out for the Minister. I notice that the same trend is appearing in connection with the Minister's <Col N="1776" /> present responsibility for regional health bodies in which local authorities have diminished representation and less power.  The Minister is again adopting the attitude that it is a matter for the local health authorities.  The regional authorities will now be the new semi-State bodies behind which the Minister will shelter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely dealing at the moment with the limitations under which we operate here in respect of parliamentary replies from the Minister. The Minister should give the fullest replies here.  There should be no attempt at evasion or equivocation.  I accept that the Minister must delegate functions and the responsibility to carry out these functions, but he cannot shed the ultimate responsibility. The most important facet of that responsibility is to give the fullest information is to the Dáil, and in reply to parliamentary questions buck-passing and long involved answers are no substitute for a clear statement of affairs.</P>
      <P>The Minister has withheld, perhaps not deliberately but certainly in the event withheld, essential information from this House.  It reflects badly on this Parliamentary Assembly that the first information that 50,000 people get that they are not fully covered by their insurance, when a few months ago they were quite happy that they were, was an announcement in the papers that the Minister had agreed to an advance in charges.  The Voluntary Health Insurance Board did their utmost to provide cover, sending notices to the newspapers informing people that they should reapply if they wanted additional coverage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a businesslike approach. This is the attitude of a Minister who seems to have forgotten the fundamental concept of good public relations, and who certainly seems to have forgotten his responsibility to this House.  I do not enjoy pouring contumely <Col N="1777" /> on the head of the Minister.  I can assure him there is nothing personal in my attitude.  I hope he will appreciate I am merely doing this to defend, as I think he would also like to defend, the operation of democracy in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to welcome Deputy Hogan as the representative of Fine Gael for Health.  I wish he had the position long enough to realise that there are only two other Deputies in this House who have uttered more words of information than me.  I defy anybody to deny that my communications with the House&mdash;in the form of notes on the Estimates, very prolonged Estimate speeches and, in particular, the two circulars that I sent to Deputies twice indicating the nature of the increased cost in the health services for the coming year, in which I included the increases required for increased capitation rates, the extensive information provided in these documents, together with the answers to a great many questions&mdash;constitute an amount of communication which I do not believe could be exceeded by any other Minister in the history of this State, and I say that without fear of contradiction.</P>
      <P>To get down to the bones of this matter, the Supplementary Estimate to which Deputy Hogan refers dealt only with the excess expenditure in 1971-72.  No prior indication or notice has been given of increases of private patient charges in this House on previous occasions, so I have not established any precedent in regard to this. There are quite a large number of beds in private hospitals that receive no State subsidy whatever, four of them being in Dublin, where the charges are increasing all the time.  These increases are inevitable in consequence of the increase in capitation charges and in consequence of the very heavy increase in hospital costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say that, naturally, I would undertake a further inquiry into the increase in private hospital charges if <Col N="1778" /> I were not aware of the fact that even in spite of these increases there is still an element of subsidisation by the State towards the maintenance in hospital of purely private patients, those who go to the public voluntary hospitals and not to the private hospitals.</P>
    <P>I will admit to Deputy Hogan that it would be much better if we had regular increases in these charges when they are necessary and not to have them jump over periods of two years. I am going to speak to the Minister for Finance about this.  As the Deputy knows, we have been slow in increasing capitation charges because there was always the impression that the Hospitals Trust Fund could provide for the deficits on the voluntary hospitals. That day is long past.  The Hospitals Trust Fund revenue is about £3 million and all but £1 million of that goes to capital charges and miscellaneous charges and the State, even in this year, and even with the increases in capitation charges, is applying £7.75 million from the Exchequer to supplement the revenue of the now totally deficient Hospitals Trust Fund, so far as hospital deficits are concerned.</P>
    <P>I have pointed out on numerous occasions in this House the frightening increase in hospital costs which are occurring both here and in every other country and which are a source of worry and anxiety to every Minister for Health in every civilised country in the world.  The reason for the increases lies, first of all, in increases of remuneration, some of which are highly inflationary in character and which I hope will be the subject of careful study by the Employer/Labour Conference in their coming negotiations; some of which are due to the reduction of hours to 40 a week; some of which are due to much merited status pay increases to junior doctor staff and to nurses and to changes in conditions; and some of which are due to costs of materials.  A further increase in hospital charges is due to the fact that 2½ per cent to 3½ per cent more people in this and every other civilised state are going for acute medical care in hospitals every year, in spite of all the efforts to provide better out-patient service and to prevent as far as possible <Col N="1779" /> any long stay in a hospital through out-patient service clinics.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated to the House, the cost of the salaries and remuneration in the hospitals has gone up 33 per cent in two years.  Some of that was, as I have said, in the nature of status pay and some of it I hope will not be repetitive.</P>
    <P>I told the House on two separate occasions through the issue of two circulars that, of the increases in hospital and health services this year, in connection with local authorities the increase was £13.5 million and of that £10 million was attributable to increases in remuneration, increase in the cost of materials and increased capitation rates payable to the voluntary hospitals and £3 million was due to an increase in the volume of services which worked out at 4 per cent of the total increase in all health and hospital charges and which I said was a reasonable volume increase which meant that we could make progress in developing a better health and hospital service system.  So, the Deputies had on two occasions clear indications of the increased cost attributable to capitation rates and they must have known from that that inevitably hospital charges to private patients would go up.</P>
    <P>I might add for the melancholy consideration of the House that the average cost per patient day in the United States for a hospital is £32.  God forbid that we should ever reach that extravagant and terrible level.</P>
    <P>To speak in detail about those who are covered by voluntary health insurance, there are 350,000 people covered by voluntary health insurance, of whom 233,000 persons will be affected because the reminder, consisting of 117,000, are Health Act patients who who are not required to pay any extra premiums.  In other words, those who are in the limited eligibility class who have also taken out voluntary health insurance, who have paid the £7 a year contribution, will not be required to take out additional premiums. So this applies, therefore, to 233,000 persons out of the total population.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1780" /> I indicated that the net increase for a family of five, after allowing for income tax allowance, was £7 a year and that this is an increase of 25 per cent on the previous payment paid. I worked out for the benefit of the House that the extra charge of £7 a year is equivalent to one gin and tonic every fortnight and I believe can be paid by the vast majority of the group concerned.</P>
    <P>We must place the increase in these premiums against the growth of incomes in the State generally in the last two years.  The increase in the pay of public servants in the last two years is 25 per cent, equivalent to the increase in the premiums.  The total life insurance premiums taken out by this community increased by 25 per cent in a period of two years ended 1970. I have no reason to suppose that that increase could not be generally applicable to the last two years.  Retail sales in this country increased by 21 per cent in the two years ended 1971. Total savings increased in the two years ended 1971 in this community by 27 per cent.  The gross national product went up 25 per cent in two years.  The consumption of drink and tobacco went up from 1968 to 1970 &mdash;I have not got later figures&mdash;by 29 per cent and reached the staggering total of £140 million in 1970, for three million people.  Out of that can come the gin and tonic every fortnight with which to pay this extra £7 premium.</P>
    <P>I gave to the House already the effect of the income tax allowances for those with heavy hospital expenditure. I do not think I need repeat it.  What it really amounted to was that for a family with an income of £2,000 with three children the tax payable after allowing for very heavy hospital expenses of £600 not otherwise recoverable would be only £9 whereas the tax in 1968-69 would have been £170. Then I also referred to what we do for the higher income group, the long-term disability benefits applicable to certain major disabilities such as epilepsy and mental handicap that went into operation in October; the hardship contributions that can be made under the Health Act for those who are above £1,600 and who find difficulty in paying hospitals bills from <Col N="1781" /> whatever resources they have, voluntary health insurance or otherwise.  I referred to the numbers of people who retain voluntary social insurance after passing the £1,600 limit, the manual workers who retain their health benefits after passing the £1,600 limit.</P>

      <P>Now I come to the end and deal with Deputy Hugh Byrne's suggestion that the whole of the extra hospital charges should fall on the Exchequer.  Why should they <Col N="1782" /> fall on the Exchequer and who would pay for them?  Inevitably, the upper income group would have to pay for these extra charges in taxation because they could not be charged either to the middle income group or the lower group.  Much the best way of paying for them is through the hardship element which I have described and through increased voluntary insurance payments to the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, which amount to £7 a year.</P>
