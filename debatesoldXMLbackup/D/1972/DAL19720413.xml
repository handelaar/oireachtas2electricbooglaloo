    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That, in connection with the supply granted for the years ended 31st March, 1971, and 31st March, 1972, the Dáil takes note of the activities of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P. J. Burke Mr. P. J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke for some time last night on the support that the Dáil and the country can give to the Minister for Justice.  Everything in any democratic State depends first and foremost on law and order.  This is a democratic State and the Deputies <Col N="168" /> of this House have been democratically elected by the people of the Twenty-six Counties over which the State has jurisdiction.  If the Department of Justice fail in their duty the whole State is brought into a chaotic condition.</P>
      <P>There was some criticism about a statement which the Minister for Justice made at the Ard-Fheis.  I support every single statement he made there because it was time to make a clear statement on the state of the country.  The people welcomed his observations because they felt that this was a man who was anxious to see law and order maintained.  The Minister is criticised if the law is not upheld. I am not here to criticise anybody but I appeal to the people who are administering the law of this country not to be afraid.  Let them have a bit of backbone and uphold the dignity of this democratic State.</P>
      <P>I was very anxious to speak on the Department of Justice Vote although I came out of hospital only two weeks ago.  It is in the interests of every one of us that we should speak very strongly on law and order in this country. If there are any people administering the law wrongly, viciously or personally they have no place in our society.  There are too many people silent over what is going on at the present time.  We should have the backbone to stand up and tell these people what we think of their actions as far as breaking the law is concerned.</P>
      <P>No Minister for Justice wants to do anything vindictive or vicious.  All our former Ministers in this Department were decent men who tried to do their best, but very few Ministers have had to cope with the troubles which we have in this country today.  Last night I referred to breaking into houses and banks and getting away with robbery. The ordinary voter in the country is asking why we cannot administer the law.  Our gardaí are doing a very good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again emphasise the necessity of everybody speaking up and supporting the present Minister for Justice.  This is not a matter for the Fianna Fáil Party alone.  It is also the responsibility of the Fine Gael Party and the <Col N="169" /> Labour Party.  I want to pay them the compliment that they are doing their best in speaking up about maintaining law and order in the country. I could not speak too strongly or too often on this.  We are at a crossroads today.  There are people today, some of them public men of standing, who have cures for all ills and they are encouraging all the viciousness they can against the State, the Government and the Dáil.  If these people were in office from what I know of some of them I am sure they would be dictators.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the valuable work being done by a number of charitable organisations for juvenile delinquents. The home environment has much to do with the problem of juvenile delinquency.  I am associated with the Legion of Mary and this organisation is doing a wonderful job in visiting the delinquents, either in their homes or in institutions.  The Minister and his Department are anxious to see that these youngsters are looked after and are encouraged and helped to cease making trouble and to behave as good citizens.</P>
    <P>The religious and voluntary organisations and visiting committees all play an important part in this work.  Juvenile delinquency is a problem in many countries.  However, in our country there is only a small section of people who are anxious to help.  Many others do not want to involve themselves with their fellow-citizens; they are entitled to do this in a democratic State but I would make an appeal to all our people to help.  Perhaps, some day it might be a relative or child of our own who might need help and for that reason alone we should lend a helping hand to those in trouble.</P>
    <P>The institute which has been established by the Minister at Shanganagh Castle is appreciated and I should like to see much more of this work carried out.  It would be helpful if we had a panel of employers so that a number of youngsters could get employment. I realise that it is essential that employers have efficient workers who will carry out their work but, perhaps, we could subsidise these employers in some way in order to have the young people <Col N="170" /> trained and looked after.  This would be much more helpful than merely remarking that a certain youngster was in St. Patrick's or some other institute when he was 15 or 16 years of age. When we point the finger at these young people we make them feel outcasts of society.  Therefore, on behalf of these unfortunate young people and their families I would make an appeal that help be given to them.</P>
    <P>Let me depart from this subject to express the hope that we shall never again have the experience that we have had in the past few days.  I want to pay a public tribute to the Congress of Trade Unions for the work they are trying to do&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Burke.  I am sure that for men in their sixties there was a sense of <i>déjá vu</i> about his speech and the proceedings here this morning and yesterday.  The Deputy correctly indicated that the Minister has a difficult task and deserves our full support. Deputy Burke was oblique in his reference to the task facing the Minister, but I take it that what he meant were the elements of subversion showing themselves in our country at the moment.  His speech, in which he urged the Minister to be firm with these people and called for the support of all right thinking, democratically-minded people, was a speech which might have been made by any Cumann na nGaedheal Deputy in the 1920s.  It is a pity Deputy Burke did not draw the full analogy with those <Col N="171" /> times.  However, it is heartening to see such a change on the other side and to hear such a speech being made. I hope for the Minister's sake, and for the policy the Minister has indicated he wants to adopt, that Deputy Burke will be followed by many other speakers from that side of the House on the same theme.</P>
      <P>I do not know if that will happen because Deputy Burke made one statement which struck me so forcibly that I wrote down his words.  He said: &ldquo;I have been told I should not open my mouth on certain things in this House.&rdquo;  That is an extraordinary statement for a Government Deputy to make.  Deputy Burke made that statement in the context to which I have been referring&mdash;the context of urging the House to support the Minister in his difficult task of dealing with the subversive elements in our society.  It would be interesting to learn from Deputy Burke who told him that he should stay silent and their reasons why any Deputy should stay silent.  Perhaps he was giving voice to the feelings or gossip in the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should like to think that his views represent the general feelings within his party but in view of his statement that he should not open his mouth on certain things I must have doubts about that. To some extent all of us are formed by our origins and this might explain why some people on the other side cannot consider themselves free to come out and speak unequivocally in support of their Minister.  With a few exceptions from the Government members themselves, their silence has been noticeable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would take issue with the Minister in his speech in regard to the problem of dealing with the subversive elements in our society.  Without any doubt this is the major problem facing the Minister for Justice.  One would have expected him to spell out the problem and how it is proposed to solve it.  He skates over the problem.  He denies that there has been any ambivalence on the part of the Government with regard to these illegal organisations.  He concedes that there has not been much action in relation to them.  He suggests <Col N="172" /> that the reason for that is that the law as it stands at present is defective.  He says that we as a community may have to accept the need for substantial changes either in the criminal law of this country or in the judicial machinery for the investigation and trial of certain offences.</P>
    <P>I concede that we who have a common law system here can be in difficulty in proving certain types of offences, but I do not concede that, as matters stand, the law has shown itself to be inadequate, or the machinery has shown itself to be ineffective in dealing with these people, and in dealing with the offences to be considered in this context.  One has to rely on the impression one gets from the newspaper reports of legal proceedings and I readily concede that they can be inaccurate. As a member of the public it is the only way I can judge what is happening in regard to the prosecution of these offences.  It seems to me that the charges and offences which have been prosecuted to date have been stale.  People have been charged for statements made nine months or even 12 months ago.  I very definitely get the feeling that, in bringing these charges, the Government are merely indulging in shadow boxing to try to reassure people in Great Britain or in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have sufficient faith and confidence in the professional efficiency of our Garda and detective forces to feel that if from the beginning they had an entirely free hand in relation to these activities, many successful prosecutions could have been brought.  Until such time as we can see an unequivocal approach, an unambivalent approach to these matters, we must have doubts as to whether Fianna Fáil are still to some extent a prisoner of their origins in relation to these activities.</P>
    <P>Last December I asked the Minister a question about illegal training camps conducted by these subversive organisations and in the course of his reply he said:</P>
    <P>I have at no time sought to deny that this kind of training activity does go on to some extent in the manner described, that is to say, indoors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="173" /> This is a small country.  In a small intimate society there are very few activities which can go on to any considerable extent without society knowing about them.  I have the height of admiration for the professional efficiency for our police and detective forces and I have no doubt that they would be able to put the finger on these illegal activities.</P>
    <P>In spite of what the Minister said in his speech I consider that the attitude of himself and his Government has not been as thorough as it should be, and has been equivocal in relation to enforcing the law.  It is no answer to say that the legal machinery may have to be changed, or that the judicial system may have to be revised. It has not been fully tried out and found wanting.  It is not enough to come in here and, if you like, indicate a distasteful alternative to this House for the Minister's failure to prosecute these people successfully and vigorously.  The House must be shown clearly, and must be able to see clearly, that the present machinery is, in fact, defective.  I do not believe it is, because I do not think it has been brought into full operation against these people.</P>
    <P>As I say, some of the reasons for this are historic.  We do not want to open old sores by dealing with them but we cannot ignore them.  To some extent we are all formed by our origins.  It was unfortunate that the Taoiseach allowed himself to be photographed on Easter Sunday last inspecting a guard of honour of civilians in semi-military costumes and carrying rifles.  To a Northerner, who would not be aware of the tribal rites of the Fianna Fáil Party, this could be a very disturbing sight: the Taoiseach down here inspecting what to all intents and purposes was a civilian army.  The people up there equate civilian armies with illegal organisations. This is a delicate time and that should not have happened.  The Taoiseach should not have allowed himself to be in that position.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to hear from the Minister the legal basis on which these people were allowed to form themselves into military ranks <Col N="174" /> at Arbour Hill and to wear semi-military costume.  Who provided them with the rifles?  Who provided them with the webbing belts they wore? They were not members of the Old IRA because from the photographs they were obviously too young to have been in that body.  It would be interesting for the Minister to let us know how that situation was legal or how it could be justified in the present climate.  It is symptomatic of the sentiment or the philosophy to be found in the Minister's party.  These very sentiments and philosophies inhibit him and have inhibited the Government up to now in dealing effectively with illegal organisations.</P>
    <P>I read, too, last week in one of the daily papers&mdash;I think it was <i>The Irish Independent</i>&mdash;an article on a gentleman called Mac Stiofáin which indicated that he is employed by Connradh na Gaeilge as an organiser.  At the moment he is on full time leave with full pay.  This is a body which is subsidised heavily by this House and it can allow one of its employees full time leave with full pay to engage in his activities.  He is described as chief of staff of what I would call the woman beaters, the provisional IRA. Again, the fact that our Government will tolerate this is indicative of their philosophy and indicative of the approach, the softly softly approach, which they have towards these people. They seem to be always looking over their shoulder in some fear that, if they take action against these groups, which are subversive and which have threatened this democracy, they are not being true to themselves and they are in some way being anti-national.</P>
    <P>This is a fallacious of course.  It has proved to be a fallacy in the past, and what is wanted now is firm action. It was very encouraging to hear support for the Minister from his own backbenchers in the person of Deputy Burke.  I would hope that, in the course of this debate, many more Deputies from the Minister's party will rise here and encourage him to take firm and positive action in dealing with these subversive organisations.  In the whole political scene in this country the activities of these organisations are the outstanding feature.  How to deal <Col N="175" /> with them, I concede, is a matter that must cause the Government of the day some difficulty because it is distasteful to have to deal firmly with some people who are idealists, albeit misguided. Because they are misguided, and because they are so misguided that they are a danger to this State and all its democratic institutions, they have to be dealt with and regrettably dealt with firmly.</P>
    <P>History has shown this.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take a lesson from the history of our young State and recognise that these people, these organisations, have to be dealt with firmly.  They cannot be allowed to threaten what was bought at such a high price.  We have seen in many of their activities fascist and totalitarian manifestations.  On no score can there be any justification for tolerating them.  There can be no sympathy whatever for their activities.  They are essentially anti-national no matter how much they may preach the doctrine of rigid sectarian nationalism.  They are anti-national in the sense that they would destroy all that we have achieved here.  They are fascist in the sense that they are prepared to administer punishment to people who deviate from their line of thought.  They are totalitarian in the sense that they do not give a place to opposing voices.  They are entirely bad and evil and it is the Government's duty to be very firm in ensuring that their voice does not become louder or their activities widespread. This can only be done by taking firm action.  The present legal system, the code of law, the judicial machinery and court procedure are, in my submission, quite adequate for this purpose if the Minister and the Executive have the will.</P>
    <P>This was the most important part of the Minister's speech and I regret that it was too vague on that point to reassure the many people worried about the present situation.  I do not know whether the Minister was flying a kite or not when he spoke about changing the present law.  It would have behoved him as Minister for Justice to have indicated specifically <Col N="176" /> the way in which the present law is defective and to have indicated also here, which is the proper place and time for doing so, the ways in which he thinks the law should be or needs to be amended.  We were left with a rather vague threat that our present legal system may have to be upset in order to curb these people.  This was not necessary before and I suggest it is not necessary now or, if the Minister thinks it is, it is his duty to spell out why and how these changes must be made.  If the law cannot be enforced successfully or effectively and if one considers that the law, in effect, is the will of the people then, in effect, a minority is trying to impose something on a majority.  That is not the situation here.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that there is no public sympathy or support for these subversives.  Consequently, he should recognise that the consensus of the people is in favour of the present institutions and present system of democracy and they have no desire to have it changed and that the consensus is behind the Minister in enforcing the present system.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated the activities of his Department in the field of law reform and the work that had been done so far.  I must commend him and the Department for the advances made in this field.  He indicated that the present system of dealing with malicious injuries was being looked at.  I do not know what is in mind there but in case there is any drive to repeal or revoke the present criminal injury code I should like to make these comments to the Minister giving some reasons why I think it should be retained. The outcry for its revision or repeal invariably arises when one particular area is faced with an unusually high bill because of some act of outrage committed in that area and the fact that all the people of that area have to pay for something in which they had no act or part and did not support is manifestly unjust.  If the bill which is spread over all the people is high, there is no doubt the present system in that situation does require reform.  The criminal injury code with its system of levying damages on that entire community was intended to <Col N="177" /> punish the community for acts by certain wrongdoers within that community who could not be made amenable to the law because, in effect, they were being protected by the community and there was a certain amount of justification for the code when looked at in that light.  But if the acts of outrage or damage are committed by persons who are strangers to the community and are not supported by the community the original argument falls down and the law requires revision.  In certain cases the damage will have to be met from central funds or from some source other than the particular community when that community as a whole is innocent.  I speak particularly of political outrages which we know do not have the support of the community by and large and for which, therefore, it cannot be held responsible.</P>
    <P>There is another type of malicious damage, the lesser type, windows being broken and occasional acts of arson and so on.  I suggest the present law in relation to compensation for items like that should not be changed because, in effect, it is a very cheap form of insurance. When the ordinary run of malicious injury claim is spread over the rated occupiers of an entire county or a large urban or corporation area the impact on any individual is not severe and it is a guarantee for the entire community that damage suffered in this way will be paid for.  The alternative is to remove this system and people are then driven to effect private insurance and I think the rates of premiums individuals would have to pay would be far higher than the sums they are now called on to pay from time to time to meet ordinary run of the mill claims.</P>
    <P>There is also a possibility that if people are at the mercy of private insurance companies they might not be able to obtain effective cover against this type of damage.  It is a risk that companies might not be able to assess and consequently they might have to refuse cover or charge unduly high premiums to cover unassessable risks. It would be a pity to see any change in the criminal injury code which would remove that protection.  Again, if the Minister has changes in mind I suggest <Col N="178" /> these should be made public as early as possible so that they could be debated by local authorities and the public generally.  If changes are to be made they could then be made by the Minister in a situation where prior to making the changes the Minister had obtained the public view and he could then say that he was introducing legislation which would be noncontroversial and would meet public demand.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with one very important aspect of his Department in a very cursory manner, the activities of the Adoption Board.  He simply gave the number of orders made in 1971 and that was his contribution to this emotional, difficult and delicate field. The Minister and I took issue some time ago on the philosophy behind our adoption law when I asked him in a Dáil question last May if he had any proposals to make to amend the adoption laws and if he had received any criticism of them.  He assumed the criticism I wanted to make was that the rights of mothers should be reduced. Essentially, that is the criticism I want to make and to that extent I take issue with the Minister because he indicated in his reply that he would not consider any such change.  It is not so much that I want to see the rights of the mothers reduced but I want to see the rights of the children increased.  At present our adoption laws are mother-centred.  The leaning in the adoption laws is in favour of the mother.</P>
    <P>The child is regarded as a chattel of the mother and is to be placed or not placed as the mother decides.  As a starting point we must admit that the mother owns the child and that there is a tremendous psychological bond between mother and infant which can be increased considerably by the circumstances of an illegitimate birth.  Having recognised that, we must consider the future of the child and the future of the mother.  Society, as it is at present, condemns both mother and child as sinners.  To some extent the illegitimate child is becoming less of an outcast in our society.  Nevertheless, the illegitimate teenager or young adult living with his or her unmarried mother is an outcast to some extent in the community <Col N="179" /> in which they live.  If &ldquo;outcast&rdquo; is too strong a word I would say that they are objects of notice, that they do not merge into the community in the same way as the other families in that community.  It is humiliating, hurtful and wrong for any human being to be put in that position.  Very often an illegitimate child is put in that position because at a time when he or she could have been adopted, the mother, for sentimental reasons, perfectly natural human reasons, did not want to part with the child.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that where a mother makes a decision to part with her child and allows him or her to be adopted provisionally but who then changes her mind, the change is essentially selfish on her part.  At that stage her life is, to all intents and purposes, half over and her future is not important in comparison to the future of the child.  Our society should ensure that its adoption laws are based on consideration of the child's future rather than the mother's and should be based on devising a system whereby if the mother agrees to have her child adopted and given the security of belonging to a family, she should not be allowed change her mind.  This may be harsh in relation to the emotions of a mother where a newly born baby is concerned but that harshness has to be counterbalanced against the life-long injustice that could be inflicted on the child by allowing a mother to change her mind.  Our adoption laws at present allow for too much prevarication by mothers. The whole point of the adoption laws is not to provide children for childless marriages but to provide homes and families for children and to be able to take children out of the position of having the stigma of illegitimacy attached to them for their entire lives.  Having regard to the amount of personal hurt and embarrassment that a person can suffer all through his life, the law should be changed so that a mother who is unduly possessive regarding her illegitimate child cannot change her mind once she decides to let the child be adopted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> Society is changing but it will be a considerable time yet before people in this category will be accepted entirely and without question, without embarrassment and without any feeling of difference.  This is one aspect of the adoption laws that deserves consideration and I would ask the Minister to give it his attention.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that will have to be considered, particularly in the context of the present climate in this country, is the prohibition on adoption in cases of mixed marriages.  At present the adoptive parents must be of the same religion so that persons who are of different religions and who are childless cannot make their homes available to an illegitimate or a homeless child. This is wrong and it shows an attitude of mind on the part of the State that is not taking into account the changes that are taking place in our society. It shows an undue interference by the State in matters of private religion which, again, is something that will leave people in Northern Ireland somewhat chary of our society.  It is not an urgent problem in the sense that there is not a surplus of children who cannot be adopted because of the regulation.  There are more prospective adoptive parents than there are children for adoption and consequently it can be arranged that the adoptive parents are always of the same religion. Nevertheless, the principle is wrong and should be changed.  Parents of different religions who are suitable and capable of adopting a child should be allowed to do so if they so wish.</P>
    <P>One other point about adoption is the nature of the annual report.  The only report I have is as old as 1969. This was not published until some time after the year in which the report ended.  There has been criticism of the size of the report in that it is much too skimpy and gives no details of the problems of adoption or of changes that the board considered to be needed.</P>
    <P>So far as I recall, the first page stated the regulations under the Acts, the second stated the number of adoptions that were made, while the third and fourth pages gave a list of registered adoption societies.  For a board who are doing such tremendously important <Col N="181" /> work one would expect much more comment on the sociological aspects of that work.  One startling omission was that there were X number of applications received but only Y number of adoption orders made.  We are entitled to know the reasons why no orders were made in some cases.  Was it because of a change of mind on the part of mothers or were there some legal obstacles to making the orders?  To enable us assess the work of the Adoption Board all information of this nature should be contained in the annual report.</P>
    <P>From information that reaches me I am aware that many adoptions are arranged through persons or bodies who are not registered adoption societies.  This is illegal under the Act but there have been no prosecutions. Very often these people who interfere are clerical people.  They are well-meaning but the making of adoptions is a matter for skilled social workers. It is a matter for the Adoption Board. The board should refuse to tolerate unauthorised or illegal adoptions arranged by well-meaning clerical persons. The Act is specific on this point and it should be enforced.  This is not an area for well-meaning amateurs.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see a reference in the Minister's speech to the appointment of welfare officers.  The title &ldquo;welfare officers&rdquo; is somewhat misleading to people who may not be aware of what these people do.  They are probation officers attached to the courts.  It was a serious gap in our social system that up to now these officers were available only to a limited extent in Dublin. They have been appointed now to several provincial centres, one of these being Athlone.  I can tell the Minister that the public and those involved in the administration of law in that area are grateful to him for the appointment that was made there and we assure him that the amount of good that has been done already by this officer is enormous.</P>
    <P>We look forward to this service being expanded.  We look forward to a position where the training that is being given to these officers can become more detailed and where existing officers can be released for postgraduate <Col N="182" /> training, so to speak.  At the moment because of the urgent need to get them to work, training periods have been short.  This does not seem to have diminished their efficiency, so far as an outsider can judge, but nevertheless, the training and expertise which these men can get before they take up duty must increase their efficiency.  We would all rather have them with short training than not have them at all.  It is an aspect of sociology under the control of the Minister which needs to be expanded urgently.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave rather frightening figures for the increase in crime and quoted also the vast increase in the number of persons in custody.  One of the most powerful weapons in trying to reverse this trend must be to have a full corps of welfare officers attached to all court areas in the country.  There are many young adults and juveniles who could be deviated from the habit of crime if they came under the supervision of skilled and trained persons at a sufficiently early date.  Many of the persons in our prisons arrived there casually.  Their criminal habits were formed casually and as a result they slid down the social scale to a stage where they did not care and just committed crimes.  If they had been contacted by a welfare officer at an early stage many of them would have been reformed.  The social welfare officer's knowledge of family and domestic background should be available to the courts.  Different action could then be taken in relation to many offenders.</P>
    <P>The main factor in diminishing crime or in preventing a recurrence of crime with that type of teenager or young adult offender is to be able to provide work.  I have not the slightest doubt, as a person who practises in district courts and who does a considerable amount of work for persons charged with petty criminal offences, that very often the motive behind these offences is that the offender was affected by the affluence he saw around him while he was an unemployed person with no money.  He was tempted to steal to provide himself with the good things of life which he saw in the hands of other persons.  I know some of these young people who drifted on to continued <Col N="183" /> crime.  Others were lucky and got employment at a critical time in their careers.  The employment provided them with an income and as long as they had a steady income and felt as good as anyone else in society the temptation to continue a life of crime was removed and they became good citizens.</P>
    <P>It is important that welfare officers should have the confidence of all employers, whether State, semi-State or otherwise and that applications for jobs for persons under their care should be considered favourably and that the young people concerned should in some cases even get priority.  I would endorse Deputy P. J. Burke's appeal to employers not to be prejudiced against a young person because he had been guilty of an offence at an earlier stage or had served time in a reformatory.</P>
    <P>I welcome the move by the Department to appoint welfare officers to the courts.  I would like to see the number of officers increased immediately.  With the growing incidence of crime this would provide one of the main weapons in fighting it.  I would like to see them provided, especially in country towns, so that the increased crime rate could be held in check before it increases further.  In modern society, with the lack of respect by many in that particular age group for the institutions of society, we need welfare officers to help the young people to correct their drift in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Coupled with that, it is good to see in the Minister's speech details of the advances which have been made in our penal system.  There have been improvements in buildings and in after-care service.  The purchase of the premises in Blacklion, County Cavan, is an interesting experiment, but is that place well situated?  There is a fine building there, situated in beautiful countryside, but it is in a very remote place and in an area which is not well served by transport.  Part of the rehabilitation of the persons there would be to ensure that their parents, relatives and friends could keep in touch with them regularly.  The good of having this fine modern premises in beautiful surroundings could be undone <Col N="184" /> to some extent if a boy there felt completely cut-off from his folk.  This is something which a generous scale of travel allowances and a rearrangement of the bus services could overcome.  I would warn the Minister to be careful about providing special bus services to the jail because the people travelling on such a service would be immediately labelled.  This is a problem which must be dealt with sensitively in order to overcome the difficulties of the centre's remoteness and to ensure that the travelling facilities available to the parents and relatives of the boys are adequate.  The general idea of providing these premises is a good one.  The numbers of suitable premises available are naturally limited.  The Department did not have much choice as to where this centre should be.  The alternative was to build, which is costly and slow.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the composition and the work of visiting committees. How effective are such committees? The Minister paid tribute to them. The only informattion I have comes from the other side of the fence, as it were.  It comes from members of the NFA who spent a term in Mountjoy Jail.  I discussed conditions with them. Mountjoy Jail is not a holiday centre or anything like that.  Discipline is severe.  This is as it must necessarily be in a prison.  The point was made that the visiting committees did not have the confidence of the prisoners and that while they were well-intentioned and the persons in them were apparently sympathetic they were identified by the prisoners with the establishment. These visiting committees should be identified by the prisoners as being neutral, and as being composed of persons to whom grievances could be put in the expectation that their points would be earnestly listened to and that if substance was found in them they would be remedied.  This is not the position from the point of view of the prisoners in relation to the visiting committees at present.  The philosophy behind visiting committees is that they should be there as buffers between the establishment and the prisoners.  Visiting committees are not fulfilling that role at present, from the point of view of the prisoners.  The structure and <Col N="185" /> activities of these committees might be examined with a view to seeing whether the difficulty which I submit exists could be overcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech referred, in the section dealing with law reform, to the introduction of the new Courts Bill.  This is welcome because it increases the jurisdiction realistically. The Minister has not yet provided a new costs structure to go with the increased jurisdiction.  This is a serious omission.  I have no doubt that the good sense of justices and judges will overcome this but it would be more satisfactory for the public and practitioners if these costs were arranged at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the good work of the various committees on court procedure and the reports that have been received from them.  He mentioned in particular the question of juries and the changes proposed. He did not outline the changes, but these changes are so drastic and so fundamental to our legal system that I am disappointed that he did not deal with them so that the public would be informed of the changes proposed and the arguments for and against. I personally am very conservative in relation to this matter and I want to be convinced that the changes are necessary.  I am conservative because my experience of juries has been on the side of accused persons coming before them, and, perhaps, the direction of my thinking has been overmuch in favour of the freedom of the individual.  I do not know can one go too much in that direction.  We have to balance the rights of the community against the individual's freedom; nevertheless, my experience has been on his side and, perhaps, it tends to give me a viewpoint that is excessively conservative in relation to retaining the present jury system.</P>
    <P>However, being a matter that is fundamental to our whole legal structure, it is one that deserves full debate.  The Minister should make known in as wide as possible a manner the views of the committee on this question, so that when this controversial legislation comes to be introduced we who will have to deal with <Col N="186" /> it here will be aware of public feeling on the subject.  This will be of assistance to us, and I think it is good for laws that they should have been well discussed in advance by the public generally and that interested parties would have an opportunity of making their views known.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the backlog in the courts and stated that the number of judges has been increased in Dublin and that the backlog there has been seriously curtailed.  This is good news, because it was becoming a serious hardship on litigants and, indeed, on persons accused of criminal offences in Dublin because of the delays in having their trials take place.  The position in the country circuits is not so bad as it is in Dublin, but with the increase in jury trials taking place in country Circuit Courts from time to time, a backlog of civil actions can build up, with consequent hardship.  However, these are periodic peaks and, by and large, can be removed without too much hardship.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of litigation in the Circuit Court in the country to which I would refer, that is, trials by jury in criminal matters.  Very often the jury and the parties have to be brought in merely to hear a person arraigned, because it could happen that for some reason the trial would not go on on that day.  Every effort should be made to avoid calling in juries in rural Ireland unnecessarily.  There are practical difficulties in this, but I would rather see six or seven gardaí inconvenienced in getting word to jurors not to come than see maybe 50 or 100 jurors brought in from their farms to a court and find they are not wanted. Very often sittings take place at a busy time in rural Ireland, and every effort should be made to avoid inconvenience to these people.</P>
    <P>Another question with which I want to deal is that of jury actions in the High Court where parties have to come possibly a very long distance to attend at a jury action and then find that the case in front of theirs will take longer than expected.  They then have to stay in Dublin for a couple of days or make a long journey down and a long journey up.  This may happen several <Col N="187" /> times a week over a period of weeks. The reason for it, of course, is that there is no fixed timetable for the commencement of jury actions in the High Court, and the reason why there are no fixed timetables is that it is not possible to know when a particular action may end.  It may be settled; it may be withdrawn from the jury; it may be settled half way through the hearing; the jury may take only a very short time to reach a decision; counsel may be unduly longwinded.  There are all sorts of reasons why it is impossible to formulate an accurate timetable for jury actions.</P>
    <P>If a timetable were to be fixed, the authorities are afraid there would be empty spaces between the ending of one jury trial and the commencement of the next if the first one were to collapse or be settled.  These empty spaces could be filled if they were of any length by the judges dealing with miscellaneous applications.  It could also be filled with the delivering of reserved judgments, because at the moment there is considerable delay in the giving of reserved judgments purely because judges do not have time to get them written and sometimes do not get opportunities for delivering them.  It would be no bad thing if there were these gaps between jury actions.  I have no doubt that these gaps could be filled satisfactorily and economically, and would be a tremendous saving in expense and convenience to members of the public who have to travel to Dublin for jury actions.  It would be of great assistance to them and to practitioners in the courts to know that jury actions would commence at a fixed time and carry on without interruption until they were finished.  This is something, I suggest to the Minister, that might be investigated by some of the court committees.  I should not like to see the answer to the problem being to abolish jury trials, because I would consider that too drastic altogether.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison made reference to the legal aid system.  I should like to endorse his plea for an extension of it into the area of civil law.  At the moment it is available only in criminal matters and it is available only to persons of no means or small means and <Col N="188" /> in serious cases.  By and large, the justices apply this means test very liberally.  Nevertheless, the amount budgeted each year for legal aid is not being used.  I think it was everybody's apprehension when it was introduced that it would be abused and that it could snowball into substantial expenditure.  This has not happened and it indicates a responsible approach to the system by the courts and persons who have to avail of it.  We can take encouragement from this reasonable user of criminal legal aid, and there should now be some extension of it into the realm of civil law.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Pattison indicated, there are persons who are apprehensive of going to law because of the cost involved. It is no answer to them to say: &ldquo;You will get a solicitor or barrister who will do it for nothing for you.&rdquo;  This is only part of the answer, because they might, if they happen to know a solicitor or barrister who will be prepared to do it, but they might be people who have never had any dealings with a solicitor or a barrister and they would be apprehensive of facing into a man without any possibility of being able to pay him.  If a person has a genuine grievance it is not right that he should be deprived of appealing to the courts to have that grievance dealt with.  There should be an immediate investigation for the purpose of considering some extension of the system of legal aid to civil matters.  In criminal matters the system works well and economically.  I have no doubt it would not be abused if much the same type of system were introduced in regard to civil matters.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect of its operation to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  I refer to the fact that legal aid is available where pleas of guilty are offered and the Minister should publicise that in a suitable manner.  There is the case of a person going forward from the District Court to the Circuit Court for sentence only. That is a gap in the law.  I am referring now to the person offering a plea in the first instance in the District Court.  At the moment legal aid is available in the Circuit Court but many district justices interpret the regulations as meaning that they cannot grant <Col N="189" /> certificates where pleas of guilt are offered.  I should like it brought to their notice that the regulations do, in fact, permit this and a different interpretation might change the volume of use being made of legal aid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison talked about a special building for and a less intimidating atmosphere in juvenile courts.  I think he was speaking principally of Dublin; they are too formal and too institutional.  That may be the case in Dublin.  In rural areas the children's court is invariably held in the justice's room.  It is an informal hearing in the sense that it is not in the courtroom proper.  Those present are seated in a more informal manner.  The courtesy and consideration given to both children and their parents in these courts are outstanding.  There is no question, as Deputy Pattison suggested, of children being crossexamined or questioned in an intimidating fashion.  The parents of the children are always present because the parents have to be summoned as well as the children and it was not accurate for Deputy Pattison to suggest that the children are there on their own.  The system of justice in children's courts is merciful.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt in some detail with the Land Registry.  He recognises there are difficulties.  He indicated the vast increase in work which has led to these difficulties.  He dealt with the different structure; instead of having sub-units to deal with a particular function, they now have geographical units and this system appears to work more satisfactorily.  The Examiner of Titles can keep in touch with the mapping branch and this can lead to more efficiency.  The main cause of complaint is in the mapping branch. There is too long a delay in getting a map and too long a delay in completing a dealing where subdivision and remapping is involved.  The reason for the delay is not the fault of the staff.  Because of the volume of work extra staff are required immediately. Considerable hardship is being caused by the delays in the Land Registry and solicitors have to take the brunt of the blame by the public because the public suffer in the ultimate.  People may have borrowed money.  A loan <Col N="190" /> may be lost.  Interest may have to be paid.  These things are quite frequent and considerable hardship is caused by delay in the Land Registry.  The Minister should give priority to providing all the staff necessary and/or the building to ensure that this very important section of his Department can cope efficiently and quickly with the work coming into it.</P>
    <P>It is the Government's and the Minister's intention to have the entire property of the country registered in due course in the Land Registry.  Compulsory registration is now in force in one or two counties.  It cannot be extended until such time as the Land Registry is geared to deal with the extra work compulsory registration will entail.  It is not geared to deal with its existing work.  Consequently, there will have to be a considerable enlargement of the Land Registry if it is to cope with compulsory registration of all the property in the country.  It is difficult to explain to the public what appears to the public to be the excessive formality in getting a site transfer. Surveyors have to be employed to mark maps.  Ordnance sheets have to be obtained.  The Land Commission has to give its consent.  Solicitors have to draw up deeds.  These deeds have to be stamped and lodged in the Land Registry.  The ordinary layman who buys a site for a house cannot understand why that site is not in his name the very next day.  Those who practice law know and understand the system, but this is an area of law reform that the Minister could look at with advantage to see if some system could be devised whereby conveyancing, particularly of plots, could be simplified. One can see the need for a more involved procedure where large areas and large considerations are involved, but there should be some <i>via media</i> between the two extremes so that land transfers could be simplified.  This would be welcomed by the legal profession because they have to take the brunt of the public odium for the defects in the system.  They have no control over the system.  One remedial step would be for the Minister to increase vastly the staff in the Land Registry so that delays can be reduced to a minimum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> In conclusion, I should like to point out again what I consider to be a serious omission in the Minister's opening speech.  He skated over the main feature on the scene at the moment, a feature which concerns his Department primarily.  I refer to the attitude of himself and his Government towards specific elements now rampant in our society.  It was good to hear Deputy P. J. Burke say that the Minister has the full support of all sides in this House but I want to hear other Members of the party opposite coming in and giving some support. Deputy Burke made the significant statement that he had been told he should not open his mouth on certain matters in this House.  In the context in which he made that statement I took it to refer to the activities of subversive organisations.  It would have helped us if he had told us who had given him this unsound and cowardly advice.  One must suspect it came from within his own party circles and one will have that suspicion confirmed unless the Members of that party opposite come in and say unequivocably that they are on the side of law and order.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to express my sincere thanks to the Minister.  I know that Deputies listening to me may say that this is typical of Fianna Fáil Deputies when they rise.  I can assure you that it is untypical of me except where I feel that I have the justification for so doing.  In this connection I especially want to express my thanks to and appreciation of the Minister in respect of what he has accomplished in St. Patrick's Institution at the North Circular <Col N="192" /> Road.  I was happy and honoured to be a member of the visiting committee there for many years.  Certain progress was made during the earlier years of my membership there.  I must confess, on the other hand, to a certain frustration which I felt in the matter of worthwhile proposals which came from that committee to the Department of Justice and the difficulties we experienced in getting the Department to accept that the proposals that we were making were being submitted in all good faith, were the result of our serious involvement in St. Patrick's Institution and that we hoped that the Department would pay careful and sympathetic consideration to them.  Unfortunately, that did not happen.  However, I can say that in respect of the last year&mdash;unfortunately I was not able to continue membership of that committee because meetings clashed with meetings of this House&mdash;more has been accomplished in respect of improvements and changes in St. Patrick's Institution than was accomplished during the previous decade.  Because of that I wish to express my sincere thanks and my genuine appreciation to the Minister, the Minister who within some short weeks of his appointment as Minister for Justice took the pains and went to the bother of visiting St. Patrick's and within a very few weeks we saw signs of his real interest in changing that institution into one that would appear at least to be doing something for the unfortunate boys who found themselves within the walls.</P>
    <P>I am happy that arrangements have now been made that the boys there will get an opportunity of being introduced to what, in educational terms, was called the three Rs.  The system is there now whereby boys having spent a term there will come out with some feeling of indebtedness to the institution in so far as their standard of literacy will have been improved during their stay.</P>
    <P>On every occasion formerly on which I referred to St. Pat's I talked about the undesirability and how wrong it was to have so many of these <Col N="193" /> boys spend so much of their time in what was called &ldquo;the mat shop&rdquo;.  I am happy to see now that the Minister has removed the mat shop from St. Pat's.</P>
    <P>I spoke too about the desirability, as I saw it in regard to the type of boy who was there, of having some females within the walls.  I am happy to see that the reverend sisters are now attending.  I do not want to be accused in any way of being anti-religious but I would like to see this extended.  I want to see other ladies employed in that institution.  I said on previous occasions that invariably in the case of the type of boy who is in that institution, any love he ever got prior to his going in there, any consideration which he ever got, came from a lady, his mother.  He found himself now within gloomy walls policed by big men, most of whom understood him and were sympathetic towards him, but invariably this boy did not associate men with any kindness or consideration towards him. Consequently, he was not prepared to pour forth his heart to any man.  I have a strong feeling, having talked to a cross section of these boys, that if they were to talk with anybody it is more likely they would talk to a lady. I would hope that in their talking with the lady they would not be confined in any way and that if, arising from the frustration which they would feel there, they felt that they wanted to cry or curse in the presence of a lady, this might be possible for them.  With the reverend sisters they may be happy to cry but might feel inhibited in the matter of cursing in their presence. Therefore I would like to see an extension of this very welcome innovation. If at all possible we should have more ladies employed.  I speak specifically of St. Pat's.</P>
    <P>I am happy to read of the success of Shanganagh.  There was in the Minister's speech an indication of the number of boys who, having spent a term there, did not return. Percentages are always welcome but at times may be deceptive.  I mention this as a slight criticism.  The type of boy who qualifies for Shanganagh invariably is a first timer.  He has not the same history <Col N="194" /> as a boy in St. Patrick's would have.  While the news is very welcome it should not be accepted that the boy in Shanganagh is like the boy in St. Patrick's.  Invariably it is the better type boy who is selected for Shanganagh. A thought I had about Shanganagh was whether or not we might think of Shanganagh in reverse and introduce what might be described as the worst offenders to Shanganagh.</P>
    <P>I am happy in regard to St. Patrick's Institution because of the physical changes that have occurred there, the changes in diet and all the reforms which the Minister has had introduced.</P>
    <P>I now propose to say a word about what is described as law and justice. In the last decade we have noticed great changes in practically every sphere.  Up to that point certain things had been accepted as true and unchangeable. Certain barriers had been erected in the matter of knowledge. Certain principles had been accepted. Many of these ideas have been exploded and apart from mathematical formulae one can seldom say that what was appropriate or relevant ten to 100 years ago is relevant to the present day.  I am not what could be described as a lawyer.  My view would be the simple layman's view.  I see law, order and justice as an indication of the concern on the part of the community that those living in a community are entitled to protection to ensure that they can lead a normal life.  I take the positive view that the first responsibility is to protect the right of the person and in that respect that law and justice will take issue with anyone who can be shown to be guilty or who can be proved to be a menace or threat to the innocent, that is, those who are prepared to go about their normal avocations in a reasonable and correct way.</P>
    <P>In this regard I may refer back to what I said about old clichés and old slogans.  A typical example would be the sacredness with which we held the slogan.  &ldquo;You shall not pass a picket&rdquo;. That principle was very desirable and appropriate and relevant to times that are past.  In the enlightened times in which we live and having regard to <Col N="195" /> the development which has occurred in the matter of negotiation, that slogan is no longer relevant.  We see the tragedy that occurs when people think and remember times when to pass a picket left one open to the accusation of blacklegging or doing an injustice to fellow workers.  We retain memories of those days.  I shall not pursue that matter.  I merely mention it as a background to what I shall mention which is relevant to the motion we are discussing.</P>
    <P>We are told that it is an accepted principle that a man is innocent until he is proved guilty.  I must confess that I am having doubts as to the wisdom of acceptance of that principle, just as I have doubts as to the wisdom of accepting the principle that a man may not pass a picket.  Would lawyers here who have knowledge of the background of and justification for laws made in the past, on some appropriate occasion indicate the origin of that principle?  I can see that principle as having been very important and very desirable, say, 1,000 years ago when in the case of the ordinary person, namely, the peasant, those for whom law and order existed, the upper classes, would in their benevolence accord to that creature the right in certain circumstances, perhaps circumstances in which it was proposed to take his life from him where he would be arraigned on a capital charge, to be accepted as innocent until he was proved guilty. However, from reading cases in the paper over the last four or five years I cannot see how, in the case of persons brought before the court, where there is evidence and information which makes sense to any reasonable man, under this umbrella of what is called law, the judge sitting on the bench may hold that because the evidence is defective in some legal technicality he cannot accept it and where the courts have become, as I see it, a platform from which a judge&mdash;I am not saying anything personal about judges&mdash;would seem to defy anybody to prove that a person charged before him could have been guilty of an offence.  All accused persons, I think, can be presumed to be innocent until they are proved guilty, but the fact <Col N="196" /> that they have been accused and brought before courts should not be accepted, as it seems to me to be, as proof that they can never be guilty.</P>
    <P>From reading judgments and cases covering every field, it seems to me that courts today are set up to defy anybody to prove that anybody has been guilty of anything.  As I have said, we are told everybody is innocent until he is proved guilty, and the set-up seems to be to dare anybody to prove anybody guilty of anything.</P>
    <P>We find cases where members of the Garda&mdash;they represent us and all the right-minded people in the community &mdash;appear in court to discharge their duties and it seems to me that they are the people who have now become the accused.  Gardaí appear in court with certain informations.  A garda may have taken a statement from somebody. He is asked: &ldquo;Did you warn him before you took the statement?&rdquo; He says he did.  He is asked if he has filled in some little technicality which seems to me to be entirely irrelevant. If he has not the evidence will not be accepted.  The accused may have been brought to a Garda station.  If he was not put sitting beside a nice fire and given all the comforts, if it can be shown that anybody trod on his toes, the judge or the legal man representing him will make some legal points and have all the worthwhile evidence, as far as I am concerned, rejected.</P>
    <P>I have memories of cases.  I can recall a motoring case, a drunken driving charge, which occurred a year or two ago.  Because the unfortunate garda who interviewed the driver did not perform some technical operation, because he did not say to the driver &ldquo;You did this&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Are you somebody else?&rdquo; the evidence was rejected although everybody knew that the person was the person to whom the charge referred.  Because of some simple technicality in the requirements of that which is called the law the case was thrown out.</P>
    <P>That may be law but to my mind it is not justice.  It tends to make a mockery of what our courts should be doing, and developments in that direction are spilling over into other fields.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="197" /> Deputy Cooney referred to Deputy Burke's contribution.  I did not hear what Deputy Cooney quoted Deputy Burke as having said but I reject the suggestion from Deputy Cooney or anybody else in the House that anybody sitting in these benches does not accept that the institutions which we have in this country are institutions set up in a democratic and correct fashion, that they are institutions which must be and shall be defended until such time as some other group or body of people with a new or alternative mandate from the people of Ireland set up something else.  If and when that happens, any changes that will come about will be welcomed, but it must be remembered they can be tolerated and accepted only if and when we know they represent the views and the wishes and the desires and the interests of the people of Ireland and not of any small section of them.</P>
    <P>Still referring to members of the Garda and the respect which we must have and should have for them, I intend to mention one or two points that have crossed my mind occasionally. During recent years, indeed for many years past, we have been recruiting to the Garda a type of person for his intelligence and understanding rather than his physique.  There is a very fine type of man entering the Garda at the moment.  However, I do not think they are getting the opportunity to display their abilities and talents.  In certain cases, because of the duties some of them are expected to perform, members of the Garda are forced to do disservice to themselves and to the Garda force generally.</P>
    <P>We can take a situation where a citizen parks his car in some prohibited place.  When he returns in half an hour or an hour he has a parking ticket which costs him £2.  I do not think we are helping that citizen to have respect for the Garda in these circumstances.  It is vital that members of the Garda Síochána must have the confidence, the concern and the co-operation of the public, and when a garda operates at this level&mdash;I refer to traffic parking&mdash;I suggest he is <Col N="198" /> operating contrary to his own interests and the interests of the Garda as a whole and, therefore, the interests of the State.</P>
    <P>I know we have other traffic officers who go around on the same errand. This work should be confined to those people, to people other than gardaí.  In the times in which we live we should be concerned to see that gardaí are engaged in more important work.  I do not think it helps the image of the Garda to be concerned with some small farmer&mdash;we have some of them in County Dublin&mdash;trying hard to combine farming with the operation of transporting cattle, who driving through Phibsboro' is found by a garda to have a dirty number plate on his truck.  I do not agree with the idea of bringing people who are guilty of no more than having dirty number plates before the courts and I particularly do not agree that it is a job for the gardaí.  Men found with dirty number plates or found parking cars in prohibited areas seem to be sitting ducks for the courts.  It is just a matter of bringing them before the courts, extracting fines from them and letting them go.  I am afraid that the gardaí are being forced to do this work.</P>
    <P>I suggest that such traffic duties should be left to a force entirely separate from the Garda.  I would recruit a special force to do that work.  I would suggest recruiting young men to a traffic corps and giving them opportunities of promotion to the Garda proper.  We should try to remove the gardaí from that type of operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I said on a former occasion, and I would like to repeat it now, that enough is not being done in regard to integrating the gardaí with the community. It is very important that members of the Garda force should visit schools in their own areas.  They only visit them now when they are looking for information about some misdemeanour. The 95 per cent of children who are never guilty of any offence have the idea that the garda is a gentleman who comes when something has gone wrong.  Members of the Garda should be invited into schools to have chats with the children.  This <Col N="199" /> could be an extension of the subject of civics.  The children could realise what the work of the garda is.  They could get friendly with him.  At the moment if a young person wants to have contact with the Garda he must commit some offence.</P>
    <P>In West Finglas, which is an area as big as many of the towns throughout the country, we have not one member of the Garda force living there. The impression there is that gardaí are gentlemen who come from residential areas.  They do not see a garda as a friend or neighbour.  The only time they see him in the area is when he is investigating a crime.  There should be consultations between the Department of Justice, the Department of Local Government and Dublin Corporation to ensure that members of the Garda force are offered housing accommodation in what are commonly called built-up areas.  I am sure members of the Garda force would welcome this.  They have the same housing difficulties as anybody else.  Their wages are not such as to make them ineligible for this type of housing. They will find that there are people living in those areas who have one and a half times and perhaps twice their wages.  I suggest to the Minister that he should ensure that members of the Garda live in areas like Finglas, Ballyfermot, Coolock and other places like this.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be forgiven for confining my remarks to my own constituency. I want to refer finally to something which concerns all parts of Dublin.  This is often the cause of laughter from some members of the public.  I refer particularly to wandering horses.  I have an idea that the legislation existing at the moment governing this question emanates from the time of Magna Carta and there has been very little advancement since. At that time the horse was king of the road and today, despite all the changes that have taken place, he still seems to be king of the road.  I have made some inquiries regarding the actual legislation which governs wandering horses and it seems to be some summary jurisdiction Act of 1851.  If that Act only were applied in relation to <Col N="200" /> wandering horses, their owners, who are not poor people, would be fined only 50p.  I understand that the Garda often take a chance and fine them under some other Act where the fine can be heavy.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House is aware that within the last three or four months a mother of five young children was killed on the road outside Finglas village.  Nobody knows who owns the horse.  The State seems very unconcerned about the condition under which this happened.  There are several cases in Finglas of young children who will never be the same again after being kicked by horses.  I appreciate the efforts which are being made by the Garda over the last six months but those wandering horses are still there. If you impound 20 today you find that 20 more are there tomorrow.  We have more children in Finglas than in any other part of Dublin.  If you go out there at the moment you will find at least 50 to 100 horses roaming around. Apart from the danger to children they are there at night and anybody motoring through Finglas is liable to encounter a horse on any of those roads.  If the driver is the breadwinner of a young family and if he is taken from them there is nothing that can be done.</P>
    <P>I know that the fault does not lie entirely with the Department of Justice. The fault lies more with the Dublin Corporation who are co-operating with those people in that they make grazing land available to them free of charge. Naturally enough, the people concerned will avail of this land.  I understand that some of these horse-owners or horse-traders are among the best clients of the bank manager.  They do not pay anything to anyone but, at the same time, they are a menace to the ordinary, correct and right-living persons in the area.</P>
    <P>This is where I see people losing faith in law and justice, people who are themselves never guilty of an offence but who can see others getting away with causing damage.  Although damage to property can cause hardship to the owner, I am more concerned about the danger to human life that exists on the perimeter of Dublin <Col N="201" /> city.  In answers to Parliamentary Questions which I addressed to the Minister I detected the sympathy of the Minister in this matter.  I am availing of this opportunity to ask him to work as expeditiously on this matter as he did on matters to which I referred previously in connection with St. Patrick's Institution.  If he does this, next year I shall be as happy about this matter as I am about St. Patrick's this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>At any time this discussion is important because of the general interest in the administration of justice and the preservation of the public peace but in present circumstances and in the context of a number of happenings in recent years it is of even greater importance than it has been for some time.</P>
      <P>Previously I quoted the crime statistics and it is not necessary to repeat them.  The growth of crime as shown in the statistics published in the annual report of the Commissioner indicates clearly the alarming trend in the rate of crime.  The Minister in his statement refers to this matter when he states: &ldquo;Although the crime figures for the year ended 30th September, 1971, are not yet available the indications are that there was a further substantial increase in the figures for that year.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>These figures indicate a continuous trend in the wrong direction.  When I first mentioned this matter I recommended that the time had come for a substantial increase in the strength of the Garda and I state that this was in the public interest and particularly in the interests of the poor, the weak, and the type of persons who have been referred to in this debate.  These are the people who have been most severely affected by the failure to maintain the Garda force at an adequate strength and have available an adequate number of gardaí to carry out the various duties involved in police work in a modern society.  Belatedly the Government decided to increase the Garda force but I do not think the numbers it is proposed to recruit this year are adequate.  It is important that this aspect should be considered further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a very serious matter that we <Col N="202" /> should have an adequate Garda force, and it is of special concern to those who have been unfortunate enough to have been injured or to the relatives of those who have been killed.  However, over and above that there is the fundamental matter which my colleagues and myself have placed in the forefront of all national questions&mdash; the maintenance of law and order and the defence of the democratic institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>The irregular and illegal usurpation of power and authority by unauthorised groups in the community has been and is the cause of public concern and uneasiness.  I wish to repeat our conviction, our belief and our support for any necessary measures to curtail irregular and illegal activities. There can be no double-thinking on this matter and here I come to what I think is a fundamental weakness in the attitude of Fianna Fáil on this question.</P>
    <P>By and large members of the Fianna Fáil Party are decent, harmless men. By and large the party are committed to peace and order, but the history of that party and the ambivalent attitude they have adopted from time to time has had a disastrous influence on their effective capacity as a political institution and organisation to act and speak authoritatively and decisively in upholding, maintaining and enforcing impartially the law against all comers.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice recently spoke at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and he adverted to this matter.  He said he was concerned at some decisions that had been given in the courts, and I think by implication he criticised those decisions.  I do not think that was the appropriate place to express this criticism, although that is a minor point.  I should like to ask what major change has taken place, either by amendment or deletion or otherwise, in the law as it exists now and as it has existed in reference to this matter 15 or 16 years ago.</P>
    <P>The laws then existing and the legal procedures then obtaining&mdash;with one change which I will mention&mdash;are those that exist at present, as far as I know.  At that time the Government of which I was a member brought <Col N="203" /> prosecutions and secured convictions against members of illegal organisations. Subsequently&mdash;and it is right that this should be mentioned&mdash;that Government were replaced by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Fianna Fáil then not merely followed up the procedure of continuing prosecutions and securing convictions where the evidence warranted them but also introduced internment, and continued to use internment for some years.</P>
    <P>I think we would all accept that if it is necessary to change the law in order to secure convictions, if this is justifiable and necessary, and if it can be proved to this House and to the country that changes are necessary, these changes should be made.  We should not lightly criticise the procedures. So far as I know, the only change of any consequence which was made was that instead of taking depositions in open court the procedure now is that a book of evidence is produced.  It is on that basis that these cases are taken.</P>
    <P>If there are cases in which convictions should have been obtained it has to be said&mdash;and I say it in no spirit of criticism of the judiciary&mdash;that, with a few limited exceptions, all the members of the judiciary were appointed by Fianna Fáil Governments.  In some cases, and I would hope in all cases, this does not lessen their capacity or their ability or their impartiality in administering justice.  It does not matter whether you take the Supreme Court or the High Court, with one or two exceptions, the members who were appointed were either active or inactive supporters of Fianna Fáil. With, I think, four exceptions in the Circuit Court, all the judges were appointed by Fianna Fáil.  With the exception of probably four or five members of the total bench of district justices of about 30 all were appointed by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>If there is anything wrong with the manner in which justice is being administered at least Fianna Fáil know where and how the members of the judiciary were selected.  If cases have been improperly presented, if the counsel who presented them have not <Col N="204" /> presented them properly, again with a microscopic exception, the people presenting them were drawn from the same source.  Therefore, I am not convinced that fundamental changes are needed.  I do not think we should have unnecessary conflict about whether the legislation was initially drawn from Europe or from Britain.  What we want is to enact legislation which will ensure that, where irregular and illegal activities are carried on, it is possible to get convictions.</P>
    <P>We never hesitated.  I want to contrast the different attitudes.  The Minister inherited the legacies of his predecessors.  We did not refuse to establish here, when necessary, either military tribunals or military courts, and we did not withhold support from those courts when established.  The only critics at any time of that procedure were Fianna Fáil Deputies, some Deputies who subsequently became Ministers and who ultimately had to take the same decisions.  Before we can make real progress we must end once and for all any question of a double-think on this matter.  Let us be frank about it.  It mainly enters into political questions when the North of Ireland is concerned on the one hand, or in connection with irregular and illegal organisations in this part of the country on the other hand.</P>
    <P>There is no legitimate authority with the right to raise an Army or a Garda force other than this House and the organs responsible to it and selected and maintained by it.  There can be no double-think on this matter.  One of the claims made in the past by Fianna Fáil was that only a single party had the authority or the strength to govern effectively.  We see that in this connection this Government have been weak and indecisive.  There have been all the elements of the double-think and the failure to take action.  Of course it is common knowledge that the Government were teetering on the brink of establishing special courts. Then some convictions were secured in a few cases and they lurched again away from the fatal decision.</P>
    <P>No Government lightly takes a decision&mdash;and no one on this side of the House easily suggests that they should <Col N="205" />&mdash;to establish in a democratic society either military courts or special courts. These in the main are decisions of last resort.  It must go out clearly and unequivocally from this House that the right to decide national policy rests in Dáil Éireann and nowhere else.  If small groups want to get authority they can go before the electorate and secure a mandate for their views.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat the experience which this party have had.  We have accepted the will of the majority.  We have seen our side shrink in circumstances in which we had to withstand every type of personal and political vilification.  We fought back and we demonstrated two qualities: one the will to fight and survive, and the other an acceptance that people in a democracy have the right to change their representatives and either support this party in larger numbers or vote this party out and vote the Fianna Fáil Party in.</P>
    <P>So long as the Fianna Fáil Government have the legal authority, supported by a majority in this House, then they have the duty to see that the law is enforced and enforced impartially. What nobody believes is that this can be shrugged off by throwing the blame on district justices and judges who, as I said, are almost exclusively drawn from Fianna Fáil supporters.  If they are not competent there is a way of dealing with them but it is not to express disapproval at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and mention in the course of that expression the procedure which exists under the 1936 Act and which, of course, has been there since 1936 and can be employed at any time.  It would be a mistake lightly to suggest changes of a fundamental character and certainly if suggestions of this sort are brought forward they should be supported by clear and coercive evidence that it is impossible to get convictions and that the ordinary system of district court procedure and trial by jury has failed to work.  If it can be proved that it is impossible to get convictions by ordinary procedure, this party would not hesitate, and have never hesitated, to take necessary action or support <Col N="206" /> needed changes in this regard.</P>
    <P>But we must go further; we must carry conviction to the community that the situation now existing is different from any that existed prior to independence, that the Garda and Army forces are Irish forces under Irish control, Irishmen working for Irishmen and in the interests of the Irish people and that it is wrong to make analogies as it is invalid to make comparisons between conditions now and conditions prior to the establishment of the State.  Since the State was established, and indeed at its very inception, the authority exercised by the forces of the nation had, and has, the sanction of the people as expressed in an election.  We must make it quite clear that there is no true analogy between conditions now and then and that it is in the public interest to recognise&mdash;here I want to reinforce what has been said during this debate&mdash; that there are a number of aspects of the preservation of peace in the widest sense, not merely defence of democratic institutions and suppression of irregular and illegal organisations, but preservation of peace in the sense of curtailment of crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>In this city and in my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire and in many parts of the country, but particularly in populous urban areas, the damage caused by vandalism is colossal.  It is directed recklessly against the property of the State and against private property.  In many areas one sees damaged telephone kiosks, public lighting and a whole range of services, institutions or property which in many cases are for the public benefit. It is essential that we should establish a strong civic opinion, virile and active, and it should be brought home to people at every level by political parties, by schools and other bodies, because it is essential to get the message across, that it is in the interests of every section&mdash;weak in the sense of those who need the use of telephones for emergencies and other occasions&mdash; no matter what the price of property is, whether a public telephone or a public light or anything else, or whether it is private property, and in the national <Col N="207" /> interest that it should not be damaged.</P>
    <P>Here, again, we have an unfortunate legacy from history.  In the past many of these things were associated with an alien administration&mdash;not the telephone which is a public service of a neutral kind.  Disrespect for law and lack of respect for its maintenance and for the general public interest that should exist in support of law is to some extent a legacy from the past.  We have now had 50 years of self-government and we have an overriding obligation to realise&mdash;and public representatives have an inescapable duty to make this abundantly clear&mdash;that it is in everybody's interest to see that the law is maintained and that the institution of the law, the Garda and all the administration of justice are part of the machinery of Government designed, in the first instance, to ensure that the weaker or poorer sections of the community have their interests safeguarded and their persons and property made secure.</P>
    <P>There are some particular aspects of the Minister's Department, apart from these overriding public questions, to which I want to refer briefly.  In connection with judgments there is considerable delay in many cases where judgment is reserved.  Quite a long time elapses before reserved judgment is delivered and this can lead to strain on parties concerned and in some cases to actual loss.  It is intolerable that delays of many months should occur where judgment is reserved.  There is another aspect of this which also causes hardship.  The interest rate on judgments is 4 per cent and I understand this has not been increased for a very long time.  In cases where there have been delays in reaching a decision it is possible for one party to enjoy the advantage of the use of the money, so to speak, at a higher rate of interest while the person who will ultimately secure the judgment in his favour is entitled to interest only at 4 per cent. I note from the Minister's speech and the reports of a number of commissions, but particularly the commission concerned with landlords and tenants, that he proposes to deal with certain aspects in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="208" /> Some of the matters covered in the report concern vitally a part of my constituency while many of the other matters covered are of a more general character.  I am concerned particularly with that aspect which provides facilities for sporting clubs that wish to avail of the right to retain property and to provide amenities for their members and, in particular, grounds such as golf courses.  That is important. These matters should be dealt with as speedily as possible especially in areas where land is being required for building and development.  These are questions of detail and it will be possible to deal more fully with them when the relevant legislation is before the House.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude on the note on which I began and say that during a long period I have expressed repeatedly that it is essential that there should be no doubt as to the attitude of the Government in these matters. The doubt that exists goes back to what I would call the cat-and-mouse approach of Fianna Fáil to this matter down through the years with the exception of two possible occasions when their direct challenge put at risk the members of the Government.  Apart from those two exceptions their attitude to irregular and illegal organisations has been such that there is a suspicion in the public mind as to there having been some indirect or concealed contact between members of the Fianna Fáil Party and some of those concerned with these organisations.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware of the unswerving support from this side of the House for the maintenance of law and order.  Regardless of the cost we are determined to vindicate, to assert and to defend the authority of this House and the institutions of the State in the interests and on behalf of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the House for what has been a useful debate on the many serious problems that confront me and my Department at present and for the various comments made on the matters to which I referred in my opening speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="209" /> A good deal of the discussion from the other side has been the topic of subversive organisations.  I think I have made clear my position, the Government's position and the Fianna Fáil Party's position generally on this problem.  I spoke in general rather than in particular terms in my opening remarks on this problem because I do not wish to refer to specific incidents. Apart from the fact that to do so would be outside the rules of order of the House, it would be unfair to both sides, prosecution and defence, in any such case.  Many of the cases referred to are still pending in so far as where convictions were secured I understand there were appeals.  For that reason I make no apology for speaking in general rather than in specific terms.  I am afraid that to a great extent I must confine myself even in my reply to speaking in general terms.</P>
    <P>In regard to the prosecutions that have been brought and the investigations of the alleged offences on which prosecutions were based, I want to say that the investigations that led to the bringing of those prosecutions were as thorough and as full as the Garda Síochána could possibly undertake.  In the course of the debate the allegation has been made that in some way the Garda were inhibited or retarded in their investigations into many of these incidents.  That is completely untrue in relation to each one of the incidents in which there were prosecutions or, indeed, in relation to incidents where it was found impossible to prosecute. At no time were the Garda inhibited. As any senior Garda officer could verify, I have gone out of my way to give every possible encouragement to the Garda to arrest and prosecute on every occasion that they might get any opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions have been brought in this country during the past six months or so where the evidence was thin and where, in other circumstances or if the offences were of a different type, prosecutions might not have been brought. I am afraid this is one of the reasons for a number of the acquittals but it is indicative and, indeed, proof of my anxiety, of the Government's anxiety <Col N="210" /> and of the anxiety of the Attorney General, independently, to try on every possible occasion to have these people prosecuted and convicted.</P>
    <P>There have been cases heard recently &mdash;I do not wish to refer to any specific one&mdash;where evidence was given by gardaí who took notes of speeches made by individuals at meetings in the hearing of 20 or 30 persons or, perhaps, in some cases of several hundred persons.  What was said consisted usually of encouragement for illegal organisations and of appeal for guns and of asking members of the audience to hand over to people who were described as being in the Republican movement any guns in their possession or control.  It would seem to me, as it seemed to the gardaí, that such speeches constituted offences against the ordinary law of this land under the Offences Against the State Act.  Prosecutions were brought accordingly but as far as I am aware the bulk of those prosecutions have not succeeded.</P>
    <P>In the course of this debate I have been asked to analyse why this should have been so.  Perhaps this House is not the place to analyse these matters. Perhaps an analysis of the reasons as to why this should be the situation could give rise to my making comments that it might be better not to make.  A full analysis of the reasons for this situation might inevitably give rise to such comments.  Whatever the reasons, these, unfortunately, are the facts.  The Garda having brought prosecutions in regard to matters that seemed to me and to them to be very clear and having given very clear evidence were astonished, as I am, to find that there was no conviction.  I am not laying the blame for that on any particular person, group or institution. What I am saying is that it is not the fault of the Garda or of the Government, not my fault or the fault of the Attorney General.  These prosecutions are being brought in respect of what appear to be clear-cut offences.  They have been prosecuted in the normal way by competent people, well&mdash; experienced in prosecutions, but convictions have not been obtained.  Whatever the reason may be, it is not the fault of the Government or of the <Col N="211" /> Garda.  At no time have the Garda been inhibited or retarded in any way in their investigation of activities of this or any other type carried out by members of illegal organisations.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, I have repeatedly exhorted the senior officers of the Garda Síochána to use every lawful means open to them to press ahead with investigations, and prosecutions, against members of illegal organisations.  I am satisfied that those senior officers have conveyed that message down the lines to every member of the Garda Síochána.  I am satisfied that the Garda Síochána as a whole, and every individual member, have endeavoured to do all they can in this respect.  There are great problems.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening speech, it seems difficult for a layman to understand why Mr. X or Mr. Y can be described almost every day in our newspapers as chief-of-staff of the Provisional IRA or chief-of-staff of the Official IRA or a prominent member of the IRA and at the same time we cannot get a conviction in the courts against this man for membership of an illegal organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Not wishing to interrupt, but can the Minister say how does this failure compare with similar incidents in the past where convictions were secured?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed this point with the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána, who is a man of great experience in dealing with these particular people.  Before this man was Commissioner, much of his career was involved in dealing with them.  He gave me a number of reasons why it was more difficult now to secure convictions. Some of the reasons which he gave me, if I were to mention them here openly, would be of assistance only to the members of illegal organisations.  One of the problems I have referred to somewhat obliquely before&mdash;and I do not think I am giving away anything in repeating it&mdash;is that, as the Commissioner has told me, in the 1950s and the early 1960s, and earlier during the war years when he was very actively engaged in <Col N="212" /> this matter, almost every successful prosecution for membership of an illegal organisation was secured as a result of evidence of membership obtained from a document found on the person or in the house of the defendant.  He tells me&mdash;and I can verify this from my own knowledge of the reports I have seen&mdash;that nowadays the obtaining of a document of that nature on the person of or in the possession of a member of an illegal organisation is very rare.  That is so. These people are aware of this point.</P>
      <P>It is amazing the difference in the approach and in the attitudes of these people to the law and the forces of the law now as compared with 15 or 30 years ago.  It was a matter of principle for members of the so-called IRA during the war and during the 1950s to refuse to recognise courts and to refuse to take legal advice except in very serious cases.  The situation today is very different.  I have seen documents which have been seized in certain premises associated with illegal organisations, which set out at great length the steps to be taken by a member of one of these organisations if he is accosted, and even setting out the names and telephone numbers of the solicitors with whom he is to get in touch.  Elaborate precautions to be taken in the course of the commission of crime are set out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will recall that quite recently there were a number of prosecutions in respect of documents which were found in the premises of what at one and the same time appears to be an illegal organisation and a registered political party.  Those documents were referred to at some length by the barrister who was prosecuting on that occasion.  The contents of those documents were very revealing.  Unfortunately, the contents of the documents did not receive any great publicity in the newspapers.  It might be no harm to refer in passing to the contents again.  Before I refer to the contents. I want to say that a number of people were charged in relation to the possession of these documents and my recollection is that, unfortunately, only one person was convicted, and he was fined either £10 or £20.  The other <Col N="213" /> people charged were not convicted.  I understand that was on the grounds that the premises were business premises and that it could not be proved that the people prosecuted were the occupiers, even though they held themselves out as being the trustees or the main members of the party concerned. My recollection is that evidence was given in court by the Clerk of the Dáil to that effect.</P>
    <P>These documents were of a hair-raising nature.  One of them was a stereotype document, of which there were obviously many copies.  It contained three foolscap pages setting out in detail how to steal a motor car.  The first sentence was:</P>
    <P>In the course of his duties, a volunteer may often have to requisition a motor car.</P>
    <P>I recall vividly the last sentence in block capitals at the end, with two exclamation marks.  It read:</P>
    <P>Always remember, never steal an ordinary worker's car!!</P>
    <P>In between these two sentences there were three pages in the document produced by this illegal organisation-cum-registered political party, which set out in great detail how to steal a car and how not to be caught at it.  After the way in which that document and many others were found, I recall being accused of using my position as Minister for Justice to persecute a genuine, legitimate political party.  I found it difficult to see why it should be necessary for a genuine political party, whether registered or unregistered, to set out in three pages the minute details of how to go about stealing a motor car.  In many ways I should like to give more details of it but it would only be of assistance to those who wish to engage in that crime.</P>
    <P>Another interesting set of documents found in the same premises, Gardiner Place, were copies of search warrants used by the gardaí from time to time in searching premises for arms and subversive documents of one kind or another.  It appears that gardaí in some areas thought they were under an obligation actually to serve the warrant <Col N="214" /> on the occupier.  This is not so. They are obliged only to show it to the occupier, but in one instance and possibly two, they actually served it on the occupier.  Many copies were then ingeniously made of the search warrants. Some of the copies had then been filled in in the names of fictitious Garda officers directed to premises where it was known that licensed guns were held.</P>
    <P>I was horrified when I discovered this.  This is a very serious matter, and I immediately asked that the premises named in these fraudulent warrants should be visited to see if, in fact, they had been raided by these people on the strength of these warrants.  By a happy coincidence, if you like&mdash;unhappy in another way&mdash;the premises in question had, several months previously, quite a number of arms held under a certificate from the police legally, but the holder of the certificate had died suddenly and his widow was not anxious to retain the arms in the house and had handed them all into the local police station.  Happily nothing came of that, but it is a serious matter that this illegal organisation should have acted in this way. Perhaps I should not refer to it as that but should refer to it as a registered political party.</P>
    <P>In addition to those documents, a very large number of documents, each set running to 20 or 25 pages, containing diagrams of how to make different forms of grenade, were found.  I recall four different forms of grenade, depending on what kind of damage you wanted to do, whether you wanted to kill people&mdash;that is called an &ldquo;anti-personnel&rdquo; grenade&mdash; or whether you wanted to cause damage in a house&mdash;structural damage, or a fire&mdash;I think that is called an &ldquo;incendiary&rdquo;.  There is some other kind, too; I forget what it is used for. There were detailed diagrams, all drawn perfectly to scale, with precise instructions as to how these should be made.  These were all found at 30 Gardiner Place.  There were, as I say, prosecutions brought in respect of them.  There was one limited conviction; unfortunately, the others were dismissed.</P>
    <P>I mention this as an instance of the <Col N="215" /> frustration which I feel and the Garda feel in relation to the difficulties they are up against.  When I talk about changes in the law, I would regard it as not unreasonable that those who hold themselves out as the proprietors of 30 Gardiner Place should be responsible in law for what is found in it.  Unfortunately, that does not seem to be so.  I do not think such a change in the law could be reasonably objected to.  I think it would surprise most people to hear that the law is not that way already.  As I said earlier in reply to Deputy Cosgrave, I cannot, for obvious reasons, give all the details in this regard, but those I have given are, I think, indicative of the serious problems we are facing and the sort of things we may have to do if we are effectively to overcome these problems.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have not a copy of the newspaper reports with me now, but I should like to refer Deputies who feel apprehensive about fundamental changes in the law to articles which appeared in the more literate of the British newspapers on Friday last and which were referred to in <i>The Observer</i> on Sunday last, and which reported that a criminal law commission in Britain is about to recommend&mdash;I understand this was more of a leak than an official report &mdash;what to us and to our way of thinking and, indeed, to the British way of thinking, are fairly fundamental changes in the approach to the criminal law.  The reported proposals&mdash;and I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 10th April&mdash;include the abolition of the police caution to a suspected person, the disclosure of an accused person's previous convictions before conviction, and a requirement that he must go into the witness box.  The Criminal Law Revision Commission who are making these proposals are a very distinguished body.  I cannot give the membership offhand but it includes many eminent British lawyers and a number of eminent judges.</P>
    <P>I think there is a realisation in Britain now that the criminal law has two functions: it has the function of protecting society and it has the function <Col N="216" /> of protecting the individual accused.  We in this country, and, in particular, many Members of this House, believe that the only function of the criminal law is to protect the rights of the accused.  I am all in favour of protecting the rights of the accused &mdash;let me preface anything further I have to say with that.  At the same time the protection of society is at least as important as the protection of the accused.  That is, I think, realised in the systems of criminal law in Continental Europe, which systems derive from what was basically Roman law. This is becoming realised now in Britain and the proposals of the commission are indicative of that way of thinking.  I am particularly struck by the fact that the British Government and the British Parliament are now recommending that the immunity of a defendant from having to give evidence or answer questions should be called in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> And the Minister appears to have learned about it since he prepared his speech because yesterday he seemed to be criticising the English system; he referred exclusively to the Continental system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Deputy to what I said.  In fact I mentioned this very point when I said :</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is as if&mdash;and, indeed, some say this in almost as many words&mdash;we are asked to believe that Continental Europe, the cradle of western civilisation, has no respect for human liberty and that only by adhering strictly and even slavishly to what we <Col N="217" /> inherited here can justice be done&mdash; and this even after our benefactors are themselves satisfied that their system of justice is no longer all that just or all that suitable for their own society.</P>
    <P>That is a direct reference to the matters about which I am now talking more specifically.  It would probably not be a very useful exercise to discuss further these proposals until we see the actual report.  I understand it will be published shortly.  It will obviously contain some fairly radical new thinking on the aproach to many of these problems and all of us, not least myself, will benefit from a close reading and examination of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their general welcome of what has been done in regard to prisons over the past two years.  Unfortunately our plans and hopes have not been fulfilled as successfully as they might have been, principally because of the unusually large numbers in our prisons at the moment; this creates security problems and does not allow of the kind of staff/ prisoner relationship to develop to the extent to which I should like to see it develop and the extent to which the staff would like to see it develop.  As we overcome the overcrowding problem, I am very confident that the relationship will continue to expand in a way that will be very beneficial to those in prison.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney asked for a further extension of the welfare service.  There has been a very, very large extension of that service.  It has been expanded from eight members in 1970 to 31 at the moment.  I hope to expand it still further because I have great confidence in it.  It could be the solution to many of our problems.  More importantly, it could be the solution of the personal problems of very many of those with whom the service will deal from now on.  Our first major experiment in close supervision of offenders on their special early release from St. Patrick's Institution is proving very successful.  It has been only eight weeks in operation but 30 out of 34 of those under this close supervision have kept straight and that is an abnormally high proportion. Normally the relapse rate is pretty <Col N="218" /> high and great credit is due to the welfare officers for the way in which they are carrying out their arduous duties.  When we increase the number still further I hope we will be able to extend the system and that it will not be necessary in future to release people from prison or from St. Patrick's to this type of supervision; I hope they will be sent direct by the courts to undergo this kind of supervision and will never have to enter one of our institutions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to delays in hearing cases, particularly criminal cases.  As I pointed out, since the appointment of another Circuit Court judge in Dublin delays have lessened. The judge appointed has not been long enough in office to eliminate delays altogether, but he is hearing a large number of civil cases every week and this has allowed his brother judges to concentrate on the hearing of criminal cases.  The number of criminal appeals coming to the Circuit Court, particularly in Dublin in recent years, has been enormous.  One judge in the Dublin Circuit Court has to devote all his time to hearing criminal appeals. The number runs into several thousand a year.  I am prepared to ask the Government, should this be necessary, to advise the President to appoint another Circuit Court judge.  However, the way things are going at the moment, I do not think this will be necessary.  I believe the arrears will be cleared off reasonably soon.  The arrears in civil cases have dropped very considerably. The only place where arrears are serious at the moment is in Dublin.  There may be temporary arrears in one county or in one circuit for one term but they are never of such a magnitude that the judge, by going back for an additional week the following term, cannot clear them.  Our problem in this regard is really in Dublin and in Dublin alone.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my opening speech.  I have set up a small committee chaired by the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice O'Keeffe, to look into the question of accommodation generally for the courts here in Dublin because the Four Courts complex is pretty full at the moment.  I doubt if we <Col N="219" /> can fit any more judges into it and I think we will have to think in terms of building a new modern block for courts.  I would envisage putting a good number of district courts into such a block if we can do that and I think a suitable place would be somewhere in one of the many derelict sites which there are at the back of the existing Four Courts in order to try to keep the administration as centralised as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the fact that nearly 50 per cent of my speech was devoted to prisons.  He was critical of this fact.  The reason for it is that the House has not debated prisons since June of 1970 on the Prisons Bill, whereas there were full debates on the Garda Síochána and on the crime situation generally since then on the Garda Síochána Bill and on some other matters also.  As well as that, I do not deny that I am proud of the fact that a very great deal has been done in regard to our prisons over the past two years.  A great deal more could have been done if the prisons had not so quickly become so overcrowded. The work that is being done now, while we may not see the immediate benefit of it, will certainly provide a basis for successful rehabilitation when our prison population gets back to a more normal figure or, alternatively, if it does not get back to it, when a number of other prisons or similar institutions are opened to cater for increased numbers.</P>
    <P>So far as the increase in crime is concerned, it is worth bearing in mind that what we are experiencing here is part of a worldwide trend.  There seemed to be a suggestion from some Deputies opposite that something had gone wrong specifically in this country which caused an upsurge in crime. That, of course, is not so.  Indeed, on the contrary, although we do and must regard the crime situation here as serious and unsatisfactory, it is an awful lot less so than in most countries in the world and a very great deal less so than in many of them.  There is a wide variety of views even among experts as to what the reasons for this trend are and possibly the only point on which <Col N="220" /> there is agreement is that the increase is not due to any single cause.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the overall increase in indictable crime here is due to increases in a few particular types of crime&mdash;housebreaking, larcenies from unattended vehicles and other larcenies of property less than £50 in value.  On the other hand&mdash;and this is a strange matter which has come out of the statistics and I do not think enough emphasis has been placed on it&mdash; offences against the person have actually declined somewhat in recent years.  With all the violence portrayed all around us one might well have thought the opposite would be the case but, in fact, the Commissioner's report shows a slight falling-off, strangely enough, in crimes of violence against the person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The total number of crimes of violence against the person generally has decreased.  Armed robberies, of course, as we know, have increased.</P>
      <P>The general public could greatly help to fight crime by making things harder for the criminal.  Crimes against property are the most frequent ones and a greater degree of care on the part of property owners would, I have no doubt, be reflected in a smaller incidence of larcenies and housebreakings. For example, to leave property exposed to view in an unattended vehicle is to issue an open invitation to the sneak thief.  This is illustrated by the fact that 18 per cent of all the indictable offences in the year ended 30th September, 1970, were larcenies of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Pattison last night referred at some length to an incident in which he was involved in his capacity as a trade union official where there was a <Col N="221" /> private trade dispute in some factory in County Kilkenny.  He made a number of statements last night and I asked for a report on them.  Unfortunately, I have not got the report yet because the request was only transmitted to the Garda this morning.  Therefore, I cannot deal with his allegations in any detail because I do not know what the facts are.  He did say that he was stopped by the police on, I think, one, and possibly more than one, occasion and that he was asked where he was going or something of that kind.  I understand, and I speak only from my recollection of having replied to a Parliamentary question from him several months ago, that the Garda found it necessary to escort certain lorries from this factory in order to prevent a breach of the peace.  I want to make it very clear that the Garda do not take sides in a private dispute of this or, indeed, of any other kind and that the Garda are in no way involved in or concerned with trying to support the employer against some of his employees as was alleged last night by Deputy Pattison.  I regret that Deputy Pattison was stopped by the Garda or that they found it necessary to do it but I do not know what the circumstances of it were and I feel, with all due respect to Deputy Pattison, that, perhaps, there is more than one side to that particular story.  I want to make it very clear that the Garda are taking no sides in this dispute.  They do not want to have any hand, act or part in it and they are there simply to prevent a breach of the peace which apparently they are apprehensive might take place if they were not there.  If Deputy Pattison was stopped by them, as he stated, it was only in the course of their ordinary duties in connection with that matter.  There is no question of their stopping him because he is Deputy Pattison.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney referred to the need to extend legal aid to civil cases.  Of course, this is one of the suggestions that will always be made by those who do not really have to face up to the problem of securing a large slice of the taxpayers' money to pay for it and who do not have the problem of trying to establish priorities as between one <Col N="222" /> scheme of social welfare and another because, basically, civil legal aid is, in my view, a social welfare scheme.  It is a worthy one.  I do not deny that.  It is one that I hope to see here in this country in the not-too-distant future. But, I am also well aware that there are even more worthy social welfare schemes crying out for more money. The Government have taken the view that there are greater needs at the moment to which our limited resources must be diverted.</P>
    <P>I had discussions recently with the organisation called FLAC&mdash;Free Legal Aid Centres&mdash;which is an organisation composed mainly of law students in Dublin who are assisted by a number of qualified lawyers.  I think both solicitors and barristers.  This is a splendid organisation.  It has opened several offices in Dublin and has dealt with the problems of a great many people and has given them advice and that advice is given free of cost.</P>
    <P>Representatives of this organisation came to see me some time ago to tell me what they were doing and to ask for assistance.  I will be happy, as I told them at the time, to give them such assistance as I can.  I did make a room available for them in the Four Courts.  I understand that while a good deal of their work was there and many of their clients turned up there from time to time they did not have any office there and found it very difficult to operate.  I am hopeful that I will be able to give them a subvention towards their annual costs.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see this type of organisation in being but I am rather disappointed that this type of movement, which is so desirable and so necessary, came from law students rather than lawyers and I would hope that the Incorporated Law Society would help in a more active and more official way rather than just have a few individual solicitors helping out.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why I am in some difficulty in giving public money to this organisation is that, through no fault of their own, they are based almost entirely in Dublin.  If, as I suggested to them, they could extend their activities, somewhat at least, to provincial areas it would make it very <Col N="223" /> much easier for me to justify subventing them out of public moneys.  They are in the difficulty, of course, that because they are law students, the majority of them are based in Dublin and the only other places where there are law schools are Cork and Galway and the Galway law school is very small indeed.  Therefore, that is an additional reason why the Incorporated Law Society should officially give its blessing to this organisation and try to arrange, with its younger members at least, that this type of service would be available to people throughout the whole country.  If that situation were reached I would be very glad to recommend to the Minister for Finance that an annual subvention towards their expenses be paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made the suggestion that gardaí should visit schools and talk to children on various topics.  This is a very good idea and I propose to ask the Commissioner to consider asking the new Garda Public Relations Officer to undertake this work.  It would do a great deal to improve co-operation between the Garda and the public generally and, in particular, the youth of our country.  When one bears in mind that the problem of vandalism, which was referred to by several Deputies, is basically a problem caused by very young persons&mdash;the Garda tell me that most of the instances of vandalism are caused by children between the ages of 12 and 14&mdash;that makes the need for co-operation on a friendly basis between the Garda and young persons all the more vital.</P>
    <P>The suggestion was made before in this House, I think by Deputy Moore, that we should assign individual gardaí to particular youth centres or community centres.  I am very hopeful that when we get our increase in numbers by the end of this year or early next year we will be able to assign certain individual gardaí to the larger youth or community centres here in Dublin and in the larger areas and that their whole work would consist of assisting, co-operating with and advising young persons and others attached to these centres.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="224" /> I have always taken the view that vandalism, which is a very serious matter in our community at the moment, particularly in the cities, is not primarily a Garda responsibility. In view of the fact that the greater part of the damage is done by children of 12 to 14 years of age, I must insist that corrective action is not primarily a matter for the police but primarily a matter for the parents of these children. I am afraid that the lessening of parental supervision is, perhaps, the major contributing factor in the increase in vandalism and, to a lesser extent, in certain other types of crime and, in many cases, more serious types of crime.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful that co-operation between parents and teachers in the schools and between parents, teachers and gardaí in the community centres may do a great deal to reduce this problem but, of themselves, no matter how many of them there are, the Gardaí will not solve it.  It is primarily a parental responsibility.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pattison referred last night to references in my opening speech to the EEC.  When I spoke about continuing the work of examining the implications for my Department of entry to the EEC I was referring primarily to the task, which will continue long after entry, of examining in consultation with the existing and prospective new members various draft Conventions on legal matters which are not yet finalised even among the Six and not yet in force, and on the technical details of which there is, under the auspices of the EEC Commission in Brussels, a continuing dialogue between all the countries involved. Deputy Pattison sought to suggest that we are only now beginning in my Department to examine EEC matters and the implications of membership for us from a legal point of view.  That is very far from the truth. We have been looking at these for a considerable period and have done a great deal of work on them.  Specifically what I said yesterday is that we are continuing this necessary study.</P>
    <P>In his speech last night, Deputy Fitzpatrick made reference to the <Col N="225" /> vacancy in the office of Master of the High Court.  He seemed to fear that I might in some way be proposing to restrict the powers and the duties of the Master and he said, with a certain amount of horror in his voice, that I might be contemplating putting a civil servant into that job.  The fact of the matter is that Mr. Justice Walsh's Committee on Court Practice and Procedure has, in the last few weeks, submitted an interim report to me in which they recommended new powers for the Master.  These new powers are very extensive.  They are a considerable extension of what the Master has been doing in the last 30 or 40 years and I am keen to implement the Committee's recommendations in this respect.</P>

Up to now, frankly, the office of Master of the High Court was a sinecure of the type we tend to sneer about if we read about it having happened in the 18th century.  I am afraid we have had one or two of these in our time and the office of Master of the High Court is one of them.  He was paid almost the same salary, if my recollection serves me, as the Secretary of a Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the Secretaries of some Departments, I can safely say, would do more work in a fortnight than the Master of the High Court was called on to do in a year. However, to extend his powers as extensively as Mr. Justice Walsh's Committee recommend will entail legislation and I am having that legislation prepared in the Courts and Court Officers Bill which I will soon be introducing.  This matter is being added to it.  Even if it is introduced in the next two months, and I hope it will be, it is unlikely to be passed <Col N="226" /> before July or so.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation a deputy Master can be appointed for three months only in any one year.  I have appointed a deputy Master but his term of office will run out at about the end of this month and therefore I have introduced a Bill in the Seanad because I understood it would sit before this House, in which I was wrong&mdash;I should have done it the other way around.  I introduced there a short Bill of two lines repealing a subsection of the Court Officers Act, 1926.  The only effect of that repeal is to allow me to continue the deputy Master for more than three months. I have to do that because if I or the Government were to appoint somebody now to the office of Master of the High Court he could afterwards argue that he was appointed Master when his duties were X, Y and Z as set out under the 1926 Act and he could refuse to undertake the additional duties.  I cannot therefore appoint a Master until the main Bill has been passed and, in the meantime, I would hope that that short Bill will get a speedy passage.</P>

      <P>The duties of the Master of the High Court, on the passage of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, will be quite extensive. It will be a full time job.  It is envisaged that he will sit every day and the Committee have recommended that he will sit either at 10 or 10.30 a.m. to enable those who are engaged in courts sitting at 11 a.m. to transact business beforehand.  It is suggested that he will sit throughout the day for five days a week until 4 or 4.30 p.m. At present the duties of the Master of the High Court are so limited that he sits only three days a week during term and, on average, only about one hour on each of those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Tunney referred to the problem of wandering horses.  I agree they are a menace.  The Garda are doing all they can under the law to deal with them but, as Deputy Tunney said, there are many large open spaces <Col N="227" /> close to urban areas where free grazing is available and where the owners allow horses to graze.  It is not an easy problem to deal with but where the Garda find animals on the roads they have them impounded and the owners prosecuted.  Some weeks ago I gave details to Deputies Tunney and Byrne of the number of prosecutions in the Dublin area in the past year.  It was very substantial.</P>
    <P>I might mention in passing that existing legislation in connection with wandering animals, from the criminal point of view, is contained in the Road Traffic Acts and that, of course, would be a matter for the Minister for Local Government rather than me.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney made the point also that there are certain anomalies in relation to our law on animals on roads generally.  I refer now to the civil law on this where animals seem to be given a type of priority or immunity which is hardly justifiable in this day and age.  As Deputy Tunney pointed out, many serious accidents, including several fatal ones, have occurred directly as a result of the presence of animals on roads.  In those cases almost always there is no negligence on the part of the drivers of the vehicles that strike them.  The result is that if a passenger in the car is killed or injured, in effect there is nobody to recover damages from.  He cannot sue the owner or the driver of the car who is not negligent, and usually the owner of the horses makes sure he does not show up to claim them.  It is much more difficult to trace ownership of horses than of cattle, which nowadays can be traced through the ear-marks. I should like to see the law in relation to liability in this respect changed.  It is one of the things my Department's Law Reform Division are trying to get around to but they are seriously overburdened with work and simply have not the staff numbers to do all the types of reform which I personally should like to see them doing.</P>

In an agricultural country if a person sees an animal in the distance he should pass that animal in such a way that he will anticipate its sudden emergence on to the road.  The only way in which a motorist would be immune from negligence is if an animal suddenly jumped across a ditch or ran out of a by-road.</P>

He might be out of £10,000 for that length of time and all the interest he can claim on it is 4 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) (for the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to the implication in the Deputy's question, the average weekly number unemployed in March as measured by the live register was 1,360 less than the average weekly figure in February. Although the number unemployed on 30th March was approximately 460 less than on 3rd March, it is true there has been no decrease in numbers on the live register between 1st January and 30th March.  This is in accordance with the normal seasonal trend.  The number unemployed this year showed an increase between early January <Col N="230" /> and early February followed by a general decline between then and 30th March.</P>
      <P>The measures taken to stimulate the economy in October and the further action taken in January last had specific regard to the problem of unemployment and the indications are that they have helped to improve the underlying trend.</P>
      <P>The Government regard the level of unemployment as a matter of vital concern and are keeping the situation under continuous review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the considerable public confusion concerning the retail chemist arrangements under the Health Act, 1970 for assistance towards the cost of prescribed medical requisites for persons with limited eligibility; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that confusion exists about this scheme but am glad nevertheless of the opportunity to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>The scheme applies to the cost of prescribed medical requisites for persons, and their dependants, in the limited eligibility category&mdash;namely, persons who have not medical cards but who have incomes of under £1,600 per annum, or who are insured under the Social Welfare Acts or who are farmers with valuations of under £60.</P>
      <P>Where expenditure on medicines for the eligible person and his dependants exceeds £3 in the month he may recoup from the health board 50 per cent of that portion of the expenditure in excess of £3 and less than £5.  Where expenditure is £5 or more the rate of recoupment increases to 100 per cent for the amount over £5.  For example, if spending on prescribed medicines for an eligible family amounts to £8 in the month, £4 of it may be recouped from the health board.</P>
      <P>Persons wishing to avail of the scheme may obtain the necessary application forms and explanatory material at any retail pharmacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme has been introduced in <Col N="232" /> the Eastern Health Board area and will be extended to the rest of the country on 1st October next.  In the meantime persons outside the eastern area for whom it is a hardship to meet the cost of medicines may apply to their health board under the existing hardship arrangements for assistance towards the cost.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the current arrangements are not only confusing but appallingly ineffective in operation?  Further, would the Minister not agree that under the new arrangements persons of limited eligibility must go to a retail chemist, produce their prescription, assume they are eligible for repayment of the amount they must pay the chemist, they must sign his docket, must pay for the prescription and then submit the application to the Eastern Health Board in the hope that they will get a refund?  Surely the Minister would agree that it is quite impossible for a person of limited eligibility to go through this appallingly cumbersome procedure with the retail chemist?

      <P>asked the Minister for Health the amount of the reduction in the 1972-73 Eastern Health Board estimate requested by his Department; the reasons for this decision; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of the Eastern Health Board for the year 1972-73 as submitted to my Department showed an increase of £4,422,000 over the corresponding estimates for the year 1971-72, and an increase of £3,243,000 over the most recently ascertained expenditure figure for that year.  The estimate was examined in my Department and was discussed in detail with officers of the board on a number of occasions.  A number of items which showed increases over the preceding year which could not be substantiated were adjusted while additions were made for increases in costs not provided for in the original estimate. The additions include a sum for increases in the capitation rates payable for patients treated in voluntary hospitals which the board were not in a position to provide for when the estimate was prepared, but, disregarding that item, the net result was a reduction of about £900,000 which represents less than 4 per cent on the board's original estimate of over £25 million.</P>
      <P>The reductions to which I have referred were made only where the projected expenditure could not be reconciled with the requirements of the services, including planned developments, and there is no question of limitation of the services to be provided by the board.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not accept that it is quite an extraordinary state of affairs that a projected expenditure for 12 months hence only by the Eastern Health Board to the tune of £900,000 could not be substantiated, if I may quote the Minister's words, and that a further sum of £1.1 million could not be reconciled?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have negotiations with a number of health boards on their estimates in relation to the services.  We think, for example, that they over-estimated the extra amount required to provide the choice-of-doctor scheme.  We based our costs on very careful estimates, based on research done by the Royal General College of Practitioners in areas where there is a choice of doctor, the number of services per patient, <i>et cetera</i>.  We think there was a mistake in that.  That accounted for £510,000. We think that the rate of increase in the number of persons receiving disablement allowances was placed at an excessive figure by the Eastern Health Board and so we reduced it.  The only actual item where one might say that the progress in new services was limited was in the case of the St. James Hospital and the James Connolly Memorial Hospital where we allowed for 270 extra staff instead of 398 as suggested, showing quite clearly that progress could be made in the development of those two institutions but on a slightly more limited basis.  All the rest were normal differences of opinion that occur from time to time between health authorities, now the health boards, and the Department as to what the general cost of the medical services would be.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputies to my press release of the 10th April in this matter, copies of which are available in the Library.</P>
      <P>Both the US and European Governments have become increasingly concerned with the operation of illegal charter traffic on the North Atlantic which poses a growing threat to the airlines who operate regular year-round scheduled services.  Both US and European regulations require that charter flights be confined to genuine affinity groups having a principal purpose other than travel and to persons who have been members of such groups for at least six months.  We are parties to a general agreement to this effect between European aeronautical administrations.</P>
      <P>It is my policy to authorise <i>bona fide</i> affinity charter flights to and from the US which are on routes not served by the scheduled airlines including Aerlínte or on such routes where the scheduled airlines cannot provide the necessary capacity.  I am satisfied that the scheduled airlines can provide adequate capacity for all <i>bona fide</i> traffic offering in the present year from New York to Shannon.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the traffic for which application has been made in this case is either <i>bona fide</i> affinity charter traffic or traffic surplus to what the scheduled airlines can provide charter capacity for.  The airline in question has already been refused permission for flights by the UK authorities on grounds of irregularities; their operations in the US have been made subject to strict conditions and it is not clear in fact that the flights in question will be authorised by the US authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of a number of the groups for which application has been made, permission for charter flights to <Col N="239" /> Britain has already been refused by the British authorities.  In the light of all the information available to me it appears that these operations providing for flights from US to Shannon and onward to other destinations are designed to circumvent the regulatory provisions of other European countries to whom we have a reciprocal commitment to apply the same general regulations.  It is far from self-evident that charter passengers booked on cut-price flights to European destinations would be wiling or able to spend any significant period in Ireland.</P>
    <P>To permit such flights freely would undermine scheduled operations on the Atlantic generally, would directly damage Aerlínte and would be contrary to our commitments to other European Governments</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, I do not propose to authorise any of these flights unless it can be shown that they are bona fide affinity charter traffic not catered for by the scheduled operators and committed to stay for significant periods in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dunne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare what improvements he intends introducing to the home assistance service particularly relating to financing, staffing and administration; and what steps will be taken to ascertain the views of the health boards and county councils which at present administer the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the House when introducing my Department's Estimate in November last, our assistance services, including home assistance are being subjected to a wide-ranging review with the object of framing a new comprehensive code of social assistance.  I also informed the House on that occasion that this would probably involve a radical restructuring of the various assistance schemes, entailing a redesigning of the present scales of payment so as to reflect more accurately the different requirements of various categories of recipients.  With a view to achieving <Col N="240" /> a proper overall development of the state income maintenance services I am envisaging substantial reform and integration of the existing home assistance scheme with these services.</P>
      <P>I believe that administration of this important residual service by a multiplicity of local authorities cannot be justified in the context of a properly-oriented social welfare code, and I contemplate that improved but flexible national standards will be laid down instead of the arbitrary payments now allowed which, being met from local rates, must depend on the availability of local resources and therefore vary considerably from one area to another.  The scheme I have in mind should, I believe, operate as a local service and may, perhaps, be integrated with a reorganised unemployment assistance scheme into one locally administered social assistance service.  I should mention that I outlined my intentions regarding the home assistance service in lengthy discussion on two occasions last year with representatives of the superintendent assistance officers and assistance officers, and the results of a detailed survey of the working of the present service which my Department carried out in collaboration with the public assistance authorities as part of the reform programme were examined in joint meetings arranged during those discussions between representatives of these officers and officers of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I stated in reply to a question on 8th March, I hope to be in a position to submit my firm proposals for restructuring of the assistance services, including home assistance, to the Government at an early date.  The Deputy will appreciate that until the Government have approved the general lines of my reform programme, it is not possible to formulate detailed proposals regarding the staffing and administration of the new local social assistance service which I have in mind.  In this connection, I might mention, however, that it would be my intention, as I have already indicated, <i>inter alia,</i> to the officers' representatives in the discussions referred to, that where any additional staff is required <Col N="241" /> for that service, they will be obtained as far as possible from the officers at present administering home assistance.</P>
    <P>In addition to the views which have been already conveyed by the representatives of the superintendent assistance officers and the assistance officers during their meetings with me I will, of course, at the appropriate time, take into account the views of all other interested parties which may relate to my proposals.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware of the hardship caused to home assistance recipients who have to travel long distances to the meeting place or the depot where the home assistance officer hands out the money?  Could he not arrange for those who are receiving money over long periods to have the money posted to them or left at the local post office where they could collect it when shopping?  Great hardship is caused at present when they have to attend at a particular hour on a particular day.  Many of them have to travel long journeys and have to walk.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of contributions paid <Col N="242" /> by the applicant since he entered insurance in January, 1924, is 1,203, but 1,049 of these were paid under the former National Health Insurance Acts.  In the case in question there were only 282 contributions reckonable for old age contributory pension purposes as the relevant contribution period was from July, 1950, to December, 1969.</P>

      <P>The fund has been reorganised and the intention of the Commission of the EEC is to have the reorganised fund in operation by the 1st May next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is up to each country to make its own applications for assistance from <Col N="244" /> the fund.  The fund is, of course, a continuing institution and applications are made according as schemes or projects which are eligible for assistance from it arise.</P>
    <P>Ireland will be eligible to benefit from the fund as from the date of accession.

      <P>As regards offices, provisions as to means of escape in case of fire are contained in section 18 of the Office Premises Act, 1958.

There are supporting provisions in section 17 of the Act which deal with the sound construction and maintenance of floors, steps, stairs, lifts, passages and gangways. The relevant provisions and their enforcement are kept under review as part of my Department's work and whenever changes are called for, the necessary action is taken.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</b> asked the Minister for Finance why the £45 million livestock development project for which a loan is being sought from the World Bank is confined to cattle and pig production and does not include sheep production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed livestock development project for which World Bank assistance is being sought emerged after consultations with the bank.  Because the finance available from the bank will be limited, the project is being confined to cattle and pig production.  These are the sectors in which there is the greatest demand for capital.</P>
      <P>There is no question, however, that the exclusion of sheep implies any diminution in resources for sheep development.  Adequate finance will be available through the ACC and other channels for all worthwhile development in this sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the report on State expenditure in relation to agriculture demonstrated that one of the greatest reasons for the decline in sheep numbers was that, relatively speaking, much less State aid was given to sheep production than to other lines of agricultural production and that this existing situation will now be aggravated <Col N="250" /> further by the fact that sheep are being excluded from this project?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree at all.  The fact that money may be obtained on foot of this project from the World Bank does not mean that money will not be available for sheep.</P>

      <P>The cost to date of the inquiry by the Public Accounts Committee into the expenditure of the Grant-in-Aid for Northern Ireland Relief is £17,250.</P>
      <P>Three members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas are engaged full-time on this work.  Various other members of the Oireachtas staff have given services to the committee as part of their normal duties.  In addition, the services of outside personnel have been engaged for reporting and sub-editing work as required.  The cost of the latter has been included in the figure I have given.</P>
      <P>I cannot answer (3) of Deputy Blaney's question as it is a matter solely for the committee to decide what further time and staff they may need to complete their task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the State, through the Department of Finance, have provided the staff and the cost of staff to the committee, surely it would be the normal procedure that if staff are to be provided and costs incurred during the coming financial year, the Department would have to have some guideline from the committee as to their likely needs.  In other words, how many staff will be required and for how long?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

I would have expected that in this situation there would have been such a request.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, on the assumption that Ireland becomes a member of the European Economic Communities, he will state the net savings to the Exchequer in 1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75; the various headings under which these savings will accrue; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the White Paper entitled &ldquo;The Accession of Ireland to the European Communities&rdquo; which was laid before each House of the Oireachtas in January this year.  The overall implications for the Exchequer of accession to the Communities are dealt with in paragraphs 44 to 47 of Chapter 5 which also indicates the various headings under which savings to the Exchequer will accrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the estimate of an annual net saving to the Exchequer of the order of £25 million to £30 million which is given in paragraph 46 of Chapter 5 of the White Paper, I should like to point out that this estimate was based, <i>inter alia,</i> on the then current annual estimate of the cost of agricultural export subsidies.  Since the White Paper was published a revised estimate has been prepared based on present prospects for agricultural export prices in 1972-73.  On this basis it is now estimated that the net annual saving to the Exchequer would be about £5 million less&mdash;say, of the <Col N="254" /> order of £20 million to £25 million&mdash; if present prices on the export markets are maintained.</P>
    <P>Exchequer savings arising from membership of the European Communities will be available to finance economic development and improvements in the social services.  Increases in social welfare payments to compensate the less well-off section for any increases in food prices arising from membership will clearly be a priority claim on such savings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will make a comprehensive statement on the recent EEC monetary agreement; and if he will state its implications for Ireland upon accession to the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to somewhat similar questions on 16th March last, the monetary arrangements to which he refers are an early stage in the EEC programme of action for the development of an economic and monetary union.  This programme and its implications are summarised in the White Paper on the Accession of Ireland to the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent agreement covers specifically two aspects apart from matters of a technical nature.  The first relates <Col N="255" /> to the narrowing of exchange rate margins in currency dealings between the member countries.  It has been agreed that the dealing margin in transactions between any two of the Community currencies, will not exceed 2¼ per cent at any one time, that is, broadly speaking 2¼ per cent above or below the relevant parities of the currencies in question.  This is a first step towards stabilising the exchange rates as envisaged in the programme for monetary union.</P>
    <P>From the monetary viewpoint the agreement has no significant implication in relation to our currency.  The Irish pound will be maintained at its present fixed parity with the pound sterling and the question of margins in that respect does not arise.  However, stability of the EEC currencies is desirable and, indeed, necessary for the orderly and efficient functioning of the Common Market, particularly the common agricultural policy.  The latter has, of course, a special interest for this country and the agreement reached on the narrowing of currency margins is to be welcomed as helping to smooth the operation of that policy.</P>
    <P>The second matter covered by the agreement relates to the control of undesirable international capital flows. Agreement has been reached on measures for the introduction and coordination of capital controls necessary to prevent or neutralise capital flows damaging to the economies of the member states.  So far as this country is concerned, we already exercise exchange control in relation to capital transactions with countries outside the sterling area and no difficulty is anticipated in complying with EEC requirements in due course.  The objective in view, as in the case of the narrowing of currency margins, is the stability of exchange rates and it is in our interest to co-operate in achieving this objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in the circumstances of our application to join the EEC any agreements, no matter under what heading, whether monetary, agricultural or otherwise, should be explained <Col N="256" /> in a memorandum sent to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas indicating the details of any such agreements?  Such information would be of vital importance and of substantial help to Members of the Houses instead of having to read of such agreements in the papers, or get information from second or third hand sources.</P>

      <P>The matter is a little bit more complex than that.  I met a deputation recently representing these people.  They wish to be included in the contributory scheme as contributors. The contributory scheme is the result of lengthy negotiations and represents an agreement between the various staff associations on one side and the Government on the other.  No substantial change can be made in that agreement without the consent of all parties.  It is not entirely a matter for me, whether I am sympathetic or not. This has been explained to the people concerned.  I understand they are making approaches to the association concerned so that the matter can be dealt with in the context of the agreement, and any necessary amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware of a recent decision by the Associated Banks to raise bank charges for certain services to customers including the drawing of cheques and lodgments and the serious increases in costs which will result for private persons, farmers, business, trade and industry; if he was consulted beforehand about this action; and what action he proposed to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a revised system of charges for current accounts has been introduced by the Associated Banks with effect from 1st April.  The proposals were cleared with the Central Bank before being announced and I understand that they take full account of the Bank's views. While I was not consulted directly, I was kept fully informed of developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first increase in charges since 1964 and I am satisfied that they are generally reasonable in scope.  I do not agree that they will result in serious increases in costs for bank customers. The Central Bank in considering the matter had particular regard to the implications for bank <Col N="258" /> customers and for the economy as a whole.  Provision has been made to limit the charge to £1 per half-year in the case of accounts with less than 50 transactions during that period.  It is also proposed to make an allowance for credit balances where an account is continually in credit to the extent of at least £100.  These proposals should moderate substantially the impact of the new system on the majority of customers, particularly private individuals, farmers and small businesses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for transactions in excess of 50 up to 3,000 the extra charge is 50p for each ten transactions or portion thereof, including the first 50 transactions? That is to say, that 51 to 60 transactions would bear a charge of £3, £1 for the 50, while the total charge would amount to £3.  In fact, in certain cases the increase amounts to 200 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think one may, in cases like this, pick out particular cases where increases may seem to be very substantial, but taking the system as a whole and the bank customers as a whole and, in particular, people with small accounts and small numbers of transactions, the two factors in the arrangements which I have mentioned, namely, the charge of £1 for up to 50 transactions and the allowance where there is at least £100 in credit continually, operate to reduce the impact. As far as the bulk of customers are concerned I am satisfied, on the advice available to me, and the views of the Central Bank, that the changes are not unreasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the amount of £100 in credit is nowadays a very small figure for, say, small businesses or even private transactions?  This decision only leaked out and has not been notified to customers.  Does it not seem strange that a decision of this character has been reached without official notification to customers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess I was not aware that this had not been communicated to customers.  If what <Col N="259" /> the Deputy says is correct, I think it is a little odd on the face of it.  I agree with what the Deputy says, that £100 at the moment is a relatively small amount for businesses and so on, but it is for that reason that I think it will benefit, because it is where there is £100 credit as a minimum continually that people will get the benefit of this arrangement.</P>

    <P>1.  Net produce of income tax is the estimated ultimate yield from the tax assessed in a given year, whether actually collected in that year or later, after deducting all discharges, remissions and setting off all repayments.</P>
    <P>2.  Figures for net produce of income tax under Schedule E are not available for any year subsequent to 1962-63 in consequence of the introduction of the system of &ldquo;one taxpayer, one charge&rdquo; in 1963-64.  The figures in the table for 1967-68 and subsequent years show the Schedule E tax payable and not the net produce of income tax under that Schedule for those years.</P>
    <P>3.  The net produce figure for 1960-61 excludes an amount estimated at £4,150,000 in respect of the abatement provided for by section 14 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1959, in respect of emoluments coming within PAYE.</P>

      <P>In the interest of clarity and to obviate any possible misunderstanding, I must point out that the figure of £600,000 quoted in my reply to a question on March 14th was not represented as the amount of commercial rents payable annually; it was the amount of such rents actually paid in the year 1971.

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education what minimum range of subjects he requires to be provided at a senior cycle level in order to justify the continuance of the senior cycle in a rural school.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if his attention has been drawn to a statement at the recent ASTI Convention that thirteen school managers were informed by his Department that recognition of the senior cycle leaving certificate classes would be withdrawn from September, 1972, and that this time limit has been extended to September, 1975; if he will list the schools concerned; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 56 and 65 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are in all 34 subjects on the leaving certificate course.  Ideally and so as to give pupils the maximum choice a school should cater for the vast majority of these subjects.  I would consider that the curriculum of a post-primary school, in order that it might be classed as being reasonably broad and sufficient to provide a fair range of options, should cater at higher and lower levels for at least four subjects from the language group, mathematics, two subjects from the science group, two subjects from the applied science group, two subjects from the social studies group and on one subject from the business studies group.  The school would of course in addition <Col N="277" /> need to provide for religious education and physical education.  This, I feel, is the type of curriculum which would be necessary to cater for the aptitudes and ability of all the pupils. It could be achieved only in a school which was sufficiently large in size to warrant the number and quality of teachers which would be required.  This would normally entail an enrolment of at least 50 to 60 pupils in each year of the leaving certificate course.  There will no doubt be cases where the areas concerned are so located or there are other circumstances which will prevent us from providing the type of leaving certificate course which we would consider to be reasonably adequate.</P>
    <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I propose to circulate with the Official Report a list of the 14 schools to which the notice referred to by Deputy Desmond was sent.  The extension in time was granted in order to enable pupils who had already entered these schools to complete their leaving certificate course in them. I might add that the schools in question had on average 12 pupils following each year of the leaving certificate course.</P>
    <P>Following is the list referred to:</P>
    <P>List of Schools which have been notified that their Senior Cycle Classes will not be recognised beyond 1975.</P>
    <P>Meán-Scoil Mhuire, Ballisodare, Co. Sligo; Meán-Scoil an Leith-Triuigh, Cloghane, Co. Kerry; Clochar na Toirbhirte, Lixnaw, Co. Kerry; Scoil Sheosaimh, Clochar na Trócaire, Kilkee, Co.

      <P>Would the Minister consider that the repetition of the phrase in Questions Nos. 55 and 56 &ldquo;in a rural school&rdquo; would appear to indicate that the questioner would settle for less expertise in teaching and a more restricted range of subjects in a rural school and would the Minister indicate whether his thinking on the matter would coincide with this expression of Fine Gael policy?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that his announcement concerning this phasing out of schools he considers not large enough to carry on to leaving certificate standard has caused serious concern in certain areas because in some of these cases he has refused the Brothers permission to extend and in other cases he has not even given a decision to the nuns.  The Brothers are threatening to pull out and there is chaos because of this statement.  I think the Minister would need to look very seriously at this to allay the concern of the parents of children all over the Dublin region at present, as I know it, because of the uncertainty and the fact that they do not know where they are going in the years ahead?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that there is either chaos or uncertainty.  I <Col N="279" /> have repeated on many occasions what my objective is in relation to the provision of equality of educational opportunity for all our children.  I have dealt with this fully in my reply to the Estimate and I have also replied to it in answer to the questions which were put to me here today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea that you cannot have a good secondary school unless you have 50 pupils in fifth year and 50 in sixth year is just absolute lunacy.  There are large areas of the country where this is not possible.  This whole centralisation of education is the craziest idea that was ever produced in this country.  Would the Minister not agree that the bulk of the people who have been doing it are people who have never taught in a secondary school in their lives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree at all with the Deputy.  The objective here is to ensure that we will have as wide a range of subjects as possible available to our young people, irrespective of their location, irrespective of their social background.  As I said before on very many occasions in this House, it is my objective to ensure that all our children will have, in so far as it is possible for me to provide it, equality of educational opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I am asking a question, a Leas-Cheann <Col N="280" /> Comhairle.  What has happened in the Department of Education that they got sold on this crazy notion that you must have large schools and you must have pupils taken 20 miles by bus to go to them in parts of the country, that otherwise they will not be able to get a secondary education at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why are the Department doing this?  Deputy Clinton talked about the Brothers and nuns. There are certain lay secondary schools in rural Ireland where people, very often a man and his wife, put together an excellent secondary school and now they are being wiped out by dictators in the Department of Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is suggesting is that it is quite satisfactory if we provide a narrow range of subjects&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;irrespective of whether it suits a very considerable proportion of the children attending that school or not.  My view is that every child has an aptitude or an ability for something and, therefore, we have got to endeavour, in so far as it is possible, to make available to that child the subjects which will enable him to develop his aptitude and his ability.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It most certainly is not economics.  It is basically educational. Of course, quite naturally we have to consider economics also.  There is no country in the world at present capable of providing sufficient money for educational purposes and we have got to make the best use we can of our financial resources.  I want to underline and emphasise that primarily this is educational.</P>

      <P>Vocational education committees are empowered to purchase or lease land for the provision of playing grounds at vocational schools.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the case of Belturbet and Bawnboy would have involved the giving of grants to bodies which had no legal standing as far as the County Cavan Vocational Education Committee was concerned.

      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Is the Minister aware that in so far as Belturbet vocational school is concerned the proposal was to enter into an arrangement with a voluntary body who had land immediately beside the school whereby for a small sum of money the students attending the vocational school would have the use of the playground under an agreement, if necessary?  Surely the Minister would consider that a satisfactory arrangement?  In the case of Bawnboy the committee actually owned the land in respect of which they proposed to enter into an arrangement with another voluntary body.  Surely the Minister would agree that such arrangements as were proposed in Belturbet and Bawnboy are in the interests, first of all, of the vocational school students but secondly, and equally if not more important, that they are in the interests of the local community and should be encouraged?</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of statements made at the recent INTO congress regarding surveys carried out on the class-size position in certain areas of Dublin city and county and Cork city.  As the surveys were not submitted to me I have no detailed knowledge of their breadth and depth.  I gave the Deputy information in a reply on the 9th February last in relation to the position in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The measures being taken by me to alleviate the position where large classes exist are:</P>
      <P>(1) At the present time we are providing annually about 220 teachers more than the number required to meet normal replacements.</P>
      <P>(2) The country-wide teacher-pupil ratio is 1:32.  The policy of amalgamating small schools will, over a period, help to ensure a proper deployment of the teaching force and the teachers' work load will be more evenly spread.</P>
      <P>(3) Many large classes result from incorrect school organisation.  These cases are being identified and appropriate action taken.</P>
      <P>(4) While there has been little increase in the number of pupils attending national schools in the past ten years the number of teachers has increased by over 1,000.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that by the implementation of these policies the problem of large classes will be very much reduced by 1973.</P>

I would remind the Deputy that traffic congestion applies throughout the city. On the other hand, groups like supermarkets are buying through their own sources and this tends somewhat to reduce congestion within the market. I know arrangements in the market have given cause for complaint from time to time.  As far as I know no major group has made any particular complaint about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there has been a drop in the number of small farmers who are keeping breeding mares and that the best way to encourage them is with a little financial incentive?  Would he not consider, from that point of view, increasing the value of the nominations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

I would <Col N="302" /> have thought that the contrary was the case.  It probably varies a bit, depending on the part of the country we are talking about.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Some mares sired by thoroughbreds are entered in the Register of Irish Draught Mares.  The ancestry of the animal is not regarded as of major importance.  Selection is based mainly on soundness and conformation assessed by inspection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the Irish draught mare was typically an animal who was not got by a thoroughbred horse?  If the Minister is now going to register mares got by thoroughbred horses as draught mares he will eventually attenuate the breed of draught horses altogether so that there will be no foundation stock to breed the typical Irish hunter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This question is very difficult to deal with by means of question and answer at Question Time because I have heard experts in this field wrangling for hours about it. The Deputy will appreciate that the expression &ldquo;Irish draught&rdquo; refers rather to a type than an actual breed of horse.  I do not think people will assert seriously that an Irish draught horse is a breed of horse.  It is rather a type of horse from which sporting horses can be bred.  It is from these that the stock is drawn and registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree with me that the type of Irish draught was never got by a thoroughbred sire, that this is the very opposite to the traditional way in which this breed or type has been produced in this country?  If the Minister introduces a policy whereby mares got by thoroughbred horses will be registered as Irish draughts, eventually <Col N="303" /> the type of Irish draught we have known for so long will disappear.  If you keep breeding with a thoroughbred sire you will eventually breed out and you will breed in to a totally thoroughbred stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>A great many factors come into this.  The most important one of all is the drying up of the number of draught horses of any type that are available in the country. Secondly, when you are aiming at the selection of a type of horse, which was never actually bred according to blood lines, it is not possible to be definite as to the type of ancestry you require in this horse.  You are looking for certain physical qualities of soundness, conformation and stamina, qualities which are recognised as being peculiar to the Irish draught horse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The general safeguard provision to which the Deputy refers is contained in Article 135 of the Treaty of Accession.  The text of this Article is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>1.  If, before 31 December 1977, difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in any sector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a given area, a new member state may apply for authorisation to take protective measures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sector concerned <Col N="304" /> to the economy of the common market.</P>
    <P>2.  On application by the state concerned, the Commission shall, by emergency procedure, determine without delay the protective measures which it considers necessary, specifying the circumstances and the manner in which they are to be put into effect.</P>
    <P>3.  The measures authorised under paragraph 2 may involve derogations from the rules of the EEC Treaty and of this Act to such an extent and for such periods as are strictly necessary in order to attain the objectives referred to in paragraph I. Priority shall be given to such measures as will least disturb the functioning of the common market.</P>
    <P>4.  In the same circumstances and according to the same procedure, any original member state may apply for authorisation to take protective measures in regard to one or more new member states.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will note that the terms of this article are extremely wide and that the approved measures may involve derogations from the rules of the Rome Treaty and of the Treaty of Accession.</P>
    <P>The present member states, during their transitional period, enjoyed a general safeguard provision on the same lines.  The action which they were able to take by invoking this provision included the imposition of quantitative import restrictions, the imposition of protective duties and the deferment of tariff reductions.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The object of the Convention on the Mutual Recognition of Companies and Bodies Corporate is to provide that companies and other bodies corporate which are established under the laws of a member state of the EEC will be recognised in the other member states and will enjoy in those other states the same rights and obligations to conclude contracts, to hold property and to have access to the courts, as they enjoy in their home state.</P>
      <P>A member state is free to refuse to apply the Convention to a body which, although established under the laws of another member state, has its headquarters outside the territory covered by the Convention and which has no real economic links with the Community. Such a refusal is not binding on the other member states.  The Convention does not prohibit a member state from recognising, if it so wishes, companies or other bodies established in countries outside the Community.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if the various trading, manufacturing, construction and employer and trade union organisations in the Republic have been informed that at the end of 1974, in the event of entry to the EEC, preference may no longer be given to Irish goods in public contracts; and if such firms have also been advised that grant conditions concerning the use of Irish materials must be abolished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangements for the elimination of measures having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions, which are prohibited within the European Economic Community, have been published in the White Paper of January this year on the accession of Ireland to the European Communities.  The statement in the White Paper at paragraph 55, page 93, is as follows:</P>
      <P>The only measures of this kind applied by us are the preferences given to Irish goods in public contracts and the condition that in order to qualify for certain grants, mainly housing and farm improvements, Irish materials must be used. It was agreed that we could retain these measures up to the end of 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may add that, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, such preferences for Irish goods are required to be eliminated by 1975, in so far as British <Col N="307" /> goods are concerned, under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, and it is probable that Britain would be more of a source of competition than the other EEC countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that these kinds of preferences for home-produced articles exist in every country in the world, and nowhere more strongly than in the United States?  Why have we given away something that allows for special arrangements of a preferential rate of a certain percentage?  Why was this given away during the negotiations on the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement, and why has it apparently been given away in our negotiations for entry into the EEC?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell the Deputy that our application is not for entry into the United States&mdash;it is for entry into the EEC.  The Deputy was quoting a regulation with regard to qualification for entry into the United States as the 51st State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was stating was the position that exists in a country which believes, more than any other, in free competition.  That was the reason for my reference to the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Technically, we have not given away anything.  Agreement has been reached to retain the measures until the end of 1974, whereas with regard to what might be our largest competitor we had come to an arrangement whereby the measures would go by 1st July, 1975.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that this is a real sell-out of the utmost importance?  As far as I recollect, the normal preference is 15 per cent; if an Irish tender for a contract is within 15 per cent of a competing tender from any other country the Irish firm gets the contract.  The Minister now tells us that under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement we will have sold out this concession completely in 1975.  The year 1975 is tomorrow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question relates to royalty payments in respect of the working of State-owned base metals.</P>
      <P>Royalties payable in respect of State minerals in existing base metal mines are governed by the terms of leases already entered into with the operating companies and such leases do not provide for the variation of the royalty rate during the term of the leases.</P>
      <P>In the case of any base metal mines which might be established in the future, the Deputy will appreciate that, on the assumption that the same system of royalty payments is adopted, payments would depend on the level of profits and on the intermediate as well as the maximum royalty rates chargeable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The decision whether to treat a drug abuser within Mountjoy or St. Patrick's, as the case may be, or in an outside institution is taken by the medical officer in consultation with the medical authorities of the institution concerned.</P>
      <P>The number under treatment in Mountjoy at present is four with an additional one on temporary release in the Dundrum unit.  Five are under treatment at St. Patrick's, two of whom are being assessed for possible treatment at Dundrum.</P>
      <P>While it is impossible, without the imposition of unduly severe custodial arrangements&mdash;arrangements so severe that they would be regarded by most people as quite unacceptable&mdash;to eliminate entirely the possibility of drug smuggling into Mountjoy and St. Patrick's, the authorities are specially alert in this regard.  They are satisfied that it is not a problem in either institution and that there could be no possible basis for any suggestion that the inmates have easy or regular access to drugs.  I should like to make two points.  First, I am satisfied that the prison authorities were in no way remiss in arranging for the transfer of the youth mentioned in the newspaper report concerned to the Dundrum Unit after the cases against him had been disposed of by the courts. Secondly, while having the greatest sympathy with people who find themselves in difficulties with drugs, and more so with their parents, I do not think it is in anybody's interests to suggest that these difficulties are attributable to neglect or indifference on the part of the prison authorities.</P>

      <P>The appointment of a Master of the High Court is a matter for the Government, who have decided not to fill the present vacancy pending consideration by them of recommendations made to me by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in their sixteenth interim report in regard to the jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court.  I have made copies of the report available in the Library.</P>
      <P>With a view to making the fullest possible use of the Office of Master of the High Court in the judicial sphere, the committee recommend a substantial increase in the present jurisdiction of the Master.  Moreover, they consider it essential that the jurisdiction of the Master be conferred by statute.  A general scheme for a comprehensive Courts and Court Officers Bill to implement the recommendations of the committee is now being discussed with the various interests concerned.  I hope to have the matter considered by the Government at an early date.</P>
      <P>The Government are satisfied that an appointment to the present vacancy should not be made in advance of legislation spelling out the new duties of the Master of the High Court.  In the meantime, the present duties of the Master are being discharged by a Deputy Master appointed by me under section 27 of the Court Officers Act, 1926.  As Deputies will be aware, a short Court Officers Bill is now awaiting Second Stage in the Seanad.

      <P>Certain incidents in the area of Gormanston cross roads about 600 yards from the military camp between 11 p.m. and midnight on 7th April, 1972, gave rise to a suspicion that the telephone lines might have been interfered with and the Garda, to whom the matter was reported by the camp authorities, notified the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with a view to their having a check carried out on the lines.</P>
      <P>When an official of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs telephoned the camp requesting information in the matter he was informed by a military officer that the telephone lines within the camp were working satisfactorily but that there was some reason to suspect that the telephone lines on the main Dublin to Belfast Road had been tampered with.  The official indicated that he would send someone out immediately.  It would appear that while the official intended that he would send someone to Gormanston Camp, the army officer understood that he would send someone to inspect the telephone lines on the main road. Accordingly, the officer did not expect that an official of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs would come to the camp and did not advise the main gate to expect such an official.</P>
      <P>At 12.15 a.m. the military policeman at the main gate handed over duties to the camp orderly sergeant.  At about 1.45 a.m. a van approached the gate. The driver got out of the van, leaving its engine running and lights on, and went towards the gate.  The man indicated that he was from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and that he had come to check a line.  The camp orderly sergeant told him to switch off.  The driver switched off the engine of the van but not the lights. The camp orderly sergeant asked him to identify himself.  The man did not produce any identity card but asked to see the orderly officer at the camp. This request was refused.</P>
      <P>The camp orderly sergeant became extremely suspicious because&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="319" /> (1) He knew the repairmen of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who normally visited the camp and the driver of the van was a stranger to him;</P>
    <P>(2) He knew that there was no fault on the telephone lines in the camp since only a short time earlier he had been in touch by telephone with a Dublin Barracks; and</P>
    <P>(3) The driver of the van had produced no identification.</P>
    <P>At this time the driver was, in accordance with normal practice, covered by the weapons of the guard. Words were, apparently, exchanged between the camp orderly sergeant and the driver and at one stage the sergeant, being apprehensive of the driver's intentions, threatened to fire. The driver entered the van quickly, saying that he would report that he had not been admitted to the camp, and made a few rapid locks to turn the van.  The orderly sergeant fired at its left rear wheel.  The van was struck but the driver succeeded in driving it away.</P>
    <P>The occurrence was immediately reported to the Garda Síochána at Drogheda and Balbriggan and the Garda later reported that the driver of the van was, in fact, an official of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>In order to appreciate the circumstances of the incident it should be borne in mind that the linesman sent to examine the equipment did not know the precise location of the equipment which it was reported was being interfered with.  Since the report about interference had originated at Gormanston Camp he called there to establish the exact location. The linesman knew that the technician in the exchange who had asked him to go to Gormanston had been in contact with Gormanston Camp and had said that somebody would be going out to attend to the matter, so he thought the sentries would know he was coming.  In the event, the sentries had been changed in the interval since the exchange technician had been in contact with the camp, and the sentries on duty were unaware <Col N="320" /> of the earlier reports that had been made.</P>
    <P>The Post Office responded promptly to the request, received late at night, that a technician should be sent to examine the lines.  I am very conscious of the good relations which exist between the military authorities and officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I regret that through unfortunate misunderstandings this incident should have occurred.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that, in present circumstances, military guards, sentries and security parties are, and must continue to be, very much on the alert. The Army and Post Office authorities are reviewing jointly the procedures at present in operation for dealing with such calls to avoid any repetition of incidents of the kind that occurred last week.</P>

      <P>As already indicated in reply to previous questions on this subject, the figures given in the Preliminary Report on the 1971 Census of Population are provisional figures subject to revision and are not to be regarded as having statutory force. Moreover, the Preliminary Report does not contain the population figures for constituencies or for the smaller areas &mdash;district electoral divisions and wards&mdash;which are used to build up constituencies.  A decision on the revision of constituencies cannot, therefore, be taken until Volume I of the Census Report, which will contain the necessary information, is published later this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the growing public concern at the inadequacy of the fire brigade services in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire; and what action it is proposed to take to provide more up-to-date fire fighting equipment and to increase the number of personnel in order to allay public anxiety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware.  Under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, it is the responsibility of the sanitary authority to make reasonable provision for the prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in its district. The responsibility for the provision of any additional equipment or for the recruitment of staff is, therefore, a <Col N="322" /> matter for the sanitary authorities concerned&mdash;in this case the corporations of Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>In a report recently received from both of these authorities I find that the position regarding fire services is constantly under review.  An indication of this can be gauged from the following facts:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Dublin Fire Brigade</i>
      </P>
      <P>In the past year the personnel of all ranks increased by 73 to a total of 475.  The annual expenditure on fire services exceeds £1 million.  Two new fire stations were completed, one at Kilbarrack which is operational, and the other at Finglas which will become operational this month.  Proposals are under consideration for the extension and rebuilding of Tara Street Fire Station and for the replacement of Buckingham Street, Dorset Street and Rathmines Fire Stations.  In addition future proposals envisage three new fire stations at Tallaght/Clondalkin, Blanchardstown and Ballinteer.  A replacement programme for fire appliances is being carried out&mdash;within the past month two new appliances were delivered and delivery of a further appliance is awaited.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire Fire Brigade</i>
      </P>
      <P>The total personnel of all ranks is 53 and the annual expenditure on the fire service is £108,000.  As a result of a comprehensive independent examination of the fire service, carried out in 1969, one fire prevention officer and seven additional firemen were recruited.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is a great deal of public concern arising out of the circumstances of the fire as to whether the procedures regarding fire precautions and fire prevention at present in use are adequate?  As it is urgent in order to allay public anxiety that this report should be made available, can the Minister give the House any idea of when it will be available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The fire services are continually being built up.  The fire services in the city are adequate.  An inquiry is taking place and when the Minister receives the report he will determine whether a Ministerial inquiry will be held or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the reply, which is extraordinarily complacent in the circumstances, would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the nature of this fire and the casualties which occurred as a result of it are themselves proof that whatever precautions are enjoined in relation to fire prevention are either not adequate or are not being effectively enforced? There is no way out of it: this was a fire in the middle of the day in which eight people lost their lives.  How can the Minister say that the precautions are adequate after that?</P>

Could the Parliamentary Secretary say, for instance, how many long-extension ladders are in the possession of the fire brigade should it be necessary to use them for high buildings?

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Minister is concerned the position is that on no occasion, when money or sanction was required by Dublin Corporation, was such money or sanction refused.  The corporation seem to be satisfied that the equipment, the appliances and the staff which they have are adequate.  Naturally, the aim of the fire authority and of the Minister is that we should achieve a situation that is as near as possible to perfection. In furtherance of that aim better equipment is being purchased and more staff are being employed.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 and 112 together.</P>
      <P>The main statutory provisions with which I am concerned are contained in the Fire Brigades Act, 1940.</P>
      <P>Under the 1940 Act a sanitary authority may inspect any building in their area which is believed to be or suspected to be a potentially dangerous building from the point of view of fire and may serve a notice requiring the proprietor to refrain from using the building either totally or partially or until specified precautions are taken.</P>
      <P>The Department's advisory fire protection standards provide guidelines in structural fire protection, the provision of essential fire fighting equipment, adequate means of escape, fire drills and evacuation procedures in case of fire.</P>
      <P>The main structure of the fire service is being reviewed in the context of local government reorganisation generally and arrangements have been made to augment the professional and administrative staff of my Department engaged on fire service duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This staff are currently engaged in an examination of the position in relation to fire protection and prevention, including the publicity and education aspects, the need for and the form of new organisational arrangements and the detailed review of the 1940 Act to determine whether amending legislation is necessary.  In addition, a new code of building regulations, under the Local Government (Planning and <Col N="326" /> Development) Act, 1963, incorporating fire protection measures, is in course of preparation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely fire drill should not be taken up only when a fire occurs.  The time to introduce such drill would be before a fire occurred. Can the Parliamentary Secretary say if there is fire drill in schools and factories and other places where there are large numbers of persons?  From experience of previous fires it is known that many lives have been lost because of panic and because of people not knowing how best to get out of the fire area.  Fire drill should be taught in schools.  I have been informed by constituents who have had experience of teaching both here and in England that fire drill is a regular feature in schools in England.</P>
