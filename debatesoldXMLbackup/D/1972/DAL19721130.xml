    <Title>European Communities Bill, 1972: From the Seanad.</Title>
    <P>The Dáil went into Committee to consider amendments from the Seanad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in Amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 3: In page 3, after subsection (2), the following subsection inserted:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Regulations under this section shall not create an indictable offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="392" /> I gave consideration to suggestions made in the Dáil and Seanad that there should be limitations on the power of Ministers to make recommendations under the Bill.  I have explained before that this is not necessary for our Bill, under which&mdash; unlike the Act from which Deputies quoted&mdash;regulations must be confirmed by statute or they will lapse. Nevertheless, and although it is not logical, I felt that the Bill should contain a limitation on the power to create offences and that this limitation should be related to the weight of the penalty that would be or might be imposed. For that purpose I moved an amendment and obtained acceptance of it in the Seanad, this amendment which I am now moving.</P>
    <P>The amendment confines the offences which may be created by ministerial regulation to offences not triable on indictment or in other words to summary offences dealt with by the district courts and excludes offences triable by judge and jury.  An offence created by regulation under this Bill could not therefore carry any greater penalty than may be imposed by a district court.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are pleased that the Minister has come some of the way he has not yet, of course, answered the main objection which we voiced in this House and which has been voiced in the Seanad.  Fine Gael object to new crimes being created by ministerial order.  We object to new crimes being created without the necessary law being scrutinised under the microscope of Parliament.  We believe it is dangerous to give this power to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite severe penalties are available in the district courts for non-indictable offences.  Those penalties can include imprisonment, fine, withdrawal of certain privileges or licences or other rights and it is no answer to say, as the Minister said again this morning, that it is illogical to even require this because under the legislation the regulations would lapse unless approved by statute.  But the offence would, nevertheless, exist and could exist for a period of up to six <Col N="393" /> months.  It would be small consolation to somebody who had been punished by a fine or imprisonment to learn subsequently that when Parliament considered the matter they were of the view that the Minister should never have created such an offence. There will be innumerable occasions when people will be suffering or will have suffered the penalties before Parliament could pass the necessary legislation declaring the Minister's action to be without the approval of Parliament.</P>
    <P>While we are now in the predicament that we either accept this amendment or reject it we find ourselves having to be grateful for this small crumb.  It is nothing of which the Minister should be particularly proud.  In our original amendment we sought not merely to require that legislation governing such crimes be put before the House but we also sought to ensure that the Minister could not create new taxation or money impositions by means of regulations.  The Minister refused to consider that notwithstanding the constitutional recognition of the importance of Parliament in the imposition of taxation. The Minister has not paid any attention to the obligation which is quite clearly there in the Constitution, in the spirit if not in the letter, which requires that Parliament be fully involved in the imposition of taxation.</P>
    <P>Out of the five heads that we tabled in our first amendment governing taxation, crime, making provision that nothing could be declared an offence which was not an offence at the time of its commission and a few other matters which do not come to mind at the moment, the Minister has only accepted one.  But even for this small mercy I suppose we can be grateful and we do express gratitude. We are only sorry that the Minister did not go the whole way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in a peculiar position in regard to this because, as Deputy Ryan has said, we can only comment on and accept or reject what the Seanad has accepted as an amendment.  There is no way in which <Col N="394" /> we can change it.  Deputy Ryan is correct in what he says, that this appears to be just a sop which the Minister gave to the Seanad to give the impression that he was giving a little bit.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me what steps he has taken since the discussion took place here that people who may be breaking the law after 1st January will know what the law is?  I am sure the Minister understands what I mean.  As of now, even the people who administer the law are not aware of what the law is because unless they are fluent French speakers they have no opportunity of studying it.  This is a deplorable situation and the small concession which the Minister has given to the Seanad in no way answers the problem.</P>
      <P>I spoke to a fairly highly placed legal man in the last few days and he admitted that he did not and could not know what exactly the position would be from 1st January next.  The Minister may say that Ministers here will have made no orders by then but if the people do not know of them what will be the position in the next few months no matter what Minister is making regulations?  We have treated this as if it was a matter of no importance.  It is a matter of very great importance.  We will be discussing later on in this House today a very important Bill where we claim that the rights of citizens are being taken away.  I claim that they have been taken away by the legislation passed by this House a fortnight ago and by the Seanad yesterday, and which is before the House this morning again.  The citizens do not know what has been taken away.  The Minister is a reasonable man.  Unfortunately, he will not have responsibility to this House in a short time. Perhaps a number of his colleagues will have no responsibility either.  I believe the Minister, even if it is the last thing he does as the Minister for Foreign Affairs, should ensure that the people who may be prosecuted for breaking the law at least know what that law is.  I would ask the Minister to make some effort to have this done.</P>

      <P>The ministerial regulations will make it quite clear what offences are being created and where a law is being repealed by ministerial regulation it will be specifically repealed, and clearly declared.  It will be made clear what the change is.  In answer to the other point, it is essential, and even this modification of our original proposal will cause trouble for the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, functioning in relation to the common agricultural policy, to have penalties quickly available. I can see the desirability from the point of view of the House if time were available to legislate first rather than afterwards.  This is still open to the Minister dealing with the situation.</P>
      <P>As regards the ministerial regulations, they will be quite clear about the penalty.  As regards community regulations which have direct effect, we have had a search done by the Departments. They have found the legislation which is affected.  In some cases it will be up to the courts to decide if the implied appeal exists in a particular case. Knowing the legislation which is affected the people concerned with the law will be able to follow that course. In the beginning the Departments will give every assistance to people having problems in finding out whether there is conflict with direct community legislation and with previous domestic legislation.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 4: In subsection (2), line 35, &ldquo;a majority&rdquo; deleted and &ldquo;at least one-third&rdquo; substituted.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to delete &ldquo;a majority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;at least one-third&rdquo;.  It relates, strangely enough to the recall of the Dáil.  It was an amendment put down in the Seanad. The provision which I had in the Bill was taken from previous legislation.  It provided that a majority of the Dáil could seek the recall of the Dáil.  It appeared to Senators, and they impressed me, that this for the most part would mean that if one had a majority in the Dáil you are the Government and, therefore, if you make a regulation and want to change it you could recall the Dáil anyway, being the Government.  It seemed to be an unnecessary section.  It was proposed that we should accept that one-third of the Members of the Dáil could recall it.  If only one-third want to recall the Dáil because of a regulation they could not change the regulation because they will not be in the majority in the Dáil which they recall.  Either way, it seems to me that it will not be a very effective section, or used very much.</P>
      <P>It was felt in the Seanad that it would be desirable that a smaller number than the number creating the majority in the Dáil should be able to recall the Dáil if a particular regulation was offensive to them or they were worried about it.  I accepted the amendment on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was waiting for the Minister's cheek to burst with the tongue that was sticking out through it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is an ease on the Executive and of assistance to Parliament. The effect of section 4 of this Bill is that a regulation made by the Government would lapse unless Parliament were recalled.  The Minister, even if he is in difficulties, or if any Minister is in difficulties with members of the Government abroad, say, on the Riviera or elsewhere, about recalling the Dáil he can probably hope to have one-third of the Members at home who <Col N="397" /> can be got to sign something for the recall of the Dáil.  This is what this amendment brings about.  We almost fell into the same trap and due to the wisdom and sagacity of Deputy Tully we were saved from that particular fate and we withdrew our amendment, but I do not think a situation is likely to develop in which members of an Opposition might be seeking to recall the Dáil in order to keep some Governmental regulation in operation.  The Minister suggested that they might want to amend it.  I understand that we will have no power to amend.  We will either confirm the regulation to keep it in existence or we might decline to do so or fail to do so and the regulation would collapse.  Our power to amend will not exist.  That is why I felt that the Minister's tongue was protruding through his cheek as he was talking.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>Section 5: In page 3, before section 5, the following section inserted&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Government shall make a report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>During the course of the Report Stage, or one of the Stages in the Dáil, Deputy Ryan had an amendment which provided for twice-yearly reports by the Government to the Oireachtas on the development of the European Communities. I thought at the time it was not unreasonable to have such a debate twice a year.  Under the Bill we will have by the sixth month confirmatory legislation three debates a year.  There is also the question of setting up a committee.  This is in hand between the Whips of the different parties.  I have looked at this and since the committee has not been established I put down this amendment in the Seanad.  It was accepted there that we should have twice-yearly debates in line with the thinking of Deputy Ryan.  This should not be taken as excluding the setting-up of a committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We welcome this amendment and think it is sensible.  The fact that reports are made to the House does not mean that there will be debates.  I would expect that there would be debates when Members of the House would feel there was some matter worth debating or some matter of significance occurring or about to occur within the Communities, or if the House felt that some development should occur they would be able to have a debate to impress the Government of the day with some particular point of view.  It is a worthwhile amendment.  It certainly still involves the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas in this business and that is the general intention of all our amendments to this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes at my disposal last night I adverted to certain elements here who would subvert the powers of the State and I also stated that I was behind any legislation designed to secure and defend our democratic institutions.  I <Col N="400" /> said I did not think that the Government were bringing in the Bill merely for the sake of an exercise in verbal gymnastics or for the purpose of having a bit of fun here.  This is a serious Assembly and, over the last three years, we have all of us listened to demands from the Opposition side of the House that the Government should do something.  We have had attempts to bring certain people under control, but none of these attempts were effective in achieving our aim. The accusation made yesterday by Deputy Ryan cannot, therefore, be said to hold much water.  If the Minister and the Attorney General are unable under present legislation to find the law sufficient for their needs, then it is our duty here, the duty of the Government and of Parliament as a whole, to ensure that there is sufficient legislation in the hands of those responsible to protect and preserve our democracy.</P>
      <P>I was surprised at many of the statements made, particularly the statements made by that well-known literary figure, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien.  He used some nice literary phrases.  He said this was an attempt to improve the image of Fianna Fáil and to justify our alleged inactivity over the last few years.  He used the word &ldquo;cosmetics&rdquo;. Whatever cosmetics may be necessary to improve the image of Fianna Fáil, I can assure the Deputy that it would take quite drastic plastic surgery to improve the image of the Labour Party.  That goes for Fine Gael also.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil do not have to introduce legislation to improve their appearance or to redeem their reputation. The referendum on entry into Europe gave the Taoiseach a vote of confidence and, if that were not sufficient, then the Cork by-election certainly strengthened his hand quite considerably.  The Government stand as a stable party.  I was surprised to read the headlines in last evening's papers.  Whether they were inspired or otherwise, whether there was a leak or whether there was not, I do not know, but it is rather a pity that at times like these&mdash;they are nearly emergency conditions&mdash;there should be these divisions even considered, never mind being voiced as real.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="401" /> The main Opposition speaker yesterday indicated a certain amount of dissatisfaction over supporting this Bill and over the attitude of his party.  I support this Bill simply and solely because I want to secure democracy here.  I want to ensure that it will endure. If we procrastinate here, either as a Government or as a Parliament, and deny the officers of the law sufficient legislation to preserve democracy we will lose it altogether.</P>
    <P>It is fair comment to say that we never can and never will be able to enjoy complete freedom.  At any stage we have only a limited freedom and, should the need arise, we must limit that freedom further in order to protect the sovereignty of the State and preserve democracy.  There are forces at work today which do not recognise democracy, forces which will use democracy to destroy democracy.  It is up to every Member of this House to ensure that that ambition is not attained, even if that means some slight curtailment of liberty and, perhaps, some legislation of a nature we might not really like.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that there are ominous overtones.  In the 11 years I have been a Member of this House most legislation has been attacked on the basis that it has ominous overtones. Yet, legislation goes through and there is no ominous effect.  As a matter of fact, the complaint is very often made subsequently that the legislation is not strong enough.  I am very pleased that the Opposition parties have decided to oppose this measure because I want this measure to be fully explained to the Irish public.  I could not and would not support Deputy Donegan's argument that the leaders of the main Opposition parties could have formed a nice little circle and that this could be brought in in a nice palsy-walsy way. I want this Bill fully discussed.  I want it discussed as between the Minister proposing it and the Opposition opposing it.  Whether or not it has weaknesses, it is the type of legislation we need at this time.  I would say to the Minister that, if there is any virtue in the arguments put forward <Col N="402" /> by the Opposition he should accept them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if he sees that they can be accepted.  I want to ensure that we have legislation to maintain law and order.  It is utterly and absolutely disgraceful that the Judiciary should be intimidated whether they are presiding in court or in their own homes, or that their wives and families should be threatened with damage if the judges acted in a certain way.  It is high time that an end was put to the intimidation of Ministers and Deputies.  They have been intimidated in their homes.  They have a job to do and they are doing the job they were elected to do.</P>
      <P>When a small percentage of the population decide: &ldquo;We do not like democracy; we do not like the way it works; it is too cumbersome; there is too much work and too much argument in it; let us have the good old Stalin system; let us have the good old Hitler system; let us issue orders, bring in the jackboot and silence opposition&rdquo;, we must guard against that.  This would appear to be the new image of the new generation and the new political parties who are unable to make an impression on the population, and who would denigrate the population as being some form of stupid imbeciles who are not mature enough to make a decision as to what type of government they want.</P>
      <P>The decision rests with all of this House.  I am glad the Opposition are opposing the Bill and I hope their opposition will not be a denigration of past Acts and laws, but that we will have a constructive and helpful debate, and that they will seek whatever amendments may be necessary to round off this Bill into an effective measure.  Far from being the tyrant some people would make him out to be, the Minister for Justice has considerable courage and integrity and intelligence.  He will co-operate with them and ensure that democracy will prevail here.</P>

      <P>That is rather lopsided humanitarianism.  He has the right to his opinions.  I hope he will accept our right to our opinions. Deputy Ryan fulminated about there being sufficient legislation on the Statute Books to deal with these matters. It has been found that this is not the position.  I have no doubt that the Department of Justice, the Minister and the Attorney-General's Office have at their disposal adequate legal advice. Yesterday evening Deputy Donegan quoted the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  I know he is a businessman and he may well be a lawyer.  I do not <Col N="404" /> know.  I am not denying him his right to interpret the law as he sees it.  He said the Taoiseach stated that a section of that Act is not in accord with the Convention on Human Rights and that, in his view, that is not so.  I have 25 years experience of lawyers of repute and I must confess that I never got a straightforward opinion from them yet. It was always laced with qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy probably never asked a straight question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I never got a clear-cut decision from them.  It was always qualified, even in relation to simple little Acts which one would imagine they would be able to interpret.  I was always told: &ldquo;It depends on the evidence. It depends on the particular case.  It depends on the judge.&rdquo;  There were so many qualifications that I decided that lawyers were not the best men to give advice.  In any case, few lawyers give advice.  They usually call in barristers, or senior or junior counsel, depending on the gravity of the case.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice cannot act unless he is given a very strong opinion on how he should proceed. He would be holding the law up to odium and ridicule by bringing prosecutions on which convictions cannot be secured.  I cannot see the Minister doing other than what he is now doing after receiving legal advice from all the resources available to him.  Deputy Ryan is a young lawyer of some experience.  For over three years he has been urging us to take certain action.  It is rather strange that at this emergency hour he should now enlighten us all on the fact that the laws have been there all the time. I think he was speaking as a politician rather than as a lawyer.  It would have suited him better if we were to suspend the rights of these people and intern them without trial.  He would have liked that better.  It would give Fianna Fáil a worse image than the image Deputy Cruise-O'Brien alleges we have.  This would have suited him and many members of the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is seeking to deal with them within the law.  When this Bill goes through these men will <Col N="405" /> be brought before a judge and, as the Minister said, the judge is bound by nobody and will depend on his own skill, competence and conscience in making his decision.  It is, indeed, regrettable that we find it necessary to bring in this Bill and it is laudable that the Government have held out for so long against so much pressure before bringing in this type of legislation. Nobody can accuse them of acting in haste.  They are acting in time, but no more than in time, to give themselves the tools to preserve democracy.  I hope and pray that this will bring peace.</P>
    <P>There are those who talk about Northern Ireland and about uniting the country.  I am as certain as that I stand here that this country will be united, perhaps not in the next 10 or 20 years, but I can see the foundation stone of that colossus of sectarianism being removed.  Indeed, Stormont has been prorogued.  The Unionist Party is itself fragmented and in pieces. Whatever system will replace it, I do not see it ever being the same again.</P>
    <P>The destruction of the Northern Ireland Government was built into it right from the start.  The Roman Empire lasted for 400 years but it, too, collapsed with all its power and all its might.  It collapsed because its collapse was built into it.  The injustice perpetrated by Stormont over 50 years had to have its day of reckoning and that day of reckoning came when the civil rights marchers marched and the authorities tried to deny them the right to march and they had no other course but to rise up out of their chains to show some protest against the many, many disabilities and the many years of the jackboot pushing them into the ground.  If it was not the jackboot, it was unemployment driving them out of the country or unemployment leaving the men on the dole and the women in the factories.</P>
    <P>The whole system of society in the North is rotten and is seen to be rotten and is collapsing like the rotten edifice it is.  It did not have a heart, it did not have a thought; it only had a belief in maintaining and retaining power for its own benefit, for just a few.  The terrible calamity in the North of Ireland <Col N="406" /> is the abysmal ignorance of the majority and the masses.  They are foolish to be led along, by sectarianism and other means, to support and continue to support a party that should never exist in that form and which grew into the monster that it did.  I hope we will long preserve democracy and freedom and that majorities and minorities, wherever they may be, will get equal and fair treatment and that we will see peace some day.</P>
    <P>Believe me, it was peace that brought down the Roman Empire, peace expressed in Christian principles and Christianity.  Christian principles and Christianity will destroy ultimately the Unionist Party and sectarianism in the North of Ireland, when people come to recognise that they cannot worship the golden calf and that Christianity is the only way by which peace and justice for all will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I see no danger in the introduction of this Bill.  There was a great bruahaha over the Forcible Entry Bill.  I am pleased to note that since that Bill became law the illegal occupation of private property has ceased entirely. That Act, for all the opposition, seems to be working well and I have no doubt that the Bill before the House will work.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I would ask the Minister to build into this Bill a limit of, say, two years or five years, so that it could be removed.  The Bill gives certain powers in an emergency situation to superintendents of police.  I will be supporting this Bill but I would ask that as soon as possible those special powers be taken away again from superintendents of police.  I wish the Minister success and I hope there will be a long and good debate.  In a democracy, there must be debate but I want responsible debate from the Opposition, not negative and destructive comment.  This is a Bill that I would prefer not to see put on the Statute Book but, as it is so necessary to preserve democracy here, I will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Gallagher, I hope time will be given for the House to discuss this Bill and that there will be no question of <Col N="407" /> agreement being made for a closure.  I want to make that statement, at the outset, arising out of Deputy Gallagher's remark.</P>
      <P>When I received the Bill by post on Monday morning, I did something that I had never done before, I sat down immediately to read the Bill because there had been speculation in one of the Dublin Sunday papers as to the likely contents of the measure introduced last week.</P>
      <P>I have not any legal experience or legal training but it was not very long until I realised that it was not necessary to have legal experience in order to appreciate what the Bill meant.  The Minister yesterday said that he had circularised the Bill without any comment from him.  How right he was, because there was no need; it was spelt out loud and clear to me as an ordinary lay person what the full contents of the Bill were.  To be quite honest, I felt that the Fianna Fáil Government must have gone mad that they should think up such a Bill and think that they could bring it into this House and get away with it, or else, that they were legislating here for the big heads of the British Government.</P>
      <P>As I read the Bill then and as my impressions of it are, the Bill is unacceptable and it will not be acceptable to me in any amended form.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  It stinks, in my opinion.  It is not easy to describe the kind of State we will have here if this amendment of the Offences against the State Act is allowed to pass through this House. Deputy Carter yesterday mentioned something about a police State.  I did not get the full statement.  That is one way in which the State could be described if this Bill is allowed to pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not alone in that thinking because many people in my constituency have been in touch with me during the past couple of days requesting me to oppose the Bill.  I have had representations from many more people than ever before in my 18 years experience in this House.  However, it was not necessary for them to approach me because my mind had <Col N="408" /> been made up already but their representations counteract the arguments being made here by the Minister and the Taoiseach to the effect that the campaign that was launched against these proposals by the Press and by those who are referred to as &ldquo;leftists&rdquo; is an indication of the type of people who oppose the Bill.  The people who come to me are ordinary citizens and with one exception all of them were workers for Fianna Fáil up to the 1969 General Election and for all I know may very well work for the party again at the next election.  These people are opposed to this measure because they have no wish to live in a police State. Yesterday I had a letter from an officer in the FCA asking me to oppose the Bill.  Will anyone try to suggest that he is the type of person who would wish to bring down the institutions of the State?  I had a phone call from a high ranking civil servant with a similar request.  All of these representations bear out my own thinking on the matter.</P>
    <P>Proposals of this nature should not be before us because they are seeking to give extraordinary powers to the Garda Síochána, powers which I do not believe the Garda wish to have. Our police force are highly respected. It has been my privilege to know many members of the Garda Síochána.  I have been acquainted with them from my days in the Army through sporting activities and as a Member of this House.  The integrity and sincerity of the vast majority of them cannot be questioned but, unfortunately, there is always the odd one who is unsuitable and this is the type of person who should not have the power that would enable him to point a finger at somebody and accuse him of being a member of an illegal organisation which accusation might result in that person being sentenced to six months imprisonment.  The Taoiseach has said that a witness would be subject to deep cross-examination but from reading reports of court cases during the past two or three years I know that it is very easy for a policeman to claim privilege.  It has not been beyond them to do that in the past and I have no doubt that <Col N="409" /> they will do it in the future, too, so that the ordinary individual would not have a chance.</P>
    <P>I shall not go into the details of the Bill section by section because that has been done already by Members who, by reason of their legal background, are well qualified to do that.  We are living on an island which has a population a little more than four million people.  The island comprises two States which, between them, have more suppressive legislation than have all the countries behind the Iron Curtain.  Last week Mr. John Hume spoke at Oxford.  I congratulate him on his speech which was in line with my own thinking and which, in my view, represented the views of the vast majority of the Irish people.  During the debate Mr. Hume reminded us that the Prime Minister of South Africa would be glad to sacrifice all the repressive legislation on his statute books for one section of the Special Powers Act.  That gentleman, no doubt, would be prepared to go to great lengths if he could have a section of this Bill as proposed.</P>
    <P>We talk of the free world and when we do so we think in terms of our own country but there will be no freedom for our citizens if these proposals are accepted.  There has been reference in the House to Fianna Fáil's association with the IRA.  I am the son of an Old IRA man and I am very proud of that but I stand here today in my own right.  I was brought up in the Republican tradition and I have no doubt that my late father would support me all the way in my opposition to this Bill because he would never have advocated repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that these proposals were brought forward in an effort to appease Mr. Heath.  It is more than coincidence that after every meeting with the British Premier, the Taoiseach took action of some kind on his return in an effort to suppress the people of this country.  I happened to be in hospital about two years ago when I heard talk of internment.  Was it coincidence that at that time the Taoiseach had returned from the UN where <Col N="410" /> he had met Mr. Heath?  Members of the Government appeared on television to tell the Irish people and the world generally that 80 per cent of our people were behind the Government's proposal to introduce internment but that did not come off, the reason being that the public would not accept it.  I am convinced that the Taoiseach had given an undertaking to Mr. Heath that he would introduce internment. Another matter of note was that the Taoiseach decided to go alone to the Chequers meeting.  He did not take his Minister for Foreign Affairs or any other colleague with him but Mr. Heath called in Sir Alec Douglas Home and other members of his Government who had responsibility for Northern Ireland affairs at the time.  My view is that the Taoiseach did not wish any colleague of his to be present when he would be told by Mr. Heath that he had not lived up to his promise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Taoiseach would not trust a colleague.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Only the week before last the Taoiseach went again to meet Mr. Heath and again I am convinced that he could not have gone to that meeting unless he was seen to be doing something regarding the IRA and what he decided on was the arrest of Seán Mac Stiofáin.  This was done despite the fact that the Minister for Justice, only a couple of weeks previously, had indicated on television that they could not arrest Mac Stiofáin because they had nothing on him or words to that effect.  We did not have to have this legislation.  We were operating under the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  Seán Mac Stiofáin was arrested, he was charged after something like 48 hours and he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. That was done despite the fact that a fortnight previously the Minister for Justice did not think he had anything on him.  What the hell more powers does he want?  If he was able to get the big fish, as far as Mr. Heath was concerned, and succeeded in putting him in prison for six months under the existing law I do not know what he wants this legislation for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is all too much of a coincidence. <Col N="411" /> Deputy Seán Sherwin reminded me of that when he was speaking yesterday. The archenemy in this country, as far as the British authorities were concerned, was Mac Stiofáin, because he was born in England.  Members of the British Conservative Party have on more than one occasion said that the man who was leading activities here was not even an Irishman.  The same was said about the late Erskine Childers.  There was the very same type of carry-on 50 years ago in relation to Childers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is surely not insulting the memory of Erskine Childers by associating his name with that of Mac Stiofáin?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaugeBrennan" hpid="Mr. P. Brennan Mr. P. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying what was said about Childers in London and by the politicians in Dublin at the time.  He was a murderous renegade, according to Churchill, he was a damn Englishman according to Griffith but in my book he was a very good Irishman.  They succeeded, anyway, in liquidating him at the behest of the British Government.  They were under pressure to do it and they succeeded in doing it.</P>
      <P>It is too much of a coincidence that we now have this man in jail with people like Deputy Desmond and all the rest having their whack at him. I do not know the man good, bad or indifferent.  I do not know that I will ever meet him but I know that he is in jail today because Mr. Heath decided it.  There was adequate legislation here to do that and I am not prepared to give this Government or any other Government any more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been 18 years in this House. For 17 years I answered the Whip of the Fianna Fáil Party loyally.  I worked hard for them.  I had my differences with them.  There was an occasion here about 12 months ago when I was not prepared to walk into the division lobbies with them on a certain motion.  The result of that is that I am out here now.  I am not taking this stand today because I have a chip on my shoulder.  I have fairly consistently supported the Government <Col N="412" /> over the past 12 months.  I am taking this stand today because in my opinion this piece of legislation strikes at the very roots of democracy and I am not prepared to stand over it.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling&mdash;I hope I will be allowed to say this without interruption &mdash;that there are people in the Fianna Fáil Party who are opposed to this measure.  I know that if it is pushed to the House, people will walk into the division lobby in support of it against their better judgment.  I know that happened before.  I am asking the Minister present, and through him the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach, in God's name to withdraw this Bill. That is the only thing that can be done about it.  There is every reason why they should withdraw it.  They have all the powers they need to uphold law and order.  They have the Offences against the State Act, 1939, which has served many Governments over the past 30 years and I do not see that the need is any greater now than it was any time in the past to strengthen the provisions of that Act particularly along the lines which are proposed here.</P>
    <P>I am making an honest and sincere appeal to the Taoiseach and his Government to consider this Bill over the week-end and do the right thing. The right thing would be to withdraw it.  It will not embarrass me but do not ask any more of your men to do something that in their hearts they do not want to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party have tabled an amendment to this Bill stating that they believe this Bill is repressive legislation.  I believe it is. The Fine Gael Party since the foundation of the State have at all times upheld the security of this State.  For many years there was a taunt thrown at the Fine Gael Party that they were the law and order party because on every occasion when it was necessary they voted for what they felt was right. This party at all times put country <Col N="413" /> before party and that is the great test of any party.  In any country it is the great test of a Government.  We have at all times upheld the security of the State and the freedom of the individual. When one is faced with a Bill such as this, one must ask oneself whether it would cause more harm than good.  At present there is sufficient legislation on the statute book to ensure the maintenance of law and order if the Garda and the Government carry out their duties.</P>
      <P>I shall briefly recap on the situation in regard to the Offences against the State Act, 1939.  In looking at the Bill before the House one must also look at the legislation already available to the Garda Síochána, to the Government and to the judiciary.  To mention some of the offences at present, I refer to Part II, section 6 which deals with usurpation of functions of Government and which says:</P>
      <P>Every person who usurps or unlawfully exercises any function of government, whether by setting up, maintaining, or taking part in any way in a body of persons purporting to be a government or a legislature but not authorised in that behalf by or under the Constitution, or by setting up, maintaining, or taking part in any way in a purported court or other tribunal not lawfully established,...</P>
      <P>The net effect is that for such conduct the person is guilty of a felony and liable on conviction thereof to suffer penal servitude for a term not exceeding ten years or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.  For the usurpation of the functions of government at present a person may be sent to jail for a period not exceeding ten years.</P>
      <P>As regards obstruction of government, section 7 provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every person who prevents or obstructs, or attempts or is concerned in an attempt to prevent or obstruct, by force of arms or other violent means or by any form of intimidation the carrying on of the government of the State or any branch (whether legislative, judicial or executive) of the government of <Col N="414" /> the State or the exercise or performance by any member of the legislature, the judiciary or the executive or by any officer or employee (whether civil (including police) or military) of the State of any of his functions, powers, or duties shall be guilty of felony and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer penal servitude for a term not exceeding seven years or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with interference with military or other employees of the State and it says that a person who engages in this shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>In section 10 of the Act there is a prohibition against printing certain documents.  It says:</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful to set up in type, print, publish, send through the post, distribute, sell, or offer for sale any document</P>
    <P> (a)  which is or contains or includes an incriminating document, or</P>
    <P>(b)  which is or contains or includes a treasonable document, or</P>
    <P>(c)  which is or contains or includes a seditious document.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that every person who contravenes the foregoing subsections of this section shall be guilty of an offence under this subsection and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £100 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or to both such fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, deals with secret societies in army or police and a person who forms or organises or attempts to form such a society or takes part in forming it or organising it or induces or solicits or assists any member of a military or police force lawfully maintained by the government to join any secret society shall <Col N="415" /> be guilty of a misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years or imprisonment for any term not exceeding two years. The administering of unlawful oaths and so on is also dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have just read some of the offences and the sentences for people found guilty of them&mdash;ten years, seven years, two years and heavy fines.  Very drastic powers are given and I think these are sufficient, if properly implemented. If the State looked after these matters properly and if the police force ensured that these offences were properly investigated and if the cases were properly presented in court and if the Government permitted it, I believe there is sufficient power here and sufficient approval by the House for obtaining convictions for any of the aforementioned offences.</P>
    <P>As regards the legislation which is now before the House, I believe that it provides powers that are excessive and dangerous and which at the present time may do a great deal of damage. In regard to section 3 (b) dealing with evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation it is stated:</P>
    <P>...but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive</P>
    <P>The full subsection reads:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (a) of this subsection &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; includes omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.</P>
    <P>This is a sort of Hobson's choice in that if he omits to deny published reports that he is a member of an unlawful organisation, then he is guilty.  If he then goes and denies it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If a person omits to deny it this will be regarded as &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; and if he then denies it the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive.  This is serious.  Continuing with section 3 (2) we find that it reads:</P>
      <P>Where an officer of the Garda Síochána, not below the rank of chief superintendent, in giving evidence in proceedings relating to an offence under the said section 21, states that he believes that the accused was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation, the statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
      <P>A person stating that he believes a person was a member of an unlawful organisation&mdash;such a statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.  I refer to the Minister's brief in regard to this matter where he deals with this subsection and says that it extends the rule of common law evidence under which a witness's opinion as to a fact is admissible evidence to prove the fact only in certain circumstances, in particular in the case of an expert witness.  This is without doubt hearsay.  The evidence comes through to the chief superintendent from many people.  The chief superintendent then gives this evidence and if the person accused asks him for proof there is a grave danger &mdash;and this is one of the most serious points about the Bill&mdash;that the chief superintendent may say he has conclusive evidence and when questioned further, may plead privilege.  That requires some safeguard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not intend to go back too far but I merely mention the Public Accounts Committee.  There was a man, who may or may not vote with <Col N="417" /> the Government tonight accused by a superintendent at that committee who pleaded privilege as to where he got his evidence.  One of the persons mentioned was Deputy Haughey and the other person involved was Chief Superintendent Fleming who claimed privilege on this matter.  It is not for me to argue the rights or wrongs of the matter at that time but Deputy Haughey later said he was very aggrieved.  This can happen at some point in time in the case of a person who may be brought in and charged. The chief superintendent will have his evidence handed to him by different people and the accused person will have no opportunity of cross-examining the person who gave the evidence to the chief superintendent.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to get this point across, but what I am saying is that the person who gives the evidence to the chief superintendent may not be in court to be cross-examined on the point.  This is very important because somebody may have a grievance possibly against somebody in this House for political, religious or economic reasons, may have a very strong dislike of a particular person, and he goes to a memof the Special Branch or the Garda Síochána and says that this person has been away for long periods or may give some other reason.  That member then goes to the chief superintendent and says that this is the position.  I must say that I have at all times had the highest possible respect for the Garda Síochána of all ranks, from the Commissioner down to the ordinary guard, or from the ordinary guard up to the Commissioner, whichever way you wish to put it; but they are liable to err on occasions and a person in respect of whom wrong information has been given is not in a position to cross-examine. That is a very dangerous precedent.</P>
    <P>The section sets out that if the chief superintendent believes that the accused was at the material time a member of an unlawful organisation, the statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.  I am a solicitor and I am not saying that what I am putting forward is 100 per cent right. I am endeavouring to give what views I have on the matter and I would hope <Col N="418" /> that what I am saying is not prejudiced or political because I am endeavouring to be fair and not political.  You have the situation in a district court, a circuit court or a high court in which a certain amount of evidence is tendered on behalf of the prosecution, and at this stage, once the evidence is given, it is up to the defendant to prove his innocence.</P>
    <P>Reading the letters columns in the three papers today, I find one very interesting letter which endeavours to prove something of what I have been saying because I have been trying to put my point fairly from this side in pointing out the danger and the difficulty facing a person involved when such evidence is given in that the onus of proof then falls back on to him. The chief superintendent gives this evidence and it is then up to the defendant to prove himself innocent. The letter is from William Sweetman of Cranford, Taney Road, Dundrum, Dublin 14, in today's <i>Irish Times</i> on page 13.  It is the first letter in the letters to the Editor section and the heading of the letter is &ldquo;The Bill&rdquo;. I have met this man and his honesty and integrity are beyond challenge.  I have the highest opinion of him, as have certain members of the Government party.  Watching him practising in court, I found him at all times fair and reasonable in all his decisions.  He is a barrister and a former member of the editorial staff of <i>The Irish Press</i> and I believe him to be a justice of wide experience.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of his letter reads:</P>
    <P>I do not believe that I, or indeed any of your readers, could possibly prove that we are not members of the Provisional IRA any more than we could prove that we are not members of the British Secret Service. Both are secret organisations believed to be active in this country, and it would be absurd to think that either of these organisations would be willing to disclose to a court a comprehensive list of their membership.  Thus anyone is liable to conviction and punishment for not denying a &ldquo;published report&rdquo; or because a chief superintendent <Col N="419" /> believes him to be an IRA man. This goes, of course, for women also.</P>
    <P>The object of this strange legislation appears to be to give power of internment of suspected IRA men to the police, for whose actions the Minister is responsible, while making a clever and ruthless effort to pass the onus of making the order for imprisonment to a judge for whose actions the Minister is not responsible.</P>
    <P>Every judge, before his appointment, makes a solemn declaration that he will, without fear or favour, administer justice in accordance with the law.  But what can he do if faced with what many lawyers believe, and perhaps he himself believes, to be an unjust law?  Each judge must handle that dilemma on his own.</P>
    <P>I would ask you to publish this letter before the Bill is passed if it is to be passed in its present form. Otherwise, I would be risking imprisonment for myself and perhaps for you, too.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph of that letter shows the difficulty of proving that you are not a member of the Provisional IRA.  If a chief superintendent gives evidence that you are, the onus of proof falls back on you and you have a situation in which the evidence has been given against you and it is up to you to get yourself free.  This man says he does not believe &ldquo;that I or any of your readers could possibly prove that we are not members of the Provisional IRA any more than we could prove that we are not members of the British Secret Service&rdquo;.  It is also pointed out that they are secret organisations.  This is a very dangerous situation where one has to prove he is not a member.  At any particular point one may find this absolutely impossible. The courts are being used to allow a person to be convicted on evidence that is very dangerous.  There is a danger of interfering with our courts which <Col N="420" /> have withstood the test of time.  I ask the Minister to consider this particular section carefully.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish mentioned last night that this section smacks of internment. I myself also feel that that is so.  It makes it impossible for a person to prove himself innocent.  It is window-dressing and shadow-boxing to cover internment.</P>
    <P>The situation in the North of Ireland really exploded once internment was introduced.  This is window-dressing for internment.  It brings the courts into disrepute.</P>

      <P>We would be in a serious situation if this Bill is passed.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Government to withdraw it.  The Taoiseach made a request a year ago to withdraw something and his request was listened to.  If the Garda force are not sufficiently strong in number I would ask the Minister to increase that force.  People do not mind paying for protection and security.  The increase in crime in this country is noticeable.  It is in no way connected with offences against the State.  The increase is frightening.  If necessary the Garda force should be increased to ensure that the law is administered to its fullest extent.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher is not in the House at present.  He mentioned that there was no time limit in this Bill.  There should have been some time limit but even if there was I would not be in agreement with it.  I could not see myself supporting this Bill for the reasons I have given.</P>

      <P>This is a sufficiently important piece of legislation to warrant all of us saying something about it particularly when we listen to speaker after speaker referring to what the Taoiseach is doing and to what the Minister for Justice is doing.  This legislation comes from the Government, unanimously supported by them and by the Fianna Fáil Party. Deputy P. Brennan said he knew there were Deputies who would be dragging their feet about this.  No Deputy has any doubt about the need for this legislation and the support it must get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many red herrings are being dragged into the discussion by people who know well the sheer hypocrisy of what they are talking about.  Is the legislation necessary or not?  Are we to allow our institutions to be eroded by the type of thing which we are seeing on the streets in Dublin, by the people who would humiliate our police force and kick them around the streets?  Are we going to take powers to ensure that we can deal with situations of that kind?  That is the issue.  If we do not pass this legislation we will leave ourselves stripped of any power to deal with any situation which may develop in the time to come.  We were elected by the <Col N="422" /> majority of the people to rule this country.  We were given an explicit mandate to do that, to protect the institutions of the State and to see that the average citizen got what he is supposed to get in a democratic country&mdash; a right to live without interference from anarchists or others who may wish to interfere with his ordinary day-to-day life in this country.</P>
    <P>Some people may say that we were given that mandate four years ago and that that mandate may not run today. Sometimes time makes changes but we have had a few opportunities in the interim to test the feelings of the people.  We have had by-elections in Donegal and Dublin.  We have had the referendum in which the attitude of the people was explicitly expressed. We have had in more recent times a by-election in mid-Cork where every facet of the speeches being made and every argument being expressed on the other side of the House was trotted out up and down the length and breadth of that constituency.  We know the results in all these cases.  To those people who might say that our mandate has perhaps weakened since the general election I want to remind them that we have had these opportunities to test it and the outcome was unmistakable.</P>
    <P>We are asking for power to deal with an abnormal situation.  We are not asking for it for the sake of &ldquo;cussedness&rdquo; or, indeed, to make ourselves unpopular.  We know what our judiciary and our police force think about this.  We know how our police force have been humiliated when they went into court and the rules of evidence made a mockery of them.  We do not come in here lightly to do something unpopular and there is not one Member of this House who believes for one moment that this legislation will be used against any law-abiding citizen. No one believes that such a thing will happen.</P>

These are the tactics copied from other countries, countries in which attempts at mob law had to be stamped out.  If this Parliament does not give us the right to enforce law and keep order, then the people will very quickly tell us in the next two weeks whether or not they want this Parliament.  It is from the people that power comes.  It is not from Fianna Fáil and it is not from Fine Gael.  It is from the people who put us here to represent them and, if we are doing wrong now, then let us ask the people what they want.  Do they want this Parliament to be upheld by legislation designed to deal with a dangerous and abnormal situation?  Is it to be a case of wearing kid gloves and going around saying: &ldquo;You are a nice fellow.  You only robbed a bank. We have no proof and we cannot substantiate the fact that you did rob a bank&rdquo;.  Is this situation to be allowed to continue?  This Parliament must decide on this legislation or else the people must tell us what they want.</P>

      <P>Yes.  If people are against violence they must do everything possible to keep peace and order in the country.  If people are in favour of violence, then the forces of order, who have an Army, have a duty to maintain that order.  We cannot just sit back and allow violence to continue. The kind of character who goes into a hospital and protests, and subverts the course of justice, and comes out the next day and protests that he is completely opposed to that kind of thing shows the kind of ambivalence that <Col N="424" /> those who support law and order just do not want.  We have come to the crunch and the Members of this House will walk into the Division Lobbies this evening to vote and I hope, after that vote, the message will be loud and clear.  Will we face the country, having left ourselves no opportunity to pass legislation here designed to deal with an extremely explosive and serious situation?  Do we reject the opportunity to bring in such legislation in the pretence that it would interfere with the liberty of God-fearing citizens?  Would it interfere with the liberty of God-fearing citizens?  Of course, it would not.  The only people with whose liberty it might interfere are the people who want to be out on the streets, throwing bottles at the police, and at the same time, talking about the freedom of the individual and the great virtues of democracy, the people who were outside this House last night, the people who have come in here in the last few years and openly stated that their objective was to overthrow the institutions of this State.</P>

      <P>If I wanted advice on law and order the last person from whom I would seek such advice would be Deputy Coogan.  One speaker talked about our trying to pass on to the courts a responsibility that should be ours.  But surely it is the courts who interpret the law and surely it is the courts who decide.  I would advise District Justice Sweetman, instead of writing long letters to the Press, to read the Bill.  Nobody should know better than he does that it is the courts who interpret and decide on the law. All we are seeking to do here is to make it easier for the courts to deal with situations which they, more than anyone else, know must be dealt with; they also know that, in order that they may be able to deal with the situation, there must be a change in the rules of evidence.</P>

They know we have had the advice of <Col N="428" /> the people who are sufficiently intimate with the situation to be certain that the legal position under the present legislation is not adequate to deal with the situation and as it is likely to develop.</P>
      <P>It is all right to carry placards through the streets about &ldquo;Jack the Rat&rdquo;, and what have you.  They are not dignified to say the least of them. They may please people sitting over there but they will not please any decent citizen.</P>

      <P>I recognise an election propaganda speech when I hear it.  I have been called naive because I am not obsessed with the electoral consequences of what we say or do in <Col N="429" /> this House.  Have we sunk so low in this Parliament&mdash;and by God the 19th Dáil has sunk pretty low over the past three years&mdash;that all our actions are determined solely and exclusively by a head count of what will happen to us, whether we will be re-elected and whether we will get our pensions.  I want to make a number of things quite clear.  I deny flatly the charge of ambivalence made against me by the Minister.  I regard this as a piece of disgraceful, fascist and totalitarian legislation which, if it were introduced by the Greek colonels, would be opposed by every delegate we sent to the Council of Europe.  Since it is introduced close to home we all find that there are necessary and reasonable excuses for having it passed.</P>
      <P>Let me make one thing absolutely clear.  Irrespective of the electoral consequences to me or to anyone else, if no one else were to stand in his place and call for a vote on this Bill I would do so, and I hope I would find four others to stand with me, so that a division would be possible under Standing Orders.  Happily that issue does not arise because the Labour Party are unanimous in their opposition to the Bill.  Let me make that absolutely clear before the label of a so-called Provisional supporter is hung around my neck, or the neck of anybody else in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No one is more conscious than I am of the importance of this debate. No one is more conscious than I am of the dilemma of a democracy, a so-called democracy if Ireland can be called a democracy&mdash;and I sometimes wonder&mdash;which is faced with the conduct of people who deny the rules of the game and who deny the proper sequence of legal action under a democracy. No one is more conscious than I am that some of the people at whom this extraordinary piece of legislation is allegedly aimed have said that they have no time for this House, and no time for the process we are now going through here.  What is a democracy to do in these circumstances? Is it to arm itself with powers which are of their very nature in breach of democracy?  Before it does this, it has to take a very long and <Col N="430" /> searching look at its own conscience and its own conduct.</P>
    <P>The Government party in this Republic, this 26-county State, have to do that.  It is very easy to wheel 71 Deputies, all desperately concerned with their political, administrative and financial futures, through the Dáil lobbies.  Would it not be more appropriate to debate whether the conduct of the party which, effectively speaking, have this country in a vice-like grip justifies adding to themselves the powers contained in this Bill?  I contend that they have not got the right to do this and I will explain why in a second.</P>
    <P>I want to make a very brief reference&mdash;I trust the Ceann Comhairle will bear with me while I do this since it has been referred to both by the Minister and by the Taoiseach&mdash;to an incident in which I was involved on Sunday.  I went to the Mater Hospital on humanitarian grounds to seek to ameliorate the conditions of an individual whom I did not want to see die. I would do the same for anyone.  It would be very easy, like the Pharisee and the Levite, to pass by on the other side.  To take my phone off the hook would be the easy way out.  I did not do that and I am not prepared to do that. I am not ashamed of my conduct.  I know that by doing what I did I left myself open to the sneers which have come from the gentle, kindly, indolent Taoiseach that I am a Provo supporter. I know, and I knew before I took the action I took, that this would be the consequence and that if an election is fought on the polarities determined by those people over there&mdash;do you want the Oireachtas or do you want Seán Mac Stiofáin&mdash;at every chapel gate in Ireland I will be called a Provisional supporter.  I know and I do not care and I did not care on Sunday because I am not prepared to stand idly by, to use a famous phrase, while a man's kidneys degenerate past the point of no return.  I am not prepared to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not mean that I am in any sense a supporter of the campaign of violence waged in the <Col N="431" /> North, allegedly by the Provisional IRA.  Like every other member of this party I am committed, as is every other Member of this House, to the view that the only possible solution to the division of what I regard as our integral national territory, the Thirty-two Counties&mdash;I am not quite sure the Fianna Fáil Party still regards it as our national territory; I regard it as such and the Labour Party constitution regards it as such&mdash;is by peaceful means and I will be found on Sunday equally ready to stand with the appeals for peace of the Protestant clergyman from Belfast who lost his son on Friday.  I will be found equally ready to stand there.  I detest and abominate death in all its forms. If I had the guts I would be a pacifist &mdash;I probably am a pacifist&mdash;let me make that quite clear.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of this Labour Party to oppose this Bill and that policy is unanimous, whatever the correspondents in the Press may say.  I am unlike the Minister who has talked about the way television cameras are used and placards about &ldquo;Jack the Rat&rdquo;.  It would be unparliamentary for me to call Jack &ldquo;Jack the rat&rdquo;, so I will not do it.  I simply ask his former colleagues what they think about him.  Unlike the Minister I do not mind if political correspondents misinterpret my actions as being an expression of allegiance with the Provisional IRA.  They have that right.  It annoys me.  I do not like it.  It irritates me.  It upsets me.  But, unlike those people over there, I am not going to set out to muzzle them and stop them doing it.  I hope I make my position clear on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been an appalling fortnight for Irish justice, culminating in this Bill.  A man&mdash;we will call him X for the purpose of argument&mdash;has been mysteriously picked up in the early hours of the morning after he had made a tape.  The entire authority of Telefís Éireann have been sacked for allowing the tape to be made.  A distinguished journalist&mdash;one of the most distinguished journalists in the country&mdash;has been sentenced for contempt for refusing to talk about the tape that has been made and <Col N="432" /> another man has been sent to his possible death on the basis of the contents of the tape appropriated by the Government.  If that is not having it both ways, well then, I am even more politically immature than I am accused of being.</P>
    <P>I want to make quite clear that I have no shame for what I did on Sunday.  It does not make me an apostle of violence to lead a deputation&mdash;I do not speak of the demonstration&mdash;to see Mr. Mac Stiofáin.  If it makes me an apostle of violence to do so, it makes the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Dermot Ryan, an apostle of violence; it makes the former Archbishop&mdash;more loved on those benches than on these&mdash;Dr. John Charles McQuaid, an apostle of violence.  It makes the Limerick City Council apostles of violence; they passed without opposition a resolution calling for the release of Mr. Mac Stiofáin on humanitarian grounds, a resolution supported by Councillor P. J. Liddy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Are these all to be condemned as Provos at every chapel gate?  Is Councillor Liddy to be condemned as a Provo for seeking to prevent a man's death?  There are enough deaths in Ireland, Protestant and Catholic.  Even if I did not think the Offences Against the State Act to be an abomination, which I do think and it is party policy to think it is an abomination&mdash;I am perfectly in accord with party policy in saying this and successive conferences have said we are opposed to the Offences Against the State Act&mdash;and if I did not think personally that Mr. Mac Stiofáin should not be let down&mdash;and I do not think he should be let down &mdash;even if I did not think this, are the Government so irresponsible that they want to provoke a situation where the corpse of Mr. Mac Stiofáin is pulled through O'Connell Street on a gun carriage and the memories of Thomas Ashe are evoked in this State, that they want the confrontation revived of the kind those associations, fostered more on those benches over <Col N="433" /> the years than by any other group of people evoke?  Do the Government want that?  Are the Government so totally concerned with survival and power that they do not care if that is the kind of confrontation they foster?</P>
      <P>If that makes the Government clever, if that makes the Government politically astute, if that makes the Government good at electioneering tactics, I am glad I am a fool because at least I am a fool with a clear conscience. What was it Pearse said?</P>

I would do it again in the morning but I wonder how those people who sit on the back benches over there and who were preaching republicanism as recently as three years ago, feel when they look in their shaving mirrors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I turn to the Bill with profound depression.  It is almost unnecessary to talk about it.  It is unamendable. Deputy Cooney's amendment is so directly a negative that it is tantamount to not being an amendment but I think the Deputy is correct in his amendment although I do not go all the way with everything he said in support of it.</P>
      <P>It has been said both by the Taoiseach and the Minister that the Bill does not transfer the onus of proof of innocence to an accused person. I refute, deny and challenge this because it seems to me that it does that precisely.  Let us look carefully at the Bill.  Section 3 (1) (a) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="434" /> Any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct, by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, in proceedings under section 21 of the Act of 1939, be evidence that he was then such a member.</P>
    <P>First, may I ask what is the meaning of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;?  I am not a lawyer but I have taken legal advice on this.  The word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; is one that occurs here and there in this Bill.  Who is to determine what is reasonable?  Secondly, the previous common law practice has not been that a person is obliged by law to provide any information or even his name and address to a member of the Garda Síochána.  This is a right to silence, as clerical people have said, the silence of St. Thomas More, a saint to whom, if I may be forgiven the crawthumping, I have a particular devotion.  St. Thomas More's defence was silence until the point of his conviction and then he broke the silence.  If this Bill becomes law silence will be culpable. This is a major change in the whole common law tradition which runs right through, by a golden thread as the textbook says, the laws of both Great Britain and Ireland.  Furthermore, the Bill places the onus of belief on a member of the Garda Síochána who is not below the rank of chief superintendent where he states that he believes the accused was, at a material time, a member of an unlawful organisation. Such statement would be evidence that the accused was then such a member.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright made the point that for one to prove he is not what he is accused of being is almost impossible. For all I know, the Minister may be a member of the Provisional IRA.  How would he prove he was not a member of that organisation?  How would Deputy Haughey prove that he was not a member of the Provisional IRA? This Bill would create an entirely new situation in law and it is arguably in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights which was ratified by all the member states of the Council of Europe, including Ireland.  Article 6 (2) of that convention states that everyone charged with a criminal <Col N="435" /> offence shall be presumed innocent until proved guilty according to law.</P>
    <P>This Bill places the onus on the accused rather than on the accusor.  I would oppose the Bill equally if it applied as much to Billy Hull, William Craig, Adolf Hitler or members of the Provisional IRA.  It is a matter of indifference to me because the Bill is something which is intolerable to me as one who has been brought up in the common law tradition of these islands.  The Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Social Welfare all made the point that the Bill was aimed specifically at special categories of people, to wit, members of the Provisional IRA.  That is a reassuring statement, I do not think.  As Deputy Cooney correctly pointed out, we were given a comparable assurance that the Forcible Entry Bill was aimed only at people who were squatting but we know that those measures were used subsequently against other categories of persons.  In the same way, the Offences Against the State Act has been used in the past against the trade unions.  Once that party are armed with these powers, are we simply to rest on their word, a word that they have broken so often since June 1969, that the Bill would be used only against the geligniter and the bomber? If I were to accept that assurance from those benches I would be guilty of a degree of gullibility even greater than that of which I have been accused.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that there are people who are members of what is described euphemistically as an unlawful organisation who refuse to recognise the courts, who would not plead, and he said that even in those cases these people's rights would be protected because the justice could cross-examine police witnesses. Let me make two points clear.  Every tradition of common law asserts that even a person who refuses to plead in a court is innocent until proved guilty. The statement that he is not prepared to give evidence does not render him a non-person.  In legal terms he is still a human being who has legal and civil rights although he denies the efficacy of the system which gives him those <Col N="436" /> rights.  Maybe democracy is over-lax or over-lenient here but every democracy behaves in this way.  I am not prepared to say people who do not recognise the court are to be sent down on a systematic conveyor belt on the basis of the evidence adduced under this Bill to what is tantamount to internment. Their legal rights remain even if they deny the validity of the institution which provides those legal rights.  This is not Deputy David Thornley making a statement.  It is a fundamental principle of common law.  In one of the classic textbooks on social democracy, that written by E.F.M. Durbin, the point is made that even those who refuse to play by the rules of the social democratic game are entitled to benefit by the application of those laws.  This is something in which I firmly believe because, as I have said before, when democracy arms itself with powers which abrogate the rule of law in order to resist people who wish to overthrow the rule of law, then you are in a circular logical situation because in effect democracy has then committed suicide and that is what it is doing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to make any criticism of our judiciary as a whole or of any individual judge.  It would be wrong and invidious to do so in this House.  The argument of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice that even where a prisoner refuses to plead or as, perhaps, in the case of Mr. Mac Stiofáin is arguably not in a physical or mental condition to conduct his own defence, his rights are adequately protected by the possibility of the presiding judge or judges acting in an inquisitorial capacity on his behalf, cross-questioning a superintendent of the Garda Síochána, does not carry conviction with me.  I am choosing my words very carefully and very deliberately here.  Reading the transcript of the Mac Stiofáin trial does not suggest to me that it is safe to leave the protection of accused people who refuse to plead solely in the inquisitorial hands of justices.</P>
    <P>This Bill cannot be seen in isolation. It has been a bad fortnight for Irish democracy.  I have mentioned four ways&mdash;the arrest of Mac <Col N="437" /> Stiofáin, the dismissal of the authority, the arrest of O'Kelly and now the introduction of this Bill.  We listen to the protestations of successive speakers from that side of the House that there is no pernicious purpose behind this Bill.  In addition to taking this Bill in the context of the four events to which I have referred, one also has to bear in mind that <i>The Sunday Independent</i> of 19th November, 1972, carried an advertisement calling for the recruitment of 100 temporary male prison officers with, as it put it, good prospects of permanent employment.  For what?  For whom?  For me?  For you?  The country is alive with rumours that Kilworth Camp, County Cork, is being prepared for the reception of large numbers of people of one category or another and <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning carries a story that Arbour Hill is being prepared similarly for the reception of prisoners. &ldquo;Arbour Hill&rdquo;&mdash;famous, evocative words&mdash;is being prepared with a rapidity which does credit to the Board of Works.  If only they had applied the same expedition to the repairing of Mountjoy Jail we might not have had the Prisons Act passed through this House.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking last night, criticised my colleague, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, and much as I may differ from him on points of detail, on this Bill we are at one.  He criticised him for referring to the historical origins of the Irish Republican Army and tried to make a distinction between the IRA from which that party proudly take their origin and the IRA which functions at the moment.  I will not follow the Taoiseach into historical exegesis.  It is not my practice to take this House back to 1922, 1931 or 1932 but I would say this, without any expression of support for violence on my part&mdash;I have no support for violence&mdash;if people in this country have been taught that their heroes should be gunmen, should be Dan Breen, Seán Treacy, Séamus Robinson, Seán Hogan, Ernie O'Malley, Cathal Brugha, Erskine Childers, senior, and as late as the 1950's, Seán South, if they have been taught this rightly or wrongly&mdash; Deputy Cruise-O'Brien and I would <Col N="438" /> differ on this&mdash;they have been taught this nowhere more clearly and more firmly than from those benches.  Maybe the Fianna Fáil Party have experienced a late conversion, do not believe in violence any longer, do not believe in republicanism any longer, want to amputate their roots, want to amputate their historical past, want rapidly to turn themselves into a new kind of party&mdash;a smooth party, a party of Europe, of mohair suits, <i>pâté de foie gras,</i> eternal realism.  Maybe that is what Fianna Fáil want to do but it is an expensive and rather rapid operation and unfortunate poor devils like Mac Stiofáin who were brought up on the mythology perpetrated from those benches are now starving so that the Government can rapidly bring this party of theirs into a different dimension and a different view of Irish history.  May God help those who believed what they heard from those benches up until 1969.  They are paying the price for it now.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach speaking last night in a speech of characteristic and to my mind disgraceful cunning which epitomises the Taoiseach, a very clever speech, a brilliant speech&mdash;I take my hat off to him&mdash;made reference in this House in an appeal for sympathy for this Bill to two things in particular &mdash;the bomb incident in a Dublin cinema recently and the conviction and release of, though he did not name her, I hope I am in order because it was obvious to whom he was referring, Mrs. Máire Drumm.  The Taoiseach is a lawyer.  I am not.  Even if the Taoiseach did not practise for very long in the early years of his career as a barrister he was too busy making up his mind whether he would join Clann na Poblachta, Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil to have time to practice as a barrister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not a barrister so I do not know, but is it proper for a Taoiseach to imply before any case is brought before a court that the Provisional IRA are responsible for the bomb incident which we all equally in this House deplore?  Do we know who is responsible for that incident? <Col N="439" /> I do not.  Is the Taoiseach in possession of sources which I am not in possession of?  Is it proper for the Taoiseach to try to hang around the necks of the opposition to this Bill the fact that Mrs. Máire Drumm only received a 22 day sentence?  Surely if the Taoiseach is asking us to repose confidence in the Judiciary he should not get up in this House and, in effect, call in question a decision reached by the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>This Bill, to me, is repulsive.  Section 5 (d) says that:</P>
      <P>any film, microfilm, negative, tape or other device in which one or more visual images are embodied (whether with or without sounds or other data) so as to be capable (as aforesaid) of being reproduced therefrom and a reproduction or still reproduction of the image or images embodied therein whether enlarged or not and whether with or without sounds or other data</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>shall be included as a document when this Bill becomes law.  This is a novel proceeding which has largely escaped notice in this debate, not totally novel because under the ruling of the justice in the Mac Stiofáin case the famous tape was used&mdash;and I have my own views about the legitimacy of doing that&mdash;to convict Mr. Mac Stiofáin. Now if this Bill becomes law, video tapes are to be used for convictions. Personally, I find this abhorrent.  It is not even done in America where political sophistication has reached a very high point, but leaving aside the major issues raised by the Bill, I wonder has the House considered the effect which section 5 (d) is likely to have upon an interviewer, a broadcaster, a producer of a programme in our radio and television.  In future whenever it is put before him&mdash;should he make a particular programme or should he conduct a particular interview&mdash;hanging over him will be the shadow of 5 (d).  If he does this, if he interviews Mac Stiofáin, if he interviews me, if he interviews the Minister for Transport and Power, there is always the possibility that <Col N="440" /> someone is going to tap him on the shoulder and say: &ldquo;Give me that cassette; it is material evidence in a prosecution I am about to take&rdquo;.  As one who has some small experience of broadcasting, may I say that I am deeply conscious of the inhibitions which this will impose upon a disseminator of objective news in the public media.</P>
    <P>Let me say that everything in the Taoiseach's speech shows that it was an election speech, a clever speech, a cunning speech, a speech designed to catch votes, a speech designed to frighten people, a speech designed to appeal to the small man, the man of property, small property, a speech designed to say: &ldquo;Your car or your house is in danger from irresponsible subversive elements; therefore, accept this Bill&rdquo;.  It was a very clever speech. The Government are setting the polarities of a future election and they are getting a certain amount of help from certain Press correspondents in doing this.  The polarities they are choosing are between the Oireachtas on one side and the Provisional IRA on the other, a marvellous issue to fight an election on, and I take my hat off to the Taoiseach for the characteristic cunning with which he has chosen it.  But there are times when moral and political issues transcend electoral considerations.  The polarities are not as the Taoiseach states them; they are not between the Provisional IRA and democracy.  They are between the Fianna Fáil Party and democracy and this Bill is designed to arm the Fianna Fáil Party with powers which I, for one, were I alone of the 144 Deputies in my protest, would under no circumstances concede to them.</P>
    <P>Let me finally repeat that <i>pace</i> the sneers of the Minister for Social Welfare, I have no time for violence.  I am a pacifist and a democrat, but I disapprove of allowing men to add to the catalogue of death in this country by dying of hunger and I disapprove of fascist oppressive totalitarian legislation, and no matter how my actions last Sunday, what I am saying here today or what I may reserve the right to do in the future are <Col N="441" /> misinterpreted by members of that party, I shall remain obdurate in opposition to this disgraceful Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation we face at present is a complex one, it is complicated by the fact that over the past fortnight we have faced not only the issue of this Bill but also the issue posed by the arrest and conviction of Mac Stiofáin and also the issue posed by the Government action with regard to RTE.  Each of these has provoked its own reactions amongst different members of the community.  This is not, therefore, a clear-cut issue. Secondly, on the Bill itself, the whole problem posed by this Bill is that perennial problem, the issue of liberty and freedom and how they are best safeguarded.  Clearly a balance has to be maintained between the libertarian view expressed by Deputy Thornley which is entitled to respect and the view that the interests of the democratic system must be safeguarded and <Col N="443" /> that any democracy which leaves itself with one hand tied behind its back is liable to founder.  Our job in this House is to find the right balance between the two.  It is not an easy task.  The issue is not a clear-cut one and all of us who faced the problem on this Bill have had to face it with seriousness, to apply our minds to the question as to which parts of the Bill are, perhaps, desirable and acceptable and which parts are totally unacceptable and, in our view, unnecessary.  It has not been easy for any of us to reach a conclusion on this.</P>
      <P>In speaking on this matter I shall be bearing in mind both the desirability of giving to a government of a democratic State the powers that are necessary to defend the democratic system and the undesirability of giving to a government powers that go beyond what is necessary and which are a danger to the democratic system we are seeking to defend.  That is the dilemma this Bill poses for us and it is no good pretending it does not exist.</P>
      <P>With respect to Deputy Thornley, it is easy to make a speech purely in terms of individual liberty and protection against encroachment by the Executive.  It is easy to make a speech on the need to safeguard the State against the IRA and to state that all measures are legitimate for this purpose. In fact, the truth lies between the two statements.  These extreme viewpoints on the issue of liberty and order do not do justice to the subject. It is all too easy to oversimplify it and in a debate which the Government have contrived, apparently as a prelude to a general election campaign, they will seek to oversimplify these issues.  They will seek to elevate the law and order issue and to pay scant regard to the issue of individual liberty with which we must be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition could fall into the trap set by the Government.  By contesting the right of the Government to introduce inherently objectionable legislation there is a danger they might find themselves facing a general election campaign in which the Government would fight this law and <Col N="444" /> order issue.  However, I do not share the confidence of some members of the Government in the ability of Fianna Fáil to pull the wool over the eyes of the people.</P>
    <P>The people in the last four years have watched the party opposite; they have watched the action and inaction of that party.  Four years ago the people saw men firing guns over a grave in Mullingar and they saw that nothing happened in that case.  From statements made in this House they know why nothing happened&mdash;because the Garda were not permitted to act.  Since then they have seen a succession of actions in public defiance of the law, tolerated by a government not willing or powerless to act because there were in the ranks of that party and in the Government people who were sympathetic to the men of violence in a campaign against democracy in this State.</P>
    <P>The people repeatedly have heard this party demand action, demand application of the existing law, but they have also seen that little use was made of the existing law.  On this issue, our party have been consistent. There has been a succession of public actions in defiance of the law, followed by Government inaction. Nobody is in any doubt why action is not taken; we know of the internal difficulties the Government faced.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I heard Deputy Sherwin make a speech that certainly gave aid and comfort to people threatening democracy in this State.  Where did Deputy Sherwin emigrate from to the upper benches?  He came from Fianna Fáil and the same is true of Deputies Foley, Brennan and Blaney.  These are the people whose views, as expressed in this House, come nearest to sympathising with the illegal organisations and who at times seek to defend or explain the actions of these organisations. These people have never been willing to condemn murders committed by these bodies, they have never been willing to defend the right of the people to life when attacked by these organisations.</P>
    <P>We have seen that when Ministers, in particular the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, spoke on these matters there <Col N="445" /> were silent gentlemen behind them unwilling to applaud them on the occasions when they chose to speak out against the IRA and even before they were willing to take action against the IRA.  Members of this House saw the glum faces behind the Taoiseach, the failure to applaud the speeches, while from this side of the House there was applause for the sentiments expressed but not for the lack of action by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers.</P>
    <P>Because of that problem in Fianna Fáil, we know the Government were inactive for a long period.  We know that two years ago Ministers were engaged directly in activities, or knew or suspected of activities involving the security of the State which they did not bring to the knowledge of the Taoiseach.  We know that with certainty because we have the report of the Public Accounts Committee on this matter and I will quote a statement from that report:</P>
    <P>Had the then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Neil T. Blaney, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, and the then Minister for Defence, Deputy James Gibbons, passed on to the Taoiseach their suspicion or knowledge of the proposed arms importation, the misappropriation of part of the money which is now known to have been spent on arms might have been avoided.</P>
    <P>The committee were concerned only with the technical issue of the money spent but, of course, this also involved knowledge of the arms importation and on this matter we have evidence from the trial as well as the evidence before the Public Accounts Committee.</P>
    <P>A government in which Ministers knew of these activities and sympathised with them to such an extent that they would not tell the Taoiseach what was going on were a government that clearly could not act against the IRA.  The accusations that have been made of direct stimulus to the creation of the Provisional IRA by Ministers, that they aided and financed this establishment, have not been properly refuted and are consonant with the findings of the Public Accounts Committee, <Col N="446" /> although they go beyond what the Public Accounts Committee were able to find on the evidence before them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, when Deputy FitzGerald speaks of what the Taoiseach did or did not do, surely the decision of the arms trial clearly indicated that the Government knew precisely what was happening in the contingency plans in relation to the oppressed nationalist population in the North?  It is wrong for Deputy FitzGerald to suggest the Taoiseach did not know this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>I read every word of the evidence in the arms trial and I was involved in the Public Accounts Committee.  I must say that the evidence before us was of the existence of contingency plans for certain action to be taken in certain circumstances. That in itself is not conclusive evidence that the Taoiseach knew of particular activities of certain Ministers. However, the leader of Deputy Sherwin's party speaking in 1970, about two months after these events, stated that these matters did come to the knowledge of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet and, knowing what had happened, the Taoiseach and the Cabinet decided to take no action against these criminal illegal activities. As Mr. Boland said at the time, the decision was taken to take no action but that decision was reversed only when Deputy Cosgrave went to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach knew he would be exposed next morning for not having acted.  That is the record of this Government.</P>

      <P>I merely want to recite the reasons this party find it difficult to take from the Government a Bill of this kind at this time, a Government which not only did not act against the IRA but whose members knew of its activities and had knowledge of its financing and whose leader was prepared to sweep this matter under the carpet.  For such a Government to come here with this legislation naturally arouses suspicion on this side.  That is the position so far as we are concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the most convoluted argument I have ever heard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The people can decide if it is convoluted.  The people know the record of this Government. Yesterday the Taoiseach attempted to pretend the Government could not use the powers they have, but let us examine his argument in detail.  Deputy Cooney mentioned a number of sections in the Offences Against the State Act which could and should have been used but which were not used.  The Taoiseach replied selectively.</P>
      <P>Of the various sections mentioned by Deputy Cooney, the Taoiseach replied to certain ones but not to others.  From his silence I argue he could not reply to the others.  Making that speech&mdash;perhaps his last speech in this House before a general election &mdash;he would have disproved any point he could have refuted.  He remained silent on all but two points which I shall deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to section 6, he argued it would not have been possible to <Col N="448" /> prosecute people under that section because until Dáil Mhumhan, Dáil Uladh or Dáil Connacht purported to legislate it would not be possible to find the people concerned guilty.  I do not know enough about the law to state if this is so, but I know that when people set up bodies and call them a Dáil they are purporting to set up a legislature. There is a good <i>prima facie</i> case in such an instance.  I agree the court might decide that the people concerned had not committed an offence but it is not the job of the Executive to pick and choose in that way.  Where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case of a crime being committed by people seeking to destroy this State they should prosecute. The possibility is there that some prosecutions may fail but where people set up a body and call it Dáil Connacht.  Dáil Uladh or Dáil Mhumhan and where they purport to set up a legislature, there is a <i>prima facie</i> case against them.  The court may decide that unless there is actual legislation the charge will not stand but that is not the point I am making. The possibility was there of getting a large number of people involved in an illegal organisation and of putting them where they should be but the Government did not take that chance. The Taoiseach's defence on this point is inadequate.  If he had told us that they prosecuted but that the prosecution had failed I would accept that, but when he did not attempt to prosecute he has no defence.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to section 52, dealing with the question of requiring people to account for their movements. He told us this could not be used any longer because of the Commission on Human Rights.  I do not know enough about the law to say that as things stand at the moment the Council of Europe would override that.  If the Council of Europe override that provision I do not see how they can permit section 2 of this Bill but I reserve judgment until I hear more of the details.  This Government have the power which they used before to derogate from our obligations under the Commission on Human Rights where there is a state of emergency <Col N="449" /> sufficient to require it.  The Government gave notice of their intention to derogate a year ago and they claimed there was a plot of some kind against the State by a small group.  They gave notice of their intention to derogate when they had a rumour or a report that some action would be taken to kidnap or assassinate people which, in fact, never came to anything.</P>
    <P>If they were prepared to derogate in that case and in the earlier case back in 1960&mdash;and derogate successfully because, in fact, the Gerry Lawless case was taken and we won that case&mdash;I should like to know why have the Government kept one hand tied behind their back in the face of what they describe as a national emergency.  Why have they not derogated from the Convention at this point to enable them to introduce section 52?</P>
    <P>Perhaps there is an answer to that, some technical answer which I do not know, but certainly for a Minister to introduce a Bill as this Minister introduced it and for the Taoiseach to intervene in the debate in the way he intervened and for neither of them to give us any explanation of this and leave the House in ignorance of the position is not to tackle this problem seriously, as they have failed throughout to tackle the problem of the IRA seriously.</P>
    <P>Those were the two sections of the Bill which the Taoiseach chose to comment on: those were his defences and in both cases the defences are inadequate.  Under section 6 they did not try to prosecute; they cannot tell this House that they failed; they can only say they thought they might fail, but that is not a defence.  In the second case, they did not derogate and have not told us why they could not derogate from the Convention of Human Rights on that particular issue.  On those two issues the Taoiseach had no defence and the grounds he gave for the inaction of the Government under those two sections were grounds that do not stand up on the evidence before us.</P>
    <P>But the Taoiseach did not mention the other sections to which Deputy Cooney referred or others to which he might have referred.  Why have the Government taken no action against military exercises, evolutions and manoeuvres, to use the words of a section <Col N="450" /> of the Bill.  I wonder why that was not mentioned because every week in this country now we have these parades of men with their berets and para-military uniforms marching in military formation, certainly engaged in military exercises, evolutions or manoeuvres, and doing it&mdash;and this is indeed a double event&mdash;within a half-mile of the Dáil last night.  What action has been taken against that?  None.  The Government have permitted and are still permitting a para-military group, or several para-military groups, to parade in a manner prohibited in the Offences against the State Act and have failed to take action against them.  Many hundreds of these people could have been arrested and charged under that section had the Government acted.  Why they have not acted, we do not know because the Government have failed to tell us.  The Minister in his opening speech failed to refer to it.  The Taoiseach, despite Deputy Cooney's challenge, failed to take up the challenge and answer it.  Is there a reason?  Perhaps there is, but we do not know: the country is not to be told, apparently, why this section is not being used.  I suspect the reason why we were not told is because there is no reason and the Taoiseach was silent because he was not able to answer Deputy Cooney.</P>
    <P>There are other sections of this Act which could have been used and have not been used.  What about the section on seditious documents, section 10, in which seditious documents are defined in a manner which covers quite a number of publications on behalf of these bodies?  Section 10 (1) makes provision enabling a prosecution to take place of those who publish documents which allege, imply or suggest that the Government are not the lawful Government or that any other body is entitled to be recognised as the Government, or document which imply or suggest that the military forces of the State are not the lawful military forces of the State under the Constitution or that some other body is entitled to be recognised as a military force.  We know perfectly well that there are publications of several illegal organisations appearing regularly which imply or suggest these things.  When have they been prosecuted for section?  Never, under this Government. <Col N="451" /> The Government have never had the courage to prosecute them; they still have not; they are still permitting these seditious documents to circulate and have taken no action against their authors or those who publish or print them.</P>
    <P>Again, there is provision under the Offences against the State Act with regard to public meetings of a seditious character.  Section 27 (1) says that in the case of a public meeting held or purporting to be held by or on behalf of, or by arrangement with, or in concert with an unlawful organisation, or held or purporting to be held for the purpose of supporting, aiding, abetting or encouraging an unlawful organisation or advocating support for an unlawful organisation, those who organise it commit an offence and are liable to three months sentence and a fine of £50.</P>
    <P>How many people have been prosecuted for holding such meetings?  I cannot recall a prosecution; perhaps there have been some cases and that I am in error.  Perhaps the Minister in replying can mention them in his opening speech he did not mention them and I am not aware of such prosecutions taking place.  I am aware of a couple of prosecutions under the heading of incitement but very few indeed.  The fact is that day after day and week after week in this State meetings are held&mdash;one was held within hearing distance of this House last night at which people were advocating support for unlawful organisations&mdash;but no prosecutions have taken place against those who organise these meetings.  Why?  We are entitled to be told&mdash;before anybody comes to this House&mdash;especially a Government with the tarnished record of this one of involvement in IRA activities&mdash;looking for legislation, why they have not used the existing legislation fully.  We have not been told that.</P>
    <P>Why is there silence in the Government about section 19, the section that enables organisations to be declared illegal?  Why has Saor Éire not been declared illegal?  Here is a body posing such a threat to the State we are told, on this occasion when <Col N="452" /> internment was threatened that it was necessary to notify an intention to derogate from the Human Rights Convention of the Council of Europe in order to deal with this dangerous body.  But it has not been declared illegal and whatever Saor Éire is, it is not a branch of the IRA.  I suppose one or other parts of the IRA can claim to be descended in some kind of apostolic succession from the original body&mdash;although from what I have read of the IRA in that excellent textbook on the subject by Professor Bowyer Bell, that apostolic succession was broken once or twice and I am afraid that if it had to be ruled on by the Vatican it would not stand up.  Nonetheless, I suppose one or other body might claim to be lineal descendant of the original IRA and to be entitled to the name but they cannot both be entitled to it. Indeed, there is a very curious position in the courts at the moment because neither body is prepared to contest this particular issue.  If you do not recognise the courts you cannot, of course, claim before the courts to be one of these bodies or not to be one of them.</P>
    <P>Saor Éire is not the IRA, yet it is a body which according to the Government threatened the security of this State more seriously apparently than the IRA and yet they are not an illegal organisation under section 19.  Why have they not been declared an illegal organisation?  Surely we are entitled to be told that before legislation of this kind is brought into this House.  These are the kinds of cases and inaction which make us properly suspicious.  Clearly, a Government who could have acted in so many ways against illegal organisations and who have failed to do so and are still failing to do so are a Government whose motives in bringing in further repressive legislation must be suspect.  The motive which seems most evident in the circumstances is that the Government have now decided to take action and in order to justify past inaction they are suggesting to the country that they did not have sufficient power before and that was why they did nothing.  They are suggesting that if they are given the <Col N="453" /> powers now they can act.  In that way they hope to secure an alibi for past inaction.</P>
    <P>The Government will not get that alibi from this side of the House.  We are not going to concede powers which are of themselves undesirable in order to cover up the failure of Fianna Fáil to act against the IRA. We will not do that and if we were to do so we would be failing in our duty to the country.  That is why we are opposing this legislation.  Were we to accept it as necessary when it is not necessary and to go along in conspiracy with the Government suggesting to the country that this legislation is necessary when present powers have not been used, we would be giving the Government an alibi for past inaction and we would also be conspiring with them to hide the truth of their past failure and the fact that some of this legislation is not necessary and is inherently objectionable.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tried to bolster up his weak case by selected quotations.  He chose to quote me.  I would like to read the whole of the quotation and not just the last sentence which he read. I would like to quote from column 3458, volume 255, of the Official Report for 5th August, 1971.  The Taoiseach quoted the last sentence and purported to quote it with a view to suggesting that I advocated internment and other changes in the law and was, therefore, being inconsistent in now opposing this Bill.  The House will have no difficulty in seeing how selective the Taoiseach was.  I said:</P>
    <P>Internment can only arise if the problem is on such a scale that civil war is threatened and society as a whole is threatened and when all other methods have failed.  This Government have discredited themselves by threatening to resort to internment at a stage when they have not begun to use the normal processes of law and they perhaps have made it more difficult for them to proceed according to the proper process.  Let us not hear any more of internment until and unless other methods have failed and this Government can come to this House and say: &ldquo;We went through <Col N="454" /> trial by jury; witnesses were intimidated; juries were intimidated and we had to introduce special criminal courts.  We did that; we charged people, but the scale of the problem is such that we are now threatened with civil war and the only solution is internment&rdquo;, the Government will get from this party support in that action&mdash;then and only then;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach had started his quotation just above that point.  He left out what went before.  He was seeking to suggest that what I said was the opposite to what I had said.  I went on to say:</P>
    <P>...but it will get that support when necessary because this party has always stood by any Government, no matter how much it is opposed to it, which, acting properly and with due process seeks to protect the liberties and lives of our people and the society in which we live.</P>
    <P>And that all stands, but this Government are not acting properly and with due process.  The due process in matters of this kind is to enforce the existing law to the hilt and to use every section of the existing Act and then, if that fails and if convictions are not being secured under section 6 about Dáil Uladh and the like, and under section 10 about seditious documents and under section 19 about military exercises and manoeuvres, and under another section about public meetings, when they have done these things and failed, then they can look for what additional powers are necessary and we will give them the necessary powers, no more than the necessary powers but all the powers that are shown to be necessary. I went on to say that we would not rule out and I certainly do not rule out that in a situation where we faced a civil war internment might be necessary.  That is the ultimate resort.  Internment can only be justified in the last resort when we face that kind of situation.  This party would support the Government in that type of situation.  We will only support the Government when they have used the existing processes fully and when they show that they have failed and when we face a situation which can <Col N="455" /> be mastered by no other means than those extreme means.  In those circumstances the Opposition, which is a loyal Opposition, would support the Government.</P>
    <P>If the Government try to cover up their own mistakes and inaction and complicity in so much that went on in the past years we should expose them.  If they try to bring in legislation of this kind without prior consultation with us involving measures of a character going beyond what is necessary and do it as a political manoeuvre, or as it now seems, a pre-election manoeuvre, they will not get our support. We would be failing in our duty if we gave them our support.  That is our position.  Let it be clear to the country and to the Government where we stand in this matter.</P>
    <P>I would like to raise the question of why this legislation is being brought in at this stage.  How many months have elapsed since the Minister first noticed these lacunae in our legislation? It is many months now since he told the House that the existing legislation was inadequate and that he was looking into the question of improving it.  This is not a long or complex Bill. It is a very bad Bill but it is a Bill which cannot have taken all that long to draft.  Even allowing for the due process in some of our Government Departments, which is remarkably slow, it could not have taken more than a couple of weeks to draft it in its present form.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tried to explain this and then he suddenly backtracked.  He tried to tell the House that the situation had suddenly become very serious with the bomb in the cinema and the guns in the Mater.  Then the Taoiseach realised that there had been even more serious developments in other parts of the country, and said that 600 lives had been lost in Northern Ireland.  He was trying to suggest that there was a new situation now and that we needed a new Bill to deal with it.  The Taoiseach suddenly realised that the situation is not new to Ireland and the Irish people, although it may be new to Dublin.  The people in the North have suffered intensely from the consequences <Col N="456" /> of the Provisional IRA campaign in Northern Ireland and the counter-reaction to that by the British Army and more recently by the UDA. As a result of that guns were bought with money which came out of public funds, through the complicity of Ministers, and with the knowledge of Ministers, Ministers who did not tell the Taoiseach anything about it, as the Public Accounts Committee have said. As a result of that guns were bought in the winter of 1969-70 which were capable of being used and were used in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Deputy Burke is well aware of where we stand on the question as to whether this House is to be ruled from here or from the streets and, if he had been here earlier and heard my opening remarks, he would know that.  We were told that this legislation was necessary months ago, but it did not come before us.  Why did it not come before us?  It cannot be said that it is because the situation has suddenly become serious because the Taoiseach himself was forced to admit, when he thought about it for a minute, that, of course, the situation has been tragically serious in a certain part of this country for a long time past and the mere fact that some activities are spreading down here now does not change that.  It aggravates the situation, but it does not change the fact that we had a duty to take action to save lives in Ireland and we did not take it. The Government did not introduce this legislation at the time it announced the need for it.  It kept putting it off.  Why? Why did they postpone it until now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>And that is my feeling, too, having read the Bill.  The amount of drafting that went into it was not very much considering there are so many inadequacies in it, but obviously it is the kind of thing one would have to sit down and think about for a couple of weeks before putting it into final shape.  A couple of weeks should have sufficed and not the very many months that have elapsed since we were first told that the law needed to be changed.  I cannot envisage what kind of legal research or drastic legal mechanism could take so many months. <Col N="458" /> Quite clearly, the decision to postpone the introduction of the Bill until now was a political decision of this Government for political reasons and to shuffle the blame off on to their Civil Service advisers, suggesting that they were so incompetent they could not do the job unless they were given a year or so in which to do it.  That, of course, is both dishonest and disreputable of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill could have been introduced, had the Government wished to introduce it, many months ago, if, in fact, they felt, as the Minister stated, the law was inadequate.  But they did not introduce it until now.  Why?  My belief, and I have some grounds for this as a result of what I have read and heard of published Government statements and what I know of things said less publicly, that what, in fact, has happened is that this Government have adopted a policy over the past year totally contrary to the policy advocated by this party&mdash;a wrong policy, I think&mdash;of postponing action on the IRA and action on constitutional reform right up to the brink of what they hope may be, and we all hope will be, a conclusive and favourable negotiation leading to a peaceful settlement of the problem in Northern Ireland.  Our belief, on this side of the House, was that the way to approach this matter was for this part of this country to take its courage in its hands at the earliest possible moment and tackle the IRA in the course of 1971&mdash; it should actually have been done long before that&mdash;and introduce the necessary constitutional changes so that we could move towards this negotiation in a strong moral position, able to say to the British Government, the British people and the Protestant population in the North, that we have done our part; we have dealt with the IRA in good conscience; we have done all that we can, and effectively, and we have made various changes in our constitutional laws to show that we are anxious only to work towards the kind of Ireland in which all could share equally and we ask you now to sit down and talk over these problems with us.  That is the approach we advocated.  It was the right approach and the only approach that one lot of Irishmen could honestly <Col N="459" /> adopt towards another lot of Irishmen. But that is not what this Government did.  They saw themselves in a grand diplomatic battle with the British Government, culminating in some great negotiation from which the Taoiseach would come triumphantly back, doing a 1938, only twice as good, and, for that purpose, they wanted therefore not to build up good will so that there would be a possibility of agreement between North and South, but to hold back from dealing with the IRA and constitutional reform so that they could use these as a bargaining weapon in the final negotiation, not with the other people in Northern Ireland but with the British Government.</P>
    <P>That is not, in our view, the way this matter should be handled.  The Government have postponed legislation until now so that they could produce a good bargaining card in the negotiations with the British Prime Minister.  If there is another explanation for this delay, let us hear it because, in the absence of it, and in the presence of a good deal of evidence to support my conclusion, I believe that is what lies behind the timing of this legislation now.</P>
    <P>There may also be electoral considerations. The Government may have decided for their own reasons to go to the country on an issue on which it is thought they might do well.  That may be present also but, so far as the Northern Ireland situation is concerned, their thinking was, I am sure, along the lines I suggest and I regard that as criminally irresponsible and as showing a total disregard of the interests of Irish people working together, a megalomaniac power politics orientation which will do nothing to resolve these problems peacefully.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Taoiseach said that Mr. Mac Stiofáin was convicted only because of the tape.  He was trying to suggest&mdash;Deputy Cooney adduced the conviction of Mr. Mac Stiofáin as evidence that the law worked&mdash;that this was pure chance in this case.  It is an interesting point.  When he said it I reflected on the curious irony of the situation, <Col N="460" /> a situation in which the Government are apparently so inept in dealing with this body and the leaders of it that they could not get any evidence until Radio Telefís Éireann conveniently obliged and produced a tape that enabled the court to convict.  In the ordinary way, when one gets a help like that in convicting a criminal, one gets a handshake and, if he is a big criminal, one may even get a reward. What reward did Radio Telefís Éireann get?  Dismissal was the result.  The curious irony of this! If, in fact, the only way in which Mr. Mac Stiofáin could be convicted was a Radio Éreann interview, why did the Government dismiss the authority for having such an interview?  I find this very hard indeed to understand and, if I were a member of the Radio Telefís Éireann Authority, I would feel there was a certain ingratitude on the part of the Government in the circumstances.  I mention that by way of an aside because I was struck forcibly by the oddity of the Taoiseach's comments and the fact that he himself failed to appreciate the irony of it.  His unconsciousness of that told us, I think, a good deal about the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>If the Government really thought this legislation was necessary, if they were seeking the national interest and not party political advantage, they would, of course, have come to the Opposition about this legislation. National security is at stake and there is a need to modify the law.  I accept that certain parts of this Bill may be useful amendments to the present law. Certainly we are not opposed to every aspect of the Bill.  There are some parts of it which could be quite useful. Unfortunately, together with those, totally objectionable sections have been put in.  Had the Government come to the Opposition, as any Government concerned with the national interest would have done, and said: &ldquo;Look, we have got problems here.  There are certain cases where the law is not working and we would like to sit down with you&mdash;we will bring our legal advisers along to explain the points so you will see we are not just making a political advantage&mdash; and consult with you as to how we <Col N="461" /> can best deal with this&rdquo;, does the Taoiseach think he would not have got the co-operation of the Opposition? Does he think we are so lacking in patriotism that we would not co-operate?  Of course, if he had come to us along those lines, we would have discussed the matter with him.  We would have pointed out that some of the provisions were unacceptable to us and we would have suggested amendments and changes and, if the Government were reasonable and seeking to govern the country properly, if they had the national interest at stake, they would have listened to and accepted our amendments and agreed legislation could have been introduced; but they brought in a Bill containing provisions so designed as to be certain to evoke the opposition of any Opposition party concerned to do their duty by the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us stick to the subject.  The Taoiseach went on to say, in defending his case, that they went through everything, meaning every part of the existing law, with a view to using it.  I pointed out that there are half a dozen sections of the Offences against the State Act which have not been used, or which have been used on only one or two occasions. For him to say they went through everything was simply not true.  He went on to say that the courts are not effective.  He even went on to say that the special criminal courts are not effective. These are direct quotations from the speech of the Taoiseach.  I wrote them down as he said them.</P>
      <P>I do not understand what the Government mean by effective courts. The figures issued by the Government recently show that in 75 per cent of the cases the special criminal courts have convicted.  What kind of conviction rate is necessary to show that the courts are effective?  Must it be 100 per cent?  Are the courts to become the creatures of the Executive, convicting every man before them regardless of his innocence or his guilt? Indeed, that is the purpose of section 3 (2) of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently the Government's attitude now is that, having failed to deal with the IRA until now, and having allowed this menace to grow, some of their supporters and members having helped to finance and assist it, the courts must become totally subservient and, unless they convict in 100 per cent of cases, the law will be changed and bent to achieve that result.  We do not accept that.  The courts are independent.  We support and, indeed, called for the setting up of the special criminal courts.  I called for that in a speech in August, 1971.  We felt they were necessary because of intimidation.  A frequent feature in this country has been the intimidation of witnesses and jurors. We have suffered from this for a very long time because of this organisation and the way they attempted to corrupt the body politic by violence <Col N="463" /> and intimidation.</P>
    <P>We called for them and those courts were set up.  They have been effective.  I regard a 75 per cent conviction rate as about as high as you will get without instances of injustice. It is inevitable that in any system of law some cases brought forward are defective as regards evidence. In some cases the accused is either innocent or there is some technicality on which he can get off. You are bound to get a certain failure rate.  A 75 per cent success rate is very high.  For the Taoiseach to insult the members of the special criminal courts by suggesting that they are not effective, because they are not being subservient to the Executive in convicting in every case, is something no Prime Minister has the right to do with respect to the judiciary.</P>
    <P>This party are willing at any time to give all necessary assistance to the Government in dealing with the menace of the IRA.  An attempt by the Government to suggest that that is not our position, an attempt to suggest that Fine Gael are soft on the IRA, will not arouse much reaction amongst the public.  It will arouse the amused contempt of the public.  The public know that we have been consistent. They know how over the past four years people like Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy O'Higgins, Deputy Cooney, Senator John Kelly and others, myself amongst them, have consistently called for action against the IRA and condemned Government inaction.</P>
    <P>The public also know the people who are in the Government, and they know their involvement.  They are aware of the Report of the Public Accounts Committee.  They know where the people on those benches up there came from.  They know in which party are the people who were not prepared to clap their leader when he was making strong speeches against the IRA.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the Bill itself.  Let us try to look at it rationally from the point of view that we are seeking to do two things.  We are seeking to strengthen the law where it is inadequate and is shown to be inadequate, and we are seeking to secure the innocent against the danger of being convicted.  Above all, that is the job of the Opposition.  We are trying to secure a system of legislation which will give the Government the powers necessary to deal with the IRA, and which will be seen not to be repressive in the sense of going beyond what is necessary.</P>
      <P>When the Government introduce legislation which goes beyond what is necessary, there are many people of liberal disposition who will be taken aback, and who will be put off, and whose support for the Government in dealing with the IRA may be weakened. Not all the people who have been demonstrating and protesting have sympathy with the IRA.  What the IRA want is an issue on which they can arouse sympathy from outside their own ranks.  We know how these revolutionaries work.  They try to broaden the area of their support by confusing the issue.  Where you get an Executive which is foolish and repressive in its attitudes then you get danger to the State.  Where you get an Executive which is prepared to confuse the issue of dealing with the IRA by sacking the RTE Authority, then you get danger because an extra issue is brought in to confuse the whole situation.</P>

Over the past couple of days a number of statements have been issued from Catholic priests associations and last night there were many industrial workers from my constituency and other parts of Dublin parading in protest against this legislation.

      <P>If the Deputy heard what I said, he would know I said the exact opposite.  Many protests have been aroused by this legislation and many by the sacking of the RTE Authority.  This is creating a situation in which the clear-cut issue of facing the IRA is being confused.  This is always the danger of repressive legislation. It gives a handle to the revolutionaries to excite sympathy and support. There is bound to be something of that in the present situation.  There are bound to be some people with soft hearts and soft heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Allow me to conclude my sentence before you interrupt. People with soft hearts and soft heads will go around demanding that Mr. Mac Stiofáin be released.  There are bound to be such people.  Indeed, this country has suffered for a long time from the menace of local authorities passing resolutions on such matters which are not within their competence and which can confuse the whole situation. On that issue the Taoiseach spoke for the vast majority in the House and in the country when two days ago he explained why it was not possible to release such a man without undermining the whole system of law and that, if any man could get himself released by going on hunger strike, law and order would break down completely. Those of us on this side of the House are totally in agreement with the Taoiseach's statement on that.  Nothing that may be said from outside will shake that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there are people who allow their human sympathy to overrun their judgment in such a matter. We can understand that, but it is our job in this House to withstand such pressures, to stand by the Government on an issue of that kind, and we do so. Unfortunately, the Government have confused the issue by sacking the RTE Authority and by the consequent effects of that in regard to Mr. Kevin O'Kelly. They have confused the issue by introducing a Bill with repressive elements against which we have to protest and which we must seek to erode and <Col N="466" /> eliminate.  It is unwise and dangerous to confuse this issue.  The Government have failed in their responsibilities by so doing.</P>
    <P>We have a complicated problem, and it is not easy for us to try to tread our way through this impasse.  We have to make it clear that we stand against the dismissal of the RTE Authority because they were put into an impossible position by the refusal of the Minister to clarify his directive. We have to make it clear that we stand by the action of the courts in enforcing the law in the case of Kevin O'Kelly, although many of us may feel individually that the sentence was too harsh and hope that on appeal it will be reduced.  By the way, if I expressed that sentiment elsewhere than in this House after this Bill is passed, it would render me liable to a jail sentence, which is one reason for amending section 4.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of this Bill which are dangerous and which should be eliminated.  We feel the Government were quite right in their decision not to release Mr. Mac Stiofáin and that they are quite right to enforce the law that exists at the moment against the IRA, as they are now beginning to do, though still in a half-hearted manner. We have to get across that complicated position because so many issues have been raised and it is not in the interests of the country that the matter should have been complicated.  It would have been far better if the Government had sought the co-operation of the Opposition and enabled us to stand firm on this issue and if the Government had not confused the issue by dismissing the RTE Authority and if the Government had brought in legislation to which this House could have agreed. The Government have chosen not to do it that way.  They have chosen to divide the country at a time when the country should have been united on these issues and that is something that will be held against them in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Looking now directly at the Bill, let us be clear about it, as all speakers have said, parts of the Bill are totally objectionable, parts of the Bill need <Col N="467" /> amendment, parts of the Bill are acceptable.  Each of us can make his own judgment on that.  There may be minor variations on that in regard to particular points.  There are certain features of the Bill which to us are totally objectionable.  Let me spell them out.  It is important I should. There should be no confusion about this.  We are opposing this Bill on Second Stage because it contains some things so objectionable that to leave them to Committee Stage and approve the Bill in principle would be open to the misconstruction that we are willing to concede matters which involve infringement of the liberties of the individual which are unnecessary and dangerous.  We want to make that clear.  We do not want to be put in the position of having it suggested that we are opposed totally to some sections of the Bill which seem to be useful amendments of the law or do not recognise the need for certain other changes although we may disagree with the wording.  Let us, therefore, isolate those problems which to us are crucial.</P>

      <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you know that that is true and that the amendment originally referred to sections 3 and 4.  That was changed because that would have prevented us from having Committee Stage amendments.  You know also, Sir, that the amendment, as originally drafted, included as a final clause a statement requiring a time limit to be put on the Bill and that once again the inclusion of that, had we left it there, would have precluded a Committee Stage debate.  It had to be deleted before the Bill came to the House, on the advice given to us by the officials of the House.  These are the facts.  You know them.  The officials know them.  We know them. Those people over there will not confuse the issue by suggesting that that is not true.</P>

      <P>These are the issues for us: there is a problem in section 3 subsection (2), a problem in section 4 and the problem of absence of a time limit.  These are the three points we put down in our amendment and the three points that we want to put to the House at this stage.</P>
      <P>First, subsection (2) of section 3, in its present form, for reasons stated and which I cannot repeat because I do not want to delay the House, is objectionable.  It is objectionable because, in fact, it puts the onus of proof&mdash;contrary to what the Taoiseach said&mdash;here he is wrong&mdash;he did not develop his suggestion that the onus of proof was not shifted because he could not develop it&mdash;the onus of proof is shifted to the individual concerned. He is put in the position where, unless he can persuade the court of the negative proposition that he is not a member of an illegal organisation he can on the word of the chief superintendent be sent to prison. We cannot accept that.  The individual concerned must as a minimum be given an absolute right to rebut the view of the chief superintendent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a provision which is already in the Offences against the State Act.  In section 26 of that Act that is precisely what is done.  What we require is that the wording of section 26 be applied here in this section.  Section 26 reads:</P>
      <P>Where in any criminal proceedings the question whether a particular treasonable document, seditious document, or incriminating document was or was not published by the accused (whether by himself or in concert with other persons or by arrangement between himself and other persons) is in issue and an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is where it came from</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;states on oath that he believes that such document was published (as the case may be) by the accused or by the accused in concert with other persons or by arrangement between the accused and other persons, such statement shall be evidence (until the accused denies on oath that he published such document either himself or in concert or by arrangement as aforesaid) that the accused published such document as alleged in the said statement on oath of such officer.</P>
      <P>These words are in section 26.  I noted with interest when the Taoiseach was speaking that he gave as precedent for section 3 (2) this section 26 and said that the words were identical but the words are not identical.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The words are not identical because in this section 26 there is an absolute right of rebuttal. If the accused does give evidence, then the chief superintendent's evidence is null and void; it ceases to exist.  That is the position.  That was omitted in this legislation in section 3 (2) and in omitting it the Government have turned something that in extreme circumstances could be <Col N="470" /> accepted to defend the State into something totally unacceptable.  We are not prepared to accept that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, the failure to include these words or similar words to similar effect giving the accused person absolute right to rebut on oath such accusations, and by so doing to eliminate the evidence of the chief superintendent, makes this totally objectionable to us on this side of the House.  I want to make that perfectly clear.  Let there be no doubt about it.</P>
      <P>We note with interest, first that the Government in presenting this legislation deliberately omitted these protecting words and, secondly, the Taoiseach tried to mislead the House into believing that, in fact, this section was based on and similar to section 26, when, in fact, he knew it had been changed in this manner in this Bill to the disadvantage and prejudice of the accused person.  That is the first point, which is one which is totally unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The second point is: in section 4 there are provisions which prejudice innocent people.  Section 4 is drafted in an extraordinarily wide way.  The suggestion in the Minister's opening statement that it did no more than turn into statutory form the law of contempt was, to say the least, contemptible. Let us pick out the relevant words and see what is meant.  The section says:</P>
      <P>A statement, meeting, procession or demonstration shall be deemed to constitute an interference with the course of justice if it is intended, or is of such a character as to be likely, directly or indirectly to influence any court, person or authority concerned with the institution, conduct or defence of any civil or criminal proceedings (including a party or witness) as to whether or how the proceedings should be instituted, conducted, continued or defended, or as to what should be their outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> (2)  A person who makes any statement, or who organises, holds or takes part in any meeting, procession or demonstration, that is unlawful under this section shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to pretend, of course, that there is no problem there because, unless the person was guilty of an offence and intended to be guilty of an offence he could not be caught under that.  We are not going to be taken in by that argument.  The provision here is one where people who take part in a meeting put themselves at risk because if at that meeting anybody makes a statement, makes any reference to illegal proceedings, the person by attending that meeting is at risk and the onus of proof is then on him that he did not, in fact, intend by participating to support that attempt to interfere with justice.</P>
    <P>Let us see how far this can go. There are advice columns in newspapers. There are even TDs who give advice occasionally.  Occasionally, there may be programmes on television when people are asked their opinion and where people, lawyers or otherwise, say: &ldquo;I think you have a case&rdquo; in relation to a particular matter. That statement: &ldquo;I think you have a case&rdquo; could come under this section here.  This is, as it stands, dangerous to freedom of speech for that reason and dangerous to any individual who attends a meeting where such matters are discussed or where anybody is likely to make any comment on any public case.  That is obviously too wide.  No Opposition anywhere in the world could accept legislation of that kind unless it were to fail totally in its duty.  As far as we are concerned that must be cut down to size.  If there is a reason, which we have not heard, why it is necessary to turn the law of contempt into statutory form, then let us do it in a manner which confines this to cases where there is genuine contempt.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an area of discretion and if it is necessary to make provision for borderline cases, let us leave that to the court and to the <Col N="472" /> law of contempt and let us confine the statute law to those things that are intended clearly to be interference with the course of justice.  So far as we are concerned, unless there is a willingness to narrow that down so that the innocent are protected and so that only those who are clearly guilty of trying to interfere with the course of justice are contemplated by it, we have no alternative but to reject the Bill.</P>
    <P>The third point that is crucial as far as we are concerned is the question of a time limit.  After all, the Offences Against the State Act has been on the Statute Book for the past 33 years.  A state of emergency was declared during the war and it is still in existence.  There has been too much legislation that has been expressed to be needed for a temporary situation but which became permanent and remains a permanent threat to the lives and liberties of the people. We cannot accept that the Bill, even modified in the way we suggest, as it would need to be before this side of the House would have anything to do with it, should be brought in in permanent form.  We know there is a crisis now and we wish to help the Government by all reasonable means to deal with it.  We will not be found wanting in that regard if the Government meet us but we are not prepared to give powers to the Government that would continue long after the crisis ended.  A time limit on this Bill of a period of one year is essential.  Those, then, are the essential elements.  They are the points that we wish to get at and which were in our original amendment before it had to be modified to comply with the rules of order of this House.  Unless the Government meet us in regard to section 3, subsection (2), section 4 and the time limit, we shall vote against them, both in relation to our amendment and to the substance of the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I shall deal with the points made last by Deputy FitzGerald because it is in this area that the greatest amount of misconception has arisen.  The Deputy, quite dishonestly in my view, and not in proper legal fashion has added fuel to these misconceptions regarding interpretation of the Bill.  Sections 1 and 2 and subsection (1) of section 3 are merely extensions, amendments or improvements of the existing Offences Against the State Act.  The first point on which Deputy FitzGerald made a dishonest legal argument relates to subsection (2) of section 3.  This is a subsection that has given rise to very great misconceptions. Let me make it clear that under this subsection there is no question of a chief superintendent swearing a man into jail, to use Deputy Fitz-Gerald's emotive phrase and there is no question of the onus of proof being shifted.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy, who knows very little about law, would allow me to continue.  The procedure in our country under the common law system has always been that the evaluation of the weight to be attached to any evidence in proceedings before the court is a matter for the court.  To suggest that evidence is always proof or that the existence of admissible evidence shifts the onus of proof is an astonishing proposition but under this subsection the basic common law procedure with regard to evidence and the evaluation of evidence remains. An officer of the Garda Síochána who is not below the rank of chief superintendent can give evidence stating that he believes that the accused was, at a material time, a member of an unlawful organisation and this statement shall be evidence that he was then such a member.  It can be admitted as evidence but there is no question of that evidence in itself putting a man into jail or of shifting the onus of proof&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Our courts operate under the principle that before an accused person can be found guilty he must be proved guilty of the offence beyond all reasonable doubt.  There is nothing of a conclusive nature as has been suggested here and elsewhere in regard to the subsection.  If the accused goes into the witness box and says he <Col N="475" /> is not a member of an illegal organisation, the onus is on the chief superintendent, there and then, to prove his case.</P>
      <P>Under that system of the administration of law it is clear that once an accused man goes into the witness box and says he is not a member of an illegal organisation, the onus of proof shifts to the chief superintendent.</P>

The Deputy did not refer to the basic fact that subsection (2) is subject to the section as a whole which deals with meetings, processions or demonstrations which interfere with the course of justice and which may directly or indirectly influence any court.  That section read as a whole and without taking any excerpts from it is a statutory duplication of the existing law of contempt of court that we have had for hundreds of years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They were the two main points raised by Deputy FitzGerald on the legal aspect apart from the aspect relating to the time limit. There are arguments for and against here but the real heart of the matter is the criticism of those two sections&mdash;in particular the criticism of subsection (2) of section 3&mdash;which in my view is largely dishonest and erroneous in law. The very fact of criticising that subsection as it stands is a direct reflection on the courts here which will always operate the laws of evidence, operate the common law procedures in regard to the onus of proof, in regard to proof beyond all reasonable doubt, in regard to assessing evidence and only convicting a person when the court is satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt.  These are the basic matters in our system of criminal law.  They are not affected whatever by that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal now with some of the wider aspects, on the political level, raised by Deputy FitzGerald.  I thought candidly that his speech was hysterical, convoluted and dishonest. Hysterical, probably by reason of affairs within his own party at present, that is understandable, but there is no point in standing up in this House and debating this matter as if it were a Fianna Fáil matter.  It is not a Fianna Fáil matter.  Much of the content <Col N="477" /> of his speech was devoted to an attack on the Fianna Fáil Party and on various things that have happened in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Those matters are irrelevant today.  In the context of debating this Bill the issue is one of Government and of parliament and representative democracy.</P>

      <P>This sort of anti-Fianna Fáil speech does not help.  I will go through to the heart of the principle that is involved in both what Deputy Cooney said yesterday and what Deputy FitzGerald said today in regard to the alleged inoperation of various sections of the Offences against the State Act.  There were various allegations that the Government did not pursue this or that aspect of illegal organisations' activities in a proper way.</P>
      <P>Fundamentally what Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Cooney are doing is attacking the independent law officers and the senior officers of the Garda Síochána.  They are not attacking Fianna Fáil; they are attacking the permanent law officers of this State and the permanent senior officers of the Garda Síochána and accusing them of not administering the law in certain circumstances.</P>

Deputy FitzGerald cannot have it both ways and Deputy Cooney cannot have it both ways.  It is a fact that we have brought in this legislation on the advice of the senior police officers of the State and on the advice of the law officers of the State who have advised us that some of the existing sections of the Offences Against the State Act and some aspects of the general law of this land are not effective enough to enable us to deal properly with unlawful organisations as it is suggested we should deal with them and has been suggested we should deal with them by Deputy FitzGerald, by Deputy Cooney and by Deputy O'Brien for the past year.</P>

      <P>This particular amendment of the Offences Against the State Act has been introduced by the Government in order to deal with a situation where we were advised by our law officers and by the senior officers of the national police authority that the law as it stood was not effective enough in certain areas to deal <Col N="479" /> with a problem with which Deputies opposite have been asking us to deal for the last two years.</P>

      <P>The suggestion made by Deputy FitzGerald and by Deputy Cooney that in some way we should explain the specific deficiencies in regard to sections of the Offences against the State Act and explain the deficiencies in the general law which led us to the introduction of this Bill is a highly irresponsible suggestion.  We have no intention of telling the enemies of this State where our existing law is deficient in dealing with them.</P>

      <P>But our law officers have examined these deficiencies, have taken the advice of the police officers of this State in regard to these deficiencies, in regard to the apprehension of the enemies of this State, and as a result of that advice this Bill emerges. That is the reason and the purpose of this Bill and that is the matter that really counts in this debate.  Are the people opposite in the Labour Party and in Fine Gael willing to face up to the responsibility of dealing with this, willing to face up to the logical consequence of what many of them have been saying?  There is no point in indulging in cant or hypocrisy and trying to run away from the situation which Deputies in the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party know well exist.  We in Fianna Fáil are not going to&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Government are facing up to the situation on the advice of their own law officers, on the advice of the <Col N="480" /> national police authority, through the senior officers of the Garda Síochána. We are taking the necessary statutory action to remedy deficiencies that exist in regard to the apprehension of what people opposite have called the enemies of this State.  When we seek to do something about it we meet hypocritical opposition, we meet double-talk and convoluted reasoning.  We intend to go ahead and make this law.</P>

      <P>As I have said before in regard to meetings with the British Prime Minister, it would not be in accordance with practice to reveal details of such discussions as their value depends largely on their confidential nature.</P>
      <P>Mr. Heath and I had a wide-ranging discussion on the situation in Northern Ireland including the British Government's Green Paper, the proposed plebiscite on the border, and the disturbing reports which I have been receiving about recent experiences of the Northern minority in certain areas. I conveyed the Government's views on these and other related matters, and suggested how political progress might be made in the months ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>While my Department has received reports from time to time in relation to forged prescriptions for drugs of abuse, particularly from the Garda Drug Squad and the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, I am not in a position to indicate precisely the number of such instances.  Generally, however, forged prescriptions have not been a serious problem.</P>
      <P>Early in 1970 reports were received that a number of such prescriptions had been presented for dispensing in the Dublin area and in April, 1970, my Department issued a special notice through the Pharmaceutical Society to all retail pharmacists in the Dublin area alerting them to the position and suggesting the steps which might be taken where prescriptions were suspected of being forged.  Doctors were alerted through <i>The Irish Medical Association Journal</i> to the danger of forged prescriptions and to the need for safeguarding stocks of headed notepaper and prescription pads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="486" /> Following recent reports of thefts of prescription pads and headed notepaper from hospitals, a circular was issued to health boards and hospital authorities urging the review of security arrangements and stressing the need to ensure that prescription pads and hospital notepaper are secure from theft.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has already approved of the preparation of comprehensive legislation for controlling the safety, quality and efficacy of medical preparations and I would expect to have a Bill before the House within the next year.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, the National Drugs Advisory Board operate a scheme for monitoring the safety of medical preparations on the market in this country. Furthermore, as an interim measure pending the enactment of the legislation, I propose to make regulations under the Health Acts providing for a scheme of inspection and licensing of pharmaceutical manufacturing plants. The National Drugs Advisory Board have appointed an inspector for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comhairle na Nimheanna which was established under the Poisons Act, <Col N="487" /> 1961, advises the Minister for Health, in relation to regulations under section 14 of the Act, for controlling the sale and distribution of poisons, including medicines.  I will be referring to the position regarding the proposed poisons regulations in my reply to a further question by the Deputies today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>The answers to (a) and (b) are 15th March, 1962 and 26th June, 1964, respectively.</P>
      <P>With regard to (c) the recommendations in question were intended to form the basis of comprehensive regulations in relation to the manufacture, storage, transport, sale and distribution of poisons, to be made under section 14 of the Poisons Act, 1961.  However, certain technical amendments of that Act were found to be necessary to enable the recommendations of the comhairle to be incorporated in the regulations.  Provision has been made for such amendments in the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1972.</P>
      <P>In the meantime draft regulations have been prepared and consultations have taken place with a large number of trade and other interested bodies on the terms of the draft regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The observations received from these bodies have been forwarded to Comhairle na Nimheanna and the comhairle is at present considering the <Col N="488" /> draft regulations in the light of these observations.</P>
    <P>Pending the making of regulations under the Poisons Act, 1961, a wide range of preparations have been brought under control under the Medical Preparations (Control of Sale) Regulations, 1966, made under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>These controls provide that the preparations in question may not be sold to the public by persons other than pharmaceutical chemists and other qualified persons.</P>

      <P>In pursuance of this policy a voluntary code of practice has been secured with the advertising and brewing interests.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I last discussed this matter with representatives of the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee on 28th October, 1971, as a result of which the cigarette manufacturers agreed that all packets of cigarettes produced by them for trade in this country would carry a Government health warning and that cigarette advertisements in newspapers and magazines and on posters would carry a reference to this health warning on the packets.  To allow the manufacturers a reasonable period for the exhaustion of existing packing materials and for the printing of new packets, this agreement was to be implemented progressively as from 1st May, 1972.</P>
      <P>All main brands covered by the agreement now carry the Government health warning and their advertisements in newspapers and magazines and on posters carry a reference to this warning.  I am informed that the remaining brands will carry the health warning on all packets issued after 31st December, 1972, and that their advertisements in newspapers and magazines and on posters will carry a reference to the health warning within a month after that date.</P>

      <P>Answering the Deputy's question on the basis that it relates to health services for the permanently disabled, I have not specifically had any investigations made into the nature and scale of such services available in the member countries of the European Economic Communities. Such health services as it is found necessary to provide for the permanently disabled are provided for appropriately in this country.  In this respect, <Col N="492" /> I should say that these services, in common with other health services, are reviewed regularly and such review naturally would take account of developments in other countries.</P>

      <P>We have made sufficient progress on a steady basis.  This is not an urgent matter but naturally it would be in our interests to examine the services that are available in the EEC in order to ensure that, as soon as possible, our standards will compare favourably with the standards obtaining in the EEC. As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Social Welfare proposes to bring measures before the House for changes in the national assistance schemes which will relate to disabled persons.  There have been changes in the social welfare code in relation to invalidity pensions and occupational injury pensions.  Grants for disabled persons provided by the health boards have been increased and in October, 1971, further help was given to certain categories of disadvantaged people and free drugs and free hospital services were given to those under 16 years.  We are making steady progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the Government have any plans for the introduction of a national income scheme for the disabled; and whether his Department have given any consideration to <Col N="493" /> drawing up a disabled persons' charter of rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Payments to the disabled are at present provided by way of social insurance benefits under the Social Welfare Acts or disabled persons maintenance allowances under the Health Acts.</P>
      <P>I might add the latter service is under review as part of the over-all examination of the social assistance services which my colleague the Minister for Social Welfare is carrying out at present.</P>
      <P>I am not at all clear as to what the Deputy has in mind in his reference to a charter of rights for the disabled. The disabled have the same rights as other people in the community and it has been an object of policy, as it is a prime objective of the disabled themselves, that they should fit in as far as possible into the normal life of the community in terms of work, social life, and in every other way. The achievement of this objective does of course involve special helps whether in the fields of health care, vocational guidance, training for employment having regard to the limitation imposed by the disability and help in placement.  The idea of a charter of rights related to the disabled conveys in its ordinary meaning a suggestion of setting the disabled apart from the general community. This approach is not considered to be in the best interests of the total welfare of the disabled and I am not aware of any demand of this kind from the disabled themselves.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister care to examine the charter of rights granted to disabled persons in Great Britain, which could scarcely be described as a backward country?

      <P>Even if the British Government have undertaken steps of this kind, I still think the best thing <Col N="494" /> to do is improve the services as we go along but not to separate any particular section of the community through providing them with a charter. I may be wrong, but I cannot see any point in it.  Modern policy in regard to this is that they should be integrated in the community as much as possible and not distinct.</P>

      <P>The Electricity Supply Board do not close parts of the Shannon waterway to navigation every time water is needed for electricity <Col N="495" /> generation.  The board in exercising its statutory powers in relation to the control of levels on the waterway take account of a number of factors, e.g. boating, flooding and the importance of the Shannon for tourism and recreational purposes.  I am informed by the ESB that the recent prohibition on navigation on the Shannon North of Athlone from 23rd October to 19th November was only the fifth such occasion in the forty-five years since the generating station at Ardnacrusha was built and was necessitated by the exceptionally dry weather since July. I understand that the extent of inconvenience to boating interests during this period was minimal due to the fact that the boating season was virtually at an end and boat hire operators were given advance notice which enabled those with bookings to transfer such boats as they required south of the prohibited area.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the implications of pollution for the tourism industry and I am informed by Bord Fáilte that they have raised regularly the question of pollution in the Shannon with the appropriate authorities. The board will continue to keep in close touch with the situation.  An inter-departmental working group appointed by the Minister for Local Government and on which my Department was represented recently submitted a report to him on water pollution, including the legislative aspect.  After the group's recommendations have been examined, the Minister for Local Government intends to bring forward such proposals for new legislation as may be necessary to deal with the situation.</P>

      <P>A fare arrangement of the kind in question would not be practicable.  It would not be possible to distinguish between emigrants in Britain, who are not required to hold passports, and non-emigrants.  Besides, there is already in existence an extensive range of excursion fares, special interest rates, group rates and other forms of incentive fares which effectively reduce travel costs on the cross-Channel air services.  In addition, the air companies have devised freeway and gateway packages aimed specifically at the ethnic market which have proved successful this year and which will be continued next year.  All of these fares are based on substantial concessions and compare well with the fare reductions referred to in the question.</P>

      <P>I cannot say when a drainage scheme for the River Lennon can commence. As I explained to the Dáil on a number of occasions, the question has been raised as to whether the economic and social returns from arterial drainage are sufficient to justify the heavy capital investment <Col N="501" /> necessary for the service.  With a view to reaching a conclusion thereupon, a full cost/benefit study of arterial drainage, as administered at present, has been put in hand.  This study is making good progress and it is hoped the result will be available next year.</P>
      <P>I might point out, however, that the River Lennon does not occupy a high place in the priority list of minor catchments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The amount of capital made available for arterial drainage has been reducing in effect and in order to find out whether I can persuade the Government to make a bigger allocation I must get the facts straight.

      <P>This is on the minor rivers list.  It is very low down on the priority list.  Special inspections were made in 1954 and 1962 and it was found that the river was torrential, flowing off a mountainous catchment area and that very extensive works would be needed to contain the high flood flows.  The cost of such works would probably be altogether above the basis on which we at present assess whether or not a river should be done.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>A survey carried out recently of the pupil potential of the Ballinadee school district revealed that, for the foreseeable future, the number of pupils in attendance at Ballinadee NS would not be sufficient to maintain the present staff of three teachers.  It has been decided, therefore, not to proceed with the proposal to build a new school at Ballinadee but, instead, to arrange for the amalgamation of Ballinadee NS with Ballinspittle NS when additional accommodation has been provided at the latter school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that according to my information 65 children are enrolled at Ballinadee school?  Is it not true that working drawings and specifications for the new school were completed in April, 1971, and that the manager was then asked to apply for planning permission to the county council?

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>The meeting on 21st November of the Agricultural Ministers of the present six member States and the three acceding States was devoted primarily to consideration of the transitional arrangements for dairy products and sugar.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached on the intervention prices to apply to butter and skim milk powder in the three acceding States as well as on the compensatory amounts to apply to trade in other dairy products such as cheese, whole milk powder, cream, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intervention prices agreed upon for Ireland from 1st February next are equivalent to about £710 per ton for butter and about £228 per ton for skim milk powder.  Taken together, these should ensure a return to our milk producers somewhat better than at present.  The compensatory amount on butter exports to Britain will be about £362 per ton but this will, of course, be phased out over the transitional period according as the intervention price in Britain is raised to the Community level.  The intervention price here for skim milk powder will be at the full Community level and our present support for liquid <Col N="509" /> skim milk will also be increased accordingly.</P>
    <P>The compensatory amounts for cheese, and other manufactured products will be based on that for butter. The compensatory amount on cream is determined separately and will be roughly the same as our present export support.</P>
    <P>The Community regulations on these dairy products matters will not be made until two remaining issues have been settled, namely, the arrangements for the purchase of salted butter under intervention and for imports of New Zealand butter and cheese into Britain.  Precise details of the prices, compensatory amounts <i>et cetera</i> will then be announced but my Department will be in contact with the industry about them in the meantime.</P>
    <P>As regards sugar, it was agreed that in our case the intervention price for white sugar and the minimum price for sugar beet should be at the full Community levels from 1st February. The corresponding prices in the UK have not yet been settled finally but they are likely to be somewhat lower and this would mean that an export subsidy from Community funds would be payable on our exports of sugar and sugar-containing goods to the UK during the transitional period.  Some remaining points on sugar that mainly concern the UK are to be taken up again at the next ministerial meeting.</P>
    <P>The Ministers also agreed that until 31st January frozen beef from outside the Community will be exempted from any levies that might technically become applicable to it following the recent reduction in import duty. Agreement was also reached on a few residual points in connection with the proposed new regulations on fruit and vegetables.  These proposed regulations had already been considered by the nine Ministers at Luxembourg on 31st October and were referred to in my reply to a question on 9th November.</P>
    <P>At the meeting on 21st November the Community also proposed new veterinary directives on trade in fresh <Col N="510" /> meat between member countries and on trade in live animals and fresh meat with third countries.  These included derogations for Ireland on the lines of the derogations from existing directives secured in the Accession Treaty.  The terms of the new directives are to be studied further.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister any information which could be helpful to Irish farmers in relation to the costs of increased production in the other countries in comparison with ours, having regard to the increase in the cost of fertilisers, rates, taxes and other expenses?  Have these risen in other countries of the Common Market to the same extent as here, and will the margin of profit of our farmers in the coming season, offset these increased costs?</P>

Is the Minister concerned with the fact that there is a monopoly in existence and being developed for the shipment of cattle?  Has his Department investigated the possibility of setting up their own shipping services to the Continent so that the prices will be reasonable and there will be guaranteed shipping available in view of the importance of our cattle exports in the EEC?</P>

      <P>I am not aware that the prices quoted by the Deputy are based on fact.  I have not heard of this export cost being imposed on cattle being exported.  If it were, I would wonder immediately how it was that the sellers of the cattle choose to carry this extra cost instead of selling their cattle profitably.  As the Deputy is aware, cattle prices have never been higher in the history of the State.  I am not aware either that there is anything approaching a monopolistic situation in the live cattle shipping business.  A great many people make their own arrangements for the export of cattle to specific ports abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have mentioned on a number of occasions in reply to similar requests, the designation of a particular area inevitably leads to considerable pressure for extension of the concession to other areas, thus leading to the danger of erosion of the grant differential applied to areas already designated; therefore, designation is an instrument which must be very sparingly used.  Only a couple of weeks ago I told the Deputy in reply to a question on the industrial situation in Waterford that projects under construction and under consideration by the Industrial Development Authority were estimated to provide over 800 jobs in the area.  I consider, in the circumstances, that the present levels provide adequate incentive to attract industry to Waterford and that it would not be appropriate to designate the area.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have introduced the Restrictive Practices (Amendment) Bill, 1972 in the Dáil.  The Bill will empower me to make orders providing for the prohibition of a proposed merger or take-over or, in the case of a monopoly, completed merger or take-over, for the division of any trade or business by a sale of assets or otherwise, where the arrangement results or is likely to result in unfair restriction of competition. There is nothing in the Bill which would be at variance with EEC requirements. I am considering a further Bill to provide for the control of mergers and take-overs by reference to considerations of importance other than competition.  Before such further legislation is introduced, it will be necessary to have consultation with the Commission of the European Communities to ensure that it is in conformity with this country's obligations to the Communities.</P>

There is no protection for people who sign up in this way, who have not read the contract and do not realise the consequences.  Does the Minister know that this firm is, in fact, one which was registered here but dissolved on 31st August, 1971, and reregistered on 17th October last, without any directors or shareholders being named and, in fact, the prime movers appear to be two Englishmen, without an address here, Messrs. Black and Holt, and would he agree that the public should be warned that this firm &ldquo;Holiday Magic (Ireland) Limited&rdquo; is one that everybody must be aware of in view of the fact that its activities, although not fraudulent from a purely legal point of view, involve depriving people of their money under false pretences?</P>

      <P>I should like to state the legal issues involved so far as I can interpret them from what Deputy FitzGerald said.  Section 3 (2) is the section against which Deputy FitzGerald took the greatest offence, as did Deputy Cooney.  I have studied this matter in the interval and it is quite clear that this is not shifting the onus of proof. It states quite clearly that the chief superintendent's evidence will be evidence, and no more than evidence. Evidence submitted in a court of law under the common law system is evidence that can be rebutted by other evidence.  It can be rebutted by the accused.  It can be the subject of cross-examination by the accused or his representatives, and it can be the subject of cross-examination by the court. Therefore, it is dishonest to suggest that the subsection in any way makes the chief superintendent's evidence conclusive.  The very reverse is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as we maintain the basic rules of common law procedures, which have been laid down over the centuries and still obtain, an accused man cannot be found guilty until the case against him is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.  The onus of proof does not shift to the accused man, does not in this case because once there is a rebuttal by him the onus will shift to the chief superintendent involved to show more than his belief because of the obligation on our courts to ensure that the accused can only be found guilty if the case is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.  So long as the basic principle of our courts is maintained that the accused can only be found guilty if the case is proved beyond all reasonable doubt, and the onus of proof is not shifted, and courts are always presided over by independent judges who will view the evidence <Col N="545" /> according to the principles I have just mentioned, in my view there is no legal breach of the traditional legal procedures involved in section 3 (2).</P>
    <P>I have checked on this since saying it before Question Time.  Section 4 is a statutory reiteration of what is already there in the way of the common law offence of contempt of court as it has been interpreted over the centuries.  The rest of the Bill, as Deputy FitzGerald admitted, is agreed upon.  In the context of that situation how do the Fine Gael Party justify themselves?  They, more than other groups of people in this House, have consistently claimed, particularly over the past two years, that this Government were not taking strong enough action, that this Government were not facing up to the problem of illegal organisations.  How can they take this attitude when we are now introducing the necessary statutory measure to remedy the situation because of the deficiencies in the existing code which prevented our law officers and our police force and, in particular, the senior officers of the police force, from taking decisions to apprehend and from pursuing that apprehension through the courts to a successful conviction.</P>
    <P>The fact is that we have found over the past three years very real difficulties in dealing with the enemies of this Parliament, of the State.  These were the practical difficulties that exist in our present criminal code and in some sections of the Offences against the State Act.  I was asked by Deputy Cooney and Deputy FitzGerald to spell out here in Parliament where those deficiencies arose and what they were.  That suggests an alarming absence of a practical attitude towards a matter of this kind.  If in open Parliament we start to spell out the deficiencies in the existing criminal code, if we start to spell out deficiencies in regard to matters which frustrate the Garda authorities in their apprehension of people who are engaged in illegal activities, we are getting directly into the security area. We are giving direct encouragement to these people and making known to them, to the enemies of the Parliament <Col N="546" /> and the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The decision to prepare this Bill and introduce it in this House was taken on the advice of the permanent law officers of the State, responsible not just to a Fianna Fáil Government but to the duly elected Government of the people.  It was adopted by us by reason of the consistent experience of the law officers of the State over the past three years in regard to inadequacies that existed in regard to successful prosecution of the enemies of this Parliament, and the inadequacies that made for an impossible situation where they could not even be apprehended.</P>

      <P>This was the view of the independent law officers of this State, responsible to any Government elected by this Parliament, and the view was sustained by the advice of the independent Garda authorities, the national police force of this country.  This is a matter at which we should look very seriously.  Whatever Government are democratically elected are dependent on such independent people as are represented by an independent police force and independent law officers.  What some Deputies lack are basic civics and a basic understanding of what representative democracy is all about and what politics is all about.  If the Government get advice and, see on an assessment of that advice, and on the assessment of a situation that has obtained over three years, that due to <Col N="547" /> the inadequacies of the system of administration in dealing with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In a revolutionary or quasi-revolutionary situation it is the duty of whatever Government occupy these benches to make a careful assessment of the situation, and we have made a very careful assessment of it.  Indeed, Deputies here have criticised us for not jumping in immediately to deal with this matter.  We decided to allow the ordinary processes under the ordinary legislation to proceed.  The first step we took to deal with the situation was the inauguration of the Special Criminal Courts earlier this year.  That was done after very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>Since then we have been further advised as to inadequacies that enabled prominent leaders of illegal organisations to display themselves on the media and to display themselves publicly. As the Taoiseach said here last night, these prominent leaders were shrewd enough not to be involved in any direct action which could bring them before the ordinary courts.  Faced with that situation, and similar types of situations arising out of the inadequacies in the legal system, we decided on the advice of the chief officers of the Garda force and on the advice of the independent law officers to proceed in this way and introduce this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say in conclusion, because I have covered some of this ground before Question Time, that this is a matter that should concern all of us in a far more serious way than I fear it has been taken to be heretofore, particularly by the Fine Gael Party.  The Fine Gael Party, in my view, have walked into a hasty situation caused by their own internal problems.  This is far too serious a matter to be taken on the basis merely of taking the mickey out of Fianna Fáil.  That is not what this is about at all.  What this is about is not Fianna Fáil or Labour or Fine Gael.  What this is about is whether we are going to have government here <Col N="548" /> through people elected democratically or whether we are going to have government in the streets or elsewhere by people who have no democratic responsibility to the people of the country.  This is what it is about.  It is not about Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael or Labour.  It is about government and where the responsibility of government lies.</P>
    <P>In my view the Fine Gael Party in particular have acted entirely against the sort of reasoning and thinking that has always been predominant in that party in taking this attitude on this occasion.  I am certain that this attitude is not representative of many people sitting in the Fine Gael Party opposite. This attitude is certainly not representative of the great majority of the Fine Gael Party supporters in the country.</P>

      <P>I happen to be a practical enough politician to know the views of many of them.  I happen to be practical enough to know a fair bit about the views of the majority of them.  If the Fine Gael Party has misjudged the situation, let it be on their own heads.  They have misjudged the situation and misjudged it gravely.  The people are far more intelligent than many of us here and they see the situation quite clearly.  There is no point in Deputy FitzGerald being ambivalent in the House or ambiguous and engaging in argument that can have it both ways. On an issue like this you cannot have it both ways.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party fundamentally should also believe in this House and the representative democracy represented in this House and recognise the fact that our strength comes from the people and from their election of us to sit in this House and to contribute to its workings and that whatever majority group is elected in this House as a Government is there as a Government, is elected fundamentally and basically by the people of the country, responsible only to God. That is what basic democracy and representative democracy is about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt fully with the Bill before Question Time, before Deputy Flanagan came into the House.  I am only coming to a conclusion now because of all this political waffle which was engaged in by Deputy FitzGerald earlier this morning. I am just replying to it and trying to come to a conclusion so that people in this House will realise the fundamental importance of what is involved here, that behind this Bill there is something more important; there is the importance of the people who, equally, make their choice as to who should represent them, not just an elitist group who, through newspaper headlines seek to get the notion over that they alone are entitled to represent the people.  That is not what we want.  Over and behind this Bill lies a fundamental purpose.  Nobody will be affected by anarchy or disorganisation more than the people whom the Labour Party represent.</P>
      <P>So, I would make an appeal to the House to realise, first of all, as I have stated in detail earlier on, there is nothing in the Bill that impinges in any way on the operations of our courts.  The subsections of section 3, to which the greatest objection of is taken, is one subject to the rules of evidence, to the procedures of the court, which provide that no man can be found guilty unless there is a case made against him beyond all reasonable doubt and that as long as that fundamental principle is maintained, as long as the onus of proof is not shifted and as long as the matter is one for our courts, whether it consists of judges or jury, that subsection is fully clothed in all the protection given by the law.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with that in very great detail already. Coming back to the fundamental point involved, which is the protection of everything in which we believe, in my view, the people themselves, if put to the test on this particular issue, will show themselves far more sensible and far more responsible than many parliamentarians in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many other Members of the House, before last Monday and before receiving this Bill, I had listened and read and had come to no decision regarding the political implications and implications of an offensive nature against what have been alleged by the media and other sections of the community to be illegal organisations and which gave rise to this Bill.  Monday came.  The Bill was circulated.  In a cool, reasonable and calculated manner, I assessed the contents of the Bill.  I assessed it as a layman. I am not a lawyer.  As a layman I assume I represent the bulk of the people.</P>
      <P>One wonders as to the real reason for the introduction of this legislation. One asks in what way this type of legislation would be implemented and what would be the consequences of this legislation if it were implemented or if it were rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill embarks on a new era of legislation to suppress the activities of illegal organisations.  In my opinion it will suppress freedom of speech, freedom of expression of opinion on the part of people who do not think exactly the same way as the Government think. I am completely opposed to legislation which is on a par with the type of legislation that we have condemned in Northern Ireland or the type of British legislation that we have openly condemned and about which we have expressed various opinions.  Some of us were honest and truthful enough to express our opinions in public, for which we have been declared to be members or supporters of illegal organisations, just because we felt our opinions should be expressed in order to help the minority population who <Col N="551" /> have been down trodden and to show to the British Government that that type of legislation would not be tolerated in this free State.  Here we are today discussing legislation which is even more distasteful than the type of legislation we have organised ourselves to condemn in the past.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more with Members of the House who say that this legislation deserves full discussion.  It deserves discussion so that the people may be truly informed regarding the type of political jobbery that has been going on between the various parties in this House.  I have no wish to be personal but it is obvious that Fine Gael have made a better case in support of this Bill than have the Government. With the exception of Deputy Enright each of their spokesmen put forward reasons why the Bill is repugnant to them but they have expressed the opinion also that these proposals are not unnecessary and they have implied that if the Government had summoned the leaders of both the main Opposition parties and told them that they faced a problem in respect of which it would be necessary to introduce restrictive legislation to strengthen the Offences against the State Act, they would have agreed to co-operate.</P>
    <P>In other words, the biggest bone of contention with Fine Gael is that they were not consulted prior to the introduction of the Bill so that they might have been able, by some type of backroom manoeuvring, to have ensured that the Bill would be introduced in perhaps a more sophisticated manner, that perhaps the lawyers in this House could have succeeded in putting the Bill before the laity in such a way that our practical knowledge would not be adequate to draw the conclusions which are easy to draw from it as proposed.  That type of political jobbery should not be accepted by the people who should be told exactly about the kind of collusion that is going on among Deputies.</P>
    <P>In his speech, the Minister for Transport and Power made the same accusations as were made by the <Col N="552" /> Minister for Social Welfare.  His speech was on the lines that this is the place where there should be a sufficient knowledge of democracy to know that the Government proposals were the ultimate in democracy.  The threat of a general election was made. All I can say in that regard is that my decision on this Bill will be based solely in accordance with my conscience and the threat of a general election will not inhibit me in the least in that decision which, incidentally, I have reached already in a cool and calculated way.  I reached that decision without having any regard for my past political beliefs, some of which I hold yet, or of my past political friendship or maybe non-friendship with individuals within Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice spelled out clearly that the incident in a Dublin cinema on Saturday last was the responsibility of an illegal organisation that is mentioned so freely here.  It was scurrilous for two people who are lawyers to stoop to such depths as to say that under this Bill nobody will be judged guilty until he is proved guilty while at the same time saying that this particular organisation were responsible for the distressing havoc which was caused by that incident and which resulted in injuries to a number of individuals.  That is a contradictory statement and it inhibits me from even proffering an opinion regarding these two gentlemen.  I say to them that they should not throw stones at their own glasshouses.  I do not expect that their accusation will be taken up by the organisation concerned but it is not the kind of statement that can do good to the morale of the people.</P>
    <P>We have been told that a domesday situation has arrived, a situation in which the nation must now stand or fall and that this House must decide whether it wants IRA rule or the ordinary democratic rule by which we are elected.  The situation has been blown up for a purpose.  This Bill has been put before us so that the actions of the Government can be justified. For many years the Offences against the State Act has been on our statute <Col N="553" /> book and we have known it to be put into operation but the argument made in support of the present proposals is that that Act is too lax and cannot be utilised to the extent that we would wish in bringing certain people to justice. That, too, is a contradiction because Seán Mac Stiofáin was brought to justice and convicted under existing legislation although a fortnight previously the Minister for Justice said he had no grounds whatever for charging this man.  An interview in respect of which there is some doubt as to its validity in court was used as a means of getting Mr. Mac Stiofáin. It was the means of catching the big fish but that gentleman was convicted on the strength of previous charges.  He was held when the time was ripe.  It was repugnant to the Constitution to have convicted him on previous charges.</P>
    <P>We have agreed to change Article 44 of the Constitution so as to broaden the scope of that Article and so that we might cherish equally every child of the nation.  Everyone will be free to express his opinion regarding the proposed amendment.  We go out to the people and tell them that the proposal has been put forward in accordance with their wishes and that they now have the opportunity of sanctioning the proposal in the ballot box but we come back to this House and contradict ourselves by introducing a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this legislation is solely for the purpose of dealing with illegal organisations.  If that were so I have no doubt but that it would get the full support of the entire House but it is legislation that will bear heavily on the ordinary citizens of this State.  I shall give an example of this. Many of us frequent sporting events during the year and very often on leaving those fixtures we are handed various leaflets.  I am sure they all have definite purposes in mind.  For instance, I could be handed a leaflet saying: &ldquo;I support the IRA&rdquo;.  I would most likely put that in my pocket as one does not normally throw litter on the streets.  It could remain in my pocket for weeks.  I could be stopped by a garda who might tap me on the shoulder and say: &ldquo;I know you, Des Foley. <Col N="554" /> You are a member of an illegal organisation&rdquo;. I would tell him I was not. That denial would be the normal reaction.  When I am searched this leaflet is pulled out of my pocket and I am held in custody.  The person thus detained is brought to court.  The chief superintendent, who gets this information from the garda, through the sergeant and the superintendent, gives evidence that you are found with an incriminating document on you.  That alone is sufficient to justify your conviction.</P>
    <P>You try to cross-examine him and try to prove that you were not a member of an illegal organisation, that it was purely by accident you had that leaflet in your pocket.  The chief superintendent can claim privilege. We have not been told by the Minister for Justice that he will not claim privilege.  The chief superintendent's prerogative is to claim privilege on which you hang or fall.  Of course, the justice might not accept this but in nine cases out of ten the evidence of a garda is a very important factor in a case.  The fact that a garda can give evidence of this nature is a very serious matter.</P>
    <P>If I was sure we could be safeguarded against those things it would be a different matter.  I have taken this position as I see it, without any specific chip on my shoulder.  Since my resignation from the Fianna Fáil Party I supported the Government in most measures that have gone through this House.  I still retain friendship with many members on the Government benches.  In the past I have endeavoured to be as fair as I could with myself with regard to legislation and in regard to particular items which have gone through this House.  I oppose this legislation purely on the basis that such legislation is repugnant to the type of freedom which I expect my children, the people of this country and my constituents to have.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt, despite my opposition, that this legislation will become law at some future date.  If the people concerned feel that the threat of a general election can justify such legislation, then I say: &ldquo;Let us have a <Col N="555" /> general election.&rdquo;  I do not say that I shall be back again to oppose any legislation which any future Government might bring in.  If I do not return to this House, I will have satisfied my conscience and I will be able to sleep at night.  That is more important to me than hustling through the lobby with a guilty conscience or living a life of sin afterwards.  There are many Deputies on the Government benches who have doubts in their minds.  I know this is true because I was one of them and I supported particular legislation which I found very difficult to support.  I did so because I felt the crunch was there and it was necessary to support it in order to show our solidarity.</P>
    <P>This is a time when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice can be truthful with themselves.  All the Government speakers have said there is a unanimous opinion in regard to this Bill.  I know that is not so.  The Minister for Transport and Power, whom I regard as a reasonably honest man, knows that there are doubts in the minds of some of the Deputies on the Government benches.</P>

If that was done, we would have a significant new era with regard to Fianna Fáil thinking.  If in our opposition to this Bill we have made a small contribution towards safeguarding the future rights of the people of this country, then I am willing to make that sacrifice, irrespective of what it might be.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is possible to consider this Bill without casting our minds back over the past few years since the violence broke out in Northern Ireland.  We indict the present Government for creating the Provisional IRA, for fomenting the trouble in Northern Ireland, for supplying the arms, for speeches by the Taoiseach encouraging the people <Col N="556" /> to initiate violence in Northern Ireland and for creating the <i>Voice of the North</i> which encouraged the people to take to violence on the streets.  This is the Government who are trying to scare the people of this country because they say we must take measures against the violence in our country. This is the Government whose members were involved in gun running, who created the trouble in Northern Ireland, who financed it and who have the audacity to come before us with this repressive legislation to preserve them in power.</P>
      <P>It would be a sad day for this country if we allowed such legislation to pass through this House.  There is a very close analogy between what is happening in this session of the Dáil and what happened when Hitler created the panic situation in Germany. Last night we saw the barriers and the mustering of the police force. This was done to create in the minds of the people fear and consternation so that the Government can introduce and pass whatever legislation they like.  There is a very close analogy here to Hitler's regime.  We all know the holocaust which resulted. All the workers of this country should remember that.  We will have a Fascist Government if this legislation is allowed to pass through this House. I do not think we should be intimidated by the fear of an election. Let us have the election, let the people decide that there will be no repressive legislation and that we will remain a democratic State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the same Government who denounced the Special Powers Act in Northern Ireland, and who denounced internment.  This is the Government who, by means of the Prisons Act, introduced internment into this country.  They have a whole range of repressive legislation, dating back to the Criminal Justice Bill preceding this Dáil.  We had the Prohibition of Forcible Entry Act, with an assurance from the Minister that it would only be used against subversives.  We saw it used against corporation tenants in Dublin city who were within their rights in protesting.  We had the Prisons Act, which is an indirect form <Col N="557" /> of internment.  We have had criminal courts introduced by them.  Now, to bring us further along the way to fascism, they introduce this Bill and seek to intimidate us and force the Opposition parties to agree with them until they produce a fascist state here. We have had all this repressive legislation when there is so much other legislation needed&mdash;legislation on housing, the social services, consumer protection, unemployment and price control.  Those things are urgently needed, but we have a Government callously disregarding them and deciding again that they must fortify their position and have no opposition to them in any form.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives the Government the right to lock up people who protest against any Bill of the Government. Three weeks ago I spoke in Belfast to the Irish Association for Cultural, Economic and Social Relations.  They said: &ldquo;Would it not be great if something could be done to have a ceasefire?&rdquo; I contacted the organisation and asked them if they would have a ceasefire.  For pleading with people to bring about a ceasefire I could be put in jail under the terms of this Bill.  I could be accused of being a member of an illegal organisation because I would speak to people and plead with them to bring peace to our country. That is what is embodied in this Bill, which the Minister says is necessary for law and order.</P>
    <P>I was amused to hear the Minister for Transport and Power saying that they introduced this Bill on the advice of the law officers.  This is a serious statement to make and I should like the Minister to clarify it.  Does he mean that the superintendents decided, that they are deciding the law for this country?  The Minister said he took the advice of the law officers and introduced this at their request.</P>

      <P>This Government tried to abolish PR to consolidate their position and they are calling for the introduction of PR in the North. This is the hypocrisy of this Government who are hellbent on consolidating their position so that it becomes impenetrable, so that it assumes almighty powers, so that there will be no opposition there.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the Government should say that the IRA are a threat in this country when the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice told Mr. Health and the British Government that the IRA did not exist here.  I should like to know whether the Minister really has the interests of the country at heart when they gave police guard to members of those illegal organisations.  It is very difficult to understand it and I would like the Minister to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister and the Taoiseach did they not interfere with a court of justice here when a member of an illegal organisation was released on instructions from the North.  I know this to be true.  This is the Government who say they cannot <Col N="559" /> get convictions, that they have not enough power.  They admit that one of the sections, section 52, of an Act on the Statute Book, the Offences against the State Act, is in contravention of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Has the Taoiseach come in to repeal that section? No.  We may find ourselves defendants before the European Court of Human Rights instead of plaintiffs. Did the Minister for Justice have legal advice as to whether the Bill before the House is in contravention of this Convention?  We already have on our Statute Book an offensive draconian Bill that dates back to 1939.  How can we attempt to say we are a democratic State when we have such an obnoxious piece of legislation? The Minister is asking us to go one stage further and give him more repressive powers.  I would rather quit this country, resign from the Dáil, than put my name to this Bill or feel that I was identified with it in any way.  It would be a terrible travesty of justice to have the like on the Statute Book.  I would lose respect for this House if I saw the parties of this House support it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has callously, deliberately and cynically exploited the situation for his own ends.  He has tried to engender fear.  The Government did not think the conviction of the member of an illegal organisation recently would take place.  This Bill was prepared because they thought the conviction could not be obtained.  It backfired on the Government.  It did not go according to plan.  Now the Minister for Transport and Power comes in and appeals to Fine Gael and Labour to be responsible and support this.  Again it backfired on them.  They were sure Fine Gael would ignore the fact that this was a fascist piece of legislation. They were sure Fine Gael would fall for the traditional thing, the trap of law and order.  Fine Gael said: &ldquo;No, we will not have that.  We will not have totalitarianism.  No matter what the cost, we will not have totalitarianism.&rdquo; This is where the Government slipped up again.  They were counting on the Fine Gael vote.  They said: &ldquo;We know <Col N="560" /> that Labour will oppose us but we may get Fine Gael with us&rdquo;, and they did not bargain for men in Fine Gael who felt it would be repugnant to the ideals of democracy to support such a piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has the Special Criminal Courts and, as Deputy Desmond said, he has had 85 per cent convictions, over 120 convictions.  I would like to know what further powers he wants in the light of that information.  I could not lend my support to this Bill and I would encourage the workers of the country to oppose it.  I am delighted to see responsible bodies realise the dangers inherent in the Bill, realise the danger to democracy. The Maynooth students and other people have come out against it at great inconvenience to themselves. Workers in factories have come out to oppose it, as also have chambers of commerce in various parts of the country. I think it is a great tribute to our people that, when they see a danger to democracy, they decide to stand up and not have it passed.</P>
    <P>This is one time when Fianna Fáil will not delude the people or fool the people with their scare tactics and will not exploit any situation in which to introduce and have passed such a draconian measure as this which could only be equalled in South Africa.  It would be a sad day if we were forced to support this, because it will be used not against subversives but against legal organisations, such as the National Association of Tenants' Organisations.  Already the Minister for Local Government has decided callously to disregard their requests for meetings; but when they decide to march in protest against injustice, he will use this Act against them if we allow it to pass.  There is no doubt about this and the precedent for it was the Forcible Entry Bill which was used against people in Coolock some time ago.  This Bill could be used against women's organisations marching in protest against spiralling prices and inflation.  It could be used against anyone.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that a chief superintendent would have to say so, but a justice would be inclined to take the <Col N="561" /> word of a chief superintendent and I pity anyone who would try to put up a case against the word of a chief superintendent in court.  I would not fancy my chances because I think a judge would be bound to take the word of the chief superintendent, who as the Minister said, is a man of vast experience.  The Taoiseach said that if a chief superintendent gives evidence against a man, it does not automatically mean that the judge will convict; but I would be prepared to say that he will be 90 per cent on the way to conviction. A chief superintendent may not necessarily go on information he has but on information supplied to him by a sergeant, an inspector or a superintendent.  He may act on that information and give it to the judge, and a person of proper standing in the community, without any connection with any illegal organisation, may find himself in prison.</P>
    <P>I could not imagine people supporting this and the only way to decide the issue is to make it an issue in a general election immediately.  The events of the past few days have made me think that the Government again want to create fear and worry amongst our people.  At present they are allowing the creation of another martyr and being a realist, I do not think we should have another martyr in our country.  I do not think we need martyrs at the moment but the Government's disregard of the situation is evidence of the fact that they are not caring what happens to our country. This is party political interest above anything else and the interests of the country must transcend the interests of any party.  They should be aware of this fact but their callous disregard of it makes me feel that it is party interest and nothing else, and even the Taoiseach who is supposed to be Taoiseach of this country and not just the leader of his party should bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>The powers being given to the Minister in this Bill are not quite appreciated by the public and I would ask the Minister to debate this Bill as an election issue on television before the public, to explain exactly what is in it, with a member of the Opposition. <Col N="562" /> I do not think the people are quite aware of the tremendous totalitarian powers being granted to the Minister and he has an obligation to explain it before the people decide on this issue.  I would ask him to have an election on it.  It is important because it is an election on whether we have democracy surviving in this country or whether we have a state of totalitarianism.  We want law and order but we want enforcement of the law and, if that is done, order will follow.  They are not going to intimidate us into abdicating our rights to ensure law and order.  I do not think we will stand for that blackmail or for the smear which will be levelled at both parties because we are trying to prevent totalitarianism in this country.  We would be in dereliction of our duty if we were not to oppose the Bill which should be made a general election issue.</P>

      <P>The Offences against the State (Amendment) Act of 1972 is perhaps the most vital and most important piece of legislation this House has undertaken to examine since we have had the responsibility of our own government.  At the outset, let me say that whatever the views of Members of this House may be, we are all at one in so far as violence is concerned.  There is nothing to be deplored more than violence.  The moment we contribute in any way to violence we cease to be Christians. Not only should we be opposed to violence within this State but, as Christians, we must be opposed to every aspect of violence throughout the world.  Because many of us are influenced and inspired by our Christian outlook we have taken a strong line and a determined view on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that people who are not members of a political party have a major decision to make on a Bill of this kind.  It reminds me of the position in which I found myself some 30 years ago when I was a young Member in this House.  On the evening of the dissolution of the Dáil I had to make up my mind about how I should cast my vote on a Bill which I did not think was in the interests of the <Col N="563" /> country.  Even though the vote I cast on that occasion was the vote that put the Government out of office in 1944, I left this House with a clear conscience.  Although I had no guarantee I would return here I considered I had performed a noble and just act and so long as I was at peace with myself I knew I had justified my membership of this House.</P>
    <P>There is nothing so difficult to live with as an uneasy conscience.  Therefore, a Bill of this kind must be examined by every Deputy and each one of us must realise that he will have to live with his conscience.  The laws we enact here mould the society in which we live and will affect the society in which our children and grandchildren will live.  I am satisfied that this Bill is just a traditional step in Fianna Fáil legislation, from the legislation in the late 1930s, the 1940s, the 1950s up to the 1960s to which Deputy O'Connell referred. The policy of Fianna Fáil is power, the greed and gluttony for power, and their wish is to oppress and lock up anyone who speaks against them.</P>
    <P>If we have responsibility to legislate here, equally we have the responsibility to ensure that there will not be any curtailment of the freedom and liberty of the individual.  Let no one on the Government side say that Fine Gael are not anxious to assist in any serious difficulty that may arise.  This party have done this and will continue to do it but not to the extent of taking away the liberty and the freedom our people enjoy.</P>
    <P>This kind of Bill will lead to a situation where our existing buildings will be insufficient to accommodate prisoners.  At the moment Ireland has the unhappy record of having more people in mental hospitals than any other country.  Are we going to couple that with a record-breaking number of prisoners, people who are not prepared to toe the Fianna Fáil line?</P>
    <P>This Bill will lead to the deprivation of individual rights and liberties.  It will lead us to a loss of freedom, to prison camps, and eventually may lead us to the situation where we will <Col N="564" /> have extermination camps for people who do not believe in the doctrine and outlook of Fianna Fáil.  This Bill will not do anything to help us to mould a better society.  It is the kind of Bill Hitler tried and succeeded in passing prior to the establishment of the gas chambers in Germany.  He created a feeling of insecurity in that country so that the citizens were dependent on him alone for their rights, liberties and existence.  It was done in exactly the same way that Fianna Fáil have attempted here, to cow the people and to threaten them with tanks, bayonets and with stripes on uniforms. We have seen an example of this recently in this country.</P>
    <P>The Government tell us that this Bill and their actions in recent weeks are intended to deal with the men of violence.  Were the former RTE Authority whom they dismissed last week men of violence?  We were told that they were dismissed in the interests of State security.  Each of them was a respectable law abiding citizen but the authority would not take dictation from Fianna Fáil.  They would not abuse their position to implement a doctrine they knew was not in the public interest.  These were men of goodwill, of peace and of justice. However, the man of justice who will not carry out the dictatorial acts of Fianna Fáil is not respected any more and is judged to be a man of violence who must be suppressed.</P>
    <P>This Bill can be used in many ways. The Government tell us that this is an emergency and that the security and institutions of this State are in danger, but I should like to know why a time limit has not been put on this Bill.  Why does the Bill not provide that the Act will be law until such time as the emergency has passed and the dangers to the security of our institutions eliminated?  That is not in the Bill.  If enacted, this legislation will be part and parcel of our permanent legislation.  It is not a temporary measure for an emergency.  There is nothing in the Bill about the IRA: there is reference to illegal organisations but if Fianna Fáil want to proclaim any organisation illegal they can do so with a stroke of the pen or <Col N="565" /> even with a buzz on the telephone to the Garda authorities and all others concerned.  They have their own ways and means by which they will capture in the web of their ill-advised, ill-conceived, suspicious and dangerous legislation anybody they wish to capture.</P>
    <P>If there is any type of emergency in Ireland today it is the emergency of unemployment and high living costs but there is no Bill here to deal with 80,000 unemployed.  There is a Bill here to restrict the rights and liberties of the people and to enable the Government to put whoever they like whenever they like behind prison bars.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would answer this question: since this Bill does not convey to me that it is entirely designed to deal with the IRA&mdash;I do not believe it is&mdash;what happens in the case of those who are anti-EEC? If we participate in a meeting, express an opinion decrying the activities of the Brussels politicians, will that not be an offence against the State?  Can it not be described as an offence against the European Parliament, an offence against the legislation enacted in Brussels?</P>

      <P>I know the mood the Deputy is in.  After such a joyful day we could expect some applause from him, even on this Bill. I want to ask the Government is it not a fact that to plot against Brussels or to participate in activities or meetings to demonstrate or protest can be regarded as an offence against the State or its external policy?  As it stands, not having specified the IRA&mdash;I repeat I <Col N="566" /> do not believe it is intended completely to deal with the IRA&mdash;this Bill could also cover women's lib, and farming organisations.  The only time ever that drastic action was taken was the occasion on which Fianna Fáil threw the farmers into prison and kept them there.</P>
      <P>Again, it may be said that his legislation can be used against trade unions if any trade union decides to organise, hold meetings, demonstrate and protest loudly.  Or, in the case of civil rights, where it is usual not only here but in various countries abroad for those who believe in civil rights to protest and demonstrate in demanding such rights, this Bill can be used.  As the Bill is framed, if the housewives of the country turned up outside a courthouse to object to an unfair court decision during the hearing of a case by the Department of Industry and Commerce for excessive prices reported by the housewives, is it not a fact that under this Bill they would be interfering with the course of justice although this would have nothing to do with bringing down the institutions of the State?  This legislation could be used to have them arrested and imprisoned.</P>
      <P>There is provision in this Bill regarding statements or meetings &ldquo;constituting interference with the course of justice&rdquo;.  I think this is a dangerous and unnecessary provision and should not become permanent legislation.  A person who makes a statement, organises, holds or takes part in any meeting, procession or demonstration that is unlawful under this section is guilty of an offence and liable to a fine not exceeding £ 200, and if convicted on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £ 1,000, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All my speeches on the EEC Bill and other Bills recently have been mainly devoted to showing that Parliament has been losing power and have been directed towards gaining respect for our Parliamentary institutions. How does the Minister for Justice expect the ordinary people to have respect for a Parliament which imposes such legislation on them which endeavours to remove the democratic <Col N="567" /> rights of the people and include fines or imprisonment of this kind for organising or taking part in any meeting, procession or demonstration?  This Bill is not clear.  This Bill could very readily be put into operation for the arrest and imprisonment of all who disagree with Fianna Fáil.  That is not the worst and most serious part of the Bill.  Section 5 reads:</P>
    <P>The definition of &ldquo;document&rdquo; in section 2 of the Act of 1939 is hereby amended by the insertion after &ldquo;advertisement&rdquo; of the following:...</P>
    <P>Under the Offences against the State Act, 1939, the Government have every clause and every section they need to enable them to overcome every difficulty. Everything they required to safeguard the institutions of the State they have under the present law.  They did not use it, and they have been told that by Fine Gael and Labour.  There must be another reason why they want this addition to the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice states he has been considering this Bill for almost a year and particularly since last August.  In all my years as a Member of this House, it is the first time I have got a Bill without an explanatory memorandum.  If he has been six or 12 months preparing this Bill, why has he not published an explanatory memorandum setting out in detail the purpose for which he was introducing the Bill?  The Minister is falsely and maliciously creating the impression that there is a big law and order problem in this country.  What did Fianna Fáil do about it for the past five years? Is this a panic measure?  In my opinion, the Government know they are going to be beaten in this House and this Bill is an excuse from Fianna Fáil to have a general election.  I want to assure the Minister for Justice that the Members of this House, even those who are behind the Minister, view this Bill with great concern.</P>
    <P>Section 5 refers to anyone who is found with any map, plan, graph or drawing or any photograph.  Have we reached the stage now that if we want to exercise freedom of expression we must have in our possession a gilt-edged <Col N="568" /> photograph of either the Taoiseach or Uachtarán na hÉireann as a means of keeping out of prison?  Is it not a fact that most motorists in the country carry a map?</P>

      <P>A road map of Ireland.  There are people who draw their own maps: engineers, mappers, sketchers, surveyors, and if they are found with a map in their possession it will be used as evidence against them.  If there is an engineer high-spirited in his belief, who is associated with any political movement and if he has in his possession or in his car, sketches, graphs, maps or drawings, if the police so wish under this legislation, they can be used in evidence against him.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any photograph&rdquo;&mdash;any photograph of what, is it any harm to ask the Minister?  Some people carry around various types of photographs. I have been carrying around for a good many years a photograph which I treasure very much, a photograph of the late Charlie Kerins, who was executed by Fianna Fáil some years ago, which his sister gave me very shortly after his death.  If that photograph was found on me, is it not sufficient evidence to convict me under this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in my possession communications from persons who are seeking Christmas parole.  These communications are addressed to me in a most personal and confidential way.  If a Garda superintendent believes that I am associated with these people I cannot clear myself; yet I am not associated in any way with the political or social activities of these people or their organisations.  I know them personally and I know them to be dedicated to a cause, rightly or wrongly, and we must respect that.  If we are to have a country of free expression of thought, belief and political opinion, we must not clamp down on and throw into prison people who differ politically from us.  That is why I say section 5 of this Bill is a section which one would expect to be drafted by Fidel Castro or by a legislator such <Col N="569" /> as Bulganin.  This is undemocratic in all its forms.  How can Fianna Fáil think they can say that this country cannot exist unless we have a law passed that every person who has a map, a photograph or a plan in his possession which, in the opinion of a garda, is not on him for a good reason can be thrown into jail?  In my opinion this is a Bill which this House must throw out if we are worthy to be called a democratic institution.  We must throw out this Bill.  It has nothing to do with law and order.  It restricts the right of the individual. That is why I regard it as destructive.</P>
    <P>The Bill is evilly designed.  It will not bring peace to the country.  The more we oppress, the more we imprison, and the more we conspire against the public and create suspicions in the minds of Garda officers, the more speedily we must become a nation of violence.  This Bill will encourage violence and bring violence where it is unknown at present.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil are serious in their efforts to reconcile all groups within and outside the State, this Bill is harmful to those efforts.  The terms of this Bill are far more severe than the terms of any Bill ever introduced by the puppet Parliament of Stormont.  Even with all the measures introduced to date in the Six Counties by Mr. Whitelaw, there is no legislation dealing with the serious problems of that province that has the same teeth, the same bite and grab and greed for power and for the setting-up of dictatorial attitudes in every respect, as this Bill has.</P>
    <P>This Bill whittles away the rights of people.  It is the worst piece of legislation ever introduced.  Nothing like it was ever introduced in a British or Northern Parliament.  In no democratic state, where legislation is enacted by the votes of the citizens, have the citizens been presented with a piece of legislation which was so damaging and dangerous to freedom, liberty and democracy.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Justice, in connection with section 5 of the Bill: if a person is found with any disc, sound-track or other device or a <Col N="570" /> film, a microfilm or a negative&mdash;and we have numerous people employed in the services of RTE who have films and tapes because of their anxiety to see that freedom is exercised in broadcasting and on television&mdash;will that person be suspect?  According to the Bill, they are liable to penalties if the superintendent so directs.  This Bill will be responsible for the breeding of common informers and touts, fellows who will got easy money for bringing in information.  The Bill will put neighbour against neighbour because of personal or public spite.  It will be no trouble to say that a person has a photograph or tape.  The anonymous letter is a most dangerous medium of communication by which superintendents or Gardaí officers, however sincere they may be can receive notes in confidence giving what looks like factual information but which may be maliciously compiled for the purpose of damaging a neighbour or a friend, and which may be used as evidence to convict an innocent person.</P>
    <P>This Bill will be a haven for all those in this country who have benefitted from the funds of the Secret Service. The Bill has so many dangerous aspects that there is only one comparison I can make, and that is the statement which Mr. Mansholt made about the EEC when he said that it had many, many heads.  This Bill has many, many heads and all of them are dangerous to a free society.  It is designed to sow the seeds of violence, distrust, destruction and dishonour.  It is a bad piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that danceband leaders and electricians are usually to be found with flex, wire and microphones? If they play at a political function or in order to raise funds for a political purpose and if information is supplied by an anonymous letter writer that such a person is exercising his rights illegally and improperly in so far as the institutions of State are concerned, are such persons not immediately convicted because they have in their possession a flex, a microphone, tapes and the usual paraphernalia that the leader of a dance band carries around with him?</P>
    <P>There is no provision in this Bill <Col N="571" /> to safeguard the innocent citizen or to specify who the guilty citizen will be.  The Bill covers everybody.  We are all suspect.  This Bill represents an attempt to establish here a police State.  God knows, none of us wants a police State, a State in which we must seal our lips, not speak to our neighbours and look upon the police as our enemies.  The normal thing is to look upon the police as our friends, the custodians of law and order, there to protect life and property and help us in our difficulties.  If this Bill is passed in its present form there will no longer be any degree at all of co-operation between the Garda authorities and the general public.</P>
    <P>This is a most dangerous Bill.  It confers quite extraordinary powers on the Garda Síochána.  In all my time in this House I have never seen such powers conferred in any measure brought before this House.  There is power to question any person found at or near a place at the time of the commission of an offence or soon afterwards.  Such a person can be convicted because a member of the Garda Síochána believes something.  I cannot understand the Minister saying that the legal advisers to the Government recommended this provision, particularly after considering the legislation, according to the Minister, for a considerable period of time, in order to save the institutions of this State.  This Bill places on the police an onus placed on no police force in any democratic state.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be thrown out of this Parliament.  It would be thrown out of any democratic parliament anywhere in the world.  Democratic parliaments are pledged to safeguard the rights of citizens.  I take grave exception to section 2, which seeks to make a fundamental change in our law. With one or two exceptions, no person is obliged by law to provide any information, even his name and address, to any member of the Garda Síochána.  This right to silence is designed to prevent a person incriminating himself.  Under this measure if a person refuses to give information, a very serious offence indeed is committed. <Col N="572" /> This Bill takes away the fundamental right to silence.  The Bill creates a new offence.  The Bill is a two-headed penny to be tossed up against the defendant and the defendant will have no hope of redress.  A person who has no legal adviser immediately available to him and who is unfamiliar with the law has only one weapon, silence.  This is a powerful weapon in the case of the weak. It is one of which the weak should not be deprived.</P>
    <P>All a member of the Garda Síochána has to do is to believe.  The most serious part is that the offence need not be committed in the State. An emigrant could come from England from a place where an offence was committed and if, in the belief of a police officer, he was near that area, he could be convicted although the offence was committed outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>In many aspects of our lives many of us use our own judgment, and very often our own wise counsel, our best judgment is wrong.  What happens if a Garda officer is wrong in his assessment and, by mistake, a person is sentenced because the belief of the police officer was not well-founded? The citizen he believes to be guilty of the offence, whether it was committed inside or outside the State, may be penalised on the wrong belief of a superintendent or a member of the Garda.  From time to time even our own best judgment is wrong.  We can all admit that.  The best belief and the best judgment of a Garda officer can be wrong on some occasions.  Even if it is wrong on only one occasion, and if a man or a woman is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, that is a complete miscarriage of justice and it cries out for vengeance.  No man should be fined or imprisoned on the belief of another man, particularly the belief of another man who is a paid officer of the Government.  That is bad law and bad form.</P>
    <P>Under the original Act of 1939 it was an offence to be a member of an unlawful organisation.  As is usual in our criminal law, the onus is on the prosecution to prove conclusively that <Col N="573" /> a person is a member of an unlawful organisation.  On the passage of this Bill this right which a citizen has will be whittled away from him and the dice will be loaded against him, or against anyone any member of the police force believes is associated with what he considers to be an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>I object strongly to section 3 (1) (b) which implies that silence could lead to prosecution.  It is criminal to have it in any Bill that by his silence a person can be prosecuted.  In the general election which we hope will take place before Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope it will be duly noted that a Bill of this type which deprives citizens of their right to a fair trial and proof of guilt before conviction has been the cause of merriment to members of the Government party.</P>
      <P>This legislation could lead to serious consequences and especially the section to which I referred dealing with conviction on the belief of another person. This is not a law which will gain respect or support.  If I remember correctly subsection (2) was part of the Criminal Justice Bill.  The penalties laid down for any person who makes a statement, or who organises, holds or takes part in any meeting or demonstration, are exceedingly savage: on summary conviction a fine of up to £ 200 or imprisonment up to 12 months, or both; on conviction on indictment a fine of up to £ 1,000 or imprisonment up to five years, or both.  That kind of sentence is savage.  &ldquo;Savage&rdquo; is a mild word for it.  An effort should be made to bring the Government down on this Bill.  I am convinced that when the vote is taken a majority of the House will reject the legislation presented to us in this way.</P>
      <P>This Bill is playing into the hands of the enemies of the House.  If we are keenly concerned about preserving and strengthening our democratic institutions and creating public trust and confidence in them and support for them, it will not be done by a Bill of this kind under which a citizen can be convicted and imprisoned on the belief of another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been introduced <Col N="575" /> simply because Fianna Fáil thought they would get away with it.  It is my opinion that when the Taoiseach was with the British Prime Minister last week he either conveyed to him a copy of the Bill or assured him that he would introduce such a Bill.  This Bill is to make Mr. Heath happy.  This Bill must be the subject of an appeal to the people.  Legislation of this kind ought not to be carried by this House without consultation with the people. The Government should now realise that the day of reckoning has come and that this is an opportunity to consult the people.  They must explain to the people why they did not administer the law as they had it and, secondly, the purpose of legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>This is the most damaging and dangerous Bill ever introduced in this House and I, therefore, recommend its rejection on the grounds that it restricts the rights and liberties of individuals and goes practically all the way to the setting up of a police State here which will breed violence where we have peace.  This is most dangerous legislation.  We want co-operation between the Defence Forces and the Garda and the public.  A Bill of this kind would discourage co-operation with the authorities responsible for the administration of law and order. Citizens will be suspicious of the beliefs of every police officer.  A gap will be created, which generations will not be able to close, between the police authorities and the public.  This is the very type of legislation that we all desire to see wiped out.  It is bad for the community, bad for the police, bad for the morale of the people.  The only people it is good for are the Government who want to get rid of and to lock up those who do not preach what the Government believe.  Therefore, this House and the Members of this House in conscience have a bounden duty to reject this Bill, bell, book and candle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened for a considerable period to Deputy Flanagan.  The Deputy had one complaint, that he received no explanatory leaflet with the Bill.  It is all too <Col N="576" /> obvious that this man needs assistance in dealing with the Bill.  It is possibly the first Bill with which the Deputy did not get an explanatory memorandum. I would ask the Minister to ensure that Deputy Flanagan gets the necessary information on the next occasion so that he can show some kind of sense when he speaks in the House.  Deputy Flanagan, at 5.24, in a frivilous manner, spoke of Hector Grey and a variety of things.  This is the way Deputy Flanagan treated the Bill.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years there have been calls for law and order from both the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party on numerous occasions. The Minister in moving the Second Reading said:</P>
      <P>The duty of the Government in this situation is clear and beyond question.  If the existing law is inadequate to enable the community to protect itself against those who are dedicated to the overthrow of the democratic institutions of the State, including this Parliament, then the Government must seek to have the law amended in such a way as to make it adequate.</P>
      <P>That is a clear statement from the Minister and the Government that the existing law is inadequate to deal with the situation.  Those people who are endeavouring to overthrow the democratic institutions of the State by various means and who are committed to that are the people who are being protected here by members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party today.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>Nobody should be under any illusion about the true nature of the problem with which this Bill is designed to deal.  The men of violence at whom the Bill is aimed are the enemies of society.  These people like to represent themselves in glowing terms as the heroes and martyrs....</P>
      <P>Later, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue raised by the existence and activities of these unlawful organisations is stark and fundamental. <Col N="577" /> The issue is whether we are to be ruled by the democratically elected Government and Parliament of this country or by a small unrepresentative and self-appointed group who, without any semblance of a mandate from the electorate, have arrogated to themselves the right to carry on a campaign of violence and blood-shed, and to dictate the policies to be pursued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am entitled to quote and I shall so that Deputy Harte might understand the situation.  The Minister continued:</P>
      <P>What we as a community now have to decide&mdash;and specifically what the Members of this House have to decide&mdash;is whether our affairs are to be conducted according to policies decided on by the elected Government and Parliament or whether we are to succumb to conditions of anarchy and mob rule in which the minority that has organised itself into private armies can terrorise and impose its will on the law-abiding majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is clear in relation to the call for law and order by the Opposition and as laid down here in the Minister's brief.  The Minister has explained the circumstances which necessitated the introduction of this Bill, but those people who in the past have called for law and order claim now that the Bill is not necessary. They indicate that there is available adequate legislation to deal with the threats to law and order.  By this they can be referring only to the fact that there is provision for internment under the Offences Against the State Act and a number of Opposition Deputies have indicated their willingness to accept internment without trial.  If they wish to have internment without trial imposed, they should say so openly.  The Minister has explained in great detail also the sections of other legislation that are available to him.  We know that that is the wish <Col N="578" /> of the Opposition, as some of the leading spokesmen in Fine Gael have led us to believe.</P>
    <P>Those people, who were so anxious in the past that law and order be upheld, have changed their attitude during the past couple of days in this respect.  No longer do they wish that law and order be upheld because they believe they can cash in on situations where tragedies occur.  Others believe that, because of the climate within their own parties at present, some situation must be brought about that would ensure the continuity of their respective political parties.  If people are prepared to abide by the law, they have no need to worry.  There is no need for such people to be upset by the anxiety expressed by Deputy Oliver Flanagan in relation to jazz bands and the other silly matters he introduced during his speech.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us, too, that the Bill is necessary also to cover such technological changes as the availability of video tapes and other methods of producing evidence.  During the debate we have not heard from any Member of the Opposition in relation to many problems that have arisen here in the not too distant past.  We need only go back a few days to the Chicago-style attack on the Mater Hospital when, under mob law, a number of people entered the hospital and fired shots.  These are the type of people who are being supported by Labour and Fine Gael.</P>

      <P>... Just a line to let, through you, the Government know of the terrible, inexcusable outrageous effects of the shootings and demonstrations in front of the Hospital yesterday and last night.</P>
      <P>Even though I was in a relatively safe position, being well up in Eccles Street, the fear in the nurses' faces was a terrible thing to look at last night.  Imagine the feelings and effects on the patients on the ground floor who were in a critical condition on hearing first gunfire within the Hospital and then later at night to hear a crowd of 4,000 or 5,000 chanting &ldquo;We're coming in&rdquo;.  I was in the coronary care unit last year and I can well imagine the damage done to patients. It is disgusting to read in the papers that in consideration of the patients they were going to abandon the meeting at 1.15 a.m. I myself, even though I could have hobbled out, felt fear as I was on the top floor and if petrol bombs were thrown to set the place on fire I don't know how we could have got the other patients out...</P>

We will deal with them one at a time.  We know the other night the terrible disruption there was within the Fine Gael Party.  We know the hatchets which Deputy Ryan mentioned a year or two ago were in cold storage.  We are now told they were only sent to be sharpened.  That is quite obvious from what happened the other night in the Fine Gael Party.  In an effort to patch up their difficulties they tried to get an issue on which they could be united, but on which they are not.  I would like to ask a few of the gentlemen in Fine Gael their attitude to the gun thugs, the bombs in the cinemas, the burning of police cars, the picketing of Deputies' homes, the intimidation of jurors and their attitude to the other types of intimidation which have been used from time to time. What is the attitude of Deputy Fox who lives close to the Border area?</P>
      <P>Deputy Harte has seen what has happened.  What is his attitude?  What is the attitude of Deputy Malone, who lives so close to the Curragh Camp, where he has seen the mob law in relation to the police and the Army of this State?  He has seen how the military were abused and how the Garda were abused.  He has seen the manner in which the violent groups who have indicated they will overthrow the democratic institutions of this State have carried on at the Curragh Camp.  Will he support this Bill tonight or does he want that situation to develop?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what will Deputy Esmonde's position be in this?  Is he a man of violence?  Does he wish to see those people carry on as they have been?  We will soon know if he <Col N="584" /> wants to see this situation develop.  I wonder what the position of the Deputies Dockrell will be?  What will be the position of the rural Deputies like Deputy Donal Creed, Deputy Phil Burton or Deputy Frank Taylor? What will the attitude be of Mr. Law and Order, Deputy L'Estrange, the man we hear so much about and from whom we have heard so much in relation to offences, illegal organisations and illegal groups?  What will be the attitude of other Deputies like Deputy McLaughlin and Deputy O'Hara?  What about Deputy Garret FitzGerald?</P>
    <P>I should like to single out the mongrel foxes from the young bulls. This is a job I will not attempt to deal with.  I will leave that to Deputy Liam Cosgrave.  We have a variety of men here whose views I should like to hear.  I should like to hear Deputy Dockrell's views as to how he proposes to support the men of violence, the cinema bombers, the rocket firers and those who have no regard for the rights of individuals, who have no regard for the institutions of this State.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Opposition are trying to bring about a showdown. They want the institutions of State overthrown, otherwise they would vote for his Bill and they would vote to ensure that we have effective law and order.  That is what you will get from Fianna Fáil.  This Bill is required to deal with those subversive groups, the Provos and the other groups. Maybe it is not strong enough.  I could say things in the House in relation to Deputy Harte that might appear in print tomorrow which he might not be too happy about.  They might be completely erroneous statements but, nevertheless, would be damaging to him.  If the Deputy wants to pursue this, I can also do that and I will also deal with him when I get him outside this House.</P>

Nevertheless, he is not a member of this party now.  There was a disagreement with him.  He is with another group now for which I have no time.  I will deal with them later.  I will deal with the scurrilous references Deputy Sherwin made here last night when he got orders from the captain.  I will deal with them when I have finished dealing with the mongrel foxes and the Katanga brush up.</P>
      <P>This country must be a country that is safe to live in.  We must ensure that your area is safe, that your job is safe and that your family is safe.  That is not so at the moment.

I want to ensure that people can go freely where they desire to go, that they can be perfectly happy in places of public amusement or other places. Parents are concerned when their children leave home at night since this terrible tragedy, this callous action in a cinema in our city.  It is not the only one.  The Fine Gael and Labour parties want to continue to assist the fire bombers, to assist the people who burn the police cars, who insult and injure the gardaí.  There is no word of the injured gardaí or the military who are injured from time to time.  They were concerned about one man and one man only&mdash;the man who was supposed to be on thirst strike, the man who was sitting up this evening reading the paper, according to the radio.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister that I hope there will be an election so that the people can judge.  The people will make up their minds as they have done on many occasions before.  You will have an opportunity in a short time.  Call &ldquo;Votál&rdquo; any time, we will get them in and we are away.  I am quite sure with all the manoeuvring that went on this morning and all through the day by the mongrel foxes and the young bulls that they were concocting something to try to get a way out.  I do not think there is any way out this time.  You will stand trial before the people and the people will respond in the same manner in which they responded in the recent Cork by-election.</P>

      <P>Now to deal with that rude interruption from a member of the Labour Party.  There are a variety of doctors there who have given us all types of prescriptions for <Col N="587" /> peace.  These are the Papa Papa Docs, with special reference to Deputy O'Donovan, the man who spends all his time calling for quorums.  He is the Papa Dinga Doc.  We had them in Katanga.  We have them here.  We have them everywhere.  These are the people who are concerned about human life, concerned about law and order.  They are concerned that there will be disruption within the community. Some of their followers have been very active in promoting all sorts of troubles within the community and are just looking for revolution and they will be aided and abetted by people within the Labour Party.  They are well known.  If the members of the Labour Party and the members of Fine Gael want to support those people they are entitled to do so but when the bell rings there may be some of those boys missing. They may find some excuse.</P>
      <P>It has been said that Fine Gael never make the same mistake twice but every day they find a new mistake to make.  This is obvious since they put down this amendment but, of course, Deputy Cooney must have his head and Deputy FitzGerald and the Deputy from Waterford.  They are the people who are trying to root out Deputy Cosgrave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thornley spoke here today. His speech was an apology for the fact that he stood outside the Mater Hospital last Sunday.  There were some references to members of the Government but nothing to do with the Bill, no apology for his action. If he took action well and good, there was no need to come in here and apologise.  I want to ensure that we will have effective measures to deal with the UDA, the Provisionals, or any other group who want to disrupt, the people who are sworn to overthrow the democratic institutions of the State.  This Bill will provide these measures but the people without backbone in Fine Gael and the Labour Party who have called out from time to time for action against them are now lacking in courage. We will see how far Deputy Desmond, Deputy O'Brien or Deputy O'Donovan <Col N="588" /> will go.  Maybe Deputy Thornley whose expulsion was moved the other day will go with them or is this an excuse to try to consolidate the Labour Party again?  No doubt Deputy O'Brien who moved the expulsion motion the other day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We must ensure that mob law does not take over.  I do not want to see the rights of the individual eroded in any way.  I am concerned about the rights of the individual.  I am concerned about the community as a whole and the democratic institutions. I will support any measures that are necessary to uphold them, to ensure that the people of this country and of my constituency can go freely to places of amusement, go freely to and from their work without fear, that parents can allow their children out at night without fear. Not a word is being said about the unfortunate people in the Mater Hospital who are seriously ill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were many people seriously ill in the intensive care and coronary units of that hospital.  Nevertheless that howling mob were not concerned about the rights of the other people, the rights of the sick and dying people in that hospital.  They were concerned about one thing and one thing only. Today we have a group of men here who are supposed to be the upholders of law and order, who hold themselves out as upholders of law and order, and who are afraid to meet their responsibilities here in relation to this Bill.  There has been no amendment to the Bill, no effort to modify the Bill; there has been an effort to reject it which clearly indicates that they want to ensure that the intimidation which has taken place, the terror tactics which have taken place will continue and that the Government will be deprived of the opportunity of acting in an effective and efficient way against the people who want to overthrow, who are sworn to overthrow, the democratic institutions <Col N="589" /> here.  It is a sad reflection on the Opposition here and I am quite certain that Deputy Cosgrave and other members of Fine Gael deal with some of the speakers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were in the political weather forecasting business, I think that, after listening to that speech, I would be inclined to suggest there is a very dirty election coming up.  It is many years since I stood up here on many occasions to protest against the hypocrisy and cynicism of successive southern Governments in the Republic in regard to their attitudes to the problem of the unity of Ireland and the problem of the North of Ireland.  I do not suppose that the black cynicism of the southern politicians, the politicians of the Republic, has ever reached as low a level as it has now, when it is quite clear that the horror, the agony, the wounds, the suffering and the terrible deaths of our fellow Irishmen in the North of Ireland&mdash;Protestants, Catholics, men, women and children&mdash; are now to culminate in this sordid climax of becoming a good issue for the Government in the next general election. Have we no standards whatever left, no feelings whatever left, about the issues we are discussing here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we on this side of the House are taking the matter lightly.  How can that be suggested? We now know the kind of election that is going to be fought. We have taken the calculated conscious decision about this issue to go to the country with it, to bring this Government down if we can, and if we cannot, and we do not believe we can&mdash;I am admitting that&mdash;we still believe that this matter should be put to the vote and the Dáil dissolved and then brought to the country.  I think that it is a decision for which the Opposition parties deserve considerable respect, that they have taken this conscious decision because they <Col N="591" /> feel that a matter of grave fundamental principle involving the civil rights of citizens here in the Republic is involved.</P>
    <P>What is worse, they know&mdash;that is, the Opposition&mdash;that they are very likely going into a general election which they cannot win because this is the kind of unanswerable propaganda with which we will be faced.  The last time we had slanders of various kinds about the subversive nature of the Labour Party and innuendoes about its Communism, its attitudes and intentions for society.  This time the public will be asked to &ldquo;Back Jack&rdquo; in order to protect our children from being raped, blown up, murdered, executed, burned with petrol bombs or killed with rockets.  This is going to be the appalling, gross, dishonest oversimplification of this terrible tragic issue, of the origins and the solutions for the dreadful reality of sectarian civil war in the North of Ireland and the possibility of a sectarian war here.</P>
    <P>Probably the most bitter irony of all is that of all the parties the Labour Party since the foundation of the State can show that, whatever about any faults they may have, they have never promulgated the idea of force, of bomb, bullet, execution, or any other form of violence for the achievement of their ends.  But now we are going to find&mdash;if we are to believe Deputy Dowling and, also I suspect from the contribution made by the Taoiseach&mdash;that a campaign will be run on the lines that Fine Gael and Labour are supporting the men of violence.  We can only hope that the electorate will be able to see the truth in this matter.</P>
    <P>At last the front benches on both sides are empty of men of violence of both parties and they have been replaced by young men who have had nothing whatever to do with the violence of a very disturbed past.  The distressing fact is that this new generation of young men who lead Fianna Fáil clearly have learned nothing from the past mistakes of their predecessors in office.  The attitudes of their predecessors regarding the use of force and their satisfaction <Col N="592" /> at the achievement of their objectives through force should not have affected the young men of this generation. Because of the involvement of their predecessors in the civil war, a lingering bitterness could be understood in the type of legislation they introduced but that should have been left behind by the young Minister for Justice and by the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Surely there must be some other way in keeping with the times and the needs of our society, of dealing with the present very serious and dangerous problem, than to reach back into the terrible and turbulent past and to produce a piece of legislation of this kind?  There should be some other way than this legislation which amends an appalling piece of police state legislation which was introduced at a time of war and emergency and when there was no doubt that the State was threatened.  Instead of ameliorating the provisions of that Act we are strengthening it and enlarging the powers taken under it.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is the complete failure of the Minister to learn anything from history or to learn anything from the failures of his predecessors. Oppressive legislation of this kind is not the answer to our present problems. The use of violence and the use of force are the twin solutions that are given to nearly every problem we have had in society.  The State was founded in violence in 1922 and was opposed in violence by Mr. de Valera in the terrible civil war.  In the 1930s, the 1940s and 1950s there was a recurrence of that violence and now we are back with exactly the same cycle of violence and repression and no solution whatever for the problems we are facing.  This is because nobody has had the courage to face the true origins and to apply the solutions we know must eventually be used if we are to deal with the young men who take up guns to achieve their objectives.</P>
    <P>In 1916 young men took up guns and they have been called idealists.  In 1922 young men on both sides fought for the Republic and were called idealists by both sides.  They were not called thugs as Deputy Dowling now <Col N="593" /> calls the present people who are also looking for their ideal republic.  At what stage does an idealist become a thug?  Today we heard words such as &ldquo;bully&rdquo; and &ldquo;gunmen&rdquo; used about these young men, men with whom I am, and always have been, in the most complete and profund disagreement about the methods by which they are attempting to achieve their objective. I have never equivocated at any time on that point.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling accuses us of playing politics here.  To the complete consternation of my own party, and, I have no doubt, to many members of Fine Gael, I came out in support of the Taoiseach at the time he expelled from his cabinet the people whom he believed were helping the establishment or the maintenance of the Provisional IRA.  I did this because I thought the Taoiseach then believed in the achievement of his objectives through peaceful means.  In taking that stand I did myself untold political damage, but I am attempting to establish beyond doubt where my beliefs lie in this whole matter of attempting to help the people in the North&mdash; Protestant and Catholic&mdash;to come to some agreement in their troubled society.</P>
    <P>I am not playing politics on this issue whatever anybody else may be doing.  It is not the first time that the present Minister has shown this complete lack of appreciation of the complexity of the problems he is facing. Almost invariably he has satisfied himself with the completely simplistic approach to any difficulty.  The classical example&mdash;and anybody who read it and reads this Bill will remember it&mdash; is the Forcible Entry Bill.  It is quite obvious that the paternity of these two Bills is the same, Deputy O'Malley.  It is quite obvious that the origin of the decision of a number of people to squat at that time was clearly an attempt to establish in the minds of the Ministers concerned that there was an urgent need for the provision of houses in the community.  The Minister's answer to that was to introduce the mirror image piece of fascist legislation, the Forcible Entry Bill.  The use of force would solve the problem. <Col N="594" /> The Minister believed in it in order to solve the problem of the homeless. He is a very intelligent and perceptive person and he must know that the correct answer to that need for houses at that time was more houses, not repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>We had the same thing I remember, a long time ago when the then Taoiseach, Deputy Lemass, introduced another use of violence in his Bill to imprison striking workers which was thrown out by this Dáil.  But again, striking workers were imprisoned. Instead of giving them social justice for their cause they were imprisoned. As other Deputies have shown, farmers have been imprisoned, members of tenants' organisations have been imprisoned. This is quite clearly the basic philosophy of the Fianna Fáil party, the use of force to solve social, political, economic issues and at present this so-called law and order issue.  There is little difference between the people this law is designed to deal with and the people who have designed this law: they both believe in the use of force; they are both anti-democratic.</P>
    <P>Here we find ourselves going to the country at a time when there are 7 per cent unemployed, thousands homeless, when there is gross price inflation, when there is dire need of greatly increased and improved social services, care for the aged and so on, educational services of one kind or another, and the issue on which we shall fight the election will be the question of whether a small minority within the community should be interned through the law courts rather than directly as was done before in the '50's or as done by Faulkner in the North.  The public will then be deprived for another four years of an opportunity of discussing the issues which we should be discussing. This Dáil has been practically monopolised by discussions about relatively irrelevant subjects&mdash;the question of the Arms Trial; I do not know how long it took, internecine struggles in the Fianna Fáil Party, one after the other.  All of them end up here and we have to attempt to clear up their mess while 70,000 or 80,000 are unemployed and all the other social ills we know so well are not <Col N="595" /> dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Northern problem has now become a good election issue and Fianna Fáil will win the election on it.  That is the bitterest irony of the lot&mdash;Fianna Fáil who have contributed more than any other single party here to the creation of the kind of society which has provided the young men they are going to lock up.</P>
    <P>I remember well the occasion on which I moved a motion here against the then Taoiseach, Éamon de Valera. Naturally, I shall not recapitulate that, but the gist of it was that he happened to be Taoiseach and at the same time controlling director of <i>The Irish Press</i> newspaper.  My charge against him was that while on the back page of his paper&mdash;and he was responsible under the articles of association for everything that went into this paper&mdash;he had colour cartoons of soldiers being shot, men being hunted, policemen bleeding to death in our great struggle &mdash;the glorious years, or whatever they were called&mdash;in the front pages of the same paper he had the names and addresses of the youngsters who were down in the Curragh in his internment camp.  I dealt with the cant and hypocrisy of the kind of mentality that would foster this belief in the cult of the gun and the bomb and violence here which has been the monopoly&mdash;I say in fairness to the Cumann na nGaedheal and the Fine Gael Party&mdash; of the Fianna Fáil Party since 1932 and long before it.</P>
    <P>How many of us are sick to death of the continuous gun-shooting over graves, memorials, commemorations and graveside orations&mdash;this perpetuation of the sick mythology of the valiant, fighting men, their bravery in dying for their country.  It is the most accepted aspect of life in any society that a man is prepared to fight and die for his country: Japanese, German, American, British, Scandinavian, it does not matter which.  But here it has been elevated into a religious cult, the belief in the greatness of the soldier over the man of peace, in an allegedly Christian society.  Starting with &ldquo;A Soldier's Song&rdquo; and running the whole way through our lives is this cult of the <Col N="596" /> man of violence.  All of my class in my school in Ballinrobe ended up in Mountjoy Prison, and I suppose that could be said of most of us here, because we were persuaded that our responsibility as young Irishmen was to take up arms and fight not only against the British but, more evil still, against the Protestant British because it was they who expropriated us as Catholics in the distant past.  Instead of the Christian &ldquo;Forgive us as we forgive them in spite of what they have done to us&rdquo;, dinned into us nearly every day that I went to school certaintly was the doctrine of hate and the need for retribution : an eye for an eye.</P>
    <P>This is what brought these young men out last night of whom Deputy Dowling is so impatient, about whom he was so sarcastic.  These youngsters have been educated into believing that they are doing something fine and noble in attempting to give their lives for their country or to take life for their country.  Therein lies the origin of sectarianism and the origin of violence which has permeated our whole culture since the State was formed.  Far from attempting to reduce its incidence, we have been doing everything we can to keep that flame alive.  The young gunman, the young bomber, is the end product of our culture, of our educational system. Give us a child and we will answer for the man.  These are the men.</P>
    <P>That is why I am so saddened by this superficial, simplistic approach to a problem which goes so deeply into the whole fabric of our society and our culture, with no attempt whatever made to deal with those origins in our schools, the origins in our homes, in our history books, in the whole life of our society.  We have a young angry brigade of Irishmen and every generation has produced them, angry young Irishmen anxious to die, starve to death, get shot or whatever other way they choose to give their lives, in order to prove their manhood, to prove their patriotism, justify their existence.  Meanwhile the serious problems of our society, unemployment, emigration, the care of old people and the disabled, the need for improved health services, housing, <Col N="597" /> become lesser and unimportant objectives for which these young men, in any other normal society, would have joined political parties in order to achieve.</P>
    <P>We have seen this in the appalling, sick&mdash;emotionally sick would be the psychiatrist's considered opinion&mdash; interest in this man Stephenson who is attempting to kill himself.  Apropos of that, Deputy Joe Dowling was quite correct when he criticised the big crowd outside the hospital for their insensitiveness, their lack of feeling for the fact that there were 400 other sick people there.  The 400 other sick people there did not matter.  They were not sick in the sense that interests us down here.  If they were going to die, first of all, they were not dying by their own hand; secondly, they were not dying for Ireland.  They are only ordinary Dublin people some of whom were, no doubt, fighting for their lives.  That was irrelevant to the 4,000 outside.</P>
    <P>Again, I am afraid I disagree profoundly with my friend Deputy Thornley's decision to go to the Mater Hospital, but that is his own business. However, I disagree even more profoundly that an archbishop and an ex-archbishop should lend their position within our society, should lend their prestige and their authority within our society, in going to see this man convicted before our courts and charged with being implicated, as far as we know, in the deaths of between 600 and 700 of our fellow Irishmen, innocent men, women and children. That an archbishop and an ex-archbishop should go answering this fellow's request to see them is one of the most scandalous things they have ever done, and by God their record is good in that regard.  How many of the 400 ordinary Irishmen, women and children did they visit?  They just went to see the one man who was in the limelight, the one man who is taking his own life, the one man who is dying for Ireland.  How can you blame these youngsters, products of the schools that these people control if they believe that <i>dulce et decorum est pro patria mori?</i></P>
    <P>This is where the origins of this <Col N="598" /> problem lie.  I am not blaming the youngsters.  You can educate a child to do anything.  Our schools educate our children to kill Protestants.  I am making that charge because I am a product of these schools&mdash;the Marist Brothers and the Christian Brothers. That is what we are doing.  As I said to Mr. de Valera years ago: &ldquo;The back pages tell what a wonderful fellow you are, and for imitating you, you put people in the Curragh internment camp&rdquo;&mdash;and execute ten, 11 or 12 of them into the bargain, because they did what they were educated to do and what they were trained to do.</P>
    <P>We, the so-called leaders of our society, are the guilty people here. Were those 12 executed?  I always think it is fascinating the way we killed 12 fellow-Republicans, and those terrible Northern Unionist black Protestants killed one Republican formally by judicial execution.  Are we proud of it?  Is this not a pretty good record?  These are the people produced by this sick society which stands amazed waiting for this man to die so that they can give him a hefty funeral stretching from one end of O'Connell Street to the other, with bands and guns and all the panoply of this kind of self-indulgence in the grossly disturbed society which we represent.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that some members of the medical profession are involved with this Stephenson doubting whether he should live or die.  He is laughing at us all and is reported to be sitting up reading the papers. There is no question whatever that he should be allowed to die.  I do not want to waste time with him.  We have the Bill and the use of force and the maudlin sentimentality of the people who went up the other night to wait on this fellow while he pirouetted around the stage&mdash;effectively, the political stage&mdash;and sent out these extraordinary bulletins through his various representatives, and all our hearts bled.  The television, the radio and the newspapers gave it full coverage. Everybody was sick with excitement looking at their sets and wondering would he or would he not die.  It was a real cliff-hanger.  In the <Col N="599" /> killings 690 people were involved and we are worried whether he should live or die.  At the same time as this was going on and we concentrated all our interest on all signals and signs of distress from the Mater and now from the Curragh Hospital, in Portlaoise Jail there are 78 non-political prisoners, and the 78 of them are Irishmen, whatever they did.  They were unemployed men, perhaps pilferers. There are 78 of them in solitary confinement.  There are 40 of them on hunger strike.  When did we see them on our television screens? What coverage did they get from the newspapers?  Forty of them are on hunger strike and four are on hunger and thirst strike.  One has been badly beaten up and six less so, while seven are suffering from beatings.  They have been sentenced to 42 days on bread and water.  They are not in an intensive care unit being interviewed by the Bishop and the Archbishop, a special chaplain and a private solicitor. They are in solitary confinement. I have been in Portlaoise where they are.  They are in a cell in which I remember the late Noel Hartnett saying years ago that a young man died on hunger strike.  It is a cell where you would not keep a dog.</P>
    <P>I remember the graves of two of those men who died.  There is a brick over one of them.  I asked where the graves were.  The Governor tipped a brick with his foot and said : &ldquo;That is where Kearns is.&rdquo;  There was a tin somewhere else and he said: &ldquo;There are the other two&rdquo;.  These people at the present time, who are fellow-citizens of ours, have not had an answer to their problem from the Minister.  It is just like the young Republicans here, and the homeless.  They wanted some education while they were in Portlaoise. They wanted better visiting hours and better parole and hot water.  They have one lavatory for 50 people and the parade ground is 29 by 100 yards for 200 men and they wanted it extended.  They wanted the devil and all, did they not?  What did they get from this Minister for Justice? They got solitary confinement and bread and water.  Who worries about that?  Deputy Thornley is not in Portlaoise; <Col N="600" /> neither is Father McManus nor the Archbishop; neither was his predecessor.</P>
    <P>I asked that a special notice question be taken here yesterday or the day before, as soon as I read this in <i>The Sunday Press.</i>  I would not have known it if that paper had not published an article about it.  That article has not been contradicted.  This was not considered a matter of urgency apparently, and the question will be taken next week if we have a Dáil.  If not, they can still go on and do their 40 days on bread and water. How could one be as hypocritical as our society is?  Our society is pretentious and hypocritical from top to bottom, all the way through.  It is rotten.</P>
    <P>No wonder the unfortunate Northern Unionist is fighting with everything he can lay his hands on to avoid coming in and to avoid having anything whatever to do with this Government and their way of life. That is one of the bitterest pills.  That is an issue they are frightened to face. I hope they will have to face it; and that is when the Government will find out from the plebiscite, if these people have enough sense to give civil rights to the Northern Catholics.  That was told to me as I went to the Newry march with two gentle, simple, working-class practising Catholics.  They had been to Mass that Sunday morning, a man and his wife middle-aged, highly responsible, going up to that march, and he said: &ldquo;As you know, it is a tricky situation for most people to be going into and, remember, Noel, this afternoon we are marching for civil rights.  We are not marching for a united Ireland&rdquo;.  They were Catholics.  They were marching for civil rights because we have not created a society here into which not only the Protestant Unionist could and should come but will not come when he thinks of the education of his children, the health of his sick, the care of the aged, the homeless, or whatever it may be.  He would be a fool to come in and join us.  But not only the Protestant Unionist will not come in, neither will the Catholic Nationalist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> That is the sum of your achievement of almost 60 glorious years, saluted as such.  That is why there is a northern struggle.  That is why there is Partition.  That is where Partition is established.  That is where it is perpetuated. It is founded in the refusal and the failure of successive Governments here to take those steps which would make it possible for any Irishman, Catholic or Protestant, Unionist or Nationalist, to come in other than at the point of the gun, and most of them will not even come in at the point of the gun.  Ours is a society in which 75 per cent of the wealth is owned by 5 per cent of the people, and then, the Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, on behalf of the Government, brings in this absurd police state fascist legislation as his solution for such a deep-seated, widespread problem permeating every aspect of our society.  That is his solution&mdash;brute force!</P>
    <P>We have failed on every single front.  Even our own people are sick of us.  Even our own people no longer believe we can solve our problems.  I have tried to explain my attitude to these young men; my sympathy for them is sympathy for their involvement in this dreadful and, in my view, unforgiveable activity of killing fellow Irishmen.  I have been criticised by my socialist comrades as a revolutionary socialist myself.  I do not believe that this is a class struggle, that it is a sectarian struggle and, for that reason, I do not support the use of force. At the end of it all we will find ourselves with the same political vertical organisation of the ruling and the ruled, North and South.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was asked did I not believe that these young republicans were the direct heirs and successors of the men of 1916 and I said yes, that was my belief; ideologically, they are the direct heirs and successors of the men who survived 1916.  I put it that way.  Given the chance, they will create in a new society, over a new 50 years, exactly the same kind of class structure, inequitable communities, with lack of freedom of conscience, in which the Catholic Church will be completely dominant in all its social <Col N="602" /> and political attitudes and in which we will have the same homeless, the emigrant, the unemployed, the sick, the aged, subject to all the inequalities those who went before them have known over the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>This Bill is no answer whatever to the problems facing the country.  I have no doubt that this Government will achieve the results for which they hope through this Bill.  They are not prepared to take decisions in relation to the organisation of our social structure. As we have seen in their recent timorous decision to introduce an amendment to Article 44, clearly they are so frightened by the repercussions inherent in attempting to remove this relatively innocuous and unimportant measure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cott</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment Deputy Browne on his very moving, but saddening and, indeed sickening analysis of the whole concept of republicanism that pervades our society, a concept that has been bred, fostered and nurtured by successive Fianna Fáil Governments down through the years for their own party political advantage.  This dangerous and misguided force of ultra-republicanism has now got to the stage at which stern action must be taken.  Indeed, that stage was reached some years ago, but the Government were singularly inactive in coming to grips with the serious situation besetting our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must seriously question the <Col N="603" /> motivation of the Government in proposing such drastic and, in our opinion, unnecessary measures to curtail this evil force.  It is true, as Deputy Browne says, that the gun is again being made a major issue in Irish politics.  This is a deliberate tactic on the part of the Government.  The more pressing social and economic issues are being pushed aside.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised by the Government Party for not supporting them on this innocuous Bill.  We have always claimed, and will continue to claim, that one of our prime interests in politics has been the defence and preservation of democracy and the institutions of the State.  However, in doing so we are obliged to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals.  We must ensure that those rights and freedoms are not in any way curtailed or jeopardised.  Any laws passed, and any amendments to existing laws, must protect those rights.  We cannot tolerate a situation in which innocent victims may have no redress under the law. This is one of the major points at issue in this Bill.  The accepted norm of justice that a man is innocent until proved guilty has been inverted and the proposed amendment is so sweeping that there is no protection for the innocent.</P>
    <P>Under section 3, members of the Garda are asked to be judge and jury in particular circumstances, and to decide whether presence in a particular place constitutes an infringement of the law.  They are being asked to decide whether an opinion, possibly held conscientiously, whether rightly or wrongly, constitutes an infringement of the law. Even a sworn denial of membership of an illegal organisation will not suffice to prove a man's innocence.  What, might I ask, can an innocent person, so victimised, do in that type of situation? The Government propose that such a man may be fined and imprisoned for a considerable period, and have no redress against that conviction. All that is needed for such a travesty of justice to take place, is a strict enforcement of the law by a superintendent who sticks rigidly to the letter of the law, and takes no cognisance <Col N="604" /> of the spirit of the law.  In such a situation, a chief superintendent might have no alternative but to testify about such an individual.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman, Deputy Cooney, ably and amply pointed out that the existing law is adequate to deal with any occasions that might arise in which security is jeopardised in any way.  He also pointed out numerous instances in which the full rigour of the law has not been applied to offenders.  The Government have not convinced the Opposition or the people that the inadequacies are sufficient to justify such sweeping measures as those proposed in the amending Bill.</P>
    <P>One might ask if the situation has deteriorated to such an extent that these drastic measures have to be imposed, that virtual internment with a legal veneer is being imposed on our society.  One must also ask in those circumstances why no corrective measures have been taken over the past few years.  If the situation is really as serious as Government spokesmen would have us believe, then the Taoiseach is obliged to tell the nation exactly what the situation is.  He should tell the people the facts, tell them why these drastic measures, have in the Government's opinion, become essential for the maintenance of law and order.  If there is a virtual state of emergency in the offing, let this House decide in an open vote what measures should be taken to correct that situation.</P>
    <P>If, on the other hand, this legislation which I believe to be divisive and oppressive, is the first price we must pay for eventual reunification, dictated by an apparently unsympathetic British Government, who themselves are not prepared to introduce laws, if necessary, to curtail the violent activities of people in Northern Ireland who claim allegiance to the same queen as they do, then the whole matter should be viewed in an entirely different light.  It would appear from statements that even Unionist lawyers are appalled at the extent to which the Government propose to go in this amendment.</P>
    <P>This House has unanimously condemned the men of violence and those <Col N="605" /> who advocate the achievement of their objectives by violent means.  I submit that this proposed amending Bill has in it an inherent violence, a violence that is more sinister than the violence of the gunman, a violence that hits at the very roots of common justice, and at the individual.  If this Bill is passed, that inherent violence might, indeed, recoil and have very grave repercussions in our society and defeat the very objective for which the Government would have us believe they intend introducing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The speech to which we have just listened from Deputy Cott is a good example of the kind of brainwashing that has gone on about this Bill.  I say &ldquo;brainwashing&rdquo; because I believe Deputy Cott was quite sincere in what he said, and believed what he said was true.  Of course, it was not.  For instance, Deputy Cott said that under this Bill a situation was being created in which the accused had shifted to him the onus which formerly rested on the prosecution and that he would be deemed to be guilty until proved innocent.  The Bill does no such thing. He said we were making a chief superintendent judge and jury.  We do no such thing in this Bill.  We enable a chief superintendent to give evidence which under present law he is not allowed to give but the decision rests with the court subject to the normal rules of evidence and presumptions of innocence that always apply.</P>
      <P>He also said that having been convicted by a superintendent acting as judge and jury there was no right of appeal.  That statement is not true either.  I am not accusing Deputy Cott, as I say, of deliberately making misstatements about this Bill but I think he has allowed himself to be brainwashed as a number of other people have to some extent by members of his party who have other axes to grind and I will come to that before I am finished.</P>
      <P>I would say to the parties opposite, even if there is not anybody on the Labour benches at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy need not get excited yet.  I will give him more to be excited about before I finish. I would say to the Deputies over there that actions speak louder than words. They have heard it before.  This House has been deafened by statements, particularly from the Fine Gael Party but also from the Labour Party, about law and order, the maintenance of the institutions of this State.  The country has heard on many occasions from Deputies opposite on this subject.  Now is the test and the country will judge Deputies opposite not by what they have been saying but by what they do because, believe me, the people outside know what the issue is and as far as the Deputies opposite are concerned their test is coming.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the Bill the Minister for Justice detailed why it was necessary, what the provisions were, what their effect would be, quoted precedent for the provisions of section 3.  The Taoiseach, speaking last night, dealt with a number of the specious arguments that had been put forward on behalf of the Fine Gael Party by Deputy Cooney to show precisely why it was necessary to have this Bill and that the arguments that had been advanced to the effect that the existing law was sufficient to deal with the problem were simply not true.  I believe that in concluding the debate the Minister for Justice will deal in more detail with these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there was one argument put forward by Deputy Cooney early in his speech and the same argument was made by Deputy Tom O'Higgins in an interjection when the Taoiseach was speaking.  I think the sincerity or lack of sincerity of the Fine Gael Party in their attitude to this Bill can be judged on that argument.  Deputy Cooney said and Deputy O'Higgins <Col N="607" /> said the same thing in other words later on that if the Minister were making this case a fortnight ago one might have some sympathy for him but that recent events, specifically the conviction of Seán Mac Stiofáin, had given the lie to the Minister's arguments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney is a lawyer and Deputy O'Higgins is a lawyer and they do not even have to think to know how untrue that argument is.  A layman might have to think for a moment, but not for very long, to realise that the only reason that conviction took place was the special circumstances which emerged.  Is it seriously suggested over there that one can rely on similar kinds of circumstances in order to ensure the conviction of members of unlawful organisations or of leaders of unlawful organisations?  The Deputies over there know as well as I do and as well as everybody else does that the chances of that kind of circumstance arising are remote, to say the least, and yet they put forward that argument as a basic argument on this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a reason for this.  Deputy Cooney is an intelligent man, a man for whom I have the highest regard in so far as his intelligence goes.  Deputy O'Higgins is an intelligent man.  When men like that make arguments like that it is time to ask why are they making these specious arguments which are beneath them, which are not worthy of the men who make them?  They have a reason.  I would suggest that nobody here should deceive himself.</P>
    <P>We have seen one of the classic dilemmas facing democrats and democratic governments at all times, a dilemma which will always face a democratic government, that is, that those who want to destroy democracy take full advantage of democratic liberties to do so.  Of course, they abuse those liberties.  They seek loopholes in the law and they try public tolerance to its limits.  It has been the case that in some countries in the past the democratic institutions have not been strong enough.  I want to make it clear here, whatever the Labour Party or the Fine Gael Party <Col N="608" /> may do, we in Fianna Fáil will not fail the Irish people.  We will go as far as we have to go and not an inch further to deal with subversion but deal with it we will.</P>
    <P>I said that I hoped nobody here would try to deceive himself.  The issue facing this House in this debate is whether this State is to be governed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and the elected Government or whether illegal groups are to hold sway.  The well-organised series of demonstrations around the Dáil conform to a classic pattern.  There are people in Berlin and in Nuremberg who will remember this pattern.  All of the ingredients are there &mdash;the hypnotic chant, the burning effigies, the looming threats of violence. They are all there.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for many of the sensible journalists of this country who have found themselves manoeuvred very cleverly in the past few days by an activist clique who do not care a damn about free speech or about freedom of the press, or of radio or of television.  I want to ask a question of that clique and I would hope that they would have the honesty to print that question.  We have heard about the public's right to know, but I want to know why did the public not have the right to know and where was the indignation of journalists when the leader of an illegal organisation in County Meath walked into the home of one of their fellow journalists, kicked him around in the presence of <Col N="611" /> his wife and children and threatened to shoot him because they disapproved of something that man had written. Why was there no resolution from any union branch, why was there no editorial comment or any mention in the national dailies and where was the secretary of the Dublin Branch of the NUJ when a fellow journalist was beaten up brutally in the presence of his family?  This, I suggest, is selective indignation.  Mr. Kevin O'Kelly, as is now evident, had access to the protection of the law.  There was no protection, but rather the stark threat of death, for his colleague in Trim in this sad affair.  There were some honourable exceptions and I would like to pay tribute to them.  One provincial paper in the West and one journalist writing in one of the Dublin papers were not afraid of intimidation. Frankly, I see red when I hear all the clap-trap about freedom of the press.

      <P>It is time we all had a look at our slogans.  In this debate one can argue about some technicalities of the Bill but everybody in the House and outside it knows what is the real issue.  I wish to say a word about the attitude during the debate of both the parties opposite.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned, Deputy Corish attempted to lecture this party because he said some of our members were sympathetic to the Provisional IRA.  Some of his colleagues followed the same line.  I suggest that they have an unmitigated cheek.  Their primary responsibility is for their own party.  Let them have a look at their party and at what has been happening within the party.  If ever there was a two-faced party on the issue before the House today, that party are the Labour Party.  Pious declarations from some of their members condemning illegal organisations have been emerging with great regularity but what are the facts?  Do we forget Deputy Thornley's attitude on the Prisons Bill?  Do we forget his actions on Sunday last?  Do we forget Deputy Treacy's purple passages in this House <Col N="612" /> in favour of the IRA?  Do we forget Deputy Coughlan's statement, which is reported at column 1184, volume 258 of the Dáil Official Report, when he said that the IRA speak for more than 80 per cent of the people of Ireland?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am finding fault with what Deputy Treacy had to say in that speech and I am pointing out that the Labour Party are the party who are facing two ways on this issue and they are accusing us of doing so. Any examination of the speeches or actions of the Labour Party will show that they are split down the middle on this issue.  That is why on this Bill there could not be any question of the Labour Party even considering supporting this Bill because they know <Col N="613" /> if the members of their party, who would have been disposed to do so, tried to do so, not alone would they have split their party irrevocably but they would have drawn even more attention to the ambivalence which exists in the Labour Party on the subject of the IRA.  That is the fact.</P>
      <P>Let us deal with Fine Gael because I think as far as they are concerned we have an even worse and an even more irresponsible position than in the Labour Party.  We have been hearing from Fine Gael speakers <i>ad nauseum</i> on the question of protecting the institutions of this State.  We have literally been deafened by Deputy L'Estrange in this House on the subject. I do not think anybody would quarrel with me when I say that.  The clear implication in all of these statements, when it was not stated explicitly, was that Fine Gael would not hesitate to support any measures aimed at curbing the activities of illegal organisations.</P>
      <P>Their protestations were so vehement that their total opposition to this Bill has left their supporters aghast and has nonplussed a number of political observers.  The reasons for this strange and, indeed, unprecedented situation are so sordid, so cynical, so contemptuous of the intelligence of the voters, so governed by personal ambition and so lacking in concern for the national interest as to be almost beyond belief.  Most people know that there have been upheavals and dissent in the Fine Gael Party for quite some time. There are some ambitious and unscrupulous men in the Fine Gael front bench who have tried everything they know to get rid of their Leader, Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>The dithering, the failure to match actions to words, the opportunism and the cowardice displayed on the Opposition benches on this issue will have removed any lingering doubt that anyone may have had as to the unfitness of the parties opposite to govern this country.  Indeed, it has raised starkly the question of the fitness of some of the people over there to sit in this House at all.  That question will be answered by the people at the next election and I look forward avidly to the answer to <Col N="620" /> that question.  It cannot come too soon for me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my long experience in public life and in this House I do not know of any piece of legislation which has caused such widespread indignation and hostility as this one. It is said to be anti-IRA but it clearly offends the susceptibilities of all our people over the whole spectrum of our society.  The indignation is to be seen in all facets of society&mdash;judges, lawyers, groups of priests, educationalists, journalists, trade unionists.  Members of virtually all organisations in the country are astonished and dismayed that this piece of reprehensible legislation should be brought in here under the guise of securing law and order.</P>
      <P>I listened to most of what the Minister for Finance had to say.  He was caustic in his remarks about members of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, but it comes ill from this Minister to try to pretend to the Irish people that they and they alone in Fianna Fáil are the saviours of law and order in our society.  As the Minister knows full well, he would not be sitting in that seat here tonight as Minister for Finance, were it not that a colleague of his was sacked, in the person of Deputy Charles Haughey.  He knows full well and better than anyone in the House why Deputy Haughey was ignominiously dismissed at that time.  It was for acts deemed to undermine the security of this State that he was sacked.  It would have been a treasonable crime in any other country, and there were many other sackings as well, but I have a lot of respect for Deputy Colley, Minister for Finance, who was portrayed to the Irish people a short time ago as the greatest republican of them all.  It was Deputy Aiken who sought to place across his shoulder the cloak of republicanism <i>par excellence.</i> He was said to have the condonance of President Éamon de Valera in his bid for the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We all know the manner in which his ghost writers of that day portrayed him to us as the great republican.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> Are we to take it that he has gone back on all he ever stood for as a republican because this Bill is a betrayal of all that Fianna Fáil ever stood for, a betrayal of national aims and aspirations, and in particular a betrayal of the beleaguered people of north-east Ulster tonight?  What then of Deputy Colley's republicanism?</P>
    <P>It is true that we live in very difficult and, indeed, dangerous times.  It is true that all our people dearly wish for peace, tranquillity and normality to return, but if it is to be a true and lasting peace in Ireland, north and south, it has to be an honourable peace.  What we are asked to vote on here tonight is a Bill which is designed to subjugate the people of Ireland, especially the people of north-east Ulster, to Unionism, to the dictates of the British, and that in my opinion is most certainly not the road to peace and to tranquillity in Ireland.  This Bill will not merely subjugate the people in this part of Ireland; it will subjugate the people of all Ireland and is designed to set the clock back 100 years at least in the Republic.</P>
    <P>There are contained in this legislation far-reaching and sweeping changes in the law which affects the traditional rights of all our people. Inherent in this measure is the clear denial of fundamental rights and essential liberties.  Freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of assembly, freedom of the Press, TV and radio, the right to a fair trial before the law&mdash;all these fundamental issues are involved in this measure, and there is no good in Fianna Fáil or any of their party spokesmen concealing the grave and serious implications of this Bill.  The rights cherished by our people are being attacked in a most serious way. Already we have had here in the Twenty-six Counties a most serious erosion of our essential rights.  We have seen the setting up of special courts, devoid and bereft of juries as such; we have seen the creation of internment camps to which we said we were implacably opposed and one internment camp which has been established is operating now at the Curragh under the guise of repairs being carried out <Col N="622" /> to Mountjoy Jail.  We have seen moreover the transfer of prisoners from the judicial authority to the military authority under this guise also.</P>
    <P>We have had here, too, another piece of repressive legislation in the recent passing of the Forcible Entry Bill which is being used for purposes this House never intended.  It is being used to beat down the tenants' associations and to deprive these organisations of their fundamental right to defend the interests of the tenants of this country.  It has been used against journalists and assurances were given in this House that amendments would be brought in and we are still waiting for these amendments.  We have had, too, something which shocked the conscience of all freedom-loving people in the ignominious sacking of the board of Radio Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>This is by any standard a most vicious and repressive piece of legislation, one of the most ruthless pieces of legislation ever introduced in these islands, Britain or Ireland, in recent times.  It seeks to set back the clock some hundreds of years in the Republic. I believe that it is fascist in its conception and dictatorial in its designs.  It is a challenge to the cherished liberties of all our people and I say sincerely that I never thought I would see such a despicable piece of legislation introduced into an Irish Parliament.  It brings shame and disgrace upon our country.  The Fianna Fáil Government are now recognised for what they are, a byword for repression and degeneracy among progressive democratic States.  This movement away from the democratic institutions we cherish has even gone beyond that which exists in the last bastion of tyranny in Europe&mdash;in Northern Ireland.  It has gone beyond the extremes of the ruthless legislation and the overbearing tyranny that battened on the minority there for the past half-century.  The odious system which so many of us sought to bring down in north-east Ulster, to our shame is now emulated in this House by Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party in brackets.</P>
    <P>How can we talk about civil rights in Ireland?  How we can advance the <Col N="623" /> cause of civil rights?  How we can talk about the shame and disgrace of internment without trial, which every political party in this country, with the exception of the Unionists, have set their faces against?  How can we go to the European Court and speak about human rights?  How can we seek amelioration there for the oppressed people in north-east Ulster?  By this action the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach, Deputy Jackie Fahey and those in Fianna Fáil are setting back irreparably the advance of the Irish nation towards unity, freedom and peace.</P>
    <P>We cannot speak about these fundamental issues any more because this legislation which Fianna Fáil have had the audacity to bring in is designed clearly to shackle and to silence all those people in Ireland who dare to assert their rights and speak out against the regime.  The tragedy is that in this process the Government are abandoning the people of north-east Ulster in their greatest hour of need. The only people who are encouraged and heartened by this legislation are the Unionists.  The Craigs and the Faulkners are on record as saying: &ldquo;Jack is right&rdquo;.  This measure has brought joy and solace to the enemies of Ireland but it saddens the hearts of those of us who aspired to a united Ireland.  This is an act of great betrayal of national abasement, and Fianna Fáil must suffer retribution for this great betrayal.  They are now seen clearly doing the dirty work for the Unionists and carrying out the dictates of the British in this important matter.</P>
    <P>It is a despicable sell-out of national aspirations.  It condones and emulates all we found abhorrent and detestable in the Stormont regime, possibly the most sordid, corrupt, overbearing and tyrannical regime in Europe.  This Bill has offended all who believe sincerely in human rights and fundamental freedoms.  It may be the last piece of legislation of the present Government and it will go down in history as an act of treachery, a blot on our society, to the eternal shame and disgrace of Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil have reneged on all they stood and fought for during the years.  The Taoiseach said <Col N="624" /> he would not stand idly by.  Tonight he is not standing idly by.  He has obviously shifted his feet and has gone over to the other side, over to the Unionists.  He has left the minority, of which he declared he would be the second guarantor, at the mercy of the Orange mobs.  Bereft of hope, tonight they are defenceless and betrayed by Jack Lynch, his Government and his party.  I do not believe this Government can be forgiven for such an act of national abasement.</P>
    <P>The most disgusting aspect of this measure is the statement by Fianna Fáil that they need this draconian repressive legislation to maintain law and order, to put down the IRA and the subversive organisations.  Fianna Fáil must think the people have very short memories.  Only a short time ago there were sensational events in this House and it was revealed that the people who were undermining law and order and the security of the State were Fianna Fáil Ministers, Deputies and supporters.  Not only did Fianna Fáil not take steps over the past three years to deal with subversion but we know in this House, and I know in particular as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, that they aided, and condoned subversion.  Far from interfering in order to eliminate subversion they were clearly seen to interfere with the due process of law in 1969 and that interference with the courts and due process of law and the action of the police was such as to bring about the resignation of the then secretary of the Department of Justice who resigned in utter disgust.</P>
    <P>Are the Irish people, are the Members of this House expected to forget the gun-running of 1969 in which so many of the Fianna Fáil Party Ministers and supporters were clearly involved? Did Government Ministers not give aid and succour to subversive organisations?  Did they not give money and guns?  Is this not a fact?  Are we to take it that this is the party which is genuinely concerned about law and order?  Apart altogether from the misappropriation of a large amount of public funds used in an endeavour to bring in a large consignment of arms to this country, is it not a fact that ordinary Fianna Fáil Party members <Col N="625" /> gloated over going about in recent years and securing guns and arms anywhere they could and handing them over joyfully and gleefully to members of various organisations?  We had that on the records of the House from an ex-member of the Fianna Fáil Party and now Aontacht Éireann Member, Deputy Sherwin.</P>
    <P>They assisted by money and guns the organisation they now seek to outlaw and put down in this Bill, and they want us and the Irish people to accept that they are doing it in the interests of law and order.  What right have this Government to talk about law and order?  They fooled no one.  Is it not a fact that after this Dáil had been elected in 1969 evidence very quickly emerged that Government Ministers were hellbent on taking over and controlling the IRA?  Were Fianna Fáil not responsible for splitting the IRA and the Sinn Féin movement in a nefarious design to control one part of it and destroy the other?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil must accept the main brunt of responsibility for the present state of affairs in our country.  They cannot expect to be bailed out by the Labour Party or any other party.  A Fianna Fáil Minister and a Government had the brazen audacity in recent days to sack the RTE Authority allegedly for presenting or preaching subversion on television and radio.  The Government sacked that authority because it gave vent to the voice of republicanism and, at the same time, they allowed the voice of extreme Orangeism and Unionism to rant and rave on.  They sacked the RTE Authority and they expect us to forget that in 1969, with the approval of certain Fianna Fáil Ministers&mdash;and I would say with the approval of the Government&mdash;they set about the establisment of a clandestine paper known as &ldquo;The Voice of the North&rdquo; to pump propaganda into north-east Ulster.  A sizeable amount of public funds were misappropriated for that purpose, the purpose of subversion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government were prepared to embark upon this propaganda device and yet they now have the audacity to suppress the freedom of television, radio and press in this part of Ireland.  It seems that the wheel has turned full circle in this regard.  Fianna Fáil are fooling nobody; they want to create the impression that they alone are the saviours of law and order when everyone knows that Ministers and members of that Government were the first to undermine the security of this State and drag law and order into disrepute.  This Bill is not merely designed to put down the IRA; it undermines the rights and the liberties of all our people.  No citizen is free under this measure.  No citizen is free from interrogation by a member of the Garda.  No group can assemble or march peacefully any more without tending to violate this measure.  No journalist can publish freely.  Television and radio are clearly circumscribed. The fate of all of us now rests with the say-so of a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána.  If we are found to have been near a place where an offence was committed we must answer for our actions.  We must give name and address, account for our movements, <Col N="627" /> and if we talk we may incriminate ourselves.  If we talk we are clearly becoming informers and if we do not talk we are deemed to be guilty anyway, and there is the penalty of £ 200 fine or 12 months in jail.</P>
      <P>This is the kind of legislation we used to associate with Russia, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy or the Smith regime in Rhodesia.  This legislation has no place whatsoever in the lives of the Irish people and it will be resisted with all the power and influence at our disposal.  It is bunkum for the Minister for Justice to talk about a fair trial or cross-examination of a chief superintendent.  Was there ever an occasion in the long history of jurisprudence and court procedure when a judge failed to accept the word on oath of a superintendent or a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána?  It is simply not on.</P>
      <P>This Bill is essentially despicable in that, for the first time, you are declared to be guilty until you prove yourself innocent.  This is a radical change in the law and is repulsive to all sections of our people.  Equality before the law is guaranteed in our Constitution and there are many who feel that this Bill is repugnant to the Constitution.  It is no longer accepted that you are innocent until proved guilty, and the onus of proving innocence is placed on the individual, and the word of a chief superintendent will determine whether you are convicted or not.</P>
      <P>This is typical Fianna Fáil legislation: shoot first and ask questions afterwards.  Get them and put them away by fair or foul means.  The Bill has far-reaching implications and has the features of a panic measure, a Bill conceived and drawn up in fear, the device of a frightened Government, frightened by an enemy, imaginary or otherwise, but if that enemy is there it is of Fianna Fáil's making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the sacking of the board of Telefís Éireann, the freedom of the Press is severely interfered with in this Bill.  The Press are clearly placed in an invidious position.  They may not be clearly committing an offence under the Bill, as the Minister <Col N="628" /> says, but they will certainly be open to criticism or far worse for publishing statements or photographs which may lead to the arrest, trial and conviction of people.  In such a situation the Press are circumscribed.  They will be slow to report events, meetings, marches and demonstrations, which are very largely proscribed in this Bill; and they will be slow to publish names, speeches and photographs lest they incriminate innocent people as well as guilty.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of this Bill deals, in particular, with alleged interference with the course of justice.  Public statements, oral or in writing, any meetings, processions, and demonstrations in public that constitute interference with the course of justice, are deemed to be unlawful under this measure. If this section of the Bill is passed any meeting, procession or demonstration is likely to be unlawful.  No one seemingly, according to Fianna Fáil, will be allowed to protest about any issue whatsoever.  No one will be allowed to protest, for instance, about the trial and sentence of Kevin O'Kelly or about the hunger strike of Seán Mac Stiofáin or anything else without incurring the displeasure of the Government and breaking the law.  Tenants associations would be outside the law in demonstrating or protesting about evictions while a case for ejectment might be before the courts.  This is an ominous piece of legislation for all organisations and for the trade union movement at large.  The trade union movement are conscious of the inroads which this measure seeks to make into their liberty and they are not accepting it. The fines in respect of this measure are vicious.  The sentences prescribed are vicious.  The fines here are not £ 100, but £ 1,000.  The sentence is not for one year, but for five years.</P>
    <P>Freedom of association, of assembly, of speech and of the press are fundamental to our Irish way of life.  They must be and will be maintained at all costs, come hell or high water.  No piece of legislation which does not meet with the respect or approval of the mass of our people can work.  This has been demonstrated on many occasions.  This piece of legislation <Col N="629" /> offends against all our highest principles and all cherished beliefs and fundamental rights.  It cannot operate against the wishes of the majority of our people.  It must not and will not be allowed to operate.</P>
    <P>I trust that this Bill will be treated with the disdain and contempt by the mass of our people, which it deserves.  Outside this House there is massed opposition to this legislation Inside the House there is a united opposition.  There are some dissidents and defections from the Government party as well.  It is true to say that many of the Fianna Fáil Party will vote for this measure with their feet and not with their hearts.  If they had the courage of their convictions they would never lend their support to such a piece of repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>The spirit of the Irish people would want to be stone dead to accept this measure or allow it to be implemented. All our national aims and cherished rights cannot and will not be filched away from us like this by a Government which have reneged on all they ever stood for.  I believe that this piece of legislation will be seen for what it is&mdash;a piece of bluff and political window dressing to give a veneer of decency, solidarity and respectability to a tattered party.  It will be seen for what it is&mdash;a piece of utter hypocrisy.  Fundamentally, I believe that the Irish people will never bow the knee or be slaves to an arrogant, neo-Fascist regime.</P>
    <P>This is a black day in the history of this Dáil.  It is a black day in the history of the country because the blinds are coming down on freedom and democracy all around us.  It is for us in these benches to ensure that the torch of liberty shines on.  Fianna Fáil will soon realise that they cannot force the Irish people, north and south, to abandon national aims, total freedom and sovereignty.  Ireland's historic claim is for total freedom and the Government which accept anything less will be repudiated by the Irish people.  I am convinced of that.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are now seen for what they are&mdash;the Unionist Party of Southern Ireland.  They have the same designs for power in perpetuity.  They <Col N="630" /> have the same desire to bend the institutions of our State towards their own ends.  I am pleased to speak from these benches here tonight and to pledge the implacable opposition of the Labour Party to this despicable measure.  We will fight it at every Stage.  We will fight it by any means at our disposal.  We are confident that, when the Irish people get the opportunity, they will reject outright the Government which sought to impose this despicable measure on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This proposed legislation which we have before us now is certainly, for all of us, rather a shock.  It is a shock because there does not seem to be the slightest reason why any additional laws of repression are needed in this country at the moment.  It is a surprise because of the fact that the laws which we now have have been successfully bent in these recent months and years in order to try to put away those who did not agree with the outlook of the establishment&mdash;which is rather a new outlook&mdash;as has been remarked by many speakers tonight.  That we should have it raises the first question in my mind.  Why should we have this sort of legislation?  Who wants it? What is the need for it?  Is there any true, clear indication given by the Minister why, even as he sees things at the moment, he needs further laws in order not just to prosecute Republicans and their sympathisers in this country but to persecute them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can we possibly listen with any sort of quiet on our part to a Minister talking, on behalf of the Government, about the weaknesses that they have discovered in the laws? How can we listen to a further spokesman for the Government explaining, when he was asked why did they not tell the Opposition what the weaknesses were so that they could get together and sort them out, that, if they did that, and if they made known what the weaknesses were, the subversives and others would take advantage of those weaknesses to do still greater depredation?  Can anybody seriously consider those two attitudes from two front bench members of the Government?  Can anybody regard <Col N="631" /> them with anything but distaste and distrust in the knowledge that both must be dishonest.  We ask ourselves has the law not worked beyond that which it was ever intended to do when we find the like of Máire Drumm being released two days ago, after spending 22 days in custody for a statement alleged to have been made by her last St. Patrick's Day, a statement which was said to be an incitement. An incitement to what?  An incitement to whose disadvantage? Máire Drumm at that time, as far as I know, and I have the very great privilege of knowing this lady for a considerable time, had two sons and her husband interned.  I thank the gentleman of the liberal Labour Party who made the scathing remark, if it was a member of the Labour Party.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I could have guessed. It could not have been anybody else in the Labour Party who would have that attitude in circumstances such as this.  Máire Drumm was 22 days in custody, awaiting trial for something she said on St. Patrick's Day, something which apparently displeased the Occupation Forces and the Crown representatives in the Six Counties and across in Westminster.  We had to nail this lady down in order to placate those people whom we now seem to be collaborating with and with whom we seem to be in collusion in order to try to beat the last vestiges of republicanism out of the people in this part of the country and in the Six Counties as well.  Is the law that could bring this about defective?  This lady had two sons and her husband interned at that particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going into any of the gory details which could be added with regard to the tortures and the treatment to which these people were subjected, and which we here hypocritically are protesting about by way of a case stated to the Court of Human Rights, is our law so defective that it can do that to which I have referred in those circumstances after all these months? Is there not something very wrong with <Col N="632" /> a law that allows this sort of thing to happen in those circumstances?  Is there not something wrong with that law when a man can be served on 23rd June with a summons relating to an alleged statement made by him on the previous 9th September?  I saw that summons issued to a constituent of mine.  The 23rd June was the first he heard of an intended prosecution and of that to which it was alleged to refer. The statement was said to be inciting and he was taken before the courts and charged.  In all truth and honesty, no man, after nine months, without notice of prosecution, could possibly recall what he said, could possibly, in all genuineness, either affirm or deny what he had or had not said at that particular time, or day, or date nine months previously.</P>
    <P>What are we trying to do?  Who are we trying to suppress?  Whom are we trying to please?  This is really what comes through from all these things and this is far removed from the attitude of the Fine Gael Party, who allege that the laws are adequate but are not being applied.  I reckon they are more than adequate and they are being rigorously, too rigorously, applied.  It is not more of these laws we need at this particular time.  After the three horrible, tragic years in the north-east of this country of ours, without any real trouble descending upon us, much though we deserved it, we should now be gladly considering the wiping out and the deletion from our Statute Book of the mother and father of this amendment, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the amending Act of 1940.  We do not need them.  That has been proved beyond any doubt.  There is no need for any of these laws at this time and, if ever there was a time of testing to find whether or not they were needed, surely to God the last three years has been that time.</P>
    <P>Do we want, following the wild fantasies of the Minister for Justice, to provoke trouble in this country to justify the laws and the abuse of those laws, the abuse that has already occurred, by bringing in yet more repressive laws in order deliberately to provoke?  Is this Bill, in fact, part of a plot hatched over the last ten days in <Col N="633" /> which the arrest of Mac Stiofáin was to be the catalyst to bring about trouble in the streets of Dublin and make it so that no Member of this House could, in the light of the outcry that would bring from the public, vote against the Bill?</P>
    <P>Maybe I am being very cynical and maybe not, but there is a fair belief in the minds of many people that this is why Mac Stiofáin could be arrested a couple of weeks after the Minister for Justice stood up here or, perhaps, elsewhere&mdash;I do not remember&mdash;and, on being chided as to why this man could freely come and go to the Sinn Féin Árd Fheis in Liberty Hall, stated that there was no case against him. I want to know what did he do since then that made it possible for a case to be taken against him?  I want to know why whatever it was that he had done was not produced in evidence when he was prosecuted only a week ago.  I want to know of what he was convicted.  I want to know what the evidence was and how it came about.  I think we will be asking these questions for quite a long time before we eventually get the answers. Unfortunately it will not be soon enough to thwart the efforts of the present Government to further provoke a situation that will bring them into the realm they now claim to be in, the realm of the protectors of the peace and the guardians of law and order.  In fact, there is no danger of any kind except of their own imagining or of their own making.</P>
    <P>We sat here during the night hours 2½ years or more ago and we listened then to the most dishonest prognostications and scare stories from the Fianna Fáil front bench about the imminent danger of civil war.  Dear God, surely the time since then has proven that those statements were abject lies at that time, that there was no truth whatever in them.  In fact, there is no truth in them today, except that danger is possibly nearer because of the attitude of the Government, the Government which have reversed their engines completely and absolutely and are now trying to justify their doing so by letting down and betraying the friends of those days, the friends they now call the enemies <Col N="634" /> of the people.</P>
    <P>This is the background to this sordid, repressive piece of proposed legislation.  This is what was brought into this House yesterday and today, and it is being supported by speeches, some of them no doubt well meant, and made in good faith as a result of listening to &ldquo;his master's voice&rdquo; but without real thought, without real examination, without people asking themselves are these repressive, nasty, new laws really necessary.  Is there one indication, is there one iota of evidence&mdash;and you would need a lot&mdash; to support the plea that further and more repressive laws are needed and that these laws, even if they infringe the rights of the people deeply and gravely, are justified because of the situation, the crisis, the emergency that exists in our community?</P>
    <P>I say there is no crisis.  I say there is no emergency and there has not been for the past three years.  There will not be, provided the people in Government today have enough sense to fall back even at this late stage, and realise that they have allowed their enthusiasm in their new found antagonism towards republican ideals, to run away with them.  I tell them sincerely, and in order to avoid the trouble that they are allegedly trying to prevent, that the surest and truest way of getting real trouble in this country is to impose that sort of law unnecessarily on a freedom loving people.</P>
    <P>Those who try to put this across on our people will have a lot to answer for if they succeed.  I only hope they do not, for their own sake as well as the sake of the rest of the people.  I believe that, if this is enacted, we will really get a taste of what we have been turning our backs on, and not wanting to see although it was there, in the Six Counties for the past three years.  Cannot we get a little sanity even at this late stage?  It would not be a loss of face for any Government to recognise the plea of the people on the streets, well behaved, remember, despite the emotive and emotional circumstances of last weekend. Surely if any proof was needed by the Government that there is no intention <Col N="635" /> and no wish and no desire to have bloodshed on the streets of Dublin or any other part of the Twenty-six Counties, that peaceful demonstration which went off with thousands there coming out, without any planned arrangements, from all walks of life, should be positive proof that there is no need for this sort of legislation.</P>
    <P>Last night there were a couple of thousand gardaí and troops surrounding this place from the early afternoon while it was still bright, and not a being out there on the streets, but with the gates closed as if we were under siege.  I remarked to some of the people I met when I saw this: &ldquo;The only thing they must be trying to keep out is the rain,&rdquo; because it was raining very heavily.  Nobody was trying to break the place down.  Nobody was attempting to do so.</P>
    <P>Surely it is a well-known and well established fact that, if the Establishment of any country, and particularly in a democracy, show that they are expecting and, indeed, almost welcoming this sort of disorder, then it follows very often that they get it.  Make the preparations so obvious and you raise in the minds of people who otherwise would not in any way be disorderly an antagonism that may bring them out in large numbers to do things they had no wish or intention to do.  Last night's display of strength around this House was, wittingly or otherwise, most provocative. Despite the provocation, and despite the fact that thousands turned up, despite the deluge of rain, I have not heard even from the most prejudiced source that there was any cause for complaint about the overall behaviour of that large crowd.</P>
    <P>Surely this must be evidence to the Government that this sort of law is unnecessary.  It must be further evidence that a great wave of feeling is developing throughout the country, in all walks of life and amongst all sorts of people and, indeed, funnily enough, more so in the more adult population, than in the younger population, against this sort of suppression.  Surely the Government must be aware of this through their contacts throughout <Col N="636" /> the country.  Surely they are not blind to the signs.  The real danger is emerging now and they are, wittingly or unwittingly, provoking it.  It is being provoked; do not let us have any doubt about that.</P>
    <P>We hear some rare explanations of this Bill.  I was, perhaps, fortunate enough to listen to the explanation by the Minister for Transport and Power this evening.  As soon as I heard he was on I said: &ldquo;That is for me.  This will be no problem.&rdquo; Neither was it.  There is no doubt about it: the veneer was there, put on, polished up and put across, but still falling very far short of being convincing.</P>

Let us not minimise it.  This is the fact.  I am not belittling the Garda.  I am belittling the defence that has been made by the Minister and others of the non-hurtful nature of the subsections in this proposed legislation.  That chief superintendent will come in, in those circumstances. Let us suppose it was the name Des Foley which came up seven, eight or nine stages from the tout down the line.  The fact is that the chief superintendent puts the finger out and says that Foley is, in fact, as far as he believes a member of an illegal organisation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons advanced to me by the Minister for Justice at the time was that the special courts procedure would help to get on with the business of the courts which was then in bad arrears.  I asked at the time how do you proceed to make up a backlog of business that is already there in the operation of our courts of justice by putting three men doing one man's job and removing jury trial in cases of this kind of offence.  That is only as a digression from the two arguments advanced as to the safeguards that exist for a person brought before the court.  I am not sure as to whether <Col N="638" /> or not this also includes being brought before the special court.  That has not emerged as yet.  I should like to be informed as to whether the special court will be the court or one of the courts before which the chief superintendent will point the finger and say on information seven or eight times removed so-and-so is a member of an illegal organisation and the person goes into the box, very annoyed, and says: &ldquo;I am not a member.  I have never been a member and have no intention of becoming a member&rdquo; and then we have the boys at him.  Before they let him out of there the possibility is they will in one shape or another have elicited more from him, to his own detriment and against his own defence than was against him when the chief superintendent put his finger on him in the first place.</P>
      <P>Secondly, we have the great and much lauded advantage of the chief superintendent, if you do not mind, being cross-examined.  Who do the people in the front bench who have advanced this as a reason think they are codding?  It just does not operate that way and every Member who said otherwise knows it does not operate that way and that the chief superintendent will, in fact, as he is wont to do in all cases, claim privilege. I saw a chief superintendent not so very long ago in the Four Courts claiming privilege.  Is that same chief superintendent of the Special Branch the chief superintendent that this law is being passed to use and not the ordinary decent chief superintendents throughout the country and have we to bring in the other 22 or 23 in order to give to this chief superintendent the power to put people away at his dictates or on the instructions or whispers of the desires of his political bosses?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can we have a clear picture?  If this should, unfortunately, go through and is not withdrawn, which would be the sensible thing to do, are we going to have the chief superintentdent, the boss of the Special Branch, operating this law in his own particular, peculiar, special way?  Are we going to have such a man as has indicated in the court that as the day changes and the weather changes so <Col N="639" /> could he change his evidence on oath? Are we prepared to give to such a man who before our own committee set up by this House made absolutely dishonest and untrue allegations this overall power?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the same man, whose position, perhaps rightly, has been defended by the custodian of order in this House, who took it on himself to make his foul and untrue and dishonest allegations and to name people where they had no opportunity of defending themselves when he was sitting down in that room being heard by this committee.  If we had nothing else to go on but our knowledge of this man, surely that would be sufficient to say &ldquo;Stop&rdquo;.  Even if the law was needed, this man should be excluded from the use of it even if the other 22 chief superintendents were entitled to use it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are we then going to bring about a catastrophe?  For what unknown, obscure reason is it being attempted to be perpetrated at this time?  Why are we trying to provoke by over suppressing the already suppressed?  Why should this be so?  What is the need for it?  These are questions that the Government must have asked themselves before they came to a decision even to consider doing this.  It was said here tonight by a Government speaker that this was not of the Government's making, that this thought came from the permanent law officers or law officer, those who are practised in and have had long experience of operating the laws of this land, that it was they who found the defects in <Col N="640" /> our law to be to such a degree that they were able to convince, the Minister for Justice presumably, and he in turn convinced the Government, no doubt after a great struggle, that the law was so defective that he needed much more severe, repressive legislation.</P>
    <P>Did the Government at that time really go into this need that was alleged to exist by these very silent and well practised and long experienced law officers?  Were they thoroughly cross-examined, if not by all of the members of the Cabinet, at least by the members who are also members of the legal profession? Were they made to justify the suggestion that there had been a disastrous lack of application of law due to a lack of law or a weakness in our laws over the recent years?  Has that been attempted to be done?  Was it sought?  Why has the House not been given the benefit in detail and the case samples of what brought this necessity upon us?  That is the very least that would be expected from any body, Government or otherwise, who would at this time attempt to bring into existence laws which, because they are unnecessary, bring only trouble in their train rather than, as is claimed, settle things so that there will be no more bother.</P>
    <P>There is not much bother.  There was far more bother four, five, six, seven years ago on many occasions than we have seen in these recent times.  In fact, the times are quite quiet, despite the fact that we have the odd explosion taking place now south of the Border and that the very well-known UDA organisation are actually facilitating us by claiming credit, or otherwise, for them and that, by some strange device, people divine that it is not the people who have claimed to have done what would seem to them logical to do, by blowing up something on this side of the Border, but we are informed by reason of some mysterious divine insight that it was the IRA who were responsible. There was a bomb explosion in a public house in St. Johnston in my constituency.  It was not very serious but, perhaps, its implications were great.  The UDA claimed responsibility <Col N="641" /> for it but despite that a statement was issued 24 hours later to the effect that the Garda believed that the IRA were responsible.  Was it not quick work to disbelieve the UDA and place the blame on the IRA? However, there has not been one shred of evidence since to indicate that the IRA were responsible and neither has there been any sign of a prosecution being brought.  I suggest to the Minister that he pass the case to the Minister for Justice.  Without any great perceptive ability in the field of detection, if the Minister were to ;7spend a day in St. Johnston I am sure he would come back with the names of the people who were responsible for that explosion and they are not in the IRA, whatever else they may be in.</P>
    <P>What is the end product desired by these efforts on the part of the Government? The same sort of situation arose last week-end after the unfortunate incident in Dublin.  While there was no claim for responsibility for that, we were told that the IRA were responsible.  If there is no evidence to support that claim why was it made?  Why do we go out of our way in this manner?  It is to try to nail people or organisations while not producing any evidence to sustain the allegations.  If there is evidence, let us have it but if there is not let there be silence at least until sufficient evidence to back such claims would come to light.  Are we so imbued in following the propaganda machine that almost continuously spews out anti-Republican, pro-Unionist propaganda from Lisburn that we can see any happening only as the work of the IRA?  This is the manner in which the Lisburn propaganda machine works.  It is well known that some of those in the Press who have the temerity to keep in touch continuously with these people for the purpose of obtaining whatever handouts are available, are given tomorrow's news today because a story is written already to cover any eventuality and in all cases the culprits are the IRA.</P>
    <P>Do we recall a few weeks ago an incident when a lad of about 14 was shot for allegedly shooting at the <Col N="642" /> army.  It was reported here immediately that when the lad dropped his rifle a woman who was standing by grabbed it and ran away with it but that when she was shouted at to halt she was shot.  That story came from Lisburn.  It was the story that our media were expected to put out straight away but a couple of hours later there was a denial from the army that the incident had taken place as described in the report and that the woman was an innocent by-stander who was shot accidentally by one of the soldiers or by somebody else. These are isolated but typical cases of what is going on there day after day and we here through our blinkered outlook are only too ready to take what we get from there and give it the first flush of publicity.  No matter what denials emerge, the lies are never corrected.  Why do we not suppress this sort of news?  Why do we not put a stop on a story until somebody whom we know would make some inquiries through the sources best known to them had done so? Why do we issue these handouts to our own radio and television media without making an effort to establish the truth from the pressman on the ground or even from the representatives up there of our own media? All the time we run out with hands up to help those who would put an end to the whole concept of unity for this country.  Why must a native Irish government representing the people of 26 of our counties behave in this way?</P>
    <P>I know the members of the Government individually and I can ask with, perhaps, more wonder and amazement than people on the other side of the House can realise what has gone wrong with the Government. For a time I may have been annoyed but now I am utterly amazed as to what happened and I am saddened by it.  Even on this very serious problem and at this late stage could they even attempt to explain what has brought about this behaviour on their part?  If they made such an attempt, perhaps we would be able to see that we err in our ways and not they in theirs.  However, we have not had explanations.  Occasionally we are <Col N="643" /> abused or are subjected to snide remarks or criticism but there is never any question of explanation as to how this amazing change came about to such a degree that the members of that party with whom I have worked and who I admired and was glad to work with&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Is the lack on the part of the few of us here because we are few and must they be right?  If that is so, perhaps we might be given an explanation that would remove the scales from our eyes and permit us to see as, apparently, the majority see but which they see in a manner that is very different from the way in which I see the situation and in which they saw it only a few years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked what is this Bill.  In my humble estimation it is a provocative, repressive and ugly proposal to enable to be put out of the way some few persons that others have feared and who now cannot be silenced or put away.  That is the only possible answer one is left with but, difficult as that is to believe, what is the alternative?  Why is the Bill necessary?  From where did it emanate?  Above all, I warn of the great danger of total disaster that would follow the enactment of this Bill.  I am not saying this by way of agreement or disagreement with it.  I say it as my firm conviction, my firm belief, that disaster is very likely to follow if this legislation goes on the statute book.  I do so because of the fact that, as I pointed out already, there has not been any evidence that our present laws are inadequate. To me the application of them has indicated that they are more than adequate.  Even if they were inclined to be wanting in certain directions, steps have been taken to take the short cuts and get ourselves away from the botheration of jury trials. What the hell do they know about things?  They do not count when there <Col N="644" /> is pressure on.  It is a different matter when times are such that you can take up their time, waste their time and pay them nothing for it.</P>
    <P>When it comes down to the liberty of many subjects, as the case may be here, then away with the juries, set up the special courts, utilise three judges and then add three or four more on as reserves.  This is a better way to carry out the law than the existing system of law as it is being practised&mdash;the time-worn practice of the judge and his jury sitting and deliberating and finally deciding how the justice of the case should stand. We have these three or four reserves and we have backlogs of cases of the ordinary nature in our courts but I do not hear any outcry about the backlog now.  I do not hear it being advanced any more as a reason for bringing in special courts that would speed up things.</P>
    <P>I ask now, as I asked then how do you speed up the administration of justice in our courts by putting three judges to do the job which one did before this?  Maybe there is a new method, maybe there is a new sort of analysis carried out by the Government through some of their agencies that has found a way in which you employ more people doing the same job at the same time and you get a bigger work out-turn as a result. That applies to machines and mass-production but I do not think it applies to the administration of justice in our courts and I do not think it was intended.  I think it was a shortcut not for the administration of justice but perhaps in order that the laws should be stretched to their limits, that the ordinary uneducated, perhaps somewhat ignorant and backward jurymen would not be able to appreciate or understand and contribute their share to the manipulations.</P>
    <P>Is that why we have these?  Are they any different to that which we condemn in the Six Counties today?  Is there any difference between this proposal in this Bill and the internment which was mooted by the Taoiseach nearly two years ago and was then taken up and put into operation by the fools in Britain?  It was not followed here at that time; but it is, <Col N="645" /> in my estimation, being followed now and followed in a way that is far more repugnant, far more dangerous, than ever straightforward internment could be, because this is internment by subterfuge. This is internment by passing the buck down to your 23 chief superintendents and giving it a veneer of having the laws of the land applied to it.  A false veneer&mdash;something nasty and totally repugnant to any freedom-loving people&mdash;is being given to this. If you want internment, why the hell do you not stand up and give it to us? Stop this sham.  If it is internment I am asking: is that what you want? I see the Minister for Transport and Power nodding his head.</P>

I believe this.  I am like the chief <Col N="648" /> superintendent.  I only heard it from two or three down the line.  I am not concerned whether the Deputy is worried or not.  I am merely giving him the opportunity of denying it, as he is prepared to give to the defendant under this Bill the opportunity to deny when the chief superintendent says: &ldquo;I believe what I heard from several removes from me down the line&rdquo;.  I heard it and I believe that that was the Deputy's answer to his own constituents who asked him and taxed him not to support it and he said that if he had ten votes he would not give one against this Bill.</P>

There was a suggestion that the comedy should finish and I quite agree but the trouble is that it was the arch-comic on the front bench who made the suggestion and nobody should recognise the comedy of things better than he does. I would say to those who feel annoyed that an ex-Minister should get a bad time that I am not getting a bad time. In fact, it would appear from the come back from over there that some people feel that they are getting a bad time.  That is not intended either.  It is purely accidental, no more.</P>

      <P>Without even the good manners to be orderly because nobody is supposed to speak from the passages in this House.  They are supposed to be in their places.  However, that is neither here nor there in regard to, as the Chair has said, a very serious matter.  I want to go back to the internment that is inherent in the repressive proposals in this Bill.  I am seriously asking the Minister again to ensure that we do not have this Bill carried through into <Col N="651" /> the Statute Book.  I ask him to do it because I believe it is unnecessary, it can only bring trouble.  It is not doing anything for the country today or will not tomorrow.  It is doing a great deal of damage to it in that it is interfering, in a very definite way, with the rights of the individuals and the citizens of this part of the country where, God knows, over the centuries we have had enough repression.  Surely we do not have to continue it now that we are in charge of our own affairs, or are we in charge of our own affairs or are we being instructed what to do?  Could this possibly be an explanation of what seems otherwise inexplicable?  Can it be that this Bill is in order to satisfy the demands that are being made, wrongfully, by spokesmen for the Unionists in the Six Counties, by spokesmen for the government in Britain and by the British Premier himself asking that we should do more than we are doing on this side of the Border to suppress the IRA?  I think these people have a bloody cheek because the fact is that with the small number of forces at our disposal, with all the inadequacies of the law that we have heard enumerated here but not in detail, with the small number of gardaí that we have, compare your performance against your own countrymen and your own republican brethren with the huge build-up of 21,000-plus troops in the Six Counties, the inflated number of RUC and their reserves and add to it, the UDR in collusion in many cases with the UVF and UDA. If they cannot manage their own little area above, why should those people demand that we should be doing it for them?  If they cannot do it, should they not be told to go and take a jump at themselves when they come crying here that we are not doing enough?  We are doing too damn much in my estimation to repress and suppress people who are fleeing from the terror, the torment and the torture, the internment and the jailings, the hammerings, and the batterings. We are fastening on their backs when they come here in order to ensure that it will be worse if they attempt to come in here than if they stayed <Col N="652" /> where they were and took their chance.</P>
      <P>They have a damn cheek to be talking about and abusing an Irish Government no matter what I might think of them individually or collectively, with their huge build-up of armaments, their army and all the rest.  Everything that science can produce they have there and what are they doing?  They are crying that we are not doing enough for them down here.  They should be told to take a big long jump at themselves and should be told at the same time to get to hell out of this country, because there has never been or never will be peace while they remain as the conquerors and occupiers of lands that are not theirs.  This is what they understand and they are bamboozled and confused and misled by the attitude of an Irish Government in this day and age who would appear to be supporters of the idea that the union must stand, that the army must remain and that Irish men and women of these 32 counties could not find out and work out their own salvation.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it.  I believe that is the method that has been used, along with others, to keep our people apart, to create the difference, to create the divide.  We should be telling them to &ldquo;hump off&rdquo; and to mind their own business, to get out of the land, to get out of the country, to make a good resolution at this stage to say they are going and to stop provoking the Unionists into the belief that they are going to stay for ever and that they are going to sustain them with their millions and to defend them with their army.  That is why there can be no discussion, no reasoned discussion, between the Orange and the Green in the Six Counties, because Britain's dirty paws are still on the table between them.  Why do you not tell them that instead of collaborating with them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>No&mdash;interrupted in the usual manner.  There is this sad sort of situation which again rather befuddles me, to say the least, and annoys me a great deal, that we undoubtedly do not know what is happening in the territory north of the line which is the unnatural division we know as the Border, and in so far as this Bill is concerned, I take it that, in keeping with our constitutional claims, we would if we got the opportunity, apply it to the Six County residents as well.</P>
      <P>What I am trying to put is this, that we are not doing ourselves any good in the eyes of the people we are seeking to unite in the Six Counties and who desire unity as much as anybody down here, by passing legislation such as is here proposed because it is only natural that they should expect that if unity came about, that sort of repressive law would apply to them as it is now proposed to apply to us, because our Constitution does say that we lay claim to the whole territory and regard every citizen as a citizen thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is surely bad in itself, but worse still, it must now have infiltrated into the mind of the Government, as a result of this and the repression which has already taken place under our all too adequate laws, that we are using down here at the moment to repress republican outlook and feeling and people, that developing in the Six County minority public mind over the recent past particularly is a most unusual happening, that is, one of total disenchantment, if not disgust, with the whole thought of ever having anything to do with an Irish Government based in Dublin.  I say this with the greatest regret and sadness, but it is a fact.  This is, in fact, what is now becoming the public mind and outlook of the minority in the Six Counties, and perhaps the only possible ray of sunshine that might relieve the gloom created by that strange happening is that by a strange perversity perhaps, a strange coincidence, almost at the same time but no doubt for <Col N="655" /> very different reasons, there is a disenchantment taking place amongst the most apt and rapt Unionists with their bosses as they now see them beginning to emerge from Westminster. Maybe in a queer, perverse and inexplicable way with these changes from the friendship and thoughts of fellowship that existed between the minority in the Six Counties and their brethren, as it were, in the South, they are now being disenchanted, looking away from them, and side by side with them the Unionists are beginning to become disenchanted with the British because they feel they are pushing them around a wee bit at the moment and they are not used in Unionist circles to being pushed around in the Six Counties.  Maybe it is that this may well be in a queer, perverse, accidental way the beginning of a common bond between the people of conviction on both sides in the Six Counties and arising from it there yet may be emerging a hope that we can have the beginning of unity.  It is my conviction that there cannot be any real settlement of this matter until the people of extreme views on both sides get together, not the moderates in the middle, not the people who change with whatever way the wind blows, not the people who think it is too much bother to change things.  What we are doing here will not be seen as helping to achieve the unity of our country.  Rather it will be seen as the result of policies that should not have been pursued here, policies that are a betrayal of the minority in the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>Can we wonder that the people in the Six Counties have a growing disenchantment with the idea of a Dublin and all-Ireland Government? Can we blame them for their feeling of revulsion at what is contained in this Bill, namely, the provision to suppress and lock up those who may be driven by political circumstances and pressure in the Six Counties to flee across the Border?  Can we blame the people in the Six Counties for looking askance at us and wondering if we are really concerned about their <Col N="656" /> welfare or about the unity of our country?  These are real problems but the answer being suggested to the people in the Six Counties is that we do not want them in the South, that we should prefer them to remain with their troubles in the North rather than embroil us or disturb us in a happy slumber into which we have fallen. Compared with our economic state some 30 years ago we now enjoy a certain affluence and it appears we are afraid we will lose some of that affluence if we have to share it with those people of all religions in the Six Counties who are just as Irish as we are.</P>
    <P>Why have we developed this selfish outlook, this lack of concern over the one matter that stands out like a sore thumb, namely, the partition of our country?  Partition was created by a foreign power, against the wishes of the vast majority of our people. For 50 years the Unionist junta have enacted oppressive legislation against the people in the Six Counties.  Why do we not abolish our Offences Against the State Act instead of making our legislation more oppressive? This is what we should be doing as an assurance not only to the minority in the Six Counties but to the majority, to show them that we do not desire to have repressive legislation on our statute book.</P>
    <P>In recent days John Brooke has indicated his disagreement with what is proposed in this Bill.  However, there may be a brighter side in that John Brooke and others like him, despite their statement of non-concern, are concerned about what we do on this side of the Border because of their deep inner convictions that they are Irish, that the whole of the island is Ireland and that they belong to it as much as we do, that Dublin is part of their heritage as it is of ours.  Maybe this is the hopeful message we can get from the condemnation by John Brooke, but is it not sad that a man in his position is forced to indicate he does not consider it is good legislation?  If Mr. Brooke found it necessary to express even mild dislike of the Bill, surely our Government and Parliament <Col N="657" /> should have no illusions about the trouble we are creating and the wrong we will do if this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>I would ask that this Bill be withdrawn. As the Opposition have stated already, if there are real problems in the administration of law here these could be considered and settled. If the Bill is withdrawn I would not regard it as a loss of face for the Government or as a lessening of the stature of the Government.  In view of the speeches made here and the messages that have been pouring in from all sections, if the Bill were withdrawn it would not be so regarded. Rather it would increase their stature because, for once, it would be seen that they stopped and said: &ldquo;We may think this legislation is right but so many think it is wrong we will take it out.  We can live without it as we have done up to now and will talk to the Opposition about our problems regarding the inadequacy of the law&rdquo;.  If the Government adopted this course and sought the expertise of the Opposition in this matter this would be of considerable benefit and would fill whatever gaps may exist in the law.</P>
    <P>I do not think there are any gaps. When law becomes too closed up and tight it gets stuffy and that is what will happen here.  However, if it were possible for the Government and the Opposition to come together on this matter I would be glad to chair the initial meeting.</P>
    <P>Despite the opposition of Fine Gael, and their motion to refuse a Second Reading by submitting a reasoned amendment, I think that is the way it is put, despite that, I had been told before Monday&mdash;and I had not seen the Bill at the time&mdash;that the contents of this Bill may well have been known to some person or persons in Fine Gael and that if it were not for assurances from such person or persons that it would ultimately be helped through by Fine Gael it would never have seen the light of day.</P>

I am not saying this merely to have a crack at Fine Gael but because this persistent rumour is going around.  It would be a sad thing if there was any semblance of truth in such a rumour because not only would we have repressive legislation but we would have a major Opposition party proclaiming publicly that they are against this legislation but perhaps ultimately accepting assurances, which I was given to understand will come from the Minister for Justice in concluding that the two subsections to which Fine Gael really object will be suitably amended.  On that promise, which is not an unusual one when a Government are under pressure in regard to some obnoxious feature of a Bill, the Fine Gael opposition would, it is suggested, withdraw their motion and on Committee Stage a formula would be produced to change these two sections but only in words and not in content or intent. That is the story; if it is not true, so much the better.  This is one occasion on which if it is not true it will be seen to be so before very long.</P>

      <P>Work it out for yourself. This is just a telegram; let nobody be alarmed.  I remember reading one here quite a few years ago; it is not the same kind.  It is a telegram that has just been handed in from my own constituency, Lifford, Donegal. It is addressed to me here and I am sure other Deputies, including Deputy Harte, will have got one.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" />&ldquo;The Donegal branch of the Local Government and Public Services Union call on you to vote against the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill, 1972,&rdquo; and it is signed by their branch secretary.  It is interesting that it asks me to vote against the measure rather than, as one might expect from the voice of the Fianna Fáil Party, perhaps, a telegram asking me to support it.  This is a body against which I do not think anybody could point a finger and say that they are either the fringe of the subversives or likely to be malcontents or misfits.  Within that Local Government and Public Services Union there is probably a sound collection of the most stable citizens in our community. That is only the Donegal branch and perhaps we are a bit daft up there but these are mostly outsiders&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Being very tourist conscious, anybody is welcome in my county provided he does not upset the rhythm of things and, in all fairness, I do not think the Minister did that.  To come back to the repressive proposals, are we doing this <Col N="660" /> to satisfy Mr. Heath?  If so, I do not think this will endear us to him or to anybody in the British Government who would feel that in bowing to their wishes in a matter that is purely our own concern we only show ourselves to be weak and not really of any great account and not to be taken seriously.  There are many suggestions that this is the case, that this is one of the main reasons we are doing this; that this is why we arrested Mac Stiofáin, got him convicted in some way&mdash;I read about it but I still do not know how it was done.  But it is done, and having had it done, let us not forget that this man we understand, is not in the best physical condition at the moment.  Is he to be allowed to continue his hunger strike despite the fact that his health condition, we understand, was not good recently before his arrest?</P>
      <P>Is it so important to satisfy the Government's ego or sense of importance that this man must have his life further endangered?  This is a man of whom the Minister for Justice three weeks ago was able to say in this House that he had no case against him.  If a man had shown himself in every respect to be unworthy of circulating in our community here and, on conviction, he decided to go on hunger strike for whatever motive, it just might be&mdash;I do not know&mdash;in those very extreme circumstances justifiable to allow such a person to die.  But I do not know of any reason why a man who had no case against him less than three weeks ago, and who since then had not committed any crime that was indicated in the court, be committed to prison.  In protest and in furtherance of his beliefs and principles he goes on thirst and hunger strike almost to the point of death.  Perhaps before we come back here, if we come back at all after this week, this man may have died.  All I am asking is, is his crime grave enough to allow him to die?  I do not think so. As well as that, trouble could follow from it because, as other Deputies said here tonight, these things raise emotions and are provocative.  We must ask ourselves is this feeling on the part of the Government of being the power in the land so all important as to justify a man being allowed to die&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, Sir.  I should have put it the other way around.  This arrest would appear to have been part of the pattern that has produced this Bill here, to have been done at the behest of Mr. Heath.  It would appear that the whole thing was a planned operation to satisfy Mr. Heath that we here really mean business, that we are doing more than our part to defeat those who hold Republican views.</P>
      <P>Our failure to object strongly to the holding of a plebiscite in the Six Counties is also in keeping with the instructions of Mr. Heath, that we should dither around and not do the logical thing, hold one here on the same day so that we get the true answer from the people of the Thirty-two Counties.</P>
      <P>Is it that or is it some other reason? I am at a loss to know what is the reason, but I do not think even that is a satisfactory explanation.  However, some explanation is necessary as to why this series of events should continue to happen contrary to what one would naturally expect from an Irish Government acting in this House on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder as well whether the comments of the other speakers I have had the good fortune to hear at an earlier stage in the debate can throw some light on the introduction of this Bill.

I assert that in 1969 neither the members of the Labour Party, of the Fianna Fáil Party or of the Fine Gael Party ran away from those who came in their dire straits at that time from Belfast seeking arms.

I do not think they are being dishonest but that they were conveniently deluding themselves that they never encouraged or made promises or gave sympathy or support to those who were seeking methods of defending themselves against the rampages of the B Specials and the RUC in 1969.  It is only the few who are now branded as violent people, and it is those few people who not only have not changed their minds or their outlook since then but who have not the facility to delude themselves that they never did think that way three years ago.</P>

      <P>As an immediate measure to increase public awareness of the continued increase in fatal accidents I have arranged with road authorities for special temporary warning signs to be provided on major traffic routes throughout the country.  The first signs will be in place next month. They will display different messages for specific periods.  In the first <Col N="536" /> period, the message will be related to drinking and driving&mdash;which as I have stated on several occasions, is a major contributory factor in road accidents.</P>
      <P>The House will recall the recently announced decision to set up a special traffic corps within the Garda Síochána which will not only enforce road traffic law but act as an accident prevention corps.  In the meantime Garda activity in the area of road enforcement has been stepped up considerably.  Breathalyser detections for example, now average 300 per month compared with a monthly average of 130 in 1971.</P>
      <P>On the engineering side road authorities have already been asked to give priority to those sections of roads identified as high accident locations by An Foras Forbartha.  Many of these schemes will be very costly and it will take a considerable amount of time before they can be completed.  Despite demands on the Exchequer for other urgent capital works and programmes, it is my intention to make the maximum practicable financial resources available for road works, for which an additional £ 2 million was allocated to road authorities this year.</P>
      <P>In the propaganda and educational field it is my intention to involve as many organisations as possible, both voluntary and commercial, in the promotion of road safety.  Co-operation is already forthcoming from a number of bodies and offers of co-operation have already been received by my Department from several organisations.  I have already initiated discussions with various interests with a view to securing their participation in appropriate roles.</P>

      <P>So far as local authority action is concerned it is a matter for Dublin Corporation to consider what action may be appropriate under the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1964 relating to dangerous places.  I understand that the corporation have, in fact, carried out certain protective works on those <Col N="538" /> portions of the banks of the Grand Canal within their area which in their opinion were dangerous and that the position in this respect is kept constantly under review by them.</P>

This includes such matters as the operation of the Alkali etc.  Works Regulation Act, 1909; regulations on air pollution control under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962: promotion of better monitoring and control arrangements locally; and a general programme of advising and assisting local authorities in dealing with pollution in their areas.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Oil Pollution</i>
      </P>
      <P> (a)  Settling arrangements, with the assistance of a liaison group, for clearance of oil pollution from coastal areas.</P>
      <P>(b)  Providing general advice and assistance to local authorities in dealing with this and related problems.</P>
      <P>
      </P>

      <P>Telephones in the four number ranges referred to are connected to automatic exchanges at Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin, Ratoath and Ashbourne respectively which serve these centres and the surrounding districts.  I am aware of the increasing number of telephone subscribers in these areas and also that subscribers are experiencing service difficulties, particularly at Dunboyne and Ashbourne.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> The existing exchange at Dunboyne which is of an old type is being replaced by a larger exchange.  Work on the installation of this exchange will commence shortly and it is expected to be in service by April, 1973.  A major cable to Dunboyne will be completed before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>A new larger exchange is also being provided at Ashbourne and is expected to be in service by the middle of next year.  A major cable to Ashbourne is expected to be in service by about October, 1973.</P>
    <P>Extensions to the existing exchanges at Dunshaughlin and Ratoath are on order and are expected to be in service by mid-1974.  Additional circuits for both exchanges will be provided next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. G. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 145 and 146 together.</P>
      <P>It is settled practice to prepare forecasts at intervals of telephone equipment requirements.  Changes of population are only one of the many factors taken into account.  Regard is had also to national and local development prospects, to planned housing and factory growth and other relevant factors. My Department are continuously collecting information, through their postmasters, through contact with planning organisations, and by means of detailed surveys so that reliable forecasts of public demand may be made.  The object is to ensure that within the limits of the resources available the equipment needed for the telephone service will be available in advance.  It is not the practice to make regular assessments of the requirements of every individual exchange by reference specifically to a seven or eight year period ahead.  The Deputies may take it that the over-all growth in the number of telephones expected by 1980 is approximately 125 per cent and growth of traffic is forecast at 160 per cent.  In the case of large exchanges the objective aimed at is to design the exchanges or extensions approximately three or four years before they are needed.  At that stage a decision is taken regarding the quantity and type of equipment to be ordered which should be sufficient to cater for demand for some years after installation is completed.  The decision is subject to review if any unforeseen change occurs.  For smaller exchanges it is better to decide quantities at a somewhat later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of what I have said the Deputies will realise that it is not possible to supply the detailed information requested in the question in respect of the period from now to 1980.  I can, however, assure them that within the limits of the resources made available to me, such additional orders as are required will be placed in good time for all equipment needed to cater for telephone development in Counties <Col N="543" /> Meath and Kildare, as well as elsewhere.</P>
