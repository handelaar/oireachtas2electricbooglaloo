      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have asked the Commission of the European Communities to take action to protect human rights and fundamental liberties in Northern Ireland having regard to the duty given to the Commission under Article 155 of the Treaty of Rome and the assertion of respect for human rights in the three treaties constituting the European Communities; and if not, why.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No such approach has been made by the Government. I am advised that the Treaties do not give the Commission a competence in the matter to which the Deputy refers.</P>

      <P>I put down a question to the Taoiseach ten days ago about this matter of the EEC and I do not understand why it has not appeared on the Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a matter for discussion in the House at this time.  If the Deputy wants to find out why he could see me about it in my room.  Since the Deputy has raised the matter, I should like to tell him that his question, as drafted, was argumentative and such questions are always ruled out of order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not the first time.  On a number of other occasions questions of mine have been refused in this fashion.  It is not right to say that it was argumentative.  I refute the suggestion.  There was no argument whatever in the question.  It was a simple why and there was nothing else in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to inform the Deputy that even if it had been a direct question on associate membership it would have had to be treated as a repeat of another question that was answered in this House and for that reason it would not have been allowed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

The Minister for Foreign Affairs has refused time and again to answer questions from me on various issues of this sort.  I will not put up with it any longer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year 1971, manufactured fertilisers were imported from Great Britain, the Six Counties, Belgium, Denmark, Germany (Federal Republic), France, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Poland, Germany Eastern, Finland, Israel, Japan, United States of America, Canada, and unmanufactured fertilisers from Great Britain, Belgium, Germany (Federal <Col N="5" /> Republic), France, Netherlands, Morocco, United States of America, Chile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Parliamentary Secretary comment on the amount compared with the amount of fertiliser imported in the two or three years before last year and would he say what effect this had on the fertiliser factories in this country and on employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be in a position to comment on the Deputy's question.  I do not have the information before me.  I should imagine that any excessive imports of fertilisers into this country would have a bad effect on industries here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary know that the price of fertiliser has gone up by £4 per ton since last year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got those figures.  I would not be in a position to comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there is an increasing amount of stocks of fertiliser being piled up in factories and that these factories and the employees are very much concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to comment.  I should imagine that if the Deputy puts down a question to that effect to the Minister concerned he will be given the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary has in his brief a comparison of the imports of fertilisers in the year 1971 with those in 1970 and 1969?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if the 15p per week paid by insured workers for health services covers x-ray and pathological fees for the middle income group (out-patient).</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if arrangements are being made to collect the £7 per year under the Health Contributions Act, 1971, from old age pensioners by reducing the pension by a weekly amount rather than demanding a lump sum payment of £7 each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no statutory powers to make reductions from old age pensions.  I might mention, however, that non-contributory old age pensioners have full eligibility for health services and are not obliged to pay the contribution of £7 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that single old age pensioners who are just over the level find it extremely difficult to find £7 if their total income is only about £10 or £11 and would he not agree that it is ridiculous to suggest that they should be asked to pay, in a lump sum, £7 in order to qualify for something which most of them were receiving free up to this new arrangement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, some contributory old age pensioners would, having regard to individual circumstances, be receiving medical cards and for others the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to accept the payment of the £7 in instalments although they do not encourage this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister, does anybody else know they are prepared to accept payment by instalments?  This is the first I have heard of it.  Certainly, <Col N="7" /> old age pensioners are not aware that they can pay in this way.  Would the Minister take steps to have this brought to the notice of the people concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the sum collected by the 50p per day capitation charge for the middle income group in the last financial year in which it was applied; and the amount to be collected in a full year by the £7 per annum per person charge which replaced it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The total income from the charges referred to by the Deputy was about £900,000 in the year to 31st March, 1970.  Complete figures for the succeeding year are not yet available.  The estimated total income in a full year from health contributions is about £5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will provide aid towards the provision of artificial cardiac pace-makers for those five or six persons in the upper income group who require them annually in view of the high cost, £350, of this apparatus which has to be replaced every two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards are empowered to provide assistance to persons, outside the eligible groups, where the boards consider that the persons concerned would be unable, without undue hardship, to provide the required service out of their own <Col N="8" /> resources.  Each application is treated on its merits and I can assure the Deputy that no case of genuine hardship is turned down.  The provision mentioned above covers, <i>inter alia,</i> the making available of assistance towards the cost of expensive apparatus such as cardiac pace-makers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of having to make applications and humiliate themselves by submitting all the details may put people off.  Would the Minister not think that in view of the few people involved and the expensive nature of this elaborate and sophisticated apparatus, it could be included without any great charge on the health services so as to avoid people having to submit full details in each individual application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the upper income group in relation to assistance given by health boards is such that it may be a difficult or delicate matter for them, but I should really prefer that the upper income group, when applying for special hardship contributions towards their operations, should apply and have the case judged. I should not like to have a kind of automatic granting of certain moneys to these people accepted as a general rule because it is understood that the 10 per cent of the population should pay virtually for the whole of their health services and that they can insure with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  I should not like to depart from that principle.  I do not think it should cause much difficulty.  I have known a great many cases where this hardship clause has been used and it has not particularly embarrassed the people concerned to apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that psychiatric nurses who were recently on strike have had their salaries reduced despite the fact that they had overtime leave due to them which would have compensated for the time lost while on strike; and if he will have the matter rectified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister serious when he says he is not aware that this situation has arisen?  We had a tragic situation in the withdrawal of the services of the psychiatric nurses; because of the inactivity of the Department and of the CEOs of the health boards we had this strike on our hands. The people who had time due to them have now been victimised to the extent of the amount of salary or wages coming to them because of their days of leave.  I want to state categorically that this is the fact, if the Minister is not aware of it and I want to know what steps he will take to rectify the position in order to avoid a further disruption of the psychiatric services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

The implementation of these recommendations is primarily a matter for each health board.  There is no information in my Department as to the extent to which the various terms of the settlement have already been implemented or when they will be fully implemented under the various health boards.  My approval has been granted in every case in which it has been requested to any of the terms of settlement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>I explained, in reply to questions by Deputy O'Donnell on 8th February, some of the considerations that arise in regard to the settlement of fares by sea and air to Ireland.  The transport sector of the tourist industry is very conscious of the need to keep fares as low as possible so as to attract additional business for their own services and additional tourist traffic for the country.  In all cases the economics of operation must be taken into account and the fare structures must be related to the companies' costs and commitments.  In addition, there are international obligations which cannot be ignored.  I am continuing to examine the problems involved bearing in mind the constraints I have mentioned and the need for the most vigorous action to attract additional traffic in the coming season.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I should point out that there is an extensive range of excursion fares, special interest rates, group rates and other forms of incentive fares which effectively reduce travel costs for many visitors.  In addition, the transport companies, in cooperation with Bord Fáilte, are combining with coach companies, car-hire firms and hotels, guesthouses and farmhouses to offer a series of very competitive package holidays.  These are based on very substantial concessions on published travel and accommodation rates and I am confident that they will prove highly attractive, particularly in the Irish ethnic market.</P>

The indications are that greater numbers of Irish people are likely to take their main holidays in Ireland this year.</P>
    <P>In the case of the promotion of ethnic traffic from Britain, the board have indicated that this campaign is now properly underway and will run for a period of at least four months.  It is at present too soon to make any assessment of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Staff from some of the regional tourism organisations have been involved in Britain in special promotional work in relation to angling since 1st January last.  Staff from nearly all regions went to Britain yesterday to take part in the ethnic promotional campaign.</P>

      <P>The situation in Northern Ireland has had a damaging effect on tourism prospects for the coming season and many sectors of the tourist industry, including hotel interests, are naturally concerned about the effects of a fall in tourist traffic on their financial position.  I have already given the Dáil, in reply to other recent questions, details of the measures being taken to counteract the problems involved. An intensified campaign is being operated in those markets likely to prove most responsive at the present time, particularly the European market and the ethnic markets in Britain and North America.  Deputies will be aware that a co-ordinated home holidays campaign is now in progress.  I expect that these campaigns will result in a significant number of additional bookings to compensate for those lost in the traditional markets in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters are receiving my constant attention and I am in very close touch with all interests involved.  I know that Bord Fáilte are in consultation with the Irish Hotels Federation about the position and I expect to meet representatives of the federation shortly to have a general review of the situation and to consider what further <Col N="19" /> measures can be taken to deal with the problems of the coming tourist season.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The level of activity undertaken by CIE in promoting their tourism business in Britain is a matter for the board.  I am, however, informed by the board that they undertook their customary annual heavy investment in advertising immediately after Christmas when people in Britain tend to make their holiday plans.  The marketing operation included the circulation of 250,000 <Col N="21" /> brochures to British travel agents.  Because of the poor response to their marketing and advertising activities, the board decided to close their Manchester and Glasgow offices at the end of January when the bulk of their promotional effort had already been made and in order to cut their losses so far as 1972 was concerned.  The board's London operation is continuing.</P>
      <P>CIE will continue to give a service to travel agents in Britain throughout the year and they have appointed a number of important agents as general wholesalers in key market areas.  The board are in a position to undertake additional types of promotion this year should there be economic justification for them.</P>

If a State company are not prepared to remain on the field, how can we expect private tour operators in Britain to continue selling Irish holidays?  Is the Minister aware that this announcement has resulted in untold damage and that whatever hope we had of getting a small trickle of British tourists to come here, there is now no such hope and that at least four major British tour operators have decided to cancel their campaigns?</P>

    <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the restoration of the planting programme to 25,000 acres made possible the retention of men who would otherwise have had to be declared redundant.  No clear figures are available for the manpower requirements of the additional work but it is estimated roughly to cover 40 men.</P>

I cannot see why, if a sum of £20 million was made available three months ago and £50 million recently, he cannot spend a couple of thousand pounds employing men to keep the forests in good order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of students now being enrolled for the course the Deputy has in mind.  The position is that each year there is a competition for entrance to the training colleges for teachers of home economics.  Amongst the candidates are a number who are attending residential home economics colleges.  It is to these latter the Deputy is referring and at no time was the entrance to the training course confined to them.  In 1969 it was intimated that it was possible that grades over and above the pass leaving certificate standard might be sought at the 1970 entrance competition.  Subsequently it was decided not to proceed with this requirement but at the beginning of 1971 it was definitely announced that for the 1972 competition certain higher grades would be sought.  The only point that there could be at issue was whether higher grades would be sought in two or more subjects.  The fact that the conductors of the residential colleges continued to accept girls without, apparently, any reference to the standard reached by them at the leaving certificate examination is not a matter the responsibility for which can be laid at the door of my Department. The Department, having given at the beginning of 1971 firm notice of its intention in relation to 1972 competition, merely laid down for that competition what in the context of higher grades was the minimum of 2 C's in higher papers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> However, in order to go some way towards meeting the case of these girls enrolled in the residential colleges who had not obtained the necessary grades I am prepared to arrange that they be admitted to the leaving certificate examination next June with a view to giving them a further opportunity of reaching the required standard.</P>
    <P>As a further concession to them I am also prepared in the case of any one of them who reaches a very high standard at the practical and written tests which are held in April to waive for 1972 the 2 C requirements.</P>

The only point at issue here was whether it would be 2 C's or more than 2 C's.  Therefore I think I have gone a reasonable distance now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>It was definitely stated that certain grades would be <Col N="37" /> needed.  It was not specifically mentioned that it would be 2 C's, but that was obviously to be understood from the announcement in the sense that 2 C's was the lowest standard for entry into higher education in any other sphere.  While I admit that there might be grounds for some slight misunderstanding, at the same time, seeing that in the previous year we said these provisions might be brought into operation and the second year we said we would be requiring certain standards, I think I have met the case pretty fairly.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that what he has given is an incomplete, in fact, inaccurate account, that the only notification the schools had was that a certain unspecified standard would be required.  They were notified of that in January, 1971 but they received no further communication until a good deal later on the subject. Surely they were entitled, in the absence of any communication, to assume that for the second year this was not going to be applied.  In fact in November of last year the Department asked the principal of at least one of these colleges to forward suggestions for revised entrance qualifications, a fact that is totally at variance with the suggestion that this had been settled at that time and that she should have known about it.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 47, 48 and 49 <Col N="39" /> together.  In introducing the Estimate for my Department, I dealt with this question of junior and senior cycle centres.  Basically, the position is that in order to be able to offer a reasonable choice of subjects at leaving certificate level, catering for both pass and honours level courses and having teachers qualified to teach these subjects, it is normally necessary to confine this provision to centres with an enrolment in the region of 400 pupils. Smaller centres will provide courses up to intermediate certificate level only and the pupils who wish to follow a leaving certificate course will then transfer to a larger centre.  There is no point in having an educational guidance service if the courses recommended by the guidance teacher are not in fact available to the child.  To achieve the position which I am aiming at, it was first necessary to stop the proliferation of centres providing leaving certificate courses and this was why my Department refused to sanction such courses in small vocational schools which had not previously provided leaving certificate courses.  More recently my Department notified 14 small secondary schools that grants would not be paid in respect of first year leaving certificate pupils next September.  It was then represented to me that children at present in these schools had entered them in the expectation that they could complete their post-primary education there.  Because of this, I agreed that pupils already in these schools could complete their leaving certificate there but children entering these schools next September should be informed that it will be necessary for them to transfer elsewhere for their leaving certificate courses.  These 14 schools included the Durrow Convent.  The school at Rahan has already ceased to enrol first year leaving certificate students.  The amount of official time and trouble involved in breaking down the results of the leaving certificate examination as between schools with various enrolment figures would be entirely unwarranted. Apart from this, information related to pass level at the leaving certificate would in no way indicate the problem which is involved.  I can assure <Col N="40" /> the Deputy, however, that sufficient investigation of the overall position has been carried out to show that percentagewise in relation to the scope and quality the achievements of the larger schools are much greater than those of the smaller schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Before going on with the general theme of my speech I want to revert momentarily to the question of the community schools. The Minister made an announcement in his opening speech the last day.  In reply to a question by me he also clarified a point about the faith and morals clause.  Unfortunately, owing to the fact that he confined himself to a very unobtrusive sentence in his speech on the issue of the trusteeship and ownership of the schools, and owing to <Col N="44" /> the fact that he omitted any reference to the faith and morals clause from his speech&mdash;I had to draw it out from him by way of interruption&mdash;I do not think the public are yet clear on the changes that have been made.  In fact, some of the newspapers the following day did not understand the point about the faith and morals clause.  It is significant that even an educational correspondent as well informed as Senator John Horgan, in his article today, does not seem to appreciate the fact that the Minister clarified this point by way of interjection in the debate.  Presumably the Press report omitted this reference.</P>
      <P>It is important for us to sum up at this stage the point we have reached in the community schools issue, the extent of the climb-down by the Minister in response to Opposition pressure, and the extent to which the scheme as originally devised, in a form which would have been sectarian in effect although, no doubt, not sectarian in intent, has been modified to become something approaching an acceptable arrangement for community schools. We cannot as yet take up a final position on this until we know the terms of the trust deed.</P>
      <P>Originally this proposal as set out in the Minister's statement of October, 1970, and sent to the Cardinal, envisaged a management of the school with four representatives of the religious orders and two representatives of the vocational schools regardless of the relative strength of schools in the area or in numbers of pupils. There was no provision for representation of the parents although this is something in which the Minister has professed himself to be interested and something which it may be said the Hierarchy supported in their statement a couple of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of pressure this has been changed.  The Minister agreed that two of the representatives of the religious orders should be appointed by the religious orders to represent the parents. Subsequently he claimbed down in respect of all the schools except Tallaght and Blanchardstown and agreed that the parents' representatives should be selected by the parents, in the case of Tallaght and Blanchardstown <Col N="45" /> this provision being postponed for two years.  Stage by stage at last we have forced from the Minister an acceptance of the right of parents to be represented on the school management in new schools being established if they purport to be community schools.</P>
    <P>The original proposal involved a chairman who it was said might be the bishop of the diocese.  That proposal has now disappeared.  It did not reappear in the May proposals and has not reappeared since.  The proposal apparently referred to the Roman Catholic bishop but, throughout these proposals, all the Minister's references to the Roman Catholic bishop of the diocese are offensively couched in the terms of the ordinary of the diocese or the bishop of the diocese, as if there were no other ordinary or no other bishop, so incapable is the Minister of having regard to the feelings of those of other religions, though I know he has no intent or desire in any way to discriminate against them.</P>
    <P>The proposal for the trustees originally involved their appointment by the parties concerned which would have meant that they would simply be the representatives of the school authorities concerned.  This was then changed to an arrangement under which instead of two of them being appointed by the religious orders and one by the vocational school authorities all three would be appointed by the bishop but he would appoint one representing the vocational school authorities on their nomination.  The presumption being, although this was not stated, that the other two would be on the nomination of the religious order concerned or, indeed, the lay school concerned, presumably in areas like Killorglin where the school concerned is a lay school.  Again, with prolonged pressure from this side of the House and the representations of a wide variety of Protestant organisations, authorities and individuals of eminence like the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Buchanan, we have finally prevailed on the Minister to eliminate this clearly sectarian provision as regards the ownership of the schools, expressed in most sectarian language referring to the ordinary of the diocese <Col N="46" /> as if there were no other bishop of the diocese concerned but the Roman Catholic one.  Now he is to do the appointing himself.  Again, a major concession.</P>
    <P>The other issue then introduced into the May proposals, the faith and morals clause, under which the selection committee established for the purpose of selecting the teachers under which its decisions would not in fact stand if the management committee decided against a teacher on the grounds not merely of his morals but of his faith, opened the way to discrimination on the grounds of religion. That has now been dropped altogether. I emphasise this and I hope that this will be taken up by the Press because the omission from Press reports of the Minister's reply to my interjected question the last day has left people, even Senator John Horgan, in doubt on this particular issue.</P>
    <P>All these changes have significantly transformed the position.  The work we have put in, and it has been hard work and involved quite a lot of questioning and quite a lot of shouting across the floor of this House, and a lot of speeches, has paid off.  Eventually we have shamed this Government into abandoning a policy which, as originally enunciated, was extremely damaging in terms of our relationship with and possible future relationship with Northern Ireland and, indeed, one which was offensive to the religious minority here and which they in the letter which the Church of Ireland board of education addressed to the Minister last July made clear was one which they found unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There remain, however, several outstanding issues.  Only one of these is one which directly concerns the issue of sectarianism and this is the question of the trust deed.  We do not know yet what the contents of the trust deed will be.  I put it to the Minister, however, that for a trust deed to be acceptable for schools of this kind, bearing in mind that they will in practice in most parts of the country, if not all, be predominantly Roman Catholic in the personnel of the teachers and in the student population, and bearing in mind that in practice the management <Col N="47" /> board will also tend to be over-whelmingly Roman Catholic, that two of the trustees will be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of the Roman Catholic religious orders, then given these facts, which are naturally a reflection of the balance between the Roman Catholic faith and other religions in this part of Ireland, it is very important that the Protestant minority should have the reassurance of knowing that the school will be so run as not to be in any way offensive to their faith and to ensure adequate safeguards for the religion of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party in their policy, which I announced on their behalf at the Ard-Fheis, made it clear that we would accept these schools only if there were adequate safeguards for the children of all religions, both Protestant and Catholic.  We are not prepared to agree to any system of community schools which is so organised as to be unacceptable to the parents of children of any religion.  I put it to the Minister, therefore, that on this side of the House we presume that the trust deed will contain provisions to cover this.  We presume that the trust deed will contain a provision specifying that the school must be run in such a way as to safeguard the religion of the children in the school.  I do not think this House would accept any proposed arrangement which did not contain that provision.  It is a matter of serious concern to us.  It does not matter what religious faith we profess, whether Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian or Methodist, our children's religious faith should be safeguarded in the schools.</P>
    <P>The problem in these schools will tend, in the nature of these schools, to be one for the Protestant minority.  In other schools it might indeed be in the other direction.  If there are other comprehensive schools which are known colloquially as Protestant comprehensive schools, where the majority of the pupils attending will be Protestants, I would be concerned to ensure that the schools are run in such a way, and that the provisions under which they are operated, are such as <Col N="48" /> to ensure the safeguarding of the faith of the minority of Roman Catholic children attending such schools.  It does not matter which way round it is.  We are all concerned with this particular point.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, therefore, to ensure that a clause of the kind that exists, for example, in the terms of appointment of statutory members of the academic staff of University College, Dublin, is introduced into this trust deed and the trust deed is one which for the Protestant minority, the people mainly affected, will be acceptable and that it will ensure that there will be no question of the schools being run in such a way as to be offensive to the children of the Protestant minority.  The Minister proclaimed in what appeared to me, listening to the radio, to be a very loud voice at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis, as if it were a great victory, that Protestant children could go to these schools.  I understood the position to be that any school which obtains aid from the State must be run in such a way that Protestant children or Catholic children are entitled to go to it.  I understood that we cannot under our Constitution in any school, discriminate by refusing admission to children of any denomination.  That being so, the Minister's triumphant statement to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis seemed to me to have elements of pathos about it.</P>
    <P>These schools are no different from any others in this respect.  Of course, Protestant children must be entitled to go to them as they are entitled to go to any school just as Catholic children are entitled to go to any school aided by State funds, otherwise we would be supporting sectarian institutions.  Our Constitution rightly forbids this.  That is not the issue.  The issue at stake is whether the school is run in such a way that it is acceptable to the children of the different religious faiths.  These schools being stated to be community schools, the Minister having proclaimed throughout, despite the very odd features of them from the point of view of the Protestant minority, that that was the intention, and having now eliminated the particular objectionable <Col N="49" /> features which were unacceptable to the Protestant minority&mdash;I think there is a statement from some of them today, welcoming this particular point&mdash; we now have to concern ourselves that the trust deed is so worded that there can be no question of the schools being run in a way as to be unacceptable to the children of any religious denomination.</P>
    <P>This is important.  Of course there will be provision in the schools for religious instruction and, indeed, one hopes, for religious observance by the children of the different faiths.  That is necessary.  The vast majority of the people want their children to be brought up in this kind of atmosphere with adequate religious instruction. Indeed, our vocational schools make adequate provisions for this.  The community schools will, we presume from what the Minister has said, be modelled on the vocational schools in this respect.  It is important that the trust deed should ensure this and that it should not be possible in any school for secular people running it who happen to be of one faith to transform it into a school objectionable in some way, by religious emblems or anything of that kind, to the religious minority.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to tell us what safeguards the trust deed will contain to ensure that the children of all faiths in these schools will find them acceptable and that we will not have the position where children come home from school and say something which to their parents indicates that they are being brought up in an atmosphere which to their parents is alien.  This would be totally against our traditions in regard to the vocational schools system and is something which we would all be concerned to ensure would not happen.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to give the final assurance necessary on that.</P>
    <P>The other point about community schools which is unsatisfactory but which is not a point concerning any question of religious faith is the question of the absence of teacher representation. On this side of the House we are quite clear that in establishing new schools of this kind, community schools which are to be genuine community <Col N="50" /> schools, the teachers must have a say in the running of the schools just as we believe workers must have a say in the running of any business of a substantial size, as is the case in countries like France and Germany.  The same principle applies here.  Rather astonishingly no such provision is made by the Minister.  As a teacher himself one would have thought that he would have been anxious to make provision for teacher representation.  Perhaps he is leaning over backwards lest he be accused of having a pro-teacher bias. God knows, nobody could accuse him of that when he totally excludes teachers from any role of any kind in the Management of the schools.  I put it to him, therefore, that he should change his mind on this and make provision for additional teacher representation. However, if he does not do so, I still hope the schools will go ahead because it will merely require a change of Government for the change to be made to introduce the additional teacher representation.  I do not want to put forward firm proposals for that now.  I merely say an appropriate form of teacher representation, without committing this party and an appropriate form could be the presence on the management board of the principal of the school and a teacher selected by the teaching staff.  You would have then a 2:2:2 relationship, which would seem reasonable.</P>
    <P>I would merely put this to the Minister that I presume that the trust deed will not contain any provisions of any kind to limit in any way changes in the structure of the management system. If it were the Minister's intention to provide a trust deed of such a kind as to limit in some way legally the power of any Government to make changes here and to introduce teacher representation, then that trust deed would be totally unacceptable to us on this side of the House.  We are prepared to wait until a Government which has more concern for the rights of teachers come into office in this country, which will not be long.  We are not prepared to permit any Government to frustrate us in our efforts to secure teacher representation. I presume that in this respect the trust deed will leave the matter open and because we do not <Col N="51" /> know that until the Minister says it, because we do not know whether the trust deed will make adequate provision for safeguards for the religious faith of children attending these schools, we must, therefore, reserve our position on the community schools, while welcoming all the changes made and accepting that in other respects the minimum necessary to make these schools acceptable from the point of view of the community as a whole has, in fact, now been achieved.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to one other point before moving on to fresh pastures and that is this question of small schools.  I mention this because the Minister has given a reply in this House&mdash;in fact, several replies&mdash;on this question and I want to turn to it for a moment.  I made the case in this House the last day and I saw the Minister nodding frequently throughout my remarks, perhaps, the only part of my remarks that he so greeted&mdash;I made a case for schools being organised in such a way as to provide an adequate choice of subjects and I have, I think, argued that the article by Father Nolan, C.S Sp., suggesting the contrary, was, in fact, deficient in logic at the various points where he purported to make the argument against having a wide range of subjects.  I am convinced on that point.  Other speakers in the debate may not agree with me on this but I should be grateful to them when they come to speak, as I understand is likely to be the case, if they would address themselves to the article and to my reply to the article and show where, if at any point it is the case, I am wrong in my logic or where Fr. Nolan is right in his logic, rather than making general statements that variety is not necessary, or anything of that kind.  I think my argument here was a closely reasoned one.  It deserves careful attention.  I would hope that nobody would make general speeches without getting down to arguing the case point by point on a specific basis.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the point I want to make clear&mdash;I did mention it before but I want to make quite clear that the Minister understands it because I do not have the impression that he does <Col N="52" /> from things that have been said since &mdash;is that while in general the indications that one would get from the criteria which I and he agree on is that schools must in general be of a certain size and I do not accept and the Minister has made no case whatever for their being of a very large size but of a certain size, that in the context of this country, with low density of population, with the problem of low density especially in parts of the west of Ireland and the long distances between schools already, that schools should be closed in those areas merely on these grounds.  The right answer, which the Minister has consistently refused to adopt, showing here as elsewhere the unwillingness of the Fianna Fáil Government to show any genuine concern for these areas&mdash;the right answer is to make special provision for additional teachers in the few schools in question to provide the range of subjects.  We must accept that where the density of population is low and where we are concerned to keep communities alive, it will be necessary to make special provision in these cases and to have a better than average pupil/teacher ratio so that a small school may provide a range of subjects.</P>
    <P>The Minister's rule of thumb bureaucratic answer is that given the ratio of pupils to teachers which he has ruled on as being nationally necessary regardless of the interests of any particular part of the country or the special problems of any particular part of the country, a school with less than X number of pupils cannot, of course, survive and letters are sent to tell them to close down.  That, to us, is totally unacceptable.  The general principle we agree with: there must be an adequate range of subjects; and if in an area there are a number of schools together and the rationalisation of them will give a wider range of subjects, instead of four schools all teaching a narrow range, merge them into two and that will give a wider range of subjects in both.  If that, in fact, is the situation, then we will accept the logic of that and we accept, even if this is locally unpopular, that something of the kind needs to be done for the children's benefit.</P>
    <P>Where a secondary school exists in <Col N="53" /> an area where there is no other secondary school anywhere in the region within ten, 20, even 30 miles of the place concerned, I do not accept in those circumstances that such school should be closed because the Minister is unprepared to make any concession about an above average teacher/pupil ratio in that area.  We have cases of this kind.  There has been mention already today of Ballycastle.  That is a special case because there is a vocational school in the area.  But, what about the case of Cloghane in the Dingle Peninsula, a school in which the number of pupils has risen very rapidly since its foundation, a school in which there originally were 38 pupils?  There are now either 32 or 34 in the first year.  Give it five years to grow, for that number of pupils to move up and assuming no further increase in the entry at first year stage, that merely that level of entry is maintained, that school would be a school of 150 pupils within four years.  That being the kind of size of school that has hitherto been acceptable, and given that the area is a remote one and that the nearest secondary school is, in fact, a very long distance away, either in Dingle, to which no school bus can get, apparently, over the Connor Pass, because it is not permitted to travel on that road, which is blocked at certain periods of the year, or Tralee, which is something like 30 miles away, in those circumstances, there can be no case for closing such a school.  It shows a total disregard for the realities of a country with a low density of population and with very severe rural problems, for the Minister by a rule of thumb to close down such a school.  Here is a school that has been highly successful. The numbers in it have increased two and a half times in ten years.  It is clear that they will almost double again within four years at the present rate of entry in the first year.  The answer here must be to give them a special allowance of extra teachers and that, in fact, is the course of action which this party would adopt in Government.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister here and now, if his Government mean anything of what they say, at election times primarily and at other times occasionally, on the subject of the west of Ireland. <Col N="54" /> let him show some sincerity in the matter.  We will back him where, in fact, there are a number of schools together because there is no distance problem involved and where rationalisation will give better results in terms of range of subjects.  But, in these particular areas the answer is more teachers.  The Minister will have to face up to that.  There is a proposal to close down 13 or 14 schools.  While in some cases there may be good reasons, in other cases the proposal is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>May I say that his attitude in this House a few minutes ago, when he refused to say where the schools are, is typical of the attitude of the Minister and his Department?  This House is entitled to know what schools they are.  He has no right to refuse to disclose this.  The idea that he will write off to the schools in question but will not tell the Members of this Parliament what schools they are is something totally unacceptable.  The Minister and his Department here show themselves to be willing to flout Parliament. They have no regard for this House.  This House has rights.  We have a right to know what those schools are.  The names of those schools should be published.  It is a matter of public interest that 14 schools, some of them in remote areas, are being closed down, in some instances at least, in circumstances which do not stand up to scrutiny.  I ask the Minister to do his duty by this House and tell us where these schools are.  We have come across a few of them because reports have come back to us and complaints have come back in particular cases, but it is an absurd position that, as the spokesman for education in the principal Opposition party, I do not know what the names of these schools are and the Minister refuses to tell me.  I do not know any democratic parliament in Europe where that kind of thing would be tolerated.  I suspect that even on the other side of the Iron Curtain a Deputy in Parliament would get a reasonably polite reply to a question of that kind, but not, apparently, in this country with its Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>This is one of a number of instances <Col N="55" /> of where the Minister and his Department act ruthlessly, retrospectively, in a manner which is unacceptable in any democratic system, in any system where there is any justice.  We had examples of that earlier in the case of home economics.  I am speaking now on the question of teacher appointments.</P>
    <P>On about 12th May last, the Department issued a circular to schools calling on them not to make any additional appointments&mdash;they were the words used&mdash;without consulting the Department.  This was the result of a decision in the Department overnight&mdash; without consultation, because consultation on matters of this kind is regarded as being beneath the dignity of the Department, to change the pupil-teacher ratio in secondary schools from 1 to 15 to 1 to 20.  First of all, that decision should have been the result of consultation.  In any normal democratic country it would have followed consultation.</P>
    <P>Secondly, a decision to make overnight a change of that character, involving one-third of the ratio, is one which is unacceptable.  It is too sudden. Any change of that kind must be made gradually.  No doubt the Minister and the Department had neglected to review the position, and the raising of the ratio, for which a case can be made except in the particular case of those small schools where special provisions must be made, should have been done gradually.  Not only was it done suddenly and overnight but despite the Minister's statements in this House that nothing of the kind would happen, it was done retrospectively.</P>
    <P>Again and again I had to approach the Minister&mdash;other cases have come up since&mdash;in cases of schools which had appointed teachers prior to May and which were told by the Department that those appointments could not stand, that if the schools wanted to employ these teachers they could pay them themselves, and the schools in most cases had no source of revenue other than public funds, they had no means of paying supernumerary teachers of that kind since they went <Col N="56" /> into the free education scheme.  The Minister, having trapped these schools into the scheme&mdash;not this Minister but his second last predecessor&mdash;is turning around now and telling them they will have to cancel appointments of teachers.</P>
    <P>In this House when I put this to him last year he denied it.  He said it was not true.  When I spoke to him subsequently he reaffirmed that position. The simple fact is that again and again I pointed out to him that this was the effect.  I brought his attention to three cases of schools where this had happened, where the teachers had been appointed and the appointments had to be cancelled.  I think the Minister should be honest in cases like this.  If he is to make retrospective cancellations, if he is to say to schools that they must cancel appointments already made, he should admit that in the House.  It is not good enough to come in here and try to convince people other than those who have specific knowledge like myself that he is not doing anything of the kind.  Any denial by the Minister of this is not an honest denial.  Convents appointed people, in some instances a short while before, in others as far back as the previous January, people had planned their lives accordingly and then the convents were forced to send out letters to them saying: &ldquo;This appointment must be cancelled. The Minister has decided without warning that he will not pay an incremental salary although you are a teacher whom we were entitled to take on under the rules then prevailing.  This has been retrospectively changed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was intolerable this should have been done and it was intolerable the Minister did not come clean about it and that he did not admit that it had been done.  In some cases this has created serious problems for the schools concerned, for schools that have been teaching a particular subject and now find themselves in a position that they cannot teach it.  The Minister is on the one hand preaching that schools must have a wider range of subjects and on the other hand he is retrospectively forcing them to cancel appointments of teachers who would enable the schools to widen the range <Col N="57" /> of subjects.  That is inconsistent and the Minister's attitude to this is less than honest.</P>
    <P>It is intolerable to find the Minister again and again trying to bring in something retrospectively in respect of pupils already engaged on courses.  I do not know if this has ever happened before.  Certainly I do not recall its having happened.  There is a basic principle in education that when a pupil enters on a course that pupil is entitled to complete that course on the terms in which he or she entered it.  Yet, in the case of home economics pupils whom I mentioned earlier, the Minister has again acted arbitrarily.  He tried to present the picture here that the convents concerned, the schools concerned, had had adequate notice. The position is that they were told in 1970 there might be a change.  In January, 1971, through Circular V.57, they were told that for the examination in 1972 and subsequent to that it would be a condition that a certain standard in the leaving certificate, with whatever number of grades are thought to be proper, would apply.  In case anybody suggests that I am not translating it properly, I will read the original:</P>
    <P>Is iad na cáilíochtaí oideachais atá riachtanach: (1) An Ardteistiméireacht le grád C (nó grád níos airde) in dhá ábhar i bpáipéar ardleibhéal.</P>
    <P Just="Center">nó</P>
    <P>An Ardteistiméireacht le honoracha in dha ábhar.</P>
    <P>There is another condition about the necessity to have particular subjects. If it was the Minister's intention at that time that of course it would apply to two subjects, as he seemed to suggest in this House, why did he not say so? Why in 1970 and again in 1971 did he use this vague phraseology that everybody knew it had to be two subjects? The fact is we did not know.  The fact is it was undecided until after the students had started on this year's course.  I quoted at Question Time a letter I received from the principal of one of these colleges.  In it she said:</P>
    <P>Last November, several months after these courses had started, after these pupils had started on these <Col N="58" /> courses, the Department of Education asked me to forward suggestions for revised entry qualifications. I submitted observations in writing but emphasised that no change could come into operation before 1972.  I heard nothing further until last Saturday, February 5th, when I received the new regulations for those competing on April 18th, 1972.  To my astonishment I discovered that the entry qualifications were radically changed, thus disqualifying many students from this year's competitive entrance examination.</P>
    <P>That was disgraceful behaviour on the part of the Department.  It was disgraceful that having indicated their intentions to introduce some system involving a certain date unspecified, they did not say anything about grades, just said something about whatever grades are thought to be necessary.  They did not say how many subjects.  Having given advanced warning of their intention, they failed to come back to the schools before September last to give any indication of what was intended, thereby leaving the schools to assume that for the second year running the matter was being postponed.</P>
    <P>No educationist would ever dream that the Department intended to let pupils start a course and months later to dare to tell them they were not entitled to be doing it, that they would be wasting their time because they would not be able to get the opportunity at the end of it to which success in that course would entitle them. After that, the Department, it would appear from the letter I have received, got in touch with the principal of at least one of these colleges and asked the principal concerned to forward suggestions for revised entry qualifications. When I raised it in the House, the Minister suggested that was not true.  This is not the first time he has thrown accusations across the House that the heads of schools, including, as in this instance, heads of religious orders, are not telling the truth.  As between a nun in charge of a home economics school and the Minister and his Department, I know where my <Col N="59" /> preference lies until I have solid evidence to the contrary as to who is telling the truth.</P>
    <P>The Minister now makes the firm statement, it seems to me highly improbable, that this nun would send me a lying letter telling me of an imaginary request from the Department, an imaginary reply from her pointing out that no change could come into operation before 1972, or that she would suppress the fact that the Department had come back to her and had told her that two honours were required.  I am not prepared to believe that the nun in question, as the Minister suggested in the House, lied in what she said or did not say.  I believe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has changed the phrase from &ldquo;it seems to me&rdquo;.  The Minister at no time suggested that lies were being told.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of what the Minister said was that what I had read out was incorrect, that it was not true.  The distinction between a thing not being true and being a lie is semantic.  Outside that semantic problem, the two mean the same thing. If the Minister says that this nun told me an untruth, that she wrote to me something that was untrue when she said that the Department asked her to do this, he is saying the Department did not ask her and she invented it. He goes on to suggest, apparently, that she did not reply, did not submit proposed changes, did not emphasise that no change had been put into operation before 1972 or that, if she did so, the Department came back to her.  She said: &ldquo;I had heard nothing further.&rdquo; Is that also untrue?  I know perfectly well that what she says is true and I simply do not accept what the Minister has said on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time the Minister and his Department stopped using this House to make these accusations against people in the educational sector who greatly resent the attitude of the Department in these matters.  The Minister has made what he calls a concession; that if these pupils do outstandingly well in their exams in April then he will allow them to carry <Col N="60" /> on though they have not got these grades.  The Minister has an absolute duty in justice to allow pupils who have been permitted to go as far as 5th February with a course&mdash;the Department knowing they were doing so, knowing from the communication from the home economics school that the school was working on this presumption&mdash;to continue and, having continued, to be allowed to enter for the competition to the other colleges and to take their luck with any other pupils.  Some of them, as they are pupils who have not got two honours in leaving certificate, may not get the final entry to these colleges but they have a right to their chance.  The Minister has an absolute duty in justice, and I do not understand how a man with a conscience&mdash;and the Minister I know is a man with a conscience &mdash;can deprive any school pupil of the chance they are entitled to because his Department failed to follow up the original communication, because his Department made a mess of it, asked for proposals to revise entry qualifications two months after, according to him, the school should have known that it was all settled.  The Department failed to reply to that letter. That any pupil should suffer because of the incompetence of his Department in this respect is something which no Minister should have on his conscience.  I do not understand how the Minister can behave like that.  I am sorry if on this matter I speak with some emotion, but there have been too many cases in which the Department have tried this tactic and been covered by the Minister.  We had it in regard to the cancellation of appointments of teachers and we have it here again.  There have been other cases I have had to bring to the Minister's attention in the two years since the last debate.  It is time this Department learned that they cannot act in that way in a democratic country.</P>
    <P>What all this comes back to is that there is no protection, there is no Education Act.  The Department can act completely arbitrarily.  They decide everything under rules and regulations they make under unknown legislation. The Minister does not know what legislation these rules are made under.  The <Col N="61" /> Minister decides everything because he controls everything financially.  Nobody has a right to anything in the educational sector if the Minister decides to withdraw finance.  This method of running education is intolerable and it will be the first concern of this party in Government to put a stop to that and to provide legislation which will lay down clearly the rights and obligations of all concerned&mdash;the rights of the parents, the rights of the school managers, the rights of the teachers, the rights of the pupils and no doubt also the rights of the Minister and the Department, so that people will know where they stand, so that their rights in natural justice cannot be overridden as the Minister has, despite his so-called concession, overridden the rights of these particular pupils.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the financial position in regard to building schools. The Government, and I here exempt the Minister from responsibility, have been using the Department of Education's school building programme as a regulator of the economy.  We have had cutbacks in school buildings.  I worked out figures the last day showing how the amount of spending on primary schools has remained virtually constant in current money terms and has fallen sharply in real terms.  The figure for spending on national school building in 1968-69 was £3,185,000; in 1969-70, £3,230,000; in 1970-71, £3,252,000; in 1971-72, £3,381,000.  When those figures are translated into constant money terms, allowing for increases in building costs, the picture that emerges is of the following annual reduction in the volume of school building.  Allowing for the increase in building costs over the last three years I get a picture like this&mdash;a reduction of about 8 per cent in 1969-70, a further 8½ per cent in 1970-71 and a further 10 per cent in 1971-72.  I hope I have calculated that correctly.  I am a little doubtful about one of my figures because I am having trouble in reading my own writing. This business of using the school building programme as a regulator and cutting back on it in periods of heavy building activity is something which is improper.  If we are to cut back on something when there is heavy building <Col N="62" /> activity let us cut back on office blocks, especially the ones which the Government are renting in such vast numbers. Do not let us cut back on schools.</P>
    <P>However, having cut back in a period of very considerable activity in the building industry and having used the schools for this purpose, the Department of Finance should now be prevailed upon by the Minister at this stage, when there is a need to restimulate the economy and when the building industry is going to face severe difficulty&mdash;apart from house building there is no other sector of building which will be buoyant in the year ahead as far as I can see&mdash;the Minister has a duty to cash in on this regulator attitude of the Department of Finance, to go to them now and say: &ldquo;You have been cutting back for years past because the building industry has been busy.  Now that the building industry is in difficulty, by virtue of the logic of your economic approach, will you now give me some money to restore the annual sharp cuts in the primary school building programme which have been taking place.&rdquo; We saw the circular which was sent out during the year to vocational schools telling them to cut back, saying that:</P>
    <P>Drawings from the Local Loans Fund against authorised loans seem, at recent levels, likely very soon to exhaust the above provision.  It has accordingly been necessary for the present to suspend further payments from this Fund.</P>
    <P>They were told that no fresh commitments were to be entered into and they were to consult with their treasurer about the possibility of getting a special temporary overdraft to enable the committee to deal with urgent accounts.  That is the position the Government were in on 25th October last.  The position has changed sufficiently for the Minister to be able to go, on economic grounds, to the Department of Finance and say: &ldquo;Reverse this.  Give us the money now to build primary schools, to build vocational schools, to restore the cuts that have had to be made because of past mismanagement by the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much then for the post-primary <Col N="63" /> sector.  I want now to refer to certain other institutions such as training colleges. Here the position is extremely unsatisfactory.  The Minister is at loggerheads with the students of training colleges and for very good reason. He is proposing that, instead of doing what has been proposed by this party and what can be done at very little cost, if any, that is, re-organising the teacher-training system so that teachers get a university degree, they are to be confined not to an open university degree but to a B.Ed.  This is something which I have argued before.  I shall not dwell on it now because I set out the views of my party on 16th April, 1970. I think the Minister needs to re-consider the position.  I pointed out to him that the Higher Education Authority itself was inconsistent in its approach to this subject.  They quoted, with approval, a Council of Europe recommendation which read as follows:</P>
    <P>Whereas some universities may be organised with a special accent on teacher-training and educational research, isolated educational universities are not recommended, because they would run the risk of becoming cut off from developments in other fields of scholarship, research and professional training.</P>
    <P>Having recorded that, and talking as if they were accepting it, they turned round and recommended that these training colleges should have a three year course leading to a Bachelor of Educational Science and be confined to that.  I think it is quite wrong that teachers should be confined to this narrow area.  They should, like other professions and indeed more than most other professions, have a broad education within a university college where they will be involved with people in other disciplines and where they can take a subject-orientated degree or a more educationally-orientated degree, depending on their interest in education and the sector they intend to go into.  If we are to have an integrated profession it is absolutely inconsistent with that to have a situation where vocational and secondary teachers go to universities for their professional training and where primary teachers <Col N="64" /> are confined to teacher training colleges. The more I have thought about this since we first put forward our proposals five and a half years ago the clearer I am that we were right in this. In the training colleges themselves the students and the staff, who were sceptical perhaps of our proposals five and a half years ago, have come around to the view that we were right in this respect and that what should be done here is to re-organise the system so that those who intend to become teachers do their university course and subsequently, as is the case with secondary teachers, take a further year of specialised training.  This would need to be a better organised full-time course which the H.Dip. in Education is not.</P>
    <P>That is the approach that should be adopted.  The Minister will only make a botch of it if he accepts the internally inconsistent suggestions of the Higher Education Authority and if he does not grasp this nettle once and for all.  I suspect he will not do so and for a bad reason.  We saw the reason coming out in this House a couple of weeks ago when he told us with rather more emphasis, rather more crossness than is his wont&mdash;even under Opposition provocation he is a mild mannered man and we do provoke him at times&mdash;on that occasion that he had instructed the training college to teach through Irish and they had no right not to be teaching through Irish and that he was determined that they should examine through Irish even if he could not force them to teach through Irish.</P>
    <P>We asked what the authority was for giving instructions to them.  The Minister was distinctly vague about it and was forced eventually to fall back on the fact that he was providing the money and if he does that he thinks he should tell them how to run their affairs, a principle which does not apply to Government grants outside the educational sector.  It is only his Department that has this tradition of dictatorial attitudes to bodies which it finances.  Many bodies obtain finance from the Government and the Government very properly stays out of their policies and does not try to interfere with or dictate to them.  That is the position in all the other Government <Col N="65" /> Departments.  I could name a whole variety of bodies getting grants-in-aid where there is no Government interference and where any such interference would be regarded as quite improper and inappropriate.  Yet, in the educational sphere which, above all, should be safeguarded from Government interference, an area where above all the politicians and administrative civil servants should stay outside, it is here there is this interference.</P>
    <P>I suspect the reason why the teacher training colleges will not be re-arranged in such a way that primary teacher trainees will get university education is because the Minister still finds it difficult to dictate to the universities. He has not written any letters so far to Trinity College or UCD saying that they are to teach through Irish in future.  He has not got into the position where he can dictate that their exams should be through Irish while their courses are through English.  If he has not got that power over them he prefers that teacher trainees should be kept in these colleges where he can still attempt to dictate the language in which the courses are given and can dictate the language in which the examinations are set.  I suspect that is why they will not get what they want from this Government.</P>
    <P>Again, I can assure the House that when the Government changes that matter too will be dealt with as one of many radical educational changes.  In the whole field of educational policy, the job of this side of the House when we get into office will be to reverse an enormous range of Government policies. I reckon there are about 40 different areas of education where we shall have to reverse what the Government is doing.  There is possibly no sphere of Government activity in which the change of Government would have such a radical effect and where the reversal of policy will be so dramatic and cover such a wide field.</P>
    <P>I trust that in the tradition of the public service of another country nearby the Department officials are making suitable preparations for that. We have read in books such as Mr. Wilson's Diary of the arrangements <Col N="66" /> that are made so that when the Government changes the civil servants have their plans already made for the Opposition policies.  I presume this excellent tradition is carried on and that somewhere in the Department in a secret drawer there is a secret file and that when we come into office the secretary of the Department will say: &ldquo;Here is how you are to work out your policies.  Here is how we shall reverse everything we have hitherto been doing.&rdquo;  I trust the reversal of policy will be carried out with the same enthusiasm and dedication which I must say the Department officials show to the misguided policies of the Minister at present.</P>

      <P>We know the Minister's and his Government's confidence that they will be there in perpetuity. Therefore, we shall have more pleasure than usual when the change of Government takes place in seeing the look on their faces.  I look forward particularly to participating in the programme on the evening of the election and to summing up the results and discussing them with members of the Government who will explain why it is that their long term of office has come to an end.  That is a theme I could develop further but not, I think, in the course of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much to be said about the National College of Art.  Much was said on the Bill but there are still many things to be said.  I am very concerned that these elections should take place.  I have been out of touch for a few days and it may be the elections have been held.  Through what contacts I have I did urge that the students should get on with the elections, co-operate in them and try to get representatives <Col N="67" /> elected so that the board can be got into operation as soon as possible.  I hope that has happened but I am sure the Minister is more up to date than I am because I have had no contact since last week with anybody in the college.  Sometimes a period of four or five days passes in which I do not have contact with the people in the college: I look forward to the time when months can pass without such contact being necessary.  I feel this will take time because there are many problems to be sorted out and the Minister knows how deep are the divisions in the college and amongst the staff and amongst the students and between some of the students and some of the staff.  I fear it will be very hard to bridge these gaps.  Having talked to all sides, the students and staff concerned, I find very little common ground except this, although I think the students do not all accept this: I think there is a willingness among the staff to reconsider the whole approach to art education.</P>
    <P>Some of the students may under-estimate the extent to which the staff are willing to discuss a fresh approach. I hope it will be possible for students and staff even yet, despite all that has happened, to sit down together in a constructive discussion wherein the students' ideas, many of which are fresh ideas and worthy of consideration, would be considered in an openminded way by the staff.  I detect among the staff a willingness to adopt that approach and I hope some discussion of that kind will be possible.  We on this side of the House, and I am sure the same applies to the Labour Party, if we could help in trying to restore relations and get discussions going, are very willing to do so at any time.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about one aspect of the college that I do not understand.  I believe there is a steering committee for the design of the new school.  It has been put to me&mdash;I think this is probably incorrect and I put it to the Minister because I think a denial would be useful if it is untrue&mdash;that this steering committee has indicated that it does not propose to resign when the board has been appointed, that the design of the <Col N="68" /> college is not a matter for the board and that they have no function in the matter.  If this were, in fact, the attitude of the steering committee the whole purpose of setting up a board would appear to be frustrated.  If the board cannot even decide what kind of college it will have, I, certainly, would not serve on a board in such circumstances.  I am sure the Minister will be able to make the position clear in his reply and make it clear that the design will be a matter for the board of the college when appointed and that in so far as there is any steering committee that committee will be responsible to the board and nobody else.</P>
    <P>I hope officials of the Department will not attempt to interfere with the work of the board in designing the new college.  If that were not the case I think nobody would want to be appointed to the board.  I hope the Minister's reply will clarify it so that there need be no inhibitions about joining the board and that these rumours that the board will not have power to run its own affairs can be scotched once and for all.  I am sure the Minister will want to do that because there is a danger that people will not accept appointments to the board if they feel that the kind of stories now circulating are correct.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I want to make about universities but I shall not dwell on them at length because we did have a very full debate on the Higher Education Authority Bill on certain aspects of university education. I should like to tell the Minister that there is a feeling amongst university teachers that university reform has been indefinitely delayed.  The fact that we are approaching the fifth anniversary of the O'Malley plan and that we still have not got published the proposals of the Higher Education Authority as to how that plan should be implemented, has depressed people.  For or against the merger they would like to know what the future shape of the institution is to be. The view being expressed in university circles at present is that this document will be published and the Minister will then seek the views of all concerned <Col N="69" /> and all concerned will make representations, no doubt of a contradictory nature, as is customary with academics, and that the Minister will then have to reformulate the proposals and have further consultations, more or less <i>ad infinitum,</i> and eventually legislation will be introduced, legislation which will take a year or, perhaps, several years to get through the Oireachtas.  Judging by the lack of speed in regard to the setting up of the new Department of the Public Service I would not be surprised if this legislation took just as long or, perhaps, longer.  The Bill for the setting up of the new Department was to be introduced last April.  The purpose of the Bill was to establish a new Department charged with the vital task of reforming the Public Service.  The Government have shown not the slightest interest in this.  I myself approached a responsible person in Government to press for that Bill as a matter of urgency.  The best estimate at the moment is that we shall see the 10th anniversary of O'Malley before we see the new university structure. Could the Minister give us some hope and alleviate the pall of despondency that hangs over universities at the moment?  Could he give us some hope that we will see some action to settle this issue because while all this merger talk goes on&mdash;it has died down at the moment&mdash;the universities are in very serious difficulties because of the total inadequacy of their structures and the great difficulty in changing those structures short of new legislation.  In UCD a great deal of work has been done on new proposals for the internal revision of the structure with the object of modernising and democratising it and I hope the Minister will give these proposals very serious consideration when he receives them.</P>
    <P>We had a long discussion on university autonomy.  Deputy Thornley and I would seem to have a different emphasis, but I sometimes think that, if we had the time to get down to it and discuss it <i>au fond</i>, we would find ourselves in closer agreement than would appear from a superficial view of our speeches and I certainly accept <Col N="70" /> that the statements of autonomy issued at times by university teachers and organisations of university teachers are aggressively conservative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>But that does not alter the fact that there are real issues here which this House should be careful in handling.</P>
      <P>A final point on universities, and a topical one, I think, and another good reason for getting on with this merger legislation to my mind&mdash;it may be a small one, but it is certainly a good one&mdash;is making it possible in the colleges of the National University of Ireland to introduce a faculty of theology.  The fact that this is at the moment precluded, since it would be unconstitutional and illegal for the colleges of the National University of Ireland to finance any posts in this area of study, is a very serious defect and there is something ludicrous about a situation in which 64 years after the British Liberal Government imposed this antiquated Victorian piece of non-sectarianism, of secularism really, upon the National University of Ireland an Irish Government still has to act to remove that disability.  It is a serious disability.  The absence of a faculty of theology is a serious defect and a serious loss.  It is one which gives great concern to university teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a Faculty of Divinity in TCD but we cannot have one, and at the very recent staff association seminar, which took place since I was speaking here last, this was one of the topics discussed and a number of speakers put forward their views on it. I would be hopeful that the problems which in the past have loomed up in people's minds, the problems of academic freedom in this particular area, may prove to be less formidable than they might have appeared to be some time ago.  Constructive proposals were put forward by the Irish Theological Association some time ago and it is no secret that the new Catholic Archbishop of Dublin was a member of that association and actively concerned with and interested in these proposals, and his presence in the Roman Catholic <Col N="71" /> Hierarchy now should, I think, facilitate the development in our university colleges of faculties of theology which would have the necessary academic freedom and would add a new dimension, and a badly needed dimension, to these colleges.  We cannot have that until the Minister gets this reforming legislation through, and that is another good reason for getting on with the job and five years is long enough to be dawdling with the subject. I know it is not all the Minister's fault.  A great deal of it is the fault of other people, but it could have been handled more expeditiously if we had had, perhaps, fewer Ministers of Education and more continuity.  Let us now handle it expeditiously.</P>
    <P>There are two other aspects I want to mention.  Time does not permit me to do more than mention them and one of them will be dealt with more fully by another speaker from our party later in the debate.  I refer to the question of reformatory and industrial schools.  I am not an expert on this subject and others here will be able to speak with more authority than I can but, from what I have read on the subject, I find it deeply depressing. The fact that it now transpires that Marlborough House will be kept going without trained staff for a further period and that children will be sent there to their detriment by the Government of this country is something we simply find unacceptable.  It simply cannot be true that the Government is incapable of leasing a suitable premises somewhere and finding some trained staff to look after that premises.  If the Government are incapable of doing that small task then they really should not be there at all.  The Minister has responsibility.  I appeal to him simply to tell his officials that he wants a premises leased and trained staff employed there within a month or six weeks from now and to get on with it or get out.  It is time the Minister took action in this matter and did not allow bureaucratic excuses to hold up humane action, action which is long overdue.  I shall leave others to develop that theme more fully, but it is a matter with which the Minister really <Col N="72" /> ought to concern himself and a matter to which he ought to give priority.</P>
    <P>My next point relates to the National Library and the National Museum. These were very fully debated recently in the Seanad and it would be superfluous for me to go over the same ground again here because the debate there really raised all the key issues. The debate certainly showed an extraordinarily depressing position and what bothered me about the Minister's speech was the fact that, while tagged on at the end there was a reference to the National Gallery&mdash;at least something has been done&mdash;as far as I could see there was no reference to the National Library and the National Museum.  I know there is a problem here.  I know the Minister has difficulty in providing funds and all the rest of it but, in the light of what was disclosed in the Seanad debate and in view of the response given in that debate on the Government side, surely his speech could have contained some hopeful reference as to what is going to be done for the National Library and the National Museum.  The way in which these bodies have been treated is not only a disgrace but an enlightenment to public opinion here and elsewhere as to what Governments of this country mean by preserving Irish culture.</P>
    <P>Preserving Irish culture is a great thing off a platform at election times; it goes down well when one is not asked to define it.  To me, preserving Irish culture means making sure that those things that have been handed down from the past are not destroyed by neglect but are safeguarded in adequate premises by skilled and trained people and made available and accessible to people who want to learn from them about our past.  The neglect of our culture is when these things are not done as they have not been done by this Government.  I will not take seriously any statement by anybody on the other side of the House about Irish culture as long as this neglect of these institutions which enshrine so much of our culture continues.  The Minister is someone who is genuinely concerned about our culture and he must surely bestir himself and insist that adequate <Col N="73" /> provision is made and I hope, if he did not advert to this matter in his opening speech, he will at least mention it in his reply.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is to make a plea to the Minister for special action in a matter which concerns North-South relations.  I refer to the position of Magee College in Derry. That college has suffered from the decision to establish the new University of Ulster in Coleraine, a decision many of us believe to have been politically motivated, politically motivated by people in the Northern Unionist Government or Unionist circles who did not want the city of Derry to have the opportunity of being a major cultural centre.  It may be that some of these people were genuine or thought they were genuine and honest in the decision they took, that they felt the state of Derry, after 50 years of Unionist rule, was such that to try to place a university there was pretty hopeless.  I suppose there is something to be said for that point of view.  Considering the atmosphere in Derry today it is not very conducive, perhaps, to educational development at any level, from the primary school level upwards, but, of course, the way you change that is not by neglecting the place, not by cutting it off from possibilities, but by providing the possibilities there; and the fact that the Unionist Government did not do that and diverted the university to Coleraine is a reason why we, who have a responsibility for Derry, should now do something about it.  Derry is the natural university centre of the northwest of Ireland.  It is within a mile or two of County Donegal and in the past, as an education centre, it has served Donegal very well.  I know that in recent times because of the situation in Derry many people from Donegal who went formerly to Derry to avail themselves of the educational facilities there do so no longer.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to do something in this matter.  The fact that this university is situated in our national territory, as so claimed in the Constitution, but outside our jurisdiction, does not prevent us from helping it.  Apparently the Government intend providing money <Col N="74" /> for an alternative assembly and since they can do that there is no reason why they should not provide money for Magee University.  The Government should apply their minds to the building up of a university college at Derry that would be designed to serve the whole of west Ulster, regardless of the Border, because there is no Border at the level of university studies.  This would be an imaginative gesture and one that would have some meaning not only for the people of Derry but for the people of Northern Ireland as a whole.  I do not think that even hardened Unionists would regard such a gesture as interference but that they would be prepared to see it as a generous gesture on our part to try to do something for a stricken part of our country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give urgent consideration to this matter because the fate of this college is now at stake and the chances of saving it depend on action being taken quickly. Educationally, this college is necessary. It is necessary for the future of west Ulster.  Whatever may be the political future and however long it may take to get rid of the Border that part of Ireland should be our prime concern. The college is necessary for Donegal. Here there is an opportunity for the Minister to do something imaginative that would serve the cause of national re-unification in time to come, that would serve the immediate interests of west Ulster and which would serve the people of Donegal who are in our own jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>If there is one note on which I should like to end it is that we must have a White Paper followed by an Education Act.</P>

      <P>This is essential.  It is wrong that the Minister should continue to rule the whole system by control of the pursestrings and by issuing rules and regulations without, apparently, any authority to do so.  It is wrong that teachers, school managers, pupils and parents should find themselves at the mercy of the arbitrary whim of the Minister's Department which he so often and so wrongly <Col N="75" /> stands over.  This must end.  I can guarantee that when there is a change of Government it will end, but I would like the Minister to say that in the interim work will start on this project so that the drawers of the Department will not be totally empty when there is a change of Government.</P>

      <P>In rising to speak on this Estimate, which is the first opportunity we have had in two years to discuss the Education Estimate, I cannot say at this stage for exactly how long I shall speak, but I doubt if I will follow my friend and colleague, Deputy FitzGerald, into the four hours and 15 minutes during which he has entertained us on this subject.  If I may be permitted both by the Chair and by Deputy FitzGerald to open on a flippant note, I might say that the frustration which this House has experienced by not being able to discuss education during the past two years could scarcely be demonstrated more clearly than by the amount of time which Deputy FitzGerald has devoted to the subject on this occasion.  With due respect to Deputy FitzGerald, although I agree with most of his remarks, at times they must appear to be mutually contradictory.  He seems to offer to us an educational world in Ireland in which there would be less interference by the Minister, more consultation with the interested parties and, at the same time, better solutions.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that those three logical premises are what Marx would have called antynoms&mdash;self-contradictory in many ways.  Very often it is by proceeding through the route of consultation that one achieves the least. While I am no exponent of Ministerial dictatorship, the fact remains that not every vested interest is a progressive interest either in education or in anything else.</P>

      <P>But there are times when the knots are so gordian that only the kind of intervention undertaken from time to time by the late Donagh O'Malley is appropriate to untie them. While I shall have a considerable number of criticisms to voice on the <Col N="76" /> Minister's speech in particular and in Government policy in general, I think it would be appropriate to open my contribution to this debate by offering a certain amount of congratulations to the Government on some of the achievements they have effected during the past decade.  Progress has not always been even.  If anything, it is becoming slower, not because of the lack of interest of our present Minister but perhaps because there is less money to go round, because there are apparently more pressing national subjects on the agenda, because education is no longer the gross area of interest, still less of money, than it was ten years ago or because the North oppresses us all.  In some ways we have slowed down in educational progress, but at the same time we must accept that the present Government of Governments, if one wants to be flippant about Cabinet changes in Fianna Fáil, have done more for educational growth during the past ten years than was done collectively in the preceding 40 years.  Education has become a vital item on the national agenda and whole new generations of young people are receiving education in secondary and vocational schools and at universities who would not have received this education before now.</P>
      <P>We must give credit where credit is due.  Looking back on the record of expansion in expenditure in education during the past ten years, one sees a steady record of progress.  The mere fact that issues like the future of the smaller schools, in both the primary and secondary areas, the optimum size of a university, and the future of an institution like the National College of Art should be something of a political controversy in which a lot of people are interested is a credit to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many years ago, when I was first elected a Fellow of TCD, I said in my speech of acceptance that one of the tragedies of Irish education was that to the vast majority of my fellow Dubliners TCD was an interesting architectural structure around which they went on a bus but one which they would never enter as students.  While progress is never adequate, there has been progress and significant changes <Col N="77" /> have taken place during the past decade so that now to talk about higher education, in particular, is to talk about something that is not a total irrelevance to everybody but a favourite 10 per cent in the community.</P>
    <P>Let me not be misunderstood.  I am not suggesting for one moment that progress has been far enough or fast enough, but within the restrictions both of our economic set up as a small and relatively poor country and within the political restrictions which attend education&mdash;no subject is covered more by political restrictions than education&mdash; progress has been significantly and meaningfully made.  I have jokingly said in other places that the cleanest form of politics are politics themselves, trade union politics are slightly dirtier and the dirtiest of all are educational politics.  The Minister, with all the mistakes he may have made, should be judged as a person beset by many factions whose criticisms of him, while united in volume, derive from different and conflicting motivations.  While I fault both his philosophy and his performance on certain points, I am realist enough to appreciate the difficulties he faces.</P>
    <P>Having opened on that relatively friendly note, I shall deal with matters of greater detail and, perhaps, more negative matters.  I intend to adopt the chronologically opposite approach to that adopted by Deputy FitzGerald; I shall discuss the details first and, secondly, I shall discuss the over-riding philosophy.  In a sense this means I will follow the Minister more precisely than did Deputy FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>I am dissatisfied with the overall expenditure in the primary school area, in particular regarding the matter of school building.  I do not think that the rise in capital expenditure in this area is adequate.  On 4th November, 1971, I asked the Minister about the degree of capital expenditure on primary education.  My figures differ slightly from Deputy FitzGerald's but his figures were concerned exclusively with school building.</P>
    <P>The figures the Minister gave me for 1969-70 were £3.7 million, for 1970-71 £3.3 million, for 1971-72 £3.8 million.  I do not think this is an <Col N="78" /> adequate amount, given the primitive conditions under which many of the children and primary teachers have to work, particularly in rural areas.  One of the points in respect of which I have often taken the Minister to task in the past is that when pressed on the size of classes in primary schools he persists in giving average figures.  Invariably he argues that it would be beyond the resources and time of his Department to give us figures broken down in a specific regional way.  In this way, intentionally or otherwise, he conceals the fact that in certain large urban areas with high populations the circumstances under which the children are being taught are disgraceful and deplorable.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald has quoted the figure of 70 per cent of classes being more than 40 in number.  This is by comparison with a Government optimum of one to 32.  In certain areas in Dublin it is an open secret that 40 is an under estimate; there are classes of 50 pupils and in some cases of 60 pupils.  The maintenance of any kind of educational standards in such classes obviously is an impossibility. The maintenance of discipline is difficult in classes of such size and, in turn, this leads inevitably to recourse to corporal punishment which is still practised on a large scale in the Irish educational system.  For many years the Labour Party have opposed corporal punishment, as I do also.</P>
    <P>The Minister should bear in mind that the low level of education in some Dublin schools and the high incidence of corporal punishment relates to the size of classes.  The Minister has stated that £3,850,000 is estimated for 1971-72 but, in this context, is this an adequate amount?  I cannot follow Deputy FitzGerald into the complexities of economics but it seems patently clear that, with the rise in the cost of living and the depreciation of money, we are only holding our own in the level of primary school building. Given the fact that not merely are many of our schools out-dated but that the life expectancy of schools is subject to constant depreciation in value, we should not consider that the performance in this area is adequate. <Col N="79" /> This is one of the most vital of areas in teaching because, for better or worse, it is the area that affects our children.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister and his Department upon the new curriculum.  It is a good curriculum and it has brought a more sophisticated and less examination-orientated form of teaching into our primary schools.  I believe it will be a success and I am glad the Minister has taken this course.  I know the Minister is providing an extra £55,000 for audio-visual teaching aids and for courses for teachers, but I suggest that at this time the amount is not sufficient for this developing area in primary education.</P>
    <P>There are aspects of the schools transport system which should be looked at closely.  All these topics, such as the closing down of small primary schools, the closing down of small secondary schools, and the acceptance of the necessity to increase the numbers of pupils in universities, are aspects of one total pattern of education. The idea that the bigger concentration in each case is better, and that it will lead to better education, is not an argument with which I am in profound disagreement.  Fundamentally I accept the underlying philosophy of the argument of the bigger unit.  Here, the central thesis of the Department, which is impossible to divorce from Buchanan, is correct, although there are areas of exception.  For example, there are areas with ethnic traditions like Dún Chaoin which are exempt from the overall working of this law. There is no law that does not have exceptions but, in the main, I accept the argument.  However, it is applied by the Department in some cases with a certain degree of absolute inhumanity. One such case is Dún Chaoin, about which, I hope, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien will have something to say. As everyone in this House knows through no fault of my own I am not proficient in the Irish language and I am not competent to talk about it.</P>
    <P>With regard to transport, the regulations about distance and the ages of <Col N="80" /> the pupils should be treated more flexibly.  I know of a case where a child lives fractionally closer to an old school which is about to be closed than to a new school.  The parents were told that the bus which brings children to the new school will not take their child to the new school because the child lives closer to the old school.  The child must attend the old school until it is closed, after which he will be transferred to the new school.  This is a detailed case and is one I may take up with the Minister privately.</P>
    <P>The matter of teacher training needs looking at in greater detail.  I was among those people who were not happy with the report of the Higher Education Authority on this subject. I think the Minister knows this because I have brought it up in another context, but I hope he will not be bound too closely by the case of those who are known as &ldquo;professional educationalists&rdquo;.  I told the Minister previously in this House that I do not know what is an educationalist. At the risk of antagonising people in my own area of teaching, it appears to me that the worst person to advise a Government on a particular area of administration is the person who is professionally involved in the practice in question.</P>
    <P>Very often the so-called specialist educationalist is somebody who is simply externalising a specific vested interest and in this case I would hope that the report would not be too rigidly adhered to by the Minister.</P>
    <P>My own view is that we are in danger here of repeating the mistakes made by the British Labour Government and elevating to the status of university institutions which traditionally existed, just by making a stroke of the pen.  Let me be clear about this: I am not criticising any individual teacher training college.  Some of them are excellent; St. Patrick's is an obvious example.  However, the Minister needs to develop a clearcut policy about the number of years necessary to acquire a primary teacher training qualification equivalent to a university degree.  Does this involve bringing the potential trainee teacher on to the <Col N="81" /> campus of an existing university, or does it involve giving greater status, greater funds and greater facilities to an existing training college like St. Patrick's?  I do not know for certain the answer to these questions.  I would tend to favour the latter rather than the former, because our traditional university colleges in Ireland are now reaching a size beyond which they will cease to be effective educational institutions.</P>
    <P>I want to deal at some length with the question of secondary teaching, but let me say that the relatively brief remarks I have made on primary education do not imply that I do not regard it as having ultimately the greatest importance of the whole lot. I would commend much the Minister has done here.  Given the reservations I have made about specific schools like Dunquin and Montpelier, I think the Department's and the Minister's policy is the correct one.  Those of us in this House who, on the one hand, demand higher standards of teaching of children in primary schools, but who, on the other hand, when a closure of a small school occurs within our own constituency scream the loudest about it, are guilty of hypocrisy here.  I think the Minister is proceeding broadly on the right lines here, except for one thing which I am glad I remembered before I leave this question of primary schools.  I should like the Minister to comment on the future of the three-teacher school.  This is something I pressed him upon before.</P>
    <P>Far be it from me to make a speech here of the pastoral Ruskinite kind which ex-Deputy Lindsay used to make about the intrinsic beauty of the one or two-teacher school and the frogs hopping along the road and that sort of thing.  But at some point one stops.  At some point a school becomes a viable educational unit and I would have thought that three teachers was, perhaps, that point.  While I am quite happy to see the children of Ireland commuting four, six or ten miles to three and four-teacher schools, a vision of Ireland as a member of the Common Market&mdash;a subject to which I shall not refer again in this debate, I hope&mdash;in which children come 20 miles to <Col N="82" /> enormous aglomerations of primary schools is not one which would attract me.  I should like the Minister to make some comment on this, the point at which his Department intend, in principle, to say: &ldquo;This is the acceptable size of a school.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the subject of secondary teaching, I think I can really indulge myself in criticism of the Minister.  I think it is fair to say that ever since the days of the immemorial Ryan Report the Minister's relations with the Association of Secondary Teachers of Ireland have (a) pursued an impenetrably complicated path and (b) have involved such a high degree of aversion on both sides that the situation is now so bad that one does not really know what can be done next.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming the Minister or his predecessor exclusively for this.  No one has been more critical of the ASTI in this House than I have and I have letters both signed and anonymous to prove it.  On many occasions in the past I have seen that organisation as an essentially conservative, entrenched organisation proud of its professional status, determined to preserve the class distinction between its members and the vocational and primary teachers.  I have seen it as an association which resisted any implication that it was a trade union, delighting rather in its quarterly salaried payments carrying with them the status of the gentleman and only reacting into trade unionism when forced to by the conflict with the Minister.  I said all these things before and I make no apology for saying them again.  With the principle of the Ryan scheme, which was at the start of the whole complex problem which now faces secondary education, I find myself in essential agreement.</P>
    <P>It does remain true, however, that the Minister and his predecessors have succeeded now in alienating the secondary teaching profession to a degree which has not existed for many years. The most recent instance of this is the botch that has been made by virtually everybody concerned of the concept of the posts of responsibility in schools, an issue which at the moment stands at stalemate.  I would be only wasting the time of the House to go back in <Col N="83" /> laborious detail over the shiftings backwards and forwards between straight salary increases, posts of special function and posts of responsibility over the last three or four years. Never has it been defined what is a post of responsibility.  Is it locking the school door as you go home?  Is it opening the school door in the morning? Is it taking care of the school debating society?  Is it taking care of the school library?  Or is it just being older than anybody else in the school?</P>
    <P>None of these things has been made clear, and here I think the Minister, to a certain extent, is as much at fault as the association, because confronted by the divisions which existed between the different branches of the secondary teaching profession, the ASTI, the Religious Teachers Association, and the clerical managers, his Department has tended rather to glory in those decisions and play both ends off against the middle than to seek to heal them. Here I think that for once the secondary teachers are, in the main, in the right.</P>
    <P>With all the defects of the Ryan scheme, one of the things it explicitly promised to the lay teacher was that where the principalship of the school was held by a cleric, the vice-principal-ship would be held by a layman.  This was a very important promise to make, and I recall reading at some time the famous article by Mr. O'Connor which was so much criticised then, criticised because it was said that a civil servant should not come into the public press to enunciate what was tantamount to educational philosophy.  I have always thought this criticism was completely wrong, and I want to put in a word here for the development division of the Department of Education.  I think they are right in playing a constructive role in formulating educational policy.</P>
    <P>I know there will be other speakers, even from my own benches, who will follow me and disagree with this. Speakers, for example, will take exception to the fact, as Deputy FitzGerald did, that the Minister permitted civil servants of his Department to go <Col N="84" /> around the country explaining the community schools project, a topic to which I will later refer.  At this stage I just want to say that the principle of a civil servant expounding policy of this kind does not seem to me in any way improper.  I think it is perfectly correct. Here we are being slave-bound by the British tradition that the civil servant is a remote, anonymous person who can never be seen anywhere except discreetly at the Minister's elbow.  If we were to follow French administrative experience, for example, we would not accept any such view.  I have no objection to the role which the Department played in that matter.</P>
    <P>Going back to my point about Mr. O'Connor's article, the defects of the Ryan scheme were essentially money defects.  It is as simple as that.  They threatened some teachers with the possibility of loss of earnings.  They threatened others with the possibility that younger people might be promoted over their heads.  They threatened them with the possibility that teachers in particular areas like science and mathematics, where it is notoriously difficult to recruit teaching staff, might be appointed to posts of responsibility at a younger age than their seniors teaching what one must with regret call the dying subjects, like Latin and Greek.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances the response of the ASTI&mdash;and this is going back some years&mdash;was essentially conservative and negative.  Much has changed since then.  The Association of Secondary Teachers have become more realistic even if they have become more militant.  The Minister could well win the goodwill of that association if he were to do two things, on the one hand, if he would make a substantive offer of meaningful posts of responsibility, assistant principalships and things like that, and, on the other hand, if he called the bluff of the Association of Secondary Teachers in the process and said to them: &ldquo;Right.  Is this what you want?  Do you want to be involved in the running of your schools?  Do you want a say in the curricula?  Do you want vice-principalships?  Do you want status in the schools or do you want to remain&rdquo;&mdash;and I quote from memory how Mr. O'Connor put it&mdash;&ldquo;the hired <Col N="85" /> hands whose involvement in the school ceases when they go out the door?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister should present them with those alternatives and call their bluff.  Here I want to make a contribution different from the contribution which Deputy FitzGerald would make. The sooner the lay teachers come to realise that their natural allies in the evolution of secondary education lie within the Department rather than elsewhere, the better for all parties concerned, instead of the unnatural form of conservatism by which, in the main, too often in the past the secondary teachers have chosen to opt for alliance against the Department and with the traditional conservatism elements in Irish education&mdash;I do not mean all the religious but I mean some of them.  Here the clerical headmasters have not covered themselves with glory. Recent events do not suggest that the teaching orders want lay vice-principals. I believe the younger lay teachers are coming to realise that there is no instinctive antipathy between them and the State and that, in fact, the State is more appropriately their ally in the development of education.</P>
    <P>At the time of the short-lived teachers' strike&mdash;when the rather disastrous settlement of 1969, I think it was, was accepted&mdash;a teacher I knew said to me: &ldquo;Thank God for one thing.  The State has been kept out of education.&rdquo;  If that is the teachers' attitude, they are cutting their longterm throats for the sake of a shortterm temporary financial advantage. If the teachers want to take part in the running of their schools they should say so and make it clear.  The price they will have to pay for this is the abandonment of the principle of seniority in some cases.  The price they will have to pay for this in the long run is the payment of their salaries from the single source of the State. Nothing has ever seemed more unreal to me than the manner in which secondary teachers are paid, with one lump of their salaries coming from the State, and another slightly smaller lump coming from the State to the school and then back to them undersigned by the Mother Superior or the Brother as the case may be.  This is an <Col N="86" /> inheritance which goes back to Disraeli's time.  It is quite ridiculous and should be ended.</P>
    <P>I want to touch on some other points which bear on secondary education before turning to the inevitable hoary annual of the community schools.  A point upon which I do not think Deputy FitzGerald touched&mdash;and how there could be any point which Deputy FitzGerald could manage to omit touching upon I do not know but I do not think he touched upon this&mdash;was the great degree of disquiet felt by many vocational teachers in particular at the manner in which the secondary schools are permitted to conduct selection procedures.  Unlike the vocational schools, the secondary schools accept no obligation to educate every pupil who lives within the catchment area of the school in question.  This means in a sense that the abolition of the primary certificate, which was one of the late Deputy O'Malley's major reforms, is vitiated by the fact that the school can seek by intelligence tests, for example, or interviews, to select the bright child or perhaps the upper-class child.  I am not happy with that situation and it has been widely protested against by the vocational teachers.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald made much of the fact that children who mature early are not permitted to proceed to secondary education before the age of 12 years.  I agree with him on that point but there is the parallel opposite danger by which the secondary school can seek to cream off the kind of child it wants, either for snobbish reasons or for intellectual reasons.  That type of thing is no longer meaningful in a day in which we, the taxpayers, pay £20 million a year approximately for current expenditure and maintenance of secondary schools.  I do not think these schools have a right to independence although I run the risk of being called a Communist for saying that.  I do not think that a school which was set up in 1850 or 1870, in circumstances in which it was totally self-sustaining through school fees, and which is now to all intents and purposes maintained by the State, can maintain the same attitude towards the community which it maintained a century ago.  I do not <Col N="87" /> think the Minister thinks so either and my sympathies would be with him here.</P>
    <P>In turn, the schools have a valid cause of complaint.  The point has been made by Deputy FitzGerald and myself and others that the grant in respect of the so-called free secondary education has not been raised in the many years since it first came into effect, years of growing inflation and an increasing cost of living.  On 4th November, 1971, I asked the Minister if he had any plans to increase the grant payable in respect of children attending secondary schools who had opted into the &ldquo;free education&rdquo; system.  The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>It is not contemplated at present to increase the <i>per capita</i> grant in lieu of school fees payable in respect of pupils attending secondary schools which have opted to enter the free education scheme.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he concluded with that glorious all-embracing cliché, &ldquo;the matter is being kept under review.&rdquo; This simply is not good enough.  The headmasters of some of the schools are intensely conservative but some are not. Some are quite prepared to enter into a constructive partnership with the State, and, in particular, the younger brothers and the younger priests are happy to do so.  In effect, they are being asked to provide free education on the cheap.  In the early years they provided the buildings.  I admit that this is less now but they still supply a fair proportion of the sustenance of the schools by the surrender of their own salaries. They are being asked to involve themselves in a State aid system where the grants paid by the State are no longer meaningfully related to the cost of educating the pupils.  This in turn has led, as we all know, to the introduction of more and more of these voluntary schemes by which children are asked to contribute for specific purposes such as a new swimming pool or a games room.  A question mark hangs over these voluntary schemes whereby no poor child wants to tell his teacher that his mother or his father is unable to contribute to one of those voluntary <Col N="88" /> schemes.  We all know that this goes on but the Government are being evasive in not facing up to it.  It is not honourable to describe as free education something which is, in fact, subsidised by the parents under a process which is allegedly voluntary but to all social intents and purposes is, in fact, compulsory.</P>
    <P>I am apportioning the blame equally on both sides.  The schools, wanting to retain the power they had in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century are anxious to keep ministerial hands off their buildings and their administration, even if only in a token way, and the Department are anxious to give an impression of State involvement in education to the point of free education but are not prepared to foot the bill.  In between the two the pupil is the sufferer.  He suffers the increased size of classes for example.  The capital expenditure on schools, as stated in a reply to a question which I put down on 4th November has remained virtually static since 1968-69. In fact, in the estimate given by the Minister on that day it is fractionally lower this year than in the year before. All this time the number of people attending secondary schools is increasing&mdash;all credit to the Minister that this is so&mdash;but the cost of this in human terms is overcrowded classes.</P>
    <P>Another way this cost is met by the Minister is by the subtle suggestion referred to by Deputy FitzGerald that recruitment in secondary schools should be phased back.  This means nothing more or less than that the existing number of teachers broadly should teach additional hours.  This fact was virtually admitted to me in this House by the Parliamentary Secretary in reply to a question which I asked on that subject.</P>
    <P>There are reasons why these detailed points are not being grasped.  They derive from the fact that there is not an overall philosophy of education in the present Government and more specifically there certainly is not a socialist philosophy in education.  For the moment I have chosen to adopt the opposite approach to that of Deputy FitzGerald.  I want to point step by step the defects which I <Col N="89" /> see in the existing structure and then, perhaps, at the end, rather than he did at the beginning, to draw these together.</P>
    <P>I do not think a system, by which the management and control of primary schools, more particularly, with the managerial system, and secondary school by the by-partisan system of control between the Government and the teaching orders, can be permitted to continue in circumstances where capital expenditure in the coming year is estimated at reaching £15.7 million.  Nobody in these benches sets out as a revolutionary to destroy the existing system and uproot teaching orders from places where they have been for many years but surely it is hardly possible to argue that in the case of new schools the same system that applied in the past can be permitted to continue.</P>
    <P>A new school is being built in a community like Tallaght and the outgoing Archbishop of Dublin invited a particular teaching order to perform the teaching function.  I feel an historical anomaly exists here.  We do not any longer live in penal times where education could only be provided by the self-sacrifice of teaching orders. We live now in complex economic times in which the community pay for education and should correspondingly control it.  Like Deputy FitzGerald, I am not happy with the Government's conception of what constitutes the appropriate size for secondary schools.  In reply to a number of questions put down today by Deputy Kenny and Deputy Enright the Minister was evasive about the Government's view of the optimum size of a school.  This gets back to the question of the future of the three-teacher primary school, seeing the whole thing together and the Government are effecting a revolution in the size of schools by stealth.  It may be a revolution with which I would agree if I understood the terms.  I rather suspect I would agree with it but I should like to be told what is going on.</P>
    <P>At the moment that is not the case. What is the target for a secondary school&mdash;200, 300, 400 pupils?  What is the teacher-pupil ratio?  Why are the <Col N="90" /> existing 14 schools chosen for closure? Why have the special cases of Durrow, Cloghane and Ballycastle been taken into consideration?  Is the whole restructuring of secondary education on the lines envisaged in terms of the regional development outlined in the Buchanan Report taking place or is it not?  If it is, then we should be told about it in a White Paper, as Deputy FitzGerald and many others have correctly said, so that we can assess here what exactly we are at.</P>
    <P>The Minister might, indeed, find that he had some friends in surprising places.  I know the Minister with the majority the Government have at the moment does not seem to care very much whether he has friends or not on these benches, but it may surprise him to know that, if he told us in a White Paper what he is doing, he would get a great deal more sympathy from many of those for whom I speak than he would anticipate.  In those circumstances he could find that a parliamentary discussion on secondary schools would fragment as between parties rather like the discussion on contraception fragmented them the other night.  The Minister would find that there are some strange conservatives on this side of the House who do not support his plans and the plans of his Department, and that there are some unexpected liberals, socialists, call them what you will, on this side of the House, who have, in fact, sympathey for what he is endeavouring to do and would offer him congratulations rather than hostility.  The Minister would be wise to take that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The next point I want to deal with is the financing of the rebuilding of secondary schools which are increasingly falling into disrepair.  This is a lengthy and complex subject.</P>

      <P>As I said the last day, I support this Bill but I am inclined to agree with Deputy Dr. Gibbons that the amount of good it would do if it had been acceptable to the Minister, is extremely limited.  I do not believe in this business of putting a notice on packages, or that kind of thing.  The fact of the matter is that the real way to deal with this problem, if anybody did really want to deal with it, would be to prohibit all advertising of cigarettes.  There is no reason why it should apply to other forms of tobacco, I understand.  Anything else is just waste of time.</P>
      <P>Section 2 subparagraph (b) says:</P>
      <P>requiring that, all advertisements whatsoever by tobacco manufacturers ... shall contain the information prescribed by the Minister from time to time.</P>
      <P>The Government have, in fact, taken out of the television service all advertising of cigarettes but I am told&mdash;I do not listen that much to it&mdash;that the amount of time given to advertising cigarettes on the radio has greatly increased. There is only one method of dealing with the matter and that is to prohibit all advertising of cigarettes. Anything else is just tinkering with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely desirable that this subject should be raised again and again in the House so that young people in particular will not start smoking.  One thing I notice is that the medical profession, about whom I talked the last day, have not much regard for medicines, strangely enough, but when the relevant figures first came out in the United States of the effect of cigarette smoking, all the doctors that I knew gave up smoking.  It was a wonderful transformation in the profession that they were paying some attention to a medical matter.  This, naturally, conveys a certain conviction to my mind, that they were convinced that smoking cigarettes was extremely deleterious to health because, on the whole, it is well known that the medical profession have very little regard for their own health and, that being the case, they very seldom have any regard <Col N="92" /> for medicines and do not bother to stay in bed when they get a serious attack of influenza, and so on.  The result is that their mortality rate is very high. This proof that they regarded cigarette smoking as beyond question a serious health hazard, convinced me that it was essential to prohibit advertising of cigarettes.  I see no reason why the advertising of cigarettes should not be completely prohibited.  I do not see much good in putting the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; on a box of cigarettes.  The ordinary person who is a confirmed cigarette smoker will continue to smoke and will show the box to his friend and say: &ldquo;Look.  I smoke poison&rdquo; and will not have the slightest regard for it.</P>
    <P>As some of the medical Deputies have mentioned, moderate consumption of cigarettes does not have any very serious deleterious effects but until society here sets its face completely against cigarette smoking it will not be eliminated and, above all else, unless the Government set their face against it, but they will not set their face against it because the Government get such a huge amount of revenue&mdash;£40 million to £50 million&mdash;every year from the duty on tobacco.  The Government, therefore, will not accept any prohibition in effect on the use of cigarettes because the great bulk of the revenue from tobacco comes, in fact, from cigarettes.  This being the case, the Government will not accept this Bill or any other Bill to control the sale of tobacco.</P>
    <P>This suggests, of course, that the Government have not any very serious concern about the health of the community in general.  They can answer: &ldquo;It is not our concern.  We take the money and let other people pay the price.&rdquo;  That is the attitude.  This is extremely bad.</P>
    <P>While I support the Bill, I do not think it goes nearly far enough, even if we accepted that it would have very much effect on anyone or on anything, if we are to continue to have advertising of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I do appreciate that the position has changed since advertising of cigarettes ceased on television.  Therefore, I would <Col N="93" /> hope that the Government would carry it one stage further and at lease cease cigarette advertising on the official radio station.  This is the least we could ask for.  If they are not prepared to interfere with newspaper advertising and hoarding advertising and all that kind of thing, there is one thing certain and that is, that they should cease cigarette advertising on the radio.  They do not have to prohibit it.  All they have to do is to tell the radio station that there is to be no more advertising of cigarettes on the radio station and there will not be any more.  It does not require a Bill.  The advertising was got rid of on the television service without any Bill.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill introduced by Deputy Dr. Browne and supported by Deputies O'Connell, Cooney and Harte.  Deputy Browne had better luck with this Bill in that at least he got a discussion on it than he had with a Private Members' Bill that he introduced on a former occasion and he had better luck with this Bill than Deputy Byrne and myself had with a Bill dealing with drugs that we introduced a few weeks ago and which was refused a discussion.</P>
      <P>Cigarette smoking and drug addiction are very serious problems with which the Dáil must contend.  It is the published view of medical experts in this country and in other countries that lung cancer is associated with cigarette smoking.  That being the case, Deputies have a serious responsibility to discuss the problem and to consider means of removing this health hazard.</P>
      <P>In my view the Minister, in rejecting the Bill, did not give it sufficient consideration. He accepts, as we all do, medical and scientific opinion as to the danger to health of cigarette smoking. A duty devolves on all of us here to discuss the matter openly and freely with a view to having legislation introduced, if necessary, designed to remove this health hazard.</P>

    <P>When Deputy Dr. Browne introduced a few years ago a measure similar to the one now under discussion there were doubts with regard to the danger of cigarette smoking but those <Col N="94" /> doubts have since been dispelled.  If it is considered medical opinion that cigarette smoking represents a health hazard, we should set about doing something about it immediately.  It is ironical that we should provide nearly £90 million for the Health Estimate every year and that having spent that vast sum of money trying to help people with their health problems we should be allowing people to smoke cigarettes and then spend so much money on them to undo the damage caused by cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to point out the dangers attached to cigarette smoking. Where the Minister and this side of the House disagree is in our approach to the problem.  I do not accept, like Deputy O'Donovan, that putting a notice on a packet of cigarettes will not affect people.  If we tell people by way of notice on a cigarette packet that the contents contain poison, at some time when a person is taking the cigarettes out of his pocket or opening the packet he is bound to notice the warning and possibly to act on it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that is very lukewarm and will not bring home to habitual smokers the dangers attached to smoking.  I suggest the word &ldquo;poison&rdquo; should appear and I further suggest that it should appear in red. That would possibly bring home to smokers the dangers involved.  In regard to advertising, as Deputy O'Donovan has said, television advertising has ceased.  I suggest it should be stopped also on radio and in the newspapers.  I think most of us are serious about this problem.  Therefore we must be prepared to take unpopular action to save people from themselves. <Col N="95" /> We should concentrate particularly on the school authorities, especially in the primary and secondary schools.  Young people must be warned of the dangers of smoking.  Most of us smoked when we went to school, mainly out of bravado.  I remember the first packet of cigarettes I got was a packet of five Woodbines for 2½d.  Like Deputy Noel Browne, although I was a heavy smoker I gave it up eight years ago on Ash Wednesday.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that little can be achieved by appealing to adults to give up smoking.  If adults were warned sufficiently of the grave dangers attached to cigarette smoking they would give up the practice and this, by example, would benefit the young people.  It is true to say that a person who smokes an average of 10 to 15 cigarettes a day will do little damage to his health.  Medical people have told us that the danger is in excessive smoking, smoking more than 25 cigarettes a day.  I know people who can smoke 40 cigarettes a day with ease.</P>
      <P>The Minister should make a better effort to get across to teachers how useful they can be in helping young people to stop smoking.  Teachers could speak to their pupils on the dangers of smoking, telling them plainly that cigarettes contain nicotine and tar.  If the truth were brought home plainly to the children they would be less likely to begin to smoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read in the newspapers that during his Ard Fheis speech the Minister referred to the starting of a health centre.  As far as I can recall he used the phrase &ldquo;when circumstances permit&rdquo;. I hope sincerely that circumstances will permit the founding of such a centre not next year or the year after but this year.  Apart from the need to bring home to people the dangers of cigarette smoking, such a centre could be used for education in regard to general health.  There is the problem of alcoholism and it has been said that it has become an Irish problem mainly because of the habit of people here standing rounds.  All of us know that is why many of us are inclined <Col N="96" /> to take a little too much.  I know that when I smoked cigarettes and when I was in company somebody was always producing cigarettes and even when I did not want to do so I practically chain-smoked.  I think if the practice of offering cigarettes in company was discontinued people would smoke fewer cigarettes.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Government have a grave responsibility in this matter of informing the public.  They should let the public know clearly and unambiguously the findings of distinguished medical men here and abroad.  They must make a more serious effort to stop cigarette advertising on radio, and the newspapers and in cinemas.  I agree with Deputy Esmonde that there should be control of smoking in places like cinemas and publichouses.  In most publichouses you could cut the air it is so heavy from smoke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I will be brief.  We are all aware of the serious problem of cigarette smoking. It is unfair to say the Government are not concerned about it.  It all depends on the aproach one takes.  I appreciate Deputy Noel Browne's suggestion and the figures he gave.  As a person who smoked in the past and who gave up cigarettes two years ago and as a person who deals in cigarettes, I appreciate both sides and have no hesitation in putting forward my opinion on cigarette smoking, particularly by the young.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various suggestions have been made on how to deal with the situation.  I am not sure that legislation is the best way.  My view is that example is the important thing, the example especially of the parents where young children are concerned.  It is unlikely that children who see their parents smoking will not do the same.  We should advise parents and adults generally that cigarettes are bad for their own health and also that they are showing bad example and that their children will probably take up smoking later.  We should ask parents to make the sacrifice for the sake of their children.  The schools and the teachers, with the Department of Education and the Department <Col N="97" /> of Health, can play an important role.  If children of ten years and upwards are given proper instruction and shown the dangers of smoking and if we can do this by means of slides or films in the schools we would be contributing to an enormous degree to the discouragement of children from smoking.  If we have the co-operation of the parents on the one hand and the teachers on the other we have a great chance of discouraging future generations from smoking.  It must be tackled from both sides.  The schools cannot do this job on their own if, when the children come home, they see their parents smoking.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult for a seasoned smoker to give up cigarettes.  I have succeeded to a big degree although I still smoke an odd cheroot.  When you have been smoking for 15 to 20 years it is a big challenge but it should not be too difficult for parents because they know that by giving up cigarettes they are doing something for their children. We must get this across to parents. Television must be used to bring this into the homes.</P>
    <P>We know that advertising on Telefis Éireann has been discontinued but there are programmes, especially the Late Late Show, on which members of the panel smoke.  I have also seen people in documentary films smoking. People should be asked to refrain from smoking while they are on these panels.  There is a programme on Sunday evenings in which one of the participants smokes continuously.  I am not asking that man to give up cigarettes, maybe he is not able to, but perhaps he should refrain from smoking while taking part in the programme.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Department of Health could circulate some advertisements to various places in which smoking takes place, such as lounges, hotels, restaurants. I believe the owners would display these advertisements because they are concerned about the people's health.  It is unfair of Deputy O'Donovan to say that the State and the Government are not concerned, that they are more concerned about the revenue.  Even though a considerable amount of revenue accrues from cigarette smoking, the State, I am convinced, <Col N="98" /> would put the health of the individual first.  Revenue can be collected by other means.  If people stopped smoking there are other ways of spending their money.  We should play our part in discouraging smoking even though there will be a loss in revenue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> It will be a loss to shopkeepers but this has to be faced.  I do not agree with Deputy O'Donovan.  The State is quite aware of the loss of revenue that would accrue, but that can be overcome. The health of the nation comes first.</P>
      <P>Deputy R. Barry advised owners of restaurants, hotels and places like that to prohibit smoking.  I do not think this would be possible, but they should have a system such as CIE have on trains.  Perhaps hotels and cinemas could have sections set aside for non-smokers. This could apply in lounge bars, too.  You could have smokeless zones.  Since I gave up cigarettes I would not go into a railway carriage where smoking is allowed.</P>
      <P>The lack of proper recreational facilities is a big drawback and it is the reason why many children start to smoke.  If there were places where children could play football and where there would be other healthy activities it would be a big contribution towards preventing them from smoking.  We must make every effort to provide more recreational facilities.  It is pathetic to see children of 12 or 14 years sitting around the hall doors of flats in this city, smoking, with no proper place to play.  I have often approached such children and discouraged them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate Deputy Dr. Browne's desire but I do not think the Bill would cure this ill.  It must be done on a much broader scale.  This has been a useful debate.  It has done no harm and it could do a lot of good.  We can all strive to discourage our own children from smoking.  If a mother and father are heavy smokers it is doubtful whether any advertising or any education in the school will succeed. <Col N="99" /> The example of the parents is essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give my unqualified support to Deputy Dr. Browne and his associates on this Bill.  One must recognise the consistency of Deputy Dr. Browne in his efforts to eliminate smoking and the effects of it.  Deputy O'Donovan complained on the last occasion that it was only doctors who spoke and he may have been correct in his criticism.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I claim I am a little more experienced than most people who have spoken here because I think everybody who contributed prefaced his remarks by saying he was a non-smoker and had never smoked or had given up smoking for the past eight, nine or ten years while I am a smoker, not an extremely heavy one, but I smoke quite a number of cigarettes on occasion.  I am qualified also in that I think I have all the fringe ailments so vividly described by Deputy Dr. Browne.  He painted quite a grim picture.  I do not think he wished to, or did exaggerate the effects of smoking.  Neither did his colleague Deputy O'Connell.  I came in deliberately to listen to him and to have spelled out for me, so that I can spell it out to other people, what the effects of smoking are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept the Bill.  I do not think anybody would say he is unconcerned or that Deputy Fitzpatrick is unconcerned but this is a typical approach by the Government on any Bill or motion introduced by Private Members.  No matter what the merits of the suggestion it seems to be the constant practice through the years, perhaps, not only by this but by other Governments also, not to respect Private Members' Time but to reject more or less out of hand as we saw on many occasions and even in this case, proposals made by Opposition parties.  If Parliament is to have any meaning it must respect Private <Col N="100" /> Members' Time and accept Bills and motions as being put down in good faith.  The Minister has gone some distance to meet requests and demands by Deputy Dr. Browne over a long period.  I cannot imagine why he does not go the whole way.  I do not see why he could not accept subsection (b) of section 2 because it is here we have the big splash for cigarettes, the point where the dangers of cigarette smoking can best be stressed.  I do not think any of us or many of us look at the packet except to see the name of the cigarettes and ensure there are cigarettes in it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider seriously including in the action he has taken the proposals described in this Tobacco Control Bill.  This would show much more goodwill on the part of the Government than has been the case up to this.</P>
    <P>The dangers of cigarette smoking are not sufficiently stressed.  I suppose I am of the same age group as my colleague whom I heard talk about a packet of woodbines for 2d.  It was at that stage I began smoking.  I got five smokes out of each woodbine by stubbing it out four times.  Nobody then told us about the dangers of smoking.  The only warning I remember getting at that time was that it would stunt one's growth, that you would not grow any higher.  There was no reference to TB or cancer of the lung or the effects it would have on the stomach or the blood stream or on one's thinking.  I think we have been remiss in not listening to those who have advocated the measures now being advocated in the Bill.  The danger of lung cancer is now being stressed.  It has been stated from time to time that there is an increase in this disease.  I wonder if 20 or 30 years ago people, in fact, died from lung cancer which was diagnosed as tuberculosis.</P>
    <P>Three or four doctors participated in this debate none more qualified I suppose than Deputy Dr. Browne. While there is merit in what is proposed in the Bill and in what the Minister has done these exortations while they may minimise smoking and the number of smokers do not and are not intended to provide a cure or give any aid or assistance to those who <Col N="101" /> wish to give up smoking.  Smokers certainly could describe themselves as drug addicts.  There are others who are drink addicts and they are given special attention.  I have been talking to my colleagues about cures and it is very depressing to hear that the only cure in regard to smoking is in one's own willpower.  Has sufficient research been done to discover an aid for heavy smokers and for those who like myself suffer from the fringe ailments I hope I do not suffer from the serious ailments that Deputy Dr. Browne has described.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan is rightly concerned about the Government's interest in taxation.  Those who work in tobacco industries, particularly in the manufacture of cigarettes, are concerned about employment.  Let us not delude ourselves: if Deputy Dr. Browne's Bill were accepted and if we did everything that has been suggested in the House it would not mean that smoking would cease just like that.  There would be a gradual decrease in smoking and in the number who smoked.  But there would be no revolution in the sense that the £50 million or whatever is raised in taxation would be cut off right away and would not be available to the Exchequer in a year or even in two years.  Similarly, in regard to employment there would be no revolutionary change as a result of the proposals in the Bill.  Naturally, there would be a decrease in employment but it would be gradual in what could be described as a phasing out period.</P>
    <P>Many good suggestions have been made which could well be adopted by the Minister for Health and promoted by the Minister for Education in the schools in regard to an anti-smoking campaign.  Much more could be done in the schools.  I doubt if very much is being done at present.  I would see great merit in having warnings in the newspapers about the dangers of smoking.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Richard Barry, about standing rounds, not alone in respect of drink but also in respect of cigarettes.  this is one thing I have managed to avoid in the last ten years.  I got off to a fairly good start because I decided to smoke a <Col N="102" /> brand of cigarettes which my colleagues refuse to smoke and so I could not offer them around.  In that way I have been able to regulate my own smoking.  If we could get into the habit of not standing rounds, either in relation to alcohol or in relation to cigarettes, our health would probably improve.  There is a sort of fear on the part of people here, as distinct from people in other countries that one will be considered mean if one does not stand a round.  One may smoke one cigarette in half an hour but, if one is in the company of others, then inevitably after 20 minutes or so someone else passes round cigarettes.  If that kind of thing could be avoided it would cut down the consumption of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and, even at this late stage, I would ask the Minister to accept the Bill.  It would be a gesture showing that the Government recognise that this is not a purely political matter.  It would also be a gesture recognising the right of private Members of this House putting forward legislation.  Worthwhile suggestions should not be rejected out of hand simply because they emanate from the Opposition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Deputies who contributed to the debate for their detached and objective approach to this Bill.  I hoped that the Bill would be supported by members of all three parties and, if that were the pattern, then we could have in this House a really serious deliberative assembly in which people could say what they thought on essential non-controversial issues.  In the Labour Party we differ as to the merits of the Bill.  Some are for it and some are opposed to it.  I should like to thank Deputy Cooney and Deputy Harte for their support of the Bill, and I hope that this will encourage Deputies in future to cross the party boundaries on issues of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like also to thank the officials in the Department of Health who <Col N="103" /> supplied me with an enormous amount of very helpful material.  That is the way it should be.  There should be some assistance to private Deputies in a matter of this kind to enable them to put forward the most convincing case possible.</P>
    <P>I was very disappointed in the Minister's attitude to the Bill.  As Deputy O'Donovan said, it is really a very innocuous Bill.  It proposes to do very little.  The proposals are minor. Ideally they should go very much further but the Minister is not even prepared to support the proposals even as far as they go.  I am quite astonished at his attitude.  He admitted himself that the notice on the cartons is of minor importance.  In the past he described it as a futile gesture and I am driven to the reluctant conclusion that Deputy Fitzpatrick is not right in his assumption that the Minister is behind this drive to do something about this serious issue, for one reason or another, but mainly because, I believe, of financial considerations.  I am driven to that conclusion because I do not think the Minister is a stupid man.  He must know the case made since 1938.  I was wrong last week when I said 1954; that was the first time I personally became involved.  In fact, the first work was done on this subject in 1938 and that showed that there is a direct relationship between cigarette smoking and early and preventible death.  The work started in 1938 has continued and has been supported and the findings ratified by subsequent research all over the world.</P>
    <P>We have advanced, I suppose, in that the Minister says he proposes to reject the Bill.  His predecessor, Deputy MacEntee, was more extreme; he said, as far as I remember, that he did not wish to use Deputy Browne's terrorist mechanism.  The Bill was precisely the same as the Bill before the House and, since the Minister merely proposes to reject it, I suppose we have advanced slightly.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister is a stupid man and I can only conclude that there is a motive behind his refusal to tackle this problem seriously.  It is <Col N="104" /> a very serious problem.  We are lagging behind, as we do in so many cases, all the other civilised countries in regard to this particular problem. The United States started as far back as 1964.  Canada, New Zealand, Britain and other countries have started to do something about it.  This is our first serious attempt to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donovan said, it is absurd to prevent television advertising while permitting the continued use of radio, magazines and, presumably, newspapers for this purpose.  From international literature, in particular from the literature issued by the College of Physicians in England, by the general support for the anti-smoking campaign in America and by the work of the World Health Organisation, I think I have shown conclusively that cigarette smoking is a lethal habit.  It kills in one of three ways, each of which is dreadful and painful.  It can result in lung cancer, coronary heart disease, bronchitis and emphysema.  I cannot understand the attitude of mind of a Minister for Health who, as the present Minister has done, dismisses this continuing increase in the incidence of these diseases in Ireland. Between the years 1950 and 1968 there was an increase in the incidence of lung cancer from 300 to 970, an increase from 400 to 1,450 in respect of chronic bronchitis and an increase from 1,700 to 5,900 in the incidence of coronary heart disease.  In spite of the increases in these avoidable diseases in so far as cigarette smoking is concerned the Minister can dismiss the matter by saying, as is reported at column 1904 of the Official Report for the 16th February, 1972:</P>
    <P>We have to look at tobacco, dangerous as it may be, dangerous as the Report of the Royal College of Physicians has said it is, as a drug which is liable to reduce the life of those who indulge in it quite definitely, but at least it has no hallucinogenic effects of note and does not cause abject misery to the family of the person who is a consistent smoker.  One has to look at it in a balanced way particularly in regard to adults who smoke cigarettes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> Is it the position that the Minister is incapable of using his imagination? Has he ever seen anyone crippled from any of these diseases.  Surely he must have had experience of people suffering from serious heart disease, bronchitis, emphysema or lung cancer.  How can he say that these diseases do not cause abject misery to the families of the victims?  The last lung cancer victim whom I watched die was a Deputy of this House.  During the months before his death he realised that he would not be cured.  His wife and family were aware, too, that he would die within a short time.  They were a family who cared deeply for one another.  For all those months could the Minister say that the condition of that patient did not cause abject misery to his family?  This man who had been about 15 stone in weight was reduced to about six stones towards the end and when I went to visit him during the last few weeks of his life, I found that his wife had sat in St. Luke's Hospital during those weeks and waited out those days and hours until he died.  That is merely the case of one heavy smoker whom I knew.  This misery goes on all the time. It is the Minister's job to do something about it.  Having listened to him, one of the most shameful findings is his callous indifference to his responsibilities. He has wonderful power at his disposal but yet he does nothing about this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be ashamed of himself.  I can only assume that he is too stupid&mdash;I choose the word carefully but I have no wish to be offensive &mdash;to understand the implications of these reports which all of us agree can be believed now without any question of doubt: or else, he is too insensitive to understand the full implications, but I find that hard to believe.  Frequently the Minister anathemises drug pushers here but in this case it appears that he is on the side of the pushers in that he does not wish the tobacco manufacturers to suffer and considers that the Government cannot afford to suffer the loss of revenue that would be associated with the discontinuance of cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="106" /> There must be a serious programme of dealing with this problem.  Unfortunately, Deputy O'Donovan's point about revenue is correct if I put forward a statement by a Conservative Minister for Health in 1966.  He said:</P>
    <P>Smokers, mainly cigarette smokers, contribute £1,000 million yearly to the Exchequer.  Nobody knows better than the Government that they simply cannot afford to lose so much.</P>
    <P>It is not exclusive to the Conservative Party because in 1969 a Labour Minister for Health said much the same thing.  He said:</P>
    <P>The introduction of a meaningful differential tax on cigarettes would be bound to have a seriously detrimental effect on total revenue from tobacco.  The capacity of tobacco duty to produce revenue would be ended.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one cannot help referring to them as two likeable rogues because at least they had the audacity and moral courage to admit they were prepared to carry a number of these preventable deaths on their consciences. They were prepared to square this kind of behaviour with their bizarre moral attitudes.  When it came to attempting to help people who suffer from the disability of finding it difficult to give up cigarette smoking they put the revenue first and the lives, welfare and the health, and what the Minister called the abject misery of the families, came a bad second.  That is the motivating factor and it applies not only to those two Ministers but to our present Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes no attempt to get away from the fact that he accepts these terrible findings.  In his article in an advertisement in <i>Woman's Choice</i> of 9th March, 1971, he said :</P>
    <P>The association between smoking and lung cancer, chronic bronchitis, coronary artery diseases and peptic ulcers is indisputable.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister made some peculiar references, which I did not understand, to the greater seriousness <Col N="107" /> of what he calls the drug problem&mdash;I presume he means the drug addiction problem&mdash;and his preoccupation with whether a drug is hallucinogenic.  I do not think it matters very much whether it is or is not hallucinogenic. Even though he attempts to separate what he calls the drug habit and cigarette smoking, in his Departmental leaflet he states:</P>
    <P>Smoking, like any other drug habit, becomes very hard to give up.  It creates the craving which only 40 cigarettes a day will satisfy.</P>
    <P>This is what the Minister believes will happen to the person who smokes. Smoking is like any other drug habit but about the other drug habits, LSD, amphetamines, heroin, pot, hash and the others the Minister comes here with the most punitive type of legislation. Not only will he not allow people to use these drugs&mdash;there is no question of their exercising their independent rights as individuals to decide whether they will kill or poison themselves by using these drugs&mdash;the Minister lays down regulations that they will not be permitted to use them.  In relation to the hard drugs I share his views but not in relation to the others.</P>
    <P>The Minister is adamant that if people insist on using the hard dangerous drugs more than likely they will end up in jail, and this applies particularly to the pushers.  The Minister is quite authoritarian in these circumstances; he is very conscious of his responsibilities as Minister for Health in protecting people from the emotional needs which lead them to take drugs, whether heroin, opium or other drugs. With regard to a relatively small problem in our society the Minister is prepared to take drastic action but with an enormous national problem involving great unhappiness, sickness and death, effectively he has refused to act.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that tobacco is a drug which reduces the span of life of those who indulge in it.  That is true about nearly all the diseases that from time to time have been dealt with by successive Ministers for Health.  That is their job.  If there is a condition in society which is preventable or which, <Col N="108" /> if not prevented or avoided, reduces the span of life of people, attempts are taken to deal with it.  Why does the Minister make an exception in this instance?  What is his justification?  Is he content to see people killing themselves by permitting them to go on with this habit?  Is this not the same as suicide?  What is the morality of all of this?</P>
    <P>The Minister is fortunate that there is a difference between organic dependence on addiction to a drug like heroin or morphia, on which the body eventually becomes dependent so that it is impossible to give the drug up, and cigarette smoking.  It is possible to give up cigarettes and people can be helped in this way.  However, the Minister is refusing to give them this help and this I consider totally disgraceful on his part.</P>
    <P>At column 1904, Volume 258, of the Official Report dated 16th February, 1972, the Minister states:</P>
    <P>Perhaps I next should say a little more about the difficulties to be faced in trying to persuade adults to give up cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to the Report of the Royal College of Physicians.  It is not impossible to give up cigarettes; it is not impossible to persuade adults to do this.  There are a number of adults in this House who have said they have already done that, and I suppose the classic example of the fallacy of the Minister's statement that it is impossible to stop adults smoking is seen in relation to the medical profession. Among the medical profession there has been a dramatic drop in smoking since 1951 on.  There are more non-smokers among doctors than among the general public and only half as many cigarette smokers.  Thirty doctors smoke cigarettes as against 61 others. Between 1951 and 1965 50 per cent of British doctors who used to smoke stopped smoking when the evidence of risk of cigarette smoking was first recognised by most doctors.  These results were the same throughout Canada, New Zealand and the United States.</P>
    <P>Another interesting fact is that not only doctors were able to give up <Col N="109" /> smoking, contrary to the Minister's belief on the subject&mdash;because doctors are no different from anybody else; they have just the same weaknesses and disabilities, likes and dislikes, as any other member of society&mdash;but also the non-medical staff at Edinburgh University, professional, clerical, skilled working class, who simply were more aware of the risks.  That is a very important point.  Deputy O'Donovan made the case, and to some extent differed with Deputy Barry, as to why some people can stop smoking and other people cannot stop smoking.  The general finding is that it is a matter of the level of education of individuals. Doctors obviously, for various reasons, must have access to literature on the subject and they also watch people dying from this disease, which is educative in a very positive way.  Other people working in this milieu in which this kind of information is available were also impressed by the statistics and the facts available and were able to control their cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister is quite wrong if he genuinely believes&mdash;and I am afraid he does not genuinely believe &mdash;that it is impossible to control this problem or to improve the situation in regard to it significantly.  I do not believe that, but let us assume that he does; then I can tell him he is wrong in his belief.  He is also wrong in relation to the graph he quoted of the pattern indicating reduction in consumption in the United States in 1961 and 1968.  He used it to show that it is very difficult to persuade adults to give up smoking. At column 1905 of the same volume he said:</P>
    <P>The general consumption of tobacco in the United States, for example, has shown spasmodic falls and then appears to have slowly risen again.  It appears to have risen recently after the ending of advertising of cigarettes showing again that the advertising of cigarettes, as claimed by some of the tobacco companies, is almost more a method of selling rival brands of cigarettes than it is of increasing the consumption of cigarettes.</P>
    <P>What the Minister said it not true, <Col N="110" /> because the facts are that since the mid-sixties one in three of men and one in four of women in the United States who were smoking in 1966 had stopped smoking in July, 1970.  Therefore, the Minister either has not read the report of the College of Physicians which he has quoted or, if he has read it, has quoted it selectively in order to mislead the House and in order to justify his failure to take any positive action in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>As I said in introducing this Bill, I was astonished at the decision of the United States Government to act on the Surgeon-General's report in 1964, because of their enormous vested interest in the tobacco company.  It is to their credit in the United States that they were the first to try to do something positive in relation to this problem. What they have done has had the effect of reducing the incidence of cigarette smoking to some extent in the United States.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows this is an enormous vested interest.  The British have just been slightly worse than the Minister and our Department of Health. We have been talking about this now for nearly 20 years.  Our Department of Health has been the worst; the British has been the next worst; other countries have been infinitely better. The British had the farcical position of watching £52 million being spent on advertising sales promotion of cigarettes while a miserable £100,000 was spent on counteracting it, pretending they were doing something.  It was a squandering of the £100,000 just as the money the Minister is spending is being squandered, with the same dishonest pretence that he is seriously concerned about this problem in spending a fiddling £27,000 against the enormous expenditure here.  I am sure it is enormous, although I have not got the present figures, because when I asked for them recently from the Minister's Department I was told the Minister did not have them.  He is not sufficiently interested to find out the size of the advertising programme against which he is working.  He has not even taken the trouble to find out how much greater it is than the £27,000, or whatever it is, that he is spending.  That <Col N="111" /> money is completely wasted.  There must be many ways in which it could be better spent.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is doing is putting this notice on the carton.  In reply to a Parliamentary question he told me that this was a futile gesture.  What he is agreeing to do here is what he has described as a futile gesture.  Faced with these tragic figures, tragic in their human implications, the Minister rejects this Bill of ours and says instead that he will carry out this device of putting a notice on the carton of which he assures us no one will take any notice.  This is his total contribution to dealing with the problem of the very powerful advertising campaigns of the tobacco pushers on whose side he has aligned himself.</P>
    <P>On 19th February, 1970, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I have considered this suggestion previously and have rejected it&mdash; essentially because I am satisfied that it would have little or no practical effect.</P>
    <P>So we are simply wasting public money.  I suspect that the reason why the cartons will carry this notice is that we have an export trade in cigarettes and our cigarettes will not be allowed into England unless they carry this notice.  It is as simple and as cynical as that.  There is no other reason for doing it.  The Minister has no sense of true responsibility as Minister for Health and he does not care enough to do anything about it.  We are suppressing our television advertisements because they are complicated and expensive to make.  They are not making them in England and they will not bother to make them here.  The notice will be carried on the cartons because our cigarettes will not be allowed into a number of countries, including England, unless they carry it.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in the world that it is difficult to persuade adults or children to give up cigarette smoking, but there are many adults who, given the information, given the education, have found it possible to give up cigarettes.  Why will the Minister not <Col N="112" /> adapt his programme to a policy based on the factors which so moved doctors, and the workers in Edinburgh University I mentioned, and various other people like Deputy Fitzpatrick, Deputy Barry and others who, because of their level of education and their level of intelligence and their level of self-control&mdash;I ask the pardon of the Labour Party&mdash;were able to give up this habit which is very difficult to give up.  I had that problem myself.  I completely concede that it is a very difficult habit to give up.  My complaint is that we are not giving the help they deserve to the people who are anxious to give up the habit of cigarette smoking.</P>
    <P>The Minister replied to one point raised by Deputy Cooney.  The Minister does not seem to know what is on television.  He does not seem to know his own service very well.  Deputy Cooney suggested that pop idols and pop singers should be used in an anticigarette smoking campaign on television. The Minister came back with a suggestion about Mr. Mitchell, who is an announcer.  The Minister's Department are already using people like Dickie Rock in their advertising programme.  Because of the Minister's obvious lack of enthusiasm, and lack of conviction that this would be anything other than a futile gesture&mdash;that is, putting the notice on the cartons&mdash; Deputy Cooney made a number of suggestions with regard to the size, the layout and the content of the notice, whether we should try to frighten people or should try to reason with them, and the various methods used by advertisers when they are faced with trying to sell anything.  Should we change the colour of the print and the size of the print?  These are all very important factors.  The Minister made no attempt to deal with that point which was put forward by Deputy Cooney.</P>
    <P>I have seen most of the literature supplied by the Department and it has been directed predominantly at children. I share with other Deputies the conviction that it is not sufficient to talk to children only.  Adults must also be helped.  We have continuous information topped by the most recent findings of the Irish Cancer Society that <Col N="113" /> among the sector of the community upon which the Minister and his Department have concentrated over the past ten years, to the extent they have concentrated at all, the children, the rate of smoking is increasing in spite of the propaganda by the Minister's Department over the past ten to 15 years.  These findings were made by public-spirited medical officers of health in Westmeath and Cork mainly and they have shown that smoking starts at the age of seven years and increases rapidly thereafter.  Not only does it start at the age of seven years but the rate of smoking among boys and girls is very much higher now than when the Minister started his campaign to stop children smoking. Surely the Minister should learn something from these facts and figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn now to the manner in which moneys are made available in the case of secondary education, in particular grants for reequipping the schools which have become <Col N="114" /> derelict or virtually unworkable. One of the defects of long-term capital planning in this State that has been raised is that money tends to be technically voted but not, in fact, applied instantly.  This was raised in the case of the £50 million which the Government are supposed to be applying to the re-flating of the economy.  In this specific connection I want to raise the case of a school in my own constituency, the Holy Faith Convent secondary school, Finglas.  This school is in fact a converted barracks with 466 pupils on the roll, 27 teachers&mdash; 24 lay and three religious&mdash;on the staff, including a full-time physical education teacher and a full-time arts teacher.  Three classes are permanently housed in a building which is already officially condemned.  There is no assembly hall, no gymnasium, no art room and no proper library accommodation in this school.  To double for a library some books are kept in a small room which also acts as a staff room of sorts.  There is no office whatsoever for the headmistress.</P>
      <P>I raised this case with the Minister for Education.  The answer I received was that the money is technically available but cannot be paid at this point. The reply stated:</P>
      <P>Since 1968 building grants have been paid for additional accommodation consisting of 12 classrooms including six special subject rooms plus ancillary accommodation.  This accommodation was provided in two stages of building.  The cost of these works was £62,000 approximately. Proposals for a further stage of building are at present under consideration. The Minister regrets, however, that it is not possible at the present time to say when an allocation of capital is likely to be available for the next part of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said before, I am not competent to follow people like Deputy FitzGerald into the intricacies of economics but I would like to know how much of the technically impressive figures which are put before us for grants for this sort of capital building in schools are hypothetical and how much of them are actual.  It is one <Col N="115" /> thing to vote the principle of the money and another to provide it.  This is now happening because the money is not being provided.</P>
    <P>I now want to deal with the issue of free books.  It is a well-known practice in this city, and the Minister knows this as well as I do, that the manner in which the capital subvention for free books is distributed is highly discriminatory. There are schools in which free books are distributed on the basis of the production of the blue card.  In reply to a question of mine on the 4th November, 1971, the Minister said that in 1968-69 the money made available for free books was £283,000. In 1969-70 the amount was slightly less at £282,581.  In 1970-71 it was £299,588, virtually a static figure, despite the fact that the cost of books has increased and the value of money decreased in this period.  Can anyone imagine a situation more humiliating to an individual child than that he can only be given free books on the teacher asking him to produce a medical card? This practice goes on in our schools.</P>
    <P>I have already said in the context of primary schools that while I welcome the Minister's allocation of additional funds towards the provision of visual aids I do not regard the amount of money as satisfactory.  I would like to see it substantially increased.  In the context of secondary schools the Minister should grasp a further nettle.  I am not making a party political point when I say that in the context of recent discussions on other topics the grasping of nettles by the Government is not a practice which they find very congenial.  Among the many barriers of traditional practices in education that of opposition to co-education should be faced rapidly because it is a further form of division within our teaching system which I would like to see broken down.  I do not think there is any need for me to develop that.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald made much of the possibility of an advanced leaving certificate.  I am pretty familiar with his thinking on this subject as he and I have argued about this for many years both in this House and in other places. <Col N="116" /> His thinking is understandable to the extent that it is wrong that the advanced pupils should be held back in the 17 to 18 age group.  This problem is met in England to some extent by what they call the State scholarship examination.  I agree with Deputy FitzGerald in his argument about this but he made a second point with which I cannot agree, that the leaving certificate was improperly applied as being, on the one hand, a terminal examination preparing people for job employment opportunities and, on the other hand, an examination designed to qualify people for university entrance. This is an argument which in my view has dangerous social implications.  The Minister knows as well as I do that students in both secondary and university education, little subsidised as they are, are nevertheless subsidised as they community.  I would be loth to see the day where young people in secondary schools were specially favoured by the introduction of an additional examination precisely designed to select people for university entrance.</P>
    <P>Here I must dissent qualitatively from what Deputy Dr. FitzGerald has said.  In my view, any pupil who enters the stream of secondary education does so with the possibility that at the end of it he will proceed no further, if that is the right phrase, than with the leaving certificate into the competitive world of economic life and at the same time is faced by the other possibility of entrance into tertiary education.  Any attempt to restructure the inter-leaving certificate system in such a way as to add an additional year or an additional examination which would refine still further the number of people, the areas of people, who get into our universities would be an attempt which I personally would oppose very deeply on social grounds.  I think it would be a most unfortunate thing because the application of selection procedures at the 12-13 age group already by our secondary schools, the selectivity of our universities, would all tend to suggest that the intrusion of yet a further examination would only have the effect of making the structure of university education still more a class thing than it is at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> In this context, I would ask the Minister to be more specific to us in his reply to this debate about the future of the intermediate examination.  I am not one of those who are hostile to examinations in their own right. Examinations have in common with democracy and Christianity that they are extremely poor systems but that better ones have not been invented as yet and the process of periodical assessment seems to me in schools to carry built-in dangers and shortcomings which I would fear very deeply and I would hope that the Minister would never accept the argument of what are called educationalists&mdash;and I have dilated on that subject before&mdash; against examinations as such.  I hope he would never yield to these arguments to the extent that he would eliminate those elements of our educational structure which are at least as egalitarian as they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>At the moment, broadly speaking, the people who attend secondary schools are already selected.  They are selected by assessment; they are selected by interview and they are selected by wealth.  Let us face this. The leaving certificate at least presents them with a competitive opportunity, with all its faults, and with the introduction of the new curricula I do not think its faults are as great as they used to be by far.  At least, it presents them with an opportunity to compete on equal class terms for entrance to university and the kind of academic thinking that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald expresses in favour of a still further selective examination is a kind of thinking with which I am very familiar in academic circles.  It usually goes with the argument, that as Kingsley Amis puts it, more means worse.  It usually goes with the argument that the university is something special, something private and something in which, as I have just said, quality is a matter of smallness rather than size.  Here, as in quite a number of other things, I would be on the Minister's side rather than on Deputy FitzGerald's side.</P>
    <P>By all means, improve the curricula of the leaving certificate continually, as the Minister's Department has been doing ever since the time of the late <Col N="118" /> Donogh O'Malley.  By all means improve the use of visual aids, the element of oral instruction and examination. Improve imaginatively the structure of curricula.  Cease to issue to examiners in the leaving certificate those appalling structured sets of briefs that used to be issued: give seven marks for knowing that X king came to Ireland on Y date.  By all means cease doing this, but to differentiate between a terminal examination in our secondary schools and entrance examinations to the universities would be to impose an unnatural barrier between those who are predeterminedly university entrants at the age of 14, in fact, and those who are not.</P>
    <P>Let us face it, in our society it is still wealth that determines this and, broadly speaking, most parents know when their children are 14 whether they will go to university at 18 or not.  They do not have to wait for the results of the leaving certificate examination to tell them that.  They will make every effort to make sure&mdash;and this is a failing of all of us, a human failing&mdash; that their children get access to universities.  Very few of us have so much detachment from the realities of education that if either the examiner or a critical assessor brings home to us the news that our child is deficient in academic expertise, we will correspondingly accept that he should not go to university.  Most of us make every effort to ensure that he does so.  I would fear that Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's special advanced examination designed to university entrance would only serve to foster the already divisive elements in Irish education and I find myself in the rare and, for me, quite unpleasant, situation of disagreeing with my colleague Deputy FitzGerald here.</P>
    <P>Vocational education is to me the major growth area of contemporary education in Ireland.  I shall have a lot more to say about that in dealing with the issue of community schools.  Suffice it for the moment to say that, again looking down the pattern of expenditure which the Minister outlined to me in reply to my question of 4th November, 1971, the pattern is, if anything, static: £2.5 million in 1968-69; <Col N="119" /> £3.3 million in 1969-70; £2.9 million in 1970-71 and an estimated £2.7 million in 1971-72.  This of course is capital, I admit, rather than current expenditure but the rise in current expenditure, while dramatic in the period between 1967-68 and 1970-71 is only marginal in the period between 1970-71 and 1971-72, inasmuch as it rose from £9.4 million to £11.2 million.  This is an unfortunate thing.</P>
    <P>I feel this to be potentially the most exciting area of our whole teaching structure because there is something unique about vocational teaching.  It is at one and the same time the most important sector in terms of the future educational needs of our community and the only sector of our educational system which is wholly controlled undenominationally and democratically.</P>
    <P>At first, the vocational schools were limited to the provision of postprimary education to the age of 16. They were also limited in practice to technical or non-academic subjects.  It is fair to say they were the poor relations of the traditional secondary schools which prepared pupils for the leaving certificate and for university entrance.  No one more than I dislikes the principle by which the child is told at the age of 12/13 that he enters one gate to one school if he wants to learn the academic disciplines, with the mark of being a middleclass gentleman, and enters by another gate if he wants to become a craftsman, a technician, to learn carpentry rather than Latin.</P>
    <P>This to me has been one of the most unpleasant barriers in Irish education. I admit that the Minister and his predecessors have attempted to break this down, successively but not always successfully, because very often, as I have said in this House before&mdash;I refer to it again because there has been a two-year intermission since I last said it&mdash;it is very much more common for the teachers in the traditional secondary areas where Latin, Greek, French, the classic academic subjects are the norm, to permit their students, if they so desire, to learn science or woodwork rather than to encourage <Col N="120" /> the flow to occur in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>To this extent the whole concept of the community schools was welcomed on these benches at a press conference, as the Minister pointed out, because we felt the community schools were likely to accelerate the degree of cross-fertilisation between secondary and vocational schools.  For many years the vocational sector was that to which the underprivileged child was sent to acquire a craft or a skill of hand or eye, as it had been called.  We all want to see this programme done.  Frankly I regard it as in some ways being much more fundamental in the basis of the community schools rather than the question of religion or denomination. I will speak at more length on this later.</P>
    <P>On the issue of development in this area, the Minister has, I am sure against his will, dragged his feet.  The figures for expenditure that I have outlined adequately demonstrate that. Heaven knows I do not often speak on constituency matters, but we certainly do not know what has happened in regard to the Ballymun complex, though all sorts of strange rumours have trickled down to me about the disused university buildings in the centre of Dublin.  However, I think the Minister should accept the necessity to come clean, to be frank with the House in respect of (a) the extent to which he is prepared to indulge in massive expenditure and (b) what will happen to Ballymun?  He should tell us these things.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of vocational education I wish to say one thing.  Speaking as a university man&mdash; too many of us here tend to lapse into the fault of identifying ourselves with our own specific areas of interest&mdash;I should like to say that if some of my colleagues who continually complain about the staff-student ratio and the overcrowding in our universities were to bring themselves to the exercise of seeing the conditions in which they work and study in Kevin Street and Bolton Street they might wax less furious about university autonomy and the beauty of university education.</P>
    <P>Inevitably this leads me to what is <Col N="121" /> being now almost overlooked and yet of vital importance, the community schools.  Ministerial policy on community schools has fluctuated so much and with such a degree of detail since the first intentions of the Department were set out in October, 1970, in a report which was never published formally but which was printed with apparent accuracy by <i>The Irish Times,</i> that I honestly confess to be confused as to what the present position is.  This is not from lack of study on my part.</P>
    <P>The initial proposals were welcomed by me on behalf of this party, perhaps with a degree of naiveté because I did not then realise, in October and November of 1970, the extent to which they would be subsequently distorted. That they were subsequently distorted is a historical fact.  Now, in turn, they seem to have taken some improvement for the better.  We have been told during this debate that the totally objectionable faith and morals element has been dropped.  This is a massive advance and it is rare and unusual for us, for Deputy FitzGerald, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien or me, to find out a piece of information on the floor of the House.  Usually one gets it from reading reports of a Fianna Fáil ArdFheis. We are glad this has been so improved.  It appears now that the trustees will be appointed by the Minister and not, as initially implied, by another authority.  This gives considerable satisfaction and I think Deputy FitzGerald can take considerable satisfaction from the part he played in this, causing the Minister to change his mind.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of credit can accrue to people on those benches, to Deputies Cruise O'Brien, Desmond and me.  I do not seek to curry favour with a particular newspaper but I mention the Educational Review, consistently good, of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  All these things have improved the structure of the community schools but have not, in my opinion, totally solved the question.  The community schools issue to me is twofold.  It is denominational, on the one hand, and it raises the whole issue of what is meant by community control.  Necessarily, most concentration has been on the denominational <Col N="122" /> point; the point that in those areas where members of the minority either predominate or exist in such numbers of them to feel entitled to a voice in the control of their secondary education, they should not be deprived by the State of this right and placed under the control of the Catholic majority.  Of course, I concur with the view that they should not be so deprived.  I regret deeply the bad image the scheme in its amended form &mdash;not its initial form but its middle form&mdash;gave to our country in the eyes most particularly of our separated alleged fellow-countrymen in the North.  At the same time I do not think that is the major issue in itself.  It may seem an odd thing to say, but the reason I say this is that I am a Catholic and if there were not a Protestant alive on this island I would disapprove of the original structure devised by the Minister for Education for those schools. A community school to me is a school controlled by a community and to speak of a Protestant community, in an allegedly pluralistic society, is as revolting to me as to speak of a Catholic community.  I do not understand what these distinctions mean.  To me a community school is controlled by the parents, the teachers, the local municipal organisations, the taxpayers, the Government, the Minister, but it is not controlled by &ldquo;invited in&rdquo; bodies of whatever denomination. Deputy FitzGerald was slightly confused here in his thinking and perhaps a little unfair even to the Minister.  At one point he said&mdash;I quote from memory but I was taking careful notes of his speech&mdash;&ldquo;The Department pay the money and call the tune.&rdquo;  I do not think the Department pay the money and call the tune.  They certainly pay the money, which is a polite way of saying that you and I pay the money, but they do not call the tune.  I do not regard as a satisfactory solution a situation in which denominational schools, be they Protestant or Catholic, are set up in this State and subsidised by the entirety.</P>
    <P>What is the present state of play in the community schools issue?  It is almost impossible to say on the information <Col N="123" /> we have at hand.  Deputy FitzGerald spoke of the participation of those involved and certainly no one has done more than Deputy FitzGerald to bring about a situation in which those involved would participate but there is no secondary school existing in some of the key areas like Tallaght and Blanchardstown which, to do the Minister justice, he has admitted are special cases, but they will only be special cases for four or five years and what happens then?  The parents will be, I understand, selected in the first instance.  What follows I know not.  In the case of Mayfield in Cork there is no school of either kind.  I do not know for certain what happens there.  Unlike Deputy FitzGerald I do not think the simple fact of the representation of parents in an area in a community school makes it necessarily meaningfully a community school.  I have before me a pattern of the statistical breakdown of pupils and teachers in different schools and different areas.  In Blanchardstown&mdash;secondary pupils, nil; vocational pupils, 158.  This was on 26th May, 1971.  In Tallaght&mdash;secondary pupils, nil; vocational pupils, 255; Mayfield, nil.  There are other cases like Athy, a pretty thorny case, as we will all find out soon, secondary pupils, 444&mdash;a fairly viable unit in terms of the Minister's apparent educational thinking; vocational pupils, 258. In Ardee, another complex area, secondary, 299; vocational, 137.</P>
    <P>Those are figures as of May, 1971, but to base a school structure upon the distribution of pupils and teachers at May, 1971, is to ignore the fact that we inherit an educational system which is itself intrinisically biassed in favour of the children of the more privileged classes.  The late Seán Ó hÉigeartaigh, whenever the subject of the revival of the Irish language was discussed, used to make a speech with which I did not agree and did not understand, Heaven knows.  He would say: &ldquo;You have not got the right to destroy the Irish language in this country even if you get the votes of the people to destroy it because what about my father?  He is not here to speak.  My grandfather is not here to speak.  You have not got the right to do it.&rdquo;  Inverting the argument <Col N="124" /> I would say you have not got a right to structure an educational system which ignores the children of the people who are not yet going to any kind of school at all and their children.  This is where Deputy FitzGerald and myself have a slight difference of emphasis.  Reading of the Fine Gael press conference I got the impression that Deputy FitzGerald would be satisfied with a situation which was simply flexible, in other words, that the structure of management of the schools would be related to the structure of educational pattern in the particular area.  To do Deputy FitzGerald justice this would be an immense improvement on the proposals of the Minister as they were originally enunciated and would, at least, have a compromise merit of saving Blanchardstown and Tallaght from the original final solution proposed for them by the Minister.  But I do not think this is an adequate answer in itself.</P>
    <P>Overall, there must be, as I have said repeatedly in this debate, a philosophy of education and I do not think the Department have the right to throw around a phrase like &ldquo;community school&rdquo; without going to the Oxford Dictionary and looking up the word &ldquo;community&rdquo; and seeing what it means.  I say this as a Catholic.  A community is not a religious, sectarian thing; it is a community of people of disparate religious interests, disparate social interests, who are entitled to have these reflected in the manner in which their origins, ethnic, educational and everything else, make them wish to do so.  This is where I would seek again for this White Paper from the Minister. I know I am going to be called some kind of Communist here but I see the need for a White Paper from the Minister saying what is my conception of a community.  I stand on very good ground here because I have taken care to do my homework with my Catholic thinkers, my John Courtney Murrays, my Enda McDonaghs, and their view of a community is not one which is a community coterminus with a particular sect and I sometimes suspect that the Minister's, against his will, is.  Against his will I say because I want to say, <Col N="125" /> in defence of the Minister, that I do not blame him or the civil servants for the morass into which the community schools thing has fallen.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald read out a most impressive list of about ten organisations all of which condemned the community schools proposal but, with a disingenuousness which I can only suppose to be accidental knowing Deputy FitzGerald as well as I do, he failed to mention that just about all ten of these organisations were opposing these proposals for ten different reasons.  In these circumstances I have a certain sympathy with the dilemma in which the Minister has found himself.  This was summed up in a <i>cri de coeur</i> made by a member of the Development Branch of the Department of Education in Ardee on 15th June, 1971.  His name was quoted in the newspaper but I shall not quote it because it is not fair to do so and there is no need for me to quote it.  He said the Department were in the dilemma that they were being told on one hand that they had given too much and on the other that they had given too little.  Where the brothers and nuns nominated four of the six members he did not think anyone could reasonably argue that they were not being given a very big say in what was going to happen.  This is where there is a flaw in Deputy FitzGerald's thinking.</P>
    <P>I am very anxious not to make political points here.  It is really not adequate proof of the inadequacy of the community schools project that &ldquo;it has been attacked on all sides&rdquo;, if one has to add in all logic an appendage to this, &ldquo;for mutually contradictory reasons&rdquo;.  I think the Minister in his secret heart would acknowledge that we have actually given him a considerable amount of help because I think there are quarters where the Minister is running through considerable difficulty where he has been able to say in effect: &ldquo;Look at these wild men who think that I am giving you too much breathing down the back of my neck.&rdquo; In this way we may have unintentionally aided him in extricating himself from a position into which he had either walked or been walked.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald spoke of forcing <Col N="126" /> things through without consultation.  I have not the same instinctive belief in the value of consultation; I do not think that parents, teachers, priests, nuns, bishops, clergymen, Protestant or Catholic, are necessarily the right people to advise you on matters like this.  The experience of the merger would tend to suggest that if the Minister proceeds by consultation he will land himself in a situation where he is festooned with hostility and sometimes the most useful thing educationally he can do is put his foot on the floorboards and accelerate ahead without consulting anybody.  I would not blame the Minister for not consulting people too much but I blame him for not realising in time&mdash;God knows time moves so fast in the present unpleasant days that it is difficult to say when he could have realised in time: something happened today as we all know which may have changed the time scale or the value of our political offerings&mdash; that the time to make the non-sectarian, undenominational offerings is before they are begged for, not afterwards. The demonstration of generosity should come in advance of the crisis point, not afterwards.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister accused us of playing sectarian politics with community schools proposals.  He is doing himself less than intellectual justice as his change of mind has shown.  I shall not attempt to impose on the liberality of the Chair by broadening the debate into a discussion on constitutional changes but I shall say something I think is relevant. It is easily said in this House that the Northern Protestant does not care about contraception and that those of us who talk about contraception here as a solution to Partition are talking nonsense.  It is easy to say that Northern Protestants do not in the main care about divorce, but the point is that to the Northern Protestant every one of these things adds up to a complex of a unitary State in which the Constitution is tinged with sectarianism; the laws on contraception and censorship are tinged with sectarianism, the schools and the hospitals in the main are under sectarian control.  It is the whole complex which to him is repulsive, not just one single thing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> Here I think the Minister has played into the hands of those who fear the unity of this State with justice.  Speaking solely for myself &mdash; Deputy Tunney who agrees with me about many things on education will not agree with this &mdash;I think the emphasis we place on the Irish language in the Constitution, in teaching and in qualifications for State employment is yet another disincentive with Northern Protestants against entering this State.  That is a personal opinion, something which I am not instructed by my party to say. If the kind of rationalisation of university education which I think, in common with the Minister, I should like to see come about takes place, I hope one of the prices we do not pay for it is to make Irish a compulsory subject for university entrance.  I do not think you would inculcate a love for the language in that way or any desire on the part of our separated countrymen to join us.</P>
    <P>If I were to go on at great length I could now explore the whole issue of what constitutes a denominational school.  At election time it is said that we in the Labour Party do not want denominational schools, that we do not want religious presence in the schools, that we want to drive it out.  This is absolute nonsense.  Any parent has the right to bring up his child with whatever faith or lack of faith he wishes.  I accept the concept of the Catholic school in the sense that I accept that a Catholic parent like myself is entitled, as I do, to have my son instructed in the Catholic religion and prepared to receive its sacraments. I do not accept that there is a Catholic way of teaching maths or science or languages.  Yet, this is the interpretation which the outgoing Archbishop of Dublin, that much abused man, Dr. McQuaid, places upon community schools, that these would be Catholic schools to which we could send our children without fear of loss of faith to them.</P>
    <P>It may seem an odd interpolation at this point but perhaps it is not inappropriate to wish Most Reverend Dr. McQuaid every health and happiness in his retirement.  I disagree with Dr. McQuaid in just about everything, <Col N="128" /> but his service as a pastoral archbishop is beyond question, in school-building, and church building and so on. I am not indulging in personal vituperation, as some would where he is concerned. But the fact remains that there is a different concept in the mind of a bishop like that and in my mind as to what constitutes denominational teaching. If what we shall have here are Catholic community schools and Protestant community schools the Protestants will inevitably retreat into their own community schools.  I can think of nothing funnier than a Catholic community school and a Protestant community school in a country based upon Tone's theoretical desire to end our differences and enunciate a common name of Irishmen. I resist and resent the innuendo&mdash;it was rather more than that&mdash;of the Minister in his speech that we on these benches have been playing politics with this issue.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the Minister should stand up to those vested interests that would cause him to make of these community schools extensions of the traditional secondary school structure.  I admit these vested interests are many.  I hope I am making this clear by repeating it deliberately: unlike Deputy FitzGerald I am realist enough to know that if the Minister were to consult with the parents, the brothers and the mothers it would not necessarily make it any easier for him: it could make it more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Minister should not underestimate the rapidity with which the thinking of the ordinary Irish people in the last five or ten years has moved upon such issues as education.  Certainly he faces some difficulties which are soluble because time will alleviate them; some which are insoluble, for example, the operation of the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree which will always cause, as long as it survives, the majority of Protestant parents, if they have the means to do so, to wish their children to be educated in a separate way.  There are many things I could ask the Minister to do but I can scarcely ask him to have that decree abolished; it scarcely lies in his power. But there are some things he could do. <Col N="129" /> and he was, I think, given a good instance of this at his party's own Ard Fheis the other day when, I understand &mdash;I was not there, for obvious reasons &mdash;a resolution, with the full backing and support of the platform, calling for the deferment of any consideration of constitutional changes until the reunification of our country was imminent, was in fact reject by the floor.  This might bring home to the Minister now that he would be taking neither a party political risk nor a career danger if he were to be slightly more courageous and set his course towards the concept of education which has already been endorsed not alone by liberalists, economists and Trinity &ldquo;queers&rdquo; but also by educationalists in the Catholic Church, by Jesuits and, by implication, God help us, by the ordinary members at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.</P>
    <P>I would ask him to look again at the community school structure and ask himself the question, if he had not gone so far wrong that now was the time to come out and admit his mistakes and give us a look at what the animal is actually like because at the moment none of us knows what it is like.  The community school at the moment is a little like the late Clement Attlee's definition of an elephant: I never saw one, but I would recognise it if it came to the door.</P>
    <P>I want to say one last thing on secondary education.  I am leaving the community school issue there because I think enough for the moment has been said upon it.  In the field of secondary education I am seriously worried about the oral expertise of language teachers.  This country faces the imminent prospect of entry into the Common Market.  Whether we will or will not enter is a matter between the Government party and the Fine Gael Party and my party and not a matter to be discussed here tonight, but it is of relevance to educational subjects to remark that in Germany alone there are 2,250,000 immigrant workers from Italy, Czechoslovakia and other countries.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a conference of young parliamentarians in Cologne and I discovered there that the barman <Col N="130" /> in the hotel was an Italian, so I ventured to talk to him in Italian; My Italian is very bad so he proceeded to answer me in English.  This meant he spoke Italian, German and English. When it came to the conference next day, and it came to my turn to speak, I was asked to talk about the issue of mobility of labour in the Common Market.  I said: &ldquo;As far as I am concerned, the barman in this hotel is an Italian and, if mobility of labour in the Common Market means that we provide your barmen, thanks very much; I do not want to know.&rdquo;  In fact the situation is very much worse than that because this Italian had not alone a second but a third language. The average pupil leaving primary school, even secondary school here, has not got even a second spoken language which means that not even the bar jobs will be reserved for us in the Common Market but, within the enclaves in which the workers live in places like Frankfurt and Düsseldorf, our people will be equipped for nothing more than the coolie jobs, the labourer jobs, the jobs in which the emphasis is totally upon the physical and not at all upon the intellectual.  I am so seriously concerned about this that I would say in all sincerity to the Minister that, if his party must persist in the misguided course of entering the Common Market, and if they do win the referendum, which I hope they do not, I hope he will recognise the obligation to re-tool our teaching of continental languages so that if our people must leave the country they will at least not leave it as the coolie labourers of Düsseldorf rather than, as they are at the moment, the coolie labourers of the Finchley Road and Kilburn.</P>
    <P>On universities, there are to me two great omissions in the Minister's references to universities.  One is on financing. In reply to my question on 14th November the Minister admitted to an increase of some £800,000 in current university financing.  I think everybody knows this is not adequate and the growth in the student population of the universities has been accompanied by worse and worse conditions and worse and worse staff-student ratios to the detriment of the education involved. It is at least a pleasure to be able to <Col N="131" /> stand up at last in an Irish Parliament and talk about university education as something relevant; ten years ago one would have been talking about an expensive luxury confined to the sons of the better-off, like myself, but this is no longer the case.  The Minister must, I think, recognise that in the last three or four years university spending has been held at what to all intents and purposes is a constant level even as the number of students have grown. I do not think this is adequate.  To me the great gap in the Minister's remark on universities was the complete absence of any reference to the university merger and the resolution of the situation in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Some time ago, in reply to questions by Deputy Dr. O'Connell and myself, he spoke about allowing us to see the report of the Higher Education Authority in three months.  I am amazed that this has not been brought forward before now.  I would have thought this Estimate, the first for two years, would have been the ideal opportunity for the Minister to give us some information of this thinking on this vital point.  I speak on this, and I am insistent in saying this, not as a university don but as a Labour elected representative of a largely working-class area.  I want to know what is happening to the taxpayer's money.  I do not believe that the duplication of expensive faculties as between the two universities can continue indefinitely. I could go on about this all night, as the Minister knows; he will be thankful to hear that I have no intention of doing so.  I do not believe that the endless production of many times as many medical graduates as we need can continue <i>ad infinitum</i>.  I do not believe that the problem of getting second, third and fourth stage computers in two institutions within miles of each other can continue <i>ad infinitum.</i> I think all these things deserve to be solved.  I do not think the situation can continue in which the structures of the two universities are so patently undemocratic as they are at the moment in both universities. There have been reforms of these structures.</P>
    <P>In the case of National University, <Col N="132" /> about which I am not as competent to speak as I am about the other college and, therefore, I do not claim infallibility here, at least student representation has been admitted on the governing bodies of the associate colleges at that institute.  My own college, a historically inherited ramshackle structure based largely on the phenomenon of fellowship, has been reformed progressively to a degree where an element of democracy exists.  Having said that the fact remains that in neither case is the situation satisfactory in any sense.  This cannot be deferred very much longer.  It is four years this March since Donogh O'Malley died. Sooner or later we must be told what is happening to universities in the city of Dublin.  Personally I favour, first, the increasing number of smaller institutions. There are good arguments for a university in Kilkenny and there are arguments for giving to the institute in Limerick a higher academic status than appears is to be given to it.  I am not happy about the way in which the student population in both Dublin colleges is growing apace, in a kind of mad spiral competition.  Above all, I am eager that the Minister should adhere to the broad outlines of the plan laid down by his predecessor but one and carried on by his immediate predecessor but not, perhaps, in every detail.  I had some small part in helping with that plan.  A statement issued by the then Minister for Education, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on the 6th July, 1968, contained at least the bones of a solution to the divisions of the university institutions in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This solution was &ldquo;not another one&rdquo;.  TCD was always intended to be one of many colleges in a common university.  Isaac Butt put forward this scheme as far back as 1873 in his scheme for St. Patrick's University and the late Donogh O'Malley, with a breath of historic imagination rarely found in politicians, saw an opportunity in what became known vulgarly as &ldquo;the merger&rdquo; to end what he called the educational apartheid among our people.  There have been some improvements since then.  For instance, the ban has been lifted but the scheme has been left in utter abeyance and as one of those who welcomed <Col N="133" /> it at the time and who helped Deputy Lenihan to some extent with his progress, I would ask the Minister to stick to his guns now and to remember that there are few people more conservative in the educational sphere than are academics.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look again at the size of grants paid to students attending universities.  In 1968 the then Minister admitted that this grant scheme was only a beginning but it has not been amended in any way since except in the case of students whose fees are inflated because of their membership of a particular area but the underlying moneys paid in respect of this scheme have not altered.  The Minister should remember that when he is dealing with students today&mdash; and I have no desire to seek the favour of students either as a politician or as a teacher&mdash;they are very different people to the students of ten or 20 years ago.  Increasingly today students are the sons and daughters of Irish people who are not different in class status from us and in many cases lower in the financial scale than us.  Everything they say is not responsible or perfect and I would be the first to admit this.  They suffer from over-exuberance. As the song says of a bachelor gay: &ldquo;At 17 he falls in love quite madly&rdquo; but the only difference in the case of students is that they fall in love with socialism and ten years later this has ceased to be.  I think it was Wilde who said that anyone who was not a socialist at 20 years of age was mad and that anyone who was still a socialist at 30 was mad also. Many contemporary students could bear this out.  However, the Minister should recognise that students today form a factor in the educational process which they never did in the days of 1959 and 1960 when I was teaching the chinless wonders and the rejects of the Oxbridge-St. Andrews set-up.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other points to which I will ask the Minister to give serious consideration.  One of these is in relation to St. Patrick's College, Maynooth, which, potentially, is one of the great growth areas in tertiary education. It is a fascinating campus capable of almost infinite expansion <Col N="134" /> in terms of education and containing within its staff some of the finest intellects in the country.  Also, the college is situated in an area touching on north-west Dublin which, as we all know, is scheduled for demographic expansion.  I would like to see the status of the teachers in that college given much greater importance and I would like to see the college integrated much more formally into the scheme of national university education and remaining much less a pontifical and much more a secular institute.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy FitzGerald, I, too, would like the Minister to address himself to the issue of industrial schools and their rapid reformation.  Only this morning in <i>The Irish Times</i> there was a letter that reminded us that the deplorable condition of Marlborough House, as was made known in the Kennedy Report, has not been rectified yet, that this institution is still in use and would remain in use, according to this letter, for at least three and a half years after the recommendation that it should be closed, which was made in July 1969.  If this statement is correct, I would like the Minister to comment on it because there are few horrors more tragic than the placing of children in what are public prisons because industrial corrective institutions do not exist for them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the increasing attention given by the Government to sport and to recreational facilities of that nature. This is only a beginning but it is good that a start has been made.</P>
    <P>I was sorry that there was no mention in the Minister's speech of the functioning of the National Library. This is something that concerns me very closely as a historian concerned actively with the keeping of archives. I am sure the Minister is aware that the circumstances under which the manuscript section of the National Library operates almost defies description. One wonders how the staff of that section manage to exercise even the degree of order that they maintain in regard to these papers.  They are to be congratulated for their efforts in that regard.  Given the fact that each year we move away further from the <Col N="135" /> 1916-22 period and that those survivors who have memories of it die, as is inevitable, we should bear in mind that we could be throwing away an enormous national heritage by not providing properly for the preservation of papers deriving from that period and, of course, I include also the papers of much earlier periods. The keeping of archives in general and the condition of the National Library should be a matter of great importance to the Minister.  I know that his financial resources are limited but it is a long time since we heard first about the building of a new national library.</P>
    <P>Little remains for me to add about the conduct of the College of Art.  This matter was covered adequately by Deputy FitzGerald.  In the main, I agree with everything he said in this instance. The Minister did not exactly cover himself with glory in that episode but I am glad that a Bill has gone through to deal with the matter.  Although we in the Labour Party did not like the Bill very much and would have amended it in many aspects, if that had been possible, it is better that the Bill should serve the purpose of getting off the ground a new institution that would be untainted with the inadequacies of its predecessor.  I hope the Minister will press on and do his best to close an episode which reflects no credit on any governmental person concerned.  I hope that in the ultimate structuring of the College of Art, far from there being victimisation of those who have identified themselves with struggles in the past against the Department, the future college will be a place where initiative, imagination and independence of thought will be encouraged and not stifled.</P>
    <P>By my standards I have made a long and detailed speech.  I wish to refer to the point which Deputy FitzGerald raised at the beginning of his speech and which I choose to put last, namely, the absence of a White Paper on overall educational policy.  There is a lack of overall view in Irish education but there is evidence of a pattern developing.  It is a pattern in which increasing emphasis is placed on size, on regional development and on technology but <Col N="136" /> decreasing emphasis is placed on community, on parish, on staff-student relationships in some areas and on the older academic subjects.  This could be the correct policy, but I should like to have it spelled out.</P>
    <P>I do not completely agree with Deputy FitzGerald on one point, namely, that if I were a civil servant in the Department of Education and I were offered the alternatives of proceeding by stealth, piecemeal, on the one hand so that after 20 years an irreversible pattern of education would have developed or, on the other hand, of taking the Irish people into my confidence regarding the whole range of education I would be sorely tempted to take the first rather than the second course, rather like the development division of the Department.  The first time that you become explicit in the sphere of educational vested interests in this country you get clobbered and I cannot blame the Department for allowing a pattern to develop rather than showing to the people what that pattern is.</P>
    <P>Yet, I wonder if the Minister is not underestimating the Irish people? The time is ripe for a White Paper. The Irish people have moved further and faster than possibly the Minister thinks.  He could take the risk of spelling out that pattern.  It would give the answer to those who oppose the closure of small schools purely for selfish constituency reasons rather than for educational reasons.  It would give the answer to those who use phrases such as &ldquo;university autonomy&rdquo; and &ldquo;academic excellence&rdquo; when all they really mean is &ldquo;leave me alone in my native laziness&rdquo;.  It would be a calculated risk but it would be a very brave Minisster for Education who would take the time in the middle of all his other stresses to adopt this course.  As I told the Minister a short time ago, if he does this he will find some unexpected friends in some strange places.</P>

      <P>Is maith liom gur mhol an Teachta Thornley an tAire Oideachais agus an Roinn Oideachais agus gur ghabh sé buíochas leo i dtaobh a bhfuil déanta acu go dtí seo.  Déanfaidh mé féin an rud céanna amach anseo. <Col N="137" /> Chuaigh sé ar aghaidh agus rinne sé clamhsán agus cnáimhseáil faoi rudaí áirithe nár thaitn leis ach sa mhéid gur admhaigh sé go bhfuil an obair atá déanta déanta agus go bhfuil a thuilleadh oibre idir lámhaibh ba dheas uaidh é.</P>
      <P>Raghainn féin beagáinín níos faide. Maidir leis an Aire Oideachais níor tháinig le fada an lá duine atá chomh díograiseach leis.  Is íontach go deo a chuid suime sna leanaí agus ó thaobh cúrsaí oideachais de níl aon ní chomh tábhachtach leis na daltaí&mdash;na leanaí.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my appreciation of the complimentary remarks, however cautious, expressed by Deputy Thornley to the Minister and his Department. Compliments of this kind are too rarely expressed in this House. So far as I am concerned, there need not be any caution in complimenting the Minister and his Department for what they have done and are continuing to do for education.</P>
      <P>I would go a little further than Deputy Thornley because the present holder of this important office has convinced me that as regards industry and dedication and his sincere regard for all students very few holders of his office can excel him.  Having said that, I should like to make some comments regarding the present educational system and this is the occasion on which they should be voiced.</P>
      <P>Generally speaking, I accept that a school should reflect the functions and the developments of society and, so far as possible, have as its aims the goals set by society.  We are told that a school should be an extension of the child's home and I would take issue with the present system in so far as it fails to meet that definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened to the speeches made by the two spokesmen on the Opposition side.  With regard to what Deputy Thornley said, I would make some exception but having listened to Deputy FitzGerald it struck me he would be happier with a continuation of the present system on a more specialised and intensified basis.  I thought it significant that in his 4½ hour speech he made very little reference to the number of students who come from what might be described as <Col N="138" /> working class homes&mdash;again a term I am reluctant to use, but it is one which we all understand.  All the time he laid emphasis on the perfection of that which exists.  I want to attack what exists and alter it to perform the function I think it should perform.</P>
    <P>I am not as concerned about the expenditure of money on university education as I am about the expenditure of money on primary or postprimary education, because those two categories cater for the vast majority of our children.  The situation to date is that unless you reached university you were denied certain professional, social and economic status, all in the name of higher education.  In essence this is the use of education to replace the former capitalist and property system, under which, having got a profession you were allowed to build up your bank account, to charge exorbitant fees to the people who had assisted you towards this higher education, and to invest in property, and all the time tell the unenlightened that this was all justified by what is called higher education.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to dwell at any great length on the matter of the universities because they are well able to look after themselves and have been doing it for far too long.  It is extraordinary that there is nobody in this country today who receives the same continuing subsidy as the person who ultimately emerges from our university. It might be expected that he would show some appreciation of the consideration afforded to him by the rest of the community, appreciation of what other people have denied themselves so that he might enjoy his new status, but, instead of that, he manifests his thanks by putting a price on his service, a price which is not capable of being paid by most of the community who had assisted him to the position he enjoys.  That is an interpretation and an attitude towards education which I want to see discontinued.</P>
    <P>Neither of the two previous speakers have given me an interpretation of education which I could accept, namely, as a means of equipping man for his place in society, as preparing a student <Col N="139" /> for that part of the day when he would not be working.  With the advances in technology it is apparent that in the next decade the number of hours that a man will be required to spend at work will be gradually diminished. Therefore equipping people for their non-working hours is just as important as equipping them for a job.</P>

      <P>In the city of Dublin today what are the principle social problems that exist?  They do not arise entirely from the fact that people cannot get jobs or that people have not got professions.  The problems arise from the fact that when people have left their place of employment they find themselves with so many hours and so little to do.  There will be an increasing need to consider how people will be occupied during their non-working hours.  In the matter of education I am concerned about the situation which exists in many a home in my own constituency, and I try as far as possible to speak of what I experience myself as I move around.</P>

      <P>Deputy Thornley, I hope, will agree with me that because the sons and daughters of the people in that area go to educational establishments to study mathematics, science, Irish, English, history and geography, and because the parents cannot boast of any more than a primary or intermediate certificate or, in some cases, a leaving certificate, teachers, politicians, radio commentators and press men, we are all telling these young people how much better educated they are than their parents. <Col N="140" /> They believe us and, unfortunately, their parents believe us.  While in regard to factual knowledge they may have an advantage over their parents, in philosophical matters, in the really important things in life, there is many a lesson they can still learn from their parents.</P>
      <P>Because of this narrow interpretation of education, let it be academic or technical, the young person has been convinced by us&mdash;and from this springs a certain frustration for him&mdash;that he is now superior to his parents.  The school is supposed to be the extension of that child's home but there would seem to be no relationship between what is happening at school and what is happening in the child's home.  In the name of education we have made many a parent in Dublin and elsewhere practically irrelevant in their own homes.</P>
      <P>In this regard I suggest that more emphasis should be placed on civics, and new subjects should be introduced which would link what goes on in the home, and what might be discussed in the home as between parent and child, with what goes on in the school.  When we talk about equality&mdash;and I accept without reservation the Minister's concern for equality of opportunity&mdash;we can accept that progress has been made.  But at times and to some extent progress can be illusory.  Here I would be critical of the educational system which has been geared to the middleincome group, a system which is based on and caters for a middle-class culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of the application of that policy, sufficient regard is not had for the fact that many thousands of our children, because of the home envioronment, because of the areas in which they live, are not capable of assimilating that culture.  The teacher who comes into the class to deliver this culture to the children is completely alien to them.  Let us consider many an area in the city of Dublin and on the outskirts of Dublin.  In the name of education we are endeavouring to impose this culture, however meritorious this may be.  I know that education must tend all the while to uplift.  I sugvioronment <Col N="141" /> gest that if through education we are hoping to uplift all sections, we must start at a point all where every section is aware of what we are trying to do and where every section is capable of benefiting from it.</P>
    <P>If we look at the figures of absenteeism from schools in residential areas like Foxrock and Cabinteely as against the heart of the city of Dublin, at primary level, we find that there is a greater incidence of absenteeism in those areas in the city.  The reason for that is that the child from what would be called a residential area is familiar with and is motivated towards what is happening in his primary school.  He understands the language of the teacher.  He is not unfamiliar with the accent of the teacher.  He is in sympathy with what the teacher is saying.  He understands it.  The child from another area finds himself in an environment which he has been told is an extension of his home but which bears as little relationship to his home as a snowball to a gooseberry.</P>
    <P>This is where I want money spent, not on the long-haired odd-bods whose only contribution to me from their union, and whose only invitation to me to comment on what should be happening at university, is a hand-out which I got from them today on contraception. Far too much money is being spent on these people.  They are subsidised, and they go out and chant about civil rights and justice for all. Why do they not look at the situation and give us the benefit of their education and their judgment and say to us: &ldquo;Our conscience is not happy at the amount of money which is being spent at our level of education when so much requires to be done at other lower levels.&rdquo;  I do not want to be accused of being anti-intellectual or wanting to reduce things to the lowest common denominator.  My point is very valid.  In carrying out a policy which, as I see it, has been created to cater for the middle class we should appreciate that certain adaptations must be undertaken to make it suitable for people who do not enjoy that way of life.</P>
    <P>Here I will stop to make a comment on one or two of the points made by Deputy FitzGerald.  Apart from the <Col N="142" /> point which I made earlier I thought it was significant that, while claiming to express his concern for the whole society, and claiming to be, as I am sure he is, analysing the educational system in the name of the whole society, his concern really was for the <i>status quo</i> position.  The <i>status quo</i> position as I see it is a position where 85 per cent of the students who reach the university come from minority groups within the country, and 5 or 6 per cent come from the masses.  The inversion of the ratio there does not appeal to me.</P>
    <P>I am now digressing to comment on what Deputy FitzGerald said on the question of university autonomy.  In essence what Deputy FitzGerald is pleading is that in a democracy we should have regard to IQ, and the higher up the ladder you go, and the more money you spend, the less hold there should be on you by the rest of the community.  That, I venture to say, is the essence of the policy he is advocating.  I cannot accept that.  It would be too bad to think that unless you reach a certain standard of professional or academic qualifications you do not qualify for autonomy but if you do that nobody dare say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to you.</P>
    <P>I will concede autonomy to anyone who wants it providing he is not looking to me and the people I represent for the finances which are used towards the working of the establishment in which he wants autonomy.</P>
    <P>He was critical of the fact that we want a board of management in the community schools.  He said that in Ballinamore there are three separate schools, presumably a Christian Brothers' school, a convent school and a vocational school, and without any board of management they are carrying out the spirit of the community schools generally.  If Deputy FitzGerald believes that he is a more innocent man than I thought.  How could you have three separate units of anything co-operating, co-ordinating and working effectively without one of them knowing what the others were doing? It would certainly be a miracle.</P>

      <P>I listened to him and certainly that was the impression he gave.  He said that the situation at Ballinamore was working very satisfactorily and that there was no board of management.  The Deputy may read what he said in today's report.  I am not happy about the over-intellectual, encyclopaedic interpretation of education. Vested interests are endeavouring to sustain this.  At the same time, they tell us about the great need there will be for technical training and the great advantages connected with it&mdash; I agree there are&mdash;but technical education as far as they are concerned is for the people who are not likely to make the grade in the academic field. Technical education will be ideal for the sons of other people but they will continue, whether it is by suggesting there should be an additional year before a candidate can qualify for a university or some other way, to keep to themselves this academic training.  A certain suspicion has arisen in the minds of the people, who should be attracted to vocational or technical education, because they see that professional men, <i>in toto</i>, continue to avail of the old form of education and they are naturally cautious about entering into the field of technical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thornley spoke of his concern for the situation which arises when one student walks in one gate and another in a different gate.  This is often done in institutions which carry some worthwhile slogan in the Latin language over their gates.  I have come across examples of that in regard to children going to primary schools.  One child attends what is called the private school and another attends what is called the public school.  We must remember that education is subsidised to a great extent by people in the lower income group.  Children accept that in education there are two types of education, that for the private person and that for the public person.  The parents of children attending the private school are entitled to drive their cars to the door of the school and deliver their children at the door of the classroom but the children attending the public school may only enter through a small gate.  Their parents, even though the children may be wet <Col N="144" /> and need a change of footwear or clothing, have to leave them at the gate of the school.</P>
    <P>I do not accept this interpretation of education and I want to see it changed as expeditiously as possible. I do not deny the right of any person to send his or her child to any school he or she likes.  In a situation where public moneys are being devoted towards a certain aim I will not accept there could be any question of subsidising one child as against another or of contributing to a situation where we would suggest that one child is superior to another.  There are many areas where this situation exists.  I hope that the Department will indicate to the managers of those schools that all children attending their schools, whether they be public or private, will enter through the same gate.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words in connection with the Irish language.  I look forward to the day when all the people in this country will speak the Irish language.  I do not want, as some people have suggested, Irish to replace English but I want the Irish language restored.  There is a tendency all over the world for people when they become affluent, to look back to their original roots.  I have no doubt that, without reaching that point at all, in Ireland today there exists a regard for the Irish language.</P>
    <P>On other occasions I have been critical, perhaps, of the policy as far as the Irish language is concerned and I have been critical of the fact that the approach to the teaching of the Irish language has been identical to the approach to the teaching of Latin, Greek and, indeed, English.  I am happy that in the new curriculum a departure has taken place.  I want children, especially in the primary school, not to be concerned to any great degree with writing Irish or with the grammar of Irish.  I want them speaking Irish, enjoying Irish.  I want Irish as a subject at primary school level to have the fascination and attraction of Disneyland. I want children to laugh and push and shove through the medium of Irish. I do not want them bothered with learning about a way of life about which they know nothing.  I do not <Col N="145" /> want them concerned about how turf is won or how fishermen reap the harvest or how people climb mountains. I want them concerned with matters about which they know something.  In the city of Dublin I want boys talking about Georgie Best or Johnny Giles or aeroplanes and double-deckers and fish and chip shops, through the medium of Irish.  I do not want them to have lessons which treat of painful operations, visit to dentists, months spent in hospitals.  In the first year or two at secondary school and certainly in the primary school I do not want the pupils to hear anything at all about the aimsir fháistineach or the modh coinníollach or the uimhir dhé or the tuiseal geiniúnach.  All the time I want them to enjoy speaking the Irish language.  I have no doubt that this is possible.</P>
    <P>I find on visiting schools that a marked improvement has occurred but I would fear that there may be still amongst us people who, with the best motives in the world, retain a purist attitude towards the Irish language and who would suggest that unless you attend Croke Park every Sunday or a céilí at Barry's Hotel every Saturday night, and lead a certain way of life, you are not entitled to speak the Irish language.  The day of that approach is gone.  I would hope that the Minister in reply will not take serious issue with me but here I would repeat something which I have said as far back as three years ago, that is, that while there was a time when I had, perhaps, a purist attitude towards the Irish language, I have now come to the stage where I think I am looking at it in a more reasonable fashion and I would be prepared to concede that the time has come when it is no longer necessary to insist that a pupil will not get the intermediate certificate or the leaving certificate unless he has obtained a pass in the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is worth while <Col N="146" /> considering because for far too long too many people whose children failed in, perhaps, six subjects in the intermediate examination or the leaving certificate examination have alleged that it was the Irish language that let them down, that they would have got the certificate but for the Irish.  The figures show that the number of cases in which failure in Irish was the cause of their not obtaining the certificate was only .2 per cent of the total and that those who failed in Irish failed in practically every other subject.  At least, if a pass in Irish were not insisted upon, people would no longer have that excuse and would not be in a position to claim that the future of the child had been jeopardised because of failure in Irish.</P>
      <P>Apart from that consideration, this insistence on a pass in Irish does not help the language.  It is not generally realised that Irish as a subject is much easier and the standard required is much easier, than most other subjects. As a teacher, I would be prepared to prove this.  Because of the anxiety which exists about it, the student may be affected in the examination.  While I suggest that the award of the certificate should not depend on success in Irish, I consider that the study of the Irish language should be compulsory for the entire school period.  I would hope that if a pass in Irish were no longer compulsory, there would be no reduction in the time allocated to Irish in the school, which is now two and a half hours or three hours a week. In fact, I would hope that that allocation would be increased.</P>
      <P>I spoke earlier about the tragedy of education as I saw it for what could be described as the disadvantaged underprivileged pupil coming from the culture or sub-culture of his home into this new culture ordained for him at school.  I have spoken sufficiently about that to indicate my concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would venture to say a word now on the question of teachers.  I should express renewed congratulations to the Minister for the manner in which he has satisfied to a worthwhile degree the many and wide complaints which we get from our three teacher organisations. Here I must return, I am afraid, <Col N="147" /> to an old endemic problem.  I was hoping that, in so far as he has recognised teachers of manual subjects in the matter of the allocation up to a certain point, he might in the years ahead have a second look at that and agree to give to any teacher in any school the same recognition.</P>
    <P>If we are to suggest that technical education is comparable with or as desirable as academic education I do not think we will convince even the students that that is so when they realise that somebody is treated differently because he has a BA degree than somebody who might be a far better teacher and who teaches subjects which did not require his graduating at one of the universities but who must accept less money.  That is not a situation that can be sustained.</P>
    <P>On the question of teachers generally, the Department must now have a look at what I call recruitment for the teaching profession.  For far too long it has been accepted that the higher the educational and academic qualifications the better the teacher.  Those of us who have had any association with teaching will appreciate that does not hold, having regard to the important work the teacher is obliged to carry out.  It is unlike any other profession. In medicine, if a person goes to a bad doctor he has a second chance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Invariably, we will say.  If he is alive he will have another opportunity.  The same applies to an engineer or an architect: if you meet a bad one you can discard him and move to another.  As far as teaching is concerned, the student, the client, has not that second opportunity. A student may find himself in the class of a teacher possibly with excellent degrees but a person who found himself teaching because he thought it would be a worthwhile occupation but who, having arrived, discovered he had not got the patience, the personality, the characteristics which would make him a suitable person to carry out the duties required of him.  Unfortunately, however, the pupil has to spend possibly two years in the charge of that teacher.</P>

      <P>The damage would have been done to those students who are so unfortunate and it can never be remedied.  Therefore, I would hope that in the recruitment of teachers in the future regard will be had for the character, the personality, of the teacher as well as for his academic qualifications.</P>
      <P>My final point in regard to primary schools will refer to my constituency. I will first of all have regard to what I think a school should be.  I am disappointed particularly that since the advent of bad weather I have heard of so many schools where children having reported for classes were told there was no heating.  Apart from anything else, if we are to try to educate children for life, for management and organisation, this is a poor example.</P>
      <P>My most serious objection however is that when children are sent to school their mothers possibly go to a shop or to church or to work.  The children in the circumstances which I have mentioned, are kept in the school for a half or three quarters of an hour. They are released at 10 o'clock and arrive at a home which is locked with the mammy missing.  That situation should not be tolerated.  Unfortunately, it has occurred in a few schools in my constituency.  I would allow for a genuine emergency but where it occurs with such frequency as to suggest lack of interest or concern on the part of the school manager, I suggest the Department should take serious not of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From an economic point of view alone, I do not see why the Department do not insist on permanent caretakers being employed in all national schools.  The school in which I operated was blessed with an exemplary caretaker and I would be prepared to show that on economic grounds alone that gentleman, who possibly received £19 or £20 a week, was worth at least three times that amount.  It pains me when I go into relatively new schools, built two or three years, in which we <Col N="149" /> try to impress on children the importance of colour, neatness and tidyness, and do not see reflected in those establishments the ideas we try to inculcate in the students.</P>
    <P>On the question of school structures, it is not always wise to generalise from one's experience in one's own district, but I am concerned about Old Cabra. The school was built there when the area was first populated and when there was a large number of young children.  They are not there in the same numbers now and the school is only half or three-quarters occupied. Perhaps in such cases the Department would consider the building not a continuation or development of the prefabricated emergency buildings but something less expensive than the brick building.  I understand that there are on the market other buildings with a guaranteed life of 20 to 25 years. From what I have seen happening in areas like Old Cabra and West Cabra, where the original structures are there and only half occupied, it might be wise to think in terms of a structure which would last 20 to 25 years and which could be transported from one area to another.</P>
    <P>I think I have expressed most of the thoughts I had when rising.  As always happens when I resume my seat I shall discover that I have given too much time to detail and too little time to more important points.  Knowing that already my reputation in the matter of my lack of regard for my fellowgraduates has gone ahead of me I shall add further to that which I have already said.  We talk about educating for society and the people for whom we are making the policy but the people on whom we are imposing the policy have very little voice in it.</P>
    <P>I shall venture to comment too on the situation that has arisen in the matter of one or two professions, most noticeably the legal profession. Some time ago I tabled a question to the Minister in which I sought information as to the number of BLs who had graduated during the last five years and I asked the Minister to indicate if possible the number who (1) were nonnationals and the number who (2) came from what would be described as the <Col N="150" /> working-class people of Ireland.  If our professions are to reflect society and what society wants, that society must have representation in these professions. The Minister unfortunately was unable to give me the information I asked for but I think I can make a fair attempt at answering the question myself.  I think the number of students who have been called to the Bar in the last five, ten, 15 or 20 years and who have come from the lower income groups is very small.  Moneys which are paid out of the public purse towards educating people for the legal profession, a very important profession, come in the main, from our taxpayers who are mostly what are described as working-class people.  I hope the representatives of those people will find their place in that profession.</P>

      <P>I hope the House will bear with me.  I had intended to do some homework on this Estimate during the weekend but because of the situation of the schools in my constituency it proved impossible.  I find myself at a disadvantage speaking on this Estimate because all the speakers who have gone before me are or have been members of the teaching profession and, more noticably still, all are from the eastern seaboard.  I have noticed in the Department of Education over the last few years a tendency to generalise, to apply standards which obtain in Dublin to rural Ireland.  You cannot do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Thornley criticised those of us who thought small schools were a good thing.  To me, coming from rural Ireland, there is nothing better than the small school.  Children get individual attention, they know their teachers and, in many schools in my constituency anyway, they get a very high standard of education in primary schools. Primary schools are the most important of all schools.  They are the basis of all our education.  What is education?  Our aim when we educate is surely to draw out the possibilities and potentials of each child and to make the best of them.  Primary schools heretofore did this.  I understand the economics of this and obviously where schools were very small it became necessary to close them.  I am glad to note that the <Col N="151" /> Department have slowed down the rate of closures of small schools.  I do not know why this is.</P>

      <P>Whatever it is it is a good thing.  I have become increasingly aware of a slight deteriora-tion in the standard of pupils applying to become teachers in primary schools. I think this is because of the grants system.  If a boy or girl gets four honours he or she qualifies for a grant. If a boy just gets one honour in Irish and one other he might chance St. Patrick's, or in the case of a girl she might chance the equivalent.  I think this is a bad thing.  The very best brains must be attracted into the teaching profession.  I am appalled at the salaries paid to national teachers.  I was speaking at the weekend to a teacher in my own parish who is on an extension.  He has given service second to none.  He spent much of his free time and his energy before what we call free education coaching children for scholarships. This teacher, and as far as I know he is a graduate, told me that on reaching the age of 67 he will not be earning £2,500 a year.  I just sat there with my mouth open because £2,500 a year is considered &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo; in many professions. Young solicitors start with that.  Young doctors, registrars in hospitals, start with that.  Surely men and women who have given a lifetime of service should have better remuneration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a very large constituency. It takes in a slice of Roscommon, half of Galway and a great portion of Clare.  In all the years I have been in this House representing this constituency I have never heard education discussed in terms of class.  In this House tonight both Deputy Thornley and Deputy Tunney seemed to be obsessed with class distinction.  I cannot understand this.  Perhaps it is due to the fact that in rural Ireland the Christian Brothers, the De la Salle Brothers, the Mercy Nuns or the Presentation Nuns, educated all of our children before the free system came in, for a minimum fee.  Therefore, children from all start attended secondary <Col N="152" /> schools if they had the academic ability and were not so conscious of class distinction.  This to me is quite a phenomenon and it is terribly apparent in the House tonight.  The Deputies appear to consider that children who go to secondary schools in Dublin come from a different class from the ones who do not go on to secondary schools.  This is crazy.</P>

      <P>I have a sort of muddled thinking on this and I suppose as a woman I will be forgiven this because we are not supposed to be logical.  Children leaving primary schools should be screened in some way to see if they are fit for what we now term secondary education and whether they will eventually be fit for academic education.  The ambition of most parents in rural Ireland is to have their children go to the secondary school and get the leaving certificate.  This is a mistake because most children are not material for leaving certificates.  I see this in my own children.  I am quite convinced that my eldest daughter is academically inclined but I do not believe that the next girl will even pass her intermediate certificate and for that reason I do not intend to push her.  I am sure we shall find a niche for her somewhere and we shall train her for that end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rural Ireland&mdash;it has happened in my constituency at least&mdash;technical schools have become more or less secondary schools.  I do not wish to be misunderstood.  It is a good thing that children in technical schools should get their leaving certificates, <i>et cetera,</i> but there should be more emphasis on technical education.  In Dublin and the larger centres there are superb technical schools the like of which do not exist in rural Ireland.  Our technical schools have now become extensions of secondary schools or are run on parallel lines which is a mistake. Heretofore, vocational schools gave, particularly to girls who were not academically minded, very good basic domestic training.  This seems to have gone.  I have always thought it a great mistake that boys did not get some domestic training.  As a nation <Col N="153" /> we leave the wives to do all domestic chores and all the rearing of families and the husbands opt out.  This is largely because of the way the boys were brought up; they were never shown or trained in or taught anything with even a slightly domestic flavour to it.</P>
    <P>It is important that children should be told at a fairly early age, about 14 or 15, that they obviously will not be material for university but could do very well in technology and industry. A child should be told this and should be proud of it.  Deputy Tunney seemed to think that children trained as technicians are second-class citizens.  Surely this is the age of technology, computers and so on, and as time goes on it would seem that technicians and people with specialised skills will be the people who will get the jobs.  A great many graduates with excellent degrees and qualifications have to emigrate to earn a living but I think we have plently of scope for technicians at home.</P>
    <P>My constituency has a number of small secondary schools for girls, excellent in themselves and run mostly by the Mercy Order.  Early this year three of them, Eyrecourt, Woodford and Kinvara, were notified by the Department that as from this year they would cease to be senior cycle schools, in other words they could not present candidates for the leaving certificate. The manner in which this announcement was conveyed showed gross bad manners.  We live in an age in which manners do not seem to count but surely nuns and teachers who have given a generation of service are entitled to at least a visit from an official of the Department to discuss the ending of senior cycle education instead of what I would describe as a rude letter dismissing them.</P>
    <P>I attended a protest meeting at Kinvara last night&mdash;that is why I did not do my homework.  That school was opened as a secondary school in 1924, residential and non-residential. Since then it has produced superb results.  It is an excellent school and the Department must be aware that it never sought too much by way of grants and that the nuns ploughed back a great deal of their money into keeping the school going.  The parents and the nuns <Col N="154" /> are very disturbed.  Woodford is in a slightly different position in that it is a more modern school, is co-educational and has larger numbers, about 170, but it is in the same category. On the day the Mother Superior received a letter from the Department telling her she would no longer have a senior cycle she also had a visit from an official of the Department to tell her she could go ahead and build two extra class rooms.  She showed him the letter and he muttered that somebody did not tell him something.  It appears there is need for more liaison in the Minister's Department.  Woodford is in south Galway, up in the mountains, and parents tell me that if their children are transported to Portumna they will be travelling, some of them, 22 miles each morning and 22 miles each evening.  They are very alarmed about this.</P>
    <P>We in rural Ireland are aware that the form of education the parents bargain for when sending their children to school by bus is not the form they are getting.  This has to be seen to be believed in some cases.  Parents have told me of their concern about those long bus journeys and the inevitable waiting at one end or the other on occasions.  In some cases parents have taken the children off the buses and got them to cycle to school.  In other cases, at great expense to themselves, they have sent the children to boarding school because of those long bus journeys.</P>
    <P>Eyrecourt, the third school in my constituency, is a small new school, about nine or ten years old which has only about 100 students but it is an excellent school and gave great service to the community.  We, in rural Ireland realise, whether the Minister does or not, that if you take a secondary school out of a small town you damage also the economic and social life of the town.  The rural strata is based on schools.  I feel very strongly about transporting children in buses over long distances.  It must be done in some cases.  In certain cases children leave for school at 7.30 or 8 a.m. and return about 7.30 or 8 p.m.  These children are being educated away from their homes and, in the case of boys, away from the land.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="155" /> I spoke to a parent last night, a quite substantial farmer whose greatest regret was that he had sent his son to a secondary school.  I said: &ldquo;We want farmers with a fairly good standard of education in the EEC.&rdquo;  His answer was that since they sent their son John to secondary school he never saw a cow or even the land and how could he be interested in something he never saw and to which he was not geared?  I think this is a dire situation. I do not know if the Minister is familiar with the area west of the Shannon but the population there is declining every year.  If we educate our children away from their homes, then they will never go back to stay in their homes.  If the boys do not go back the girls will not stay because there will be no one for them to marry.</P>
    <P>We are missing out on one facet of education, farming education.  I know there are schools and facilities in the universities but something will have to be done at grassroots level for the benefit of the boys and girls who intend to stay on the land.  They will have to be given a better technical training in farming.  In the light of the EEC it is most important that they should get the very best training they can.  For too long our farmers mooched along doing things any-old-how. Now they are adapting to modern methods and modern conditions.  Even in primary school the children should have visits from the local agricultural instructor who would give them talks on agriculture.  The vocational schools should have a close liaison with the agricultural section of the county council. The children should be kept up-to-date on modern farming methods.</P>
    <P>My constituency has unfortunately a high incidence of mental handicap.  I do not know why this should be.  There are all sorts of theories.  Every weekend unfortunate mothers come to me and tell me that a child is mildly mentally handicapped and therefore not eligible for St. Raphael's; the nearest school then is in Athlone and it is mainly for mongoloid children.  These mothers tell me they are nearly demented because they do not know what to do and their husbands do not <Col N="156" /> understand the problem.  A great deal more will have to be done by way of making schools available for mentally handicapped children.  Were it not for the invaluable work done by the religious orders we would be very lacking in facilities for these children. The Minister should try to get more money for these schools.  These children belong to the weakest section of the community and they will always be a problem for both the parents and the community.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look again at the small schools.  West of the Shannon we could not possibly get 400 in a school.  There are not 400 adults in most areas, not to mention 400 children.  It might be a good idea to make these schools co-educational.  If that were done one might get 150 or 200 pupils, but one will never get 400.  I think co-education is excellent. We have had one experience in Woodford in which the results have been extraordinarily good.  The teachers tell me that the girls cannot bear to see the boys beat them and the boys cannot bear the idea of the girls being better and so they are all breaking their necks to secure higher marks.  The experiment there has been a very happy one.  The male teachers find the girls easy to handle and the nuns are well able to handle the boys.  There cannot be a hard and fast rule for this area.  There must be no regulation saying you must have 400 students before you can have a senior cycle school.  In fairness to the Minister, I should tell the House that these schools have been given a reprieve of four years.  I imagine that is for the purpose of enabling the present students to complete their courses.  But this is a slow, lingering death.  I appeal to the Minister to reverse his decision and to allow the schools to continue for the next ten or 12 years until we see what the population trend is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not by any stretch of the imagination an authority on education but I am very concerned about education.  I happen to be the father of a large family of school-going children.  I am also chairman of the Vocational Education Committee in County Dublin, one of the busiest committees in the whole country and <Col N="157" /> with more responsibility than any other committee in the country because of the rapid rate of expansion in County Dublin.</P>
      <P>We have all sorts of problems.  One thing that almost frightens me is the fact that we have practically no framework of legislation for education.  It frightens me to think of what the Minister can do by simple decree or order. Will we ever have an Education Act under which those providing the education will know what they can do and what the Minister can impose on them?  By an over-night announcement, outside of this House altogether, the Minister can tell those people what they have to do and almost what they must think.  This is a shocking situation. By decree or order the Minister can ordain fantastic changes in educational policy without any discussion here in this House.  The greatest example of this in recent times was the way in which the matter of the community schools was handled.</P>
      <P>I am one of those who is wholly in favour of the whole concept of community schools.  It is an excellent idea and I believe it would have been accepted wholeheartedly in the area I represent if it had been properly put before the people and the people given the opportunity of considering all the implications in the knowledge that their views would get sincere consideration in the Department.  Very early on I made an effort to get the Minister back on the rails, so to speak, before he went too far, but I failed to do so. The people are putting him back on the rails nows.  He sent his inspectors, excellent people, down the country to make the various announcements and they were lucky to get back with their lives, almost.  They were thrown out of the various areas; here was someone coming down from Dublin to tell the people what was good for them and, whether they liked it or not, they were going to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is all wrong.  Many of the wrongs that were obvious earlier in regard to the community school proposals have been rectified since but it would have been much better if there had been a certain amount of discussion of people's view on this whole matter before they were told that this <Col N="158" /> was the type of school they were to have.  Last July the Minister made an announcement to the effect that after full consultation with the parties concerned he had made certain decisions in respect of community schools for Tallaght and Blanchardstown.  In these two areas the County Dublin Vocational Education Committee were providing the only post-primary education that was available.  There was no consultation with them.  The only attempt at consultation took place at 4 o'clock on a Friday afternoon when there was a telephone call for me asking me to go to the Department where I would be told of the announcement that was to appear in the newspapers on the following morning.</P>

      <P>When I confronted the Minister with this instance at Question Time his answer was that he had consulted with the vocational education organisation for the country as a whole.  Had he been talking to the organisation representing the country in regard to two schools the type of which was to be peculiar and particular to Tallaght and Blanchardstown only? That is not playing the game.  It was not giving sufficient recognition to what I consider to be the busiest committee at present in the country and the committee which probably have the greatest responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know from the draft census that out of a population increase in the last six years of 80,000, approximately 55,000 are in County Dublin.  We know what that means in terms of problems for everybody charged with responsibility for providing educational facilities. The problems are enormous and I <Col N="159" /> know that the Minister has a difficult job in trying to provide facilities in an area growing as rapidly as the one with which I am concerned.  I know the problems that this involves for the officials of his Department but many of the problems could be eased if the job was tackled in the way that it should be tackled.</P>
