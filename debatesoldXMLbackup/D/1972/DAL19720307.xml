      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware of the statement made by the United States Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs to the effect that no suggestions regarding any useful role the United States might afford with regard to using its good offices in connection with the Northern Ireland problem were forthcoming from the Irish Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery) Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>I have made known the Government's views about the Northern Ireland situation to the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to my colleagues in the United States, Canada, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Luxembourg and Norway, as well as to a number of US Senators and Congressmen. In each case I urged that the British Government be encouraged to seek a political rather than a military solution to the problem.</P>
      <P>I was much heartened by the sympathetic reaction I received generally. My action is supplemented by our ambassadors abroad who keep in touch with their Governments of accredition on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder, Sir, could we be allowed to ask a number of supplementary questions at this point?  The Minister has taken seven questions together and his reply has not been very comprehensive.  I asked <Col N="967" /> the Minister if he brought the matter to the attention of the UN Security Council or has he exhausted all aspects of the UN in an attempt to bring this question to them?  Has he seen the suggestion made that Ireland should engage the services of an international constitutional lawyer to investigate this, particularly having regard to the success of this method in the Algerian problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the House either last week or the week before that the decision taken by the Government was to approach other Governments which are friendly to Britain and to ask those Governments to encourage Britain to stop military solutions in the North of Ireland.  We have no reason to believe that this has not been a success and until we have evidence of the need for a new policy line we would not make another decision. The questions asked by the Deputy about what we would or would not do would be in conflict with allowing this policy to implement itself.  We do not exclude new decisions, but we have not taken other decisions yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here a transcript of a statement made by the US Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs.  He said that the Minister told the US Secretary, Mr. Rodgers, that he was not requesting US intervention in the Northern Ireland situation. Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that we asked the US Government and other Governments to speak to Britain and to encourage Britain to seek a political rather than a military solution in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This document states that the Minister did not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have an argument on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>From page 2 of this document it is clear that the Minister did not request&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; in the circumstances was in <Col N="968" /> response to a call for intervention by people in the US and &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; implies the American Government getting into the situation in a manner which would be resented and rejected by Britain, and it was made quite clear that America did not intend to get involved in that way.  What we asked was not to intervene in a hostile way but as a friendly nation to Britain to encourage Britain and to ask Britain to change from a military policy.  Not using the word &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; might give the impression we did not ask for action by the US.  We certainly did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the US Government assure the Minister that they would take such action?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Connell has it in one of his questions.  He used the word &ldquo;discreet&rdquo;.  The very essence of the mission was to ask Governments to do this.  Some Governments expressed immediate opinions to me but I do not think it would be discreet or proper to state these publicly.  As a Government, we asked them to do this and we are awaiting the result of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that the American Secretary of State said that as far as his Government were concerned they intended to remain neutral?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite true that in a public statement he said they would not take sides unless requested to do so by the British Government and us. Therefore the technicality of the word &ldquo;intervention&rdquo; does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister's representation was rejected by the American Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reason to believe it was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Minister's statement now, Mr. Rodgers was telling a public lie.  We must have it one way or the other.  The Minister was sent home like a little boy by the Americans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the appalling feeling in this <Col N="969" /> country as he traipsed around the world that he had not done his homework, that he had made no preparations for this jaunt and that neither had the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there was no way of preparing for the catastrophe that took place.  I went immediately and did a job on behalf of the Government and I think I did it very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the feeling in the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply, I give notice that I intend to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, having regard to the intensity of feeling in this country about diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, he will ensure that no Government decision in favour of such relations will be taken without first affording the Dáil an opportunity to discuss the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the Dáil that I do not consider it appropriate to discuss publicly the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with particular countries.  It is, however, open to any Deputy who has a view on a particular case to make this known to the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister verify or deny the several kites that <Col N="970" /> have been put up suggesting that the Government have already taken a decision on this matter?  Have they taken a decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not responsible for kites but if the Dáil wants to discuss this matter&mdash;it is a function of the Government&mdash;the Estimate for my Department may come before the House before any such decision is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall that when this matter was last before Dáil Éireann there was a debate on the matter in which the Minister of the day proposed that the matter be considered? Might I invite the Minister to express an opinion on this matter? Is it not preferable that we should show the world that we are a democratic country by having a debate on a matter before a decision is taken, in contrast to the Soviet Union where a decision is taken and notified then to Parliament for such debate as may then be allowed to take place?  Surely this is a case where we should indicate the essential democracy of our system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was not so democratic in regard to other countries with which we might have relations. The Deputy is just picking one country for discussion.  I do not think that is appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether we had a debate in this House when Ireland decided to vote for the inclusion of China in the United Nations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputies are confused by their own propaganda. They are talking as if there was a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fine Gael Government as well.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the only recent complaint of inadequate voltage from Drangan village was received last December. On investigation is was discovered that the deficiency was attributable to the internal wiring of the premises from which the complaint emanated.  If the Deputy will let me have details of any specific complaints which he has in mind I will have them investigated.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The number of international conferences, sales meetings and incentive travel visits to Ireland in 1970 and 1971 was 120 and 86, respectively.  With regard to 1972, there have been 18 cancellations involving and estimated 12,000 delegates.  There are at present arrangements for the holding of 48 conferences or similar gatherings here this year and these involve a total of about 16,000 delegates.  I should add, however, that these should not be treated as firm figures because the position is rather fluid, as the House will appreciate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the lowest return air fare between London and Shannon available to an Irish adult resident in Britain and returning to Ireland in July or August, 1972, for a fortnight's holiday with relatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the figure of £29 return fare between Shannon and London is absolutely prohibitive and will impede any efforts made to generate additional ethnic traffic to this country from Great Britain?  How does the Minister reconcile this figure with the announcement of BEA and Caledonian Airways yesterday of a return fare at weekends of £13 between London and Belfast?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two matters.  Aer Lingus have reduced fares also for packages.  The Deputy will find that that figure applies to a package.  The Deputy in his question asked for the normal fare, outside a package arrangement.  There are attractive package arrangements in which Aer Lingus guarantee totally free road services and reduced hotel rates.  These are all involved in a package with the air fare.  These packages are available throughout the year and have been publicised and are proving successful.  If the Deputy puts down another question on this matter I will answer it fully.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is it correct to say that there is a fare of about £10 or £12 return available if a person stays more than six days and less than 30 days, but that if he goes on an emergency trip and comes back in two or three days time the fare is over £20?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a package, by almost eliminating road and rail transport costs and reducing accommodation costs, one can offer a package figure which is very attractive but is quite unrelated to the normal scheduled fare, which is a different matter altogether.</P>

There is a combination then between the air or sea carriers, road or rail carriers, and the hotel, guesthouse or farmhouse involved.  It is all in the package.</P>

      <P>As I told the Deputy previously, my Department and the economic consultant to the <Col N="974" /> Taoiseach and the Government, Dr. O'Donohue, are engaged in a very detailed independent survey of this kind, putting our expertise against that of Aer Lingus in regard to what they submit as figures.  We found there were certain unviable considerations involved in a stop at Shannon solely and that a stop at Shannon solely was not at all acceptable to the Americans.  The matter would be largely an academic exercise once the American request was for a landing at Dublin.</P>

      <P>The Paymaster-General's office have been notified of a total of 82 supplementary pensions so far.

      <P>Will the Minister not agree that it seems very ridiculous that those people, some of whom have retired two years ago, are still awaiting pension and gratuity from his Department? If the Paymaster-General's Office is responsible for the delay, would he attempt to get his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, to do something about it?  Only today I had 20 applications from people who are almost 12 months out who have not got either gratuity or pension yet?  It is a damn disgrace.</P>

Where complaints are made to the Minister about the creaming of pupils by means of an entrance examination the Department has written to the school in question deprecating the use of an examination for the purpose of admitting to the school only pupils of higher ability.

      <P>Why did the Minister say at column 187 that while it might be acceptable to advocate consumption of butter as such within the Community, if we as a Government were to advocate the use of Irish butter within the Community that would probably be considered unfair practice?

If it can be objected in the case of any particular board that their activities distort trade within the Community then it becomes objectionable within the Community.

When you consider that the board was established about 1925 and held 25 meetings in the ensuing 40 years to 1965, I do not think it could be seriously contended that this was an effective weapon for the promotion of the livestock industry in the country and, therefore, it is reasonable to say that to convene it again to continue with its 26th meeting in the 47th year or so would not be a very sensible thing to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there has been undue delay because the general question of meat classification is a highly technical business and there is the question of the determination of standards by which one classifies meat, and even now there are a couple of weeks more experimentation to be done in order to standardise these things.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that time did not permit me to complete reading the statement on the 1971-72 Health Estimate.  I did deal with a large number of subjects last week including the Estimate itself, the Supplementary Estimate, health contributions, programme budgeting, the pursuance of the Health Act and establishment of health boards, establishment of the family doctor service, vital statistics, infectious diseases, staff relations, general hospital development, the appointment of consultants, capital made available for building projects, <Col N="1004" /> psychiatric services, drug abuse policy, accommodation for the aged, community care for the aged, the public health nursing service, mental handicap and the child health service.  Those matters were all dealt with last week and I now come to dental services.</P>
      <P>Dental services will continue to be provided in the main by wholetime dental officers employed by the health boards.  In recent years, due to better salaries and conditions of employment, recruitment of these officers has shown a marked improvement.  There are now 141 dental officers, including senior dental officers, employed in the public dental service.  This represents a 44 per cent increase as compared with four years ago when revised conditions of appointment were introduced.  Most health boards have a number of senior dental officers whose duty it is to organise and supervise the operation of the public dental services in local areas; it is the policy of the Department to encourage health boards to create such posts where they are needed and thereby, to ensure that the services are organised and operated as efficiently as possible.  It is recognised that the development of dental services for the eligible classes, in particular for school children, has been uneven throughout the country and the service is one which a number of health boards have, since their establishment, been critically reviewing.</P>
      <P>Prevention is better than cure in the case of most human ailments but in no other case, perhaps, does this principle apply more than in relation to tooth decay.  It is, therefore, important that children should be instructed, even from a very early age, to acquire good habits of dental care and oral hygiene. The dental health campaign conducted by the dental health education committee of the Irish Dental Association and the dental health programmes operated in some areas by public dental officers have made a valuable contribution in this field.  Health boards will, in future, be expected to include dental health education as a regular part of their programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for adding fluoride to public water supplies as a proven means of preventing much dental decay <Col N="1005" /> continues to make steady progress.  So far 78 supplies have been fluoridated serving a total of 1.4 million persons or 47 per cent of the total population. All the major cities&mdash;Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford&mdash;and almost all towns with a population of 10,000 or more are now on fluoridated water; 70 per cent of all the population using piped water supplies are now receiving the benefits of fluoridation and only the smaller supplies remain to be treated.</P>
    <P>Preliminary research in Cork city has shown a marked reduction in caries in both the first and permanent teeth of the children who from birth were provided with fluoridated water. Also, the dental staff of the Eastern Health Board have made a survey of the dental condition of school children in the Dublin area who have been on fluoridated water for about six years. The preliminary findings of this survey, while awaiting full statistical assessment, show a significant reduction in caries among these children compared with the results of the similar survey made by the Medical Research Council in the area in 1961. For example, in the temporary teeth of the five and six year olds the reduction was 64 per cent and 52 per cent respectively and in the permanent teeth of the ten and 12 year olds there were reductions of 34 per cent and 32 per cent respectively.</P>
    <P>In the more sparsely populated parts of the country which have not public water supplies suitable for fluoridation, a number of schemes have been initiated for applying fluoride by means of regular mouth rinsing by children under supervision with a suitable fluoride solution.</P>
    <P>Generally it is accepted that about 3 per cent of primary school children suffer from speech defects and that about one half of these children would benefit from attention by a trained speech therapist.  For adults suffering from speech defects due to brain injury or other conditions the provision of speech therapy is also desirable. The Dublin College of Speech Therapy was established in 1969 under the auspices of the National Rehabilitation Board to train speech therapists <Col N="1006" /> for the health services.  The first three-year course at the college will conclude in June, 1972, and it is to be hoped that the students, who will then qualify, will take employment here.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note that this year's Estimate includes a sum of £70,000 for health information.  This is by far the largest amount devoted to this purpose in any one year and reflects the importance I attach to health education.  Quite a number of our health problems are avoidable, but due to human ignorance or weakness &mdash;perhaps sheer indifference in some cases&mdash;many of us find ourselves in need of medical treatment of one kind or another, due, for instance, to cigarette smoking, excessive drinking, drug taking, lack of exercise, overeating or eating the wrong foodstuffs, and so on.  This is where health educational measures can do much good.</P>
    <P>Health education is approached in two complementary ways, firstly, by inculcating a proper and deepening understanding of life and health from childhood, through adolescence, into maturity and, secondly, by advising and warning groups at risk of the dangers associated with particular habits or practices.  I think there is much room for improvement in both methods of approach in so far as concerns our existing arrangements for health education and I hope to introduce improved measures to educate the public more effectively in matters of health.  Television can do much good in this field and we have made considerable use of this medium, with the co-operation of Telefís Éireann.  I hope to see greater use being made of television in the field of health education.</P>
    <P>Health education in schools needs development, in view of the young age at which children nowadays become aware of the problems of living and behaviour.  Here I am thinking mainly of the need to inculcate in children a healthy regimen&mdash;starting with simple hygienic practices and taking account, at appropriate ages, of education about the ill-effects of cigarette smoking, excessive drinking, drug taking and such like problems.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, I have already embarked on a widespread <Col N="1007" /> publicity campaign aimed primarily at discouraging young people from smoking cigarettes, using television, radio, magazines, newspapers, posters and school film shows.  Anti-smoking publicity on television and in the Sunday papers during the past year has featured some well-known sporting personalities &mdash;the footballers, Tom Prendergast and Steve Heighway, the Cork hurler Charlie McCarthy, the swimmer Vicki Smith and the boxer Mick Dowling. Further anti-smoking filmlets are currently appearing on television featuring some well-known parents in different walks of life&mdash;Charles Mitchel of Telefís Éireann, Tom Kiernan, the international rugby footballer, and Frank O'Farrell, manager of Manchester United football team.  I feel sure that the influence of these well-known personalities against cigarette smoking will be persuasive and counteract the false image of cigarette smoking as an essential ingredient of modern sophisticated living.</P>
    <P>I have thus dealt with the special anti-cigarette smoking campaign of my Department which is aimed primarily at the younger generation.  This campaign has been given real impact by the fact that Radio Telefís Éireann have ceased to accept cigarette advertising on television with effect from the 1st April last.</P>
    <P>There has been one other significant development which I feel I should report to the House.  At my request the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers Advisory Committee have agreed voluntarily to put a warning notice on all packets of cigarettes which are sold in this country.  The warning notice will read: &ldquo;Government Warning&mdash; Smoking can damage your health.&rdquo; All advertisements in newspapers and magazines and on posters will carry a reminder that there is a warning on the packets.  I am most grateful to the tobacco manufacturers for their public spirited co-operation in this matter.</P>
    <P>I intend to continue and intensify the anti-smoking campaign aimed at our young people in view of the serious health hazards to cigarette smokers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1008" /> These hazards have been publicised time and again, and I have on several occasions quoted from reports of such reputable bodies as the British Royal College of Physicians about them.  In a leaflet published by the US Public Health Service today's knowledge about the health consequences of smoking cigarettes is summarised in the following major conclusions:</P>
    <P>1.  Cigarette smokers tend to die at earlier ages and experience more days of disability than do comparable non-smokers in the population.</P>
    <P>2.  If it were not for cigarette smoking, practically none of the earlier deaths from lung cancer would have occurred; a substantial portion of the earlier deaths from chronic bronchitis and emphysema would not have occurred; and a portion of the earlier deaths of cardiovascular origin would not have occurred.</P>
    <P>3.  If it were not for cigarette smoking, excess disability from chronic respiratory and cardiovascular diseases would be reduced.</P>
    <P>4.  By quitting or significantly reducing their smoking, people could delay or avert a substantial portion of the deaths which occur from lung cancer, a substantial portion of the earlier deaths and excess disability from chronic respiratory diseases, and some portion of the earlier deaths and disability from diseases of cardiovascular origin.</P>
    <P>This is a serious, sober statement on a widespread habit that is, without equivocation, a matter of life and death.  Many cigarette smokers tend to ignore this warning, but, if they do, I am afraid they do so at their peril.</P>
    <P>The Working Party on Drug Abuse, which reported to me earlier this year, devoted a chapter of their report to education and publicity on drugs. They recommended, among other things, that &ldquo;information and advice in connection with drug abuse should be provided as a matter of urgency for parents, teachers and others who come in contact with young persons&rdquo;. I have accepted this recommendation, and I am happy to tell the House that my Department, in co-operation with <Col N="1009" /> the Department of Education, will hold seminars for post-primary teachers. These seminars will discuss the problems of drug abuse and alcoholism in a way that will, we hope, equip the teachers to give advice and guidance, in a balanced and helpful way, to teenage children.  The first two of the series have been held already.</P>
    <P>The working party considered the difficulties of communicating information on drugs to young persons and concluded that, as this point in time, there should not be any &ldquo;crash&rdquo; programme for schools or youth clubs and that there should not be any general use of the mass media in an educational campaign.  I think this is a wise viewpoint as the wrong type of publicity about drug abuse could do more harm than good, in promoting curiosity rather than understanding among the young.  The working party did, however, make some specific recommendations in regard to young people who had been identified as having abused drugs in regard to the identification of children at risk, <i>et cetera.</i> They recommended also that a group representing the Departments of Health and Education, the schools, the university departments and professional bodies should investigate the general question of communicating information on the dangers to young persons.  These recommendations are being pursued in the Department.</P>
    <P>With regard to the problem of alcoholism, I have mentioned already that arrangements are in hand for distributing the Department's new leaflet &ldquo;What Sort of Drinker Are You?&rdquo; widely throughout the community. Press advertising of the problem of alcoholism has also been undertaken.</P>
    <P>Alcoholic drinks are widely advertised, as Deputies know, and recently the Institute of Advertising Practitioners adopted a code of standards governing advertisements for alcoholic beverages.  It seemed to me that this code could be improved in some respects, without being in any way unfair to the brewing and distilling interests, and some suggestions for improving the code have been put to the institute.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1010" /> A publicity campaign to draw attention to the dangers of accidents in the home was undertaken during the past year, including a new illustrated leaflet on the subject.  This leaflet was widely distributed at the Department's stand at the Ideal Homes Exhibition in the Mansion House a few months ago.</P>
    <P>Food hygiene was another health topic on which the Department produced a new leaflet during the year, to coincide with a &ldquo;clean food&rdquo; campaign organised by the Irish Housewives' Association.</P>
    <P>I should tell the House that I have been examining the possibility, indeed the inevitability, of promoting a health education centre.  This will occupy my attention in the coming year.</P>
    <P>The standard of food hygiene in the food trade is controlled under the Food Hygiene Regulations.  Experience gained in the working of the regulations showed that certain amendments were desirable.</P>
    <P>Under the regulations a person who is carrying on, or proposes to commence, a food business such as a restaurant, hotel or butcher's shop is required to obtain registration of his premises from the health board for this area.  Up to this a premises had to be registered in full or not at all.  This presented certain practical difficulties, for example, a licensed premises providing snacks or precooked meals for customers could not be expected to have full kitchen and cooking facilities. In practice, regard must be had in the reasonable operation of a registration system of this kind to the nature and extent of the business involved and, in order to provide an appropriate basis for this, an amendment has been made of the Food Hygiene Regulations.</P>
    <P>Under the revised regulations health boards will have power to grant registration where the nature and extent of the food business carried on is appropriately limited to take account of the facilities and size of premises available. Should a proprietor exceed the limitations on the nature and extent of the food business after the registration has been granted or should a change occur in the extent of the facilities available. the chief executive officer of the health <Col N="1011" /> board has power to cancel the registration. The proprietor has a right to appeal to the Minister for Health against any such cancellation.</P>
    <P>The regulations also require proprietors to provide sanitary conveniences for customers in restaurants and other registrable catering premises where such a requirement is reasonable and practicable.  They also contain provision aimed at securing the establishment of more hygienic conditions in food stalls.</P>
    <P>In October, 1967, a committee was appointed to consider and make recommendations on the measures which should be taken, in the interests of public health, to further and maintain a programme of education and training in food hygiene and in other related aspects of hygiene and for ensuring the education of school children in the basic principles of hygiene.</P>
    <P>The membership included persons concerned with the catering and food manufacturing industries, the trade unions, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the Irish Housewives' Association, a chief medical officer of health, a health inspector and officers of the Departments of Education, Health and Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>The report of this committee, which was published recently, covers a wide field.  It points out that as a result of the implementation of the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, there had been a general upgrading of hygiene standards but that a great deal of further progress is necessary.  It defines the object of a food hygiene programme as the ensuring of clean, safe and hygienic food premises in which food is prepared for human consumption and enumerates the hazards that need to be guarded against.</P>
    <P>The committee refers especially to the great importance of education in bringing about an appreciation of the fundamentals of hygiene and recommended the setting up of a health education centre.</P>
    <P>The committee's report represents a careful and thorough assessment of the many aspects of the field assigned <Col N="1012" /> to it for study and will be of great assistance to all concerned with the problem.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee has been widely circulated and comments on its recommendations from interested bodies have been invited.</P>
    <P>Our participation in the activities of international health organisations continues to increase.  In the Council of Europe we are represented on the two principal health committees&mdash;the European Public Health Committee and the Partial Agreement Public Health Committee.  We are also actively concerned with the sub-committees and working parties attached to these committees.  This enables this country not only to benefit from the pooled expertise of the participating countries but also to contribute usefully from Irish experience, as in the case of the Working Party on the Problems of Implementation of Drinking Water Fluoridation, the report of which was recently published by the Council of Europe.  We have joined as full members the Partial Agreement Public Health Committee and this has resulted in a considerable expansion of our commitments, particularly in the continuous and valuable exchange of information between member states which is a feature of that committee's work.  The 23rd session of the Partial Agreement Public Health Committee was held in Dublin in April last.</P>
    <P>We also continue active co-operation with the World Health Organisation. On the occasion of the 1970-71 Estimates I referred to a pilot scheme of registration of ischaemic heart disease which we were carrying out in co-operation with the World Health Organisation.  That scheme is continuing and it has recently been the subject of very favourable comment by WHO.  Our association with these and other international organisations in the field of health brings this country the considerable benefits which derive from the exchange of information, the co-operative control of diseases and the opportunities for Irish doctors and paramedical medical officers to attend international seminars and to study abroad with the <Col N="1013" /> aid of fellowships.  It also brings international recognition of the contribution which we are making towards the raising of the standard of health services in the world at large.  This is seen in the increasing number of fellowship holders and others who visit this country to study Irish procedures.</P>
    <P>The negotiations on Ireland's application for membership of EEC have not indicated any insuperable difficulties for us in the health sector.  The steps necessary for effecting freedom of movement and freedom to practice in relation to medical and paramedical personnel have not been completed. This is essentially a matter of co-ordination of training and rules of practice and provision for the mutual recognition of qualifications.  From now on we will be consulted regarding further proposed developments in these matters as in other matters and, of course, we will be in a position to influence directly the final form of the particular controls.  We have kept in close touch with the professional and other interests involved in these matters and will continue to do so.  In regard to directives already enacted by the EEC in matters which are the concern of my Department, officers of my Department have participated in the negotiations to ensure that the interests of this country are taken into account in the adjustments which the enlargement of the Communities will require.  These principally relate to food additives, <i>et cetera</i>, proprietary medicines and social benefits for migrant workers.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I recently established a National Social Service Council which held its inaugural meeting on the 1st October last.  The council includes persons active in voluntary organisations and officers of local authorities and Government Departments.  The majority of the members are people who have over the years participated in a prominent and positive way in voluntary activity and they represent a good cross-section of those in the community who have indicated their willingness to devote themselves to the service of others.</P>
    <P>The primary function of the council <Col N="1014" /> is to promote the establishment of social service councils, to encourage and co-ordinate voluntary activity, and to help in its co-ordination with the activity of statutory bodies.  The council will, I hope, be a focal point of voluntary social work activity in this country and will be a source of encouragement, assistance and advice to existing agencies.  That the council will have a challenge is evidenced by the fact that in the whole of the Republic there are 37 social service councils operating reasonably full services and 32 councils mainly caring for the aged.  The lists are in the notes circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The council will also provide a means through which the Government may be constantly aware of the views of those most concerned with social work problems and create a channel of communications through which the Government might seek the advice of those concerned with these problems.</P>
    <P>To co-ordinate the work of Government Departments concerned with social work activity, a permanent inter-departmental liaison committee has also been established comprising representatives of the Departments of Finance, Social Welfare, Local Government, Education, Justice and Labour as well as my own Department. This committee will work in close association with the National Social Service Council.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from recent pronouncements which I have made that I am deeply concerned about the extent of and the role of voluntary activity in our society.  There have in recent years been many marked improvements in conditions in this country.  The population, for the first time in many years, is rising; new industries have been established to replace those becoming obsolete and to provide for the many who are leaving agriculture and seeking alternative employment.  There has been, despite rising prices and despite temporary setbacks in our plans, an increase in the general standard of living of the majority of our people. While we have not attained to the level of affluence which has developed in many other countries it is true to <Col N="1015" /> say that our progress in recent years is leading us in that general direction.</P>
    <P>While this is so we cannot overlook that there are also in our society many who have failed to participate in full in this growth in living standards.  One thinks, in particular, of those who are disadvantaged by age, those handicapped in one way or another through physical or mental ailment and those suffering from deprivation proceeding from economic or social causes.</P>
    <P>Throughout our society in general there has been a growing awareness in recent years of the problems of such persons and groups of such persons and an increasing urge to take some practical steps towards meeting their needs. Some have found it possible to provide such services through the traditional voluntary agencies such as the St. Vincent de Paul Society or organisations which have a history of helping specific groups of people to live a better life.  Others, particularly the young, have found outlets for their idealism in newly founded organisations providing specific services for groups whose needs have hitherto been unidentified or for whom no practical activity has in the past been undertaken. One thinks in this connection of such organisations as the Samaritans and the Simon Community which have been doing most valuable work for the dropouts from our society.  There are many also who have found that their contribution can best be made in a general purpose such as a social service council or a community association whose primary function is to co-ordinate the activities of voluntary agencies in a particular area and to ensure that, by avoiding duplicating or parallel developments of similar activities, available voluntary resources are used to the best advantage, for the good of the under-privileged in our community.</P>
    <P>In all of these organisations there are those concerned who try to see the whole picture, the most desirable pattern into which to weave the many differing strands of voluntary work. The National Social Service Council will, I hope, be of great assistance in <Col N="1016" /> local areas in which there develops, among those engaged in voluntary activity, an awareness of the need to make their activity more effective through co-operation and co-ordination. It will be able, when it has settled down and recruited some staff, to provide specialised advice and assistance in an area in which, without such assistance, much time and effort could be wasted.  The council will also be able to provide for voluntary organisation in the social service field an information service which will keep them abreast of developments in the statutory services and inform the voluntary agencies of the schemes and assistance and the help which can be made available by central and local statutory bodies.</P>
    <P>It should also help in the important function of promoting sensitivity to social need and a desire to meet it. These are practical short-term steps which must be taken during the next year to improve the impact of voluntary endeavour on the problems of our society.  There is also the broader, more general question of the total role of voluntary activity in the solution of social problems with which society is faced.  We must try to develop a clear view of the respective roles of the State and other organisations; we must harmonise them and see that each component of the global effort to help the disadvantaged plays its part.  We must develop an accepted attitude towards the extent to which the State should subsidise and financially assist voluntary organisations in discharging their activities.  We must try to be clear on how best to encourage people to become involved in social activity in their communities and on the steps which can most appropriately be taken to achieve the defined aims.</P>
    <P>All of these are matters which can legitimately be considered by the National Social Service Council but this is not, of course, the only body concerned with the evolution of a philosophy in this field.  One such body recently established, for instance, is the Council for Social Welfare, appointed by the Catholic Hierarchy, which is considering broad general questions in this field in order to advise the Catholic <Col N="1017" /> Hierarchy of the steps which the church might appropriately take.  Incidentally, I am glad to tell the House that, at my invitation, three members of that council are also serving on the National Council.  I may also mention that I have been glad to note that the council recently held a conference on poverty which was attended by a widely representative body of people and at which there was a most useful dialogue on the subject of poverty.</P>
    <P>A number of other national bodies are also actively concerned in the field of community social service and there is, of course, the pending reorganisation of the local government structure under which proposals have been made which would result in greater participation by communities in the evolution of local government policy.</P>
    <P>All this shows a welcome apppreciation of the need for involvement of individuals and the general body of the public in the direction of our society and in the solution of its social problems. I think that the next two or three years will be a time of great development in this field and one during which, I hope, it will be possible to achieve advances, if not solutions, to many outstanding social problems which will find a general acceptance among all those, whether at central government, local government, church or voluntary level, who are involving themselves in the attempt to push forward towards the completion of what is, to my mind, a most pressing task.</P>
    <P>I have frequently, in this House and outside, expressed my sincere thanks to the very great numbers involved in providing unpaid service to the community through membership of bodies set up under the aegis of my Department.  It may come as a surprise to many Deputies to learn that there are some 30 such bodies with membership of from 30 plus down to ten.  I have in the course of this speech mentioned some of them, the National Social Service Council for instance.  My failure to mention others does not arise from any lack of appreciation of the tremendous service which they render to the community, a service which, if it were to be paid for, would cost the taxpayers and the ratepayers a vast <Col N="1018" /> sum of money annually.  And here I can say also that since I became Minister for Health I have had occasion to invite large numbers of persons to serve, unpaid, I should stress, on such bodies and I could count on the fingers of one hand the number who declined my invitation. Further, in no case that I can remember was an invitation declined without a very good reason.  To all of them I again offer my thanks.</P>
    <P>Apart from those who are serving on the various bodies established under my Department's aegis, I must also pay warm tribute to the religious orders who faithfully continue the age-old practice of charitable service for their fellow citizens.  There is no area of the country in which members of these orders are not to be found, working in our general hospitals, in homes for the mentally handicapped&mdash;perhaps the most exacting but equally the most spiritually valuable form of personal service one could give&mdash;in geriatric hospitals and in social service.  And in mentioning social service I also express sincere appreciation of the work of the hundreds of good lay folk who are doing noble and most useful work for people in social need through the channel of community social service organisations, whether as members of voluntary charitable organisations, as public officers, or as simple lay men and women without formal affiliations. All these are making a most worthwhile contribution towards the health and well-being of the less fortunately circumstanced.  We are very much in their debt.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health, I would naturally like to advance at twice the pace actually accomplished.  At the same time, I offer to the House this year a report indicating real and substantial progress in all branches of the service and specific sanctioned plans for progress in the coming year.</P>
    <P>If I were asked to give my No. 1 priority I would answer&mdash;the development of social service councils throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1019" /> First of all, I wish to thank the Minister and the officials of his Department for the very useful notes circulated to us over the past few months and for the wealth of information the Minister has given us in the speech he has just concluded.  I am quite sure that the Deputies of every party will join with me in saying a sincere word of thanks to him and his officials for their invaluable assistance to us.</P>
    <P>The figure we are now debating here is quite a sizeable one, and that is an understatement.  The Minister's Estimate for this year is for £83 million, and it is strange but true that over 80 per cent of the people who are paying for the service are dissatisfied with it. The amount of money provided for health services by way of taxation and rates has gone beyond the stage of being described as staggering and frightening.  It behoves all of us here to examine this figure critically to see if it needs to be pruned, to see if good value is being obtained for it and, if not, to correct that.</P>
    <P>The charges on the rates for health services have gone so high that a change is urgently demanded.  It is not so long ago that the Minister said here in this House that it was his belief that if the charges for health services continued to increase as they were increasing, by 1980 the cost of the health services would be doubled.  If that is so, we must tackle this problem now to see how those charges can be met. Every ratepayer knows that the largest single item on his rates bill relates to health charges.  In practically all local authorities the health charges represent something between one-third and one-half of the total rates bill.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that great strides have been made in recent years in the development and improvement of the health services.  It is the enormous cost of that expansion which is giving rise to concern.  The most worrying aspect of the whole thing is that 70 per cent of the population pay 50 per cent of the cost for the 30 per cent who possess medical cards.  We all know that local authorities have, for some years, been pointing out to the Minister <Col N="1020" /> that they were unable to accept the increases for health charges on the rates.  There was nothing the local authorities could do about it because it is a statutory imposition on them. Some years ago the Minister made an attempt to stabilise health charges on the rates but this was a failure.  I am glad to see that the Minister, this year, has done something better.  He has fixed the health charges on the rates to be not more than 30p in the £.</P>
    <P>I read in one of the daily papers that in County Leitrim the rates are increasing by something like 94p in the £.  It is not any consolation to those people to know that the health charges on the rates are being fixed at 30p in the £ because there are other elements on rates which materially affect the pockets of those people.  The rates in North Cork for 1971-72, which is the area in which I pay my rates, were £5.69.  Health charges accounted for £2.23 of that figure.  Many people who will be called to pay big increases in rates this year will not be able to do so. Families who are already hard-pressed to manage their budgets are quite unprepared to meet those new charges. The cost of living is rising daily and an increase of £1 in the £ on the rates means for a person who lives in a house with £12 valuation that he will have to pay an extra 50p in the week.  We should seriously consider removing health charges from the rates.</P>
    <P>A white paper on local government was issued recently and it appeared to me that the reorganisation of the local government services deliberately dodged the question of rates.  We are now promised another white paper from the Minister for Local Government on the financing of local authorities and I hope before it sees the light of day that the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health will come together on it and take into account the comments I have just made.</P>
    <P>In Fine Gael we regard the health charges on the rates so seriously that there is on the Order Paper at the present moment a motion in my name and that of some other Deputies of my Party which states:</P>
    <P>That, in view of the recent increase <Col N="1021" /> in rates (20 per cent in the past year) of which health service costs are becoming such an oppressive feature and the fact that the administration of these services has now passed from county council control, Dáil Éireann is of opinion that the cost of these services should now be met from central government sources.</P>
    <P>When this motion is being discussed in the House, if the Minister has not already made up his mind on it, he will then see the justice of the case we make and our plea that the health charge should be removed from the rates.</P>
    <P>I have previously appealed to the Minister that home assistance officers who spend most of their time working for health boards on health matters and who are being paid by local authorities should be put on the payroll of the health boards where 50 per cent recoupment could be got on their salaries.  I hope the Minister will have another look at what I regard as an injustice to the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that many people do not realise the extent to which the Exchequer meets the health services. He quoted figures and said that in most cases 75 per cent of the charges were recouped by the Exchequer.  He admitted&mdash;this is where the exception comes in&mdash;that in certain towns and cities the health rates form a higher proportion than that figure.  I have already pointed out the percentage that obtains in Cork County and the town of Fermoy, from which I come.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Minister that health services are costing this year £28 per head of the population.  I was interested to note in something I read over the weekend that the figure in England per head of the population is £36.  While we are much lower than Britain in that regard we still have per head of the population to carry a very heavy burden.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister introduced a Bill into this House known as the Health (Contributions) Act, 1971.  The contributions that were imposed on 1st October on insured workers were 15p per week and there was a levy of £7 put on farmers whose valuation was under £60, those people and others <Col N="1022" /> who are known as the limited eligibility group.  I remember saying in the House then that I believed that to be the first of the mini-budgets of 1971. It is true to say that that description was reasonably accurate.  The Minister says that he hopes to collect £5 million by this exercise.  It is true that he is losing something between £750,000 and £850,000 in not collecting the 10s per day from people in hospital who come into that category. What has become of the £5 million? Has the Minister taken that figure to ease the £7,390,000 in the second Supplementary Estimate we are discussing? The Minister should tell us exactly where the £4,250,000 he has gained by the introduction of the Health (Contributions) Act, which came into force on 1st October last, will be spent.  I am speaking about the cost of the health services and I hope I have made the case, in my own simple way, for changing the financing of the health services from rates to general taxation.</P>
    <P>I have already said in this House that I was not altogether happy with the functioning of the health boards. Now that they have been working for practically one year we may have a better opportunity of judging them. Perhaps I judged them prematurely here some months ago.  Though I am a member of a local authority, I am not a member of a health board and anything I say is not intended as a criticism of the personnel of any of them.  I shall comment on what I have read of them.</P>
    <P>Since the first day the health boards were set up there has been pulling, dragging and tearing going on in one direction or another.  I saw it in the case of the Southern Health Board.  I read about it in regard to the other health boards.  In the first instance there was dragging, pulling and tearing as to where the headquarters of the boards should be located.  That argument went on between the members of the local authorities who comprised the different health boards.  We were told then, and I said it in this House, that some methods were being used to get people to make their decisions as to <Col N="1023" /> where the health boards should be, methods that were not what we would like and which certainly were not parliamentary.</P>
    <P>When the headquarters were finally decided there was pulling and tearing as to who was who with regard to staff.  Naturally when there was a health board comprising County Kerry, County Cork and Cork city, human nature being what it is and with the healthy rivalry that has always existed between Cork and Kerry, there was bound to be some pulling, dragging and tearing as to who was to be staff officer, who was to be chief officer, who was to be programme manager and now they are talking about something that I cannot understand&mdash;evolution managers.</P>
    <P>All this having been settled, the health boards now appear to be in worse trouble than ever because when it comes to the striking of the rate the Kerry people do not accept the Cork people's proposals; the Cork county people do not accept Cork city's proportion of it; the Cork city people naturally do not understand people like Mr. Martin Corry and myself.  The dragging and tearing is still going on with regard to who will pay and for what and how much.</P>
    <P>I forecast here six or seven months ago that all this would happen and while that is going on the Minister has not yet decided on the apportionment of rates to be paid by any of those local authorities within the health board area.  Now an arbitrator is to decide on them.  All this does not add up to good administration.  For that and other reasons, which I shall mention later, I think the Minister should have another look at the organisation of health boards.  I read in today's <i>Cork Examiner,</i> when coming up on the train, that at a meeting of the Southern Health Board held in the Cork County Hall yesterday the programme manager, giving an account of the set-up of the board for community care, a very desirable and admirable thing I accept, went to great lengths to point out that Kerry, for community care, should be taken as one region and that Cork city and <Col N="1024" /> Cork county should be taken as a second region.  That is bringing us back to the stage we were at before the health boards were set up on 1st April, 1971.  I wonder is this an indication of things to come.  Do coming events cast their shadows before them?</P>
    <P>I read that the Minister said recently that the extra cost involved in the setting up and running of those health boards would be in the region of £200,000.  He also represented that as something like a halfpenny in the £ on the rates.  I find it difficult to believe, from what I observe going on with regard to those health boards, that their cost will be limited to anything like the figure the Minister suggests, not that I am doubting the figure, but they are appointing programme managers and evolution managers and as a member of a local authority for the past 22 years I know that when you set up any new department within a local authority, even with the best intention of any manager, it will snowball into more and more offices and more and more expensive personnel. That is why I am sceptical about the future and the cost and when we speak in terms of £83 million we should stop and take note.  I accept the Minister's statement that administration and staff charges are responsible for practically 50 per cent of the entire cost.  Is that not another reason why we should be more careful to reduce staff costs, if anything, rather than recruit more people?  We should call a halt now before it is too late.</P>
    <P>I read in the newspaper last week, on the day on which the Minister was paying such nice compliments to the health boards here, that a member of the Southern Health Board whose name was given as Mr. James Courtney, a Kerry representative, was calling for the dissolution of the Southern Health Board.  I shall tell later how another member of the board called for the same thing at a meeting of that board in the County Hall in Cork yesterday.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat disappointed in relation to the question of medical cards. The Minister said in the Dáil in October or November last, and we were all very pleased to hear it, that he proposed <Col N="1025" /> to have the whole matter reviewed with the intention of setting up new standards.  He was talking about the Draft Health Services (Limited Eligibility) Regulations.  He said:</P>
    <P>I hope also to include in these regulations a provision fixing income standards for full eligibility, that is, for the category who are entitled to medical cards.  After detailed and careful study of the matter, I have come to the conclusion that as circumstances other than the purely financial vary so much between country and town and between one family and another, I should not at this stage make regulations on such standards but rather to leave to it the chief executive officers of the eight health boards to try to achieve the greatest practical uniformity in their decisions on eligibility.  I am arranging for my Department to bring the chief executive officers together with a view to working out a formula for achieving maximum unity of approach.  The reduction from 27 to eight in the number of bodies responsible for the operation of the health services should facilitate a reasonable degree of consensus in this matter.</P>
    <P>He went on to describe the information the CEOs had at their disposal. At that time I commented that I did not think it would work and that the Minister was failing in his responsibility by not making a decision on common standards that would be applicable to all the health boards.</P>
    <P>Since then, the CEOs of the eight boards met and my information is that they did not express any common opinion as to who should and should not have medical cards.  The Minister himself should make those regulations and in that way lay down guidelines for a common standard in respect of all health authorities.</P>
    <P>Talking about medical cards, by design or otherwise it looks to me as if an attempt is being made to take cards from people who had them heretofore. This is being done on the ground of income.  It is interesting to see the percentage of people in the different areas who possessed medical cards on 30th November, 1971.  In Cork, 26.8 per cent <Col N="1026" /> of the population had medical cards; in Kerry the figure was 44 per cent; in Galway, 50.9 per cent; Roscommon, 50.6; Dublin, 12.5; Limerick, 28.9; Donegal, 42.9; the average for the country being 29 per cent.  Do those figures not suggest to the Minister that there is a glaring case for him and the Department to lay down guidelines instead of leaving it to the CEOs to decide who should and should not have medical cards?</P>
    <P>One case in respect of which I am sure is the Southern Health Board.  The earnings of a person who can still qualify there have been raised since 11th January last.  I wonder whether other Members of the House would be interested in what is happening in this respect in the Southern Health Board area.  I have here a document headed Southern Health Board, Bord Sláinte an Deisceart.  It refers to guidelines on standards of eligibility for medical cards.  In paragraph (a) it states that persons in the following classes and dependants of such persons may be regarded as eligible for health cards: persons in receipt of the following pensions or allowances under the Social Welfare Acts and Health Acts, that is, old age care allowances, old age non-contributory pensions, widows' non-contributory pensions, orphans' non-contributory pensions, deserted wives' allowances, blind pensions, infectious diseases maintenance allowances and disabled persons' maintenance allowances. The last one is understandable and to be commended.</P>
    <P>In paragraph (b), the circular relates to other persons whose incomes do not exceed the following limits: a single person living alone, £13 per week; a single person living with his family, £10 per week; a man and wife, £16.50 per week.  There are allowances of 75p per week for each dependent child.  Allowance is also given in respect of outgoings in excess of £1.25 per week.  In Cork city an allowance of £1 per week is made for married persons.  In paragraph (c) it states that hardship cases are to be dealt with on individual merit. All medical cards in future are to be for a fixed term not exceeding one year.</P>
    <P>That document is signed W. MacEvilly, Chief Executive Officer. <Col N="1027" /> The same Mr. MacEvilly was one of those who appealed to the Minister and expressed publicly his opinion that the Minister is the person who should give the guidelines.  In fairness to him, I regard Mr. Walter MacEvilly as a first-class official and a most conscientious man who has done a reasonably good job.  However, since that formula was published a number of people who had medical cards have had them taken away.  We seen to be forgetting that although wages are high they have to be increased to meet the spiralling cost of living and that persons on fixed wages are less well off now than they were two years ago.  Therefore, I suggest that, though the figures I have quoted were meant to be reasonable, they will make things very difficult for several people.  Accordingly I appeal again to the Minister to have another look at this.  It will require some courage on his part because it may be an unpopular decision but I know the Minister is not afraid to make unpopular decisions and I have always admired him for that.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister referred to his intention to introduce legislation with regard to drug addiction and control.  A few weeks ago a First Reading to a Bill introduced by Deputy Byrne and myself was refused.  Our Bill referred to this very important matter.  I am glad to note from what the Minister said that his Bill contains practically all the points which were written into the Bill to which Deputy Byrne and I penned our names.</P>
    <P>I am not at all satisfied that the Minister fully appreciates the nature of the drug problem.  If he does, he is certainly taking his time in dealing with it.  Last week when the Taoiseach was asked about the Bills which he thought would come before the Dáil before the Easter recess he did not mention the Bill which the Minister referred to in his speech.  I hope that the Minister, when replying, will tell us whether that is so.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago I said that the problem of drug-taking in this country is increasing.  It has assumed frightening proportions.  The Report of the Working Party on Drug Abuse is now <Col N="1028" /> 12 months old.  It contained a serious warning.  Some of the suggestions of improvements and cautions mentioned in that report have been considered by the Minister. There is no doubt that much remains to be done about this problem.  This problem was mentioned in the House a fortnight ago and the following Sunday I came across <i>The Sunday Press</i> which contained a heading right across the top of the page: &ldquo;Heroin spreading in Dublin. Smuggled from London, says Drug Squad.&rdquo;  The article goes on to describe what is happening here and the attempts being made by the Garda drug squad to cope with the situation. We all see from the papers what is happening in other countries in regard to the use, abuse, sale and distribution of drugs.  A young boy of 14 was sentenced to jail for many years.  I do not approve of his sentence, but this gives some idea of the magnitude of the problem outside this country.  In these days of sophisticated and easy travel, what happens in Europe or America today could well happen in Ireland tomorrow.  There is a real element of urgency in regard to this problem.  I read recently that 90 persons per month are attending special drug clinics in Dublin.  We are told that the drug problem now embraces several provincial centres and that the use of cannabis is now spreading to Cork, Galway and Kilkenny.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Barry from Cork raised this problem when we were discussing the Estimate for the Department of Education.  The Deputy showed me a letter which he had got from 15 students attending a secondary school in Cork city who asked him to raise the matter in the Dáil.  These young people were aware of what was going on around them.  This is frightening. It is alarming that youngsters of 15 years are themselves writing to their Dáil Deputy about such a matter.  They are the people who know what is going on.  They see what is happening all around them.  Their action must serve as a serious warning that time is running out and that we should take the problem in hand forthwith.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister when introducing <Col N="1029" /> legislation will include in his Bill penalties similar to those which were referred to in the Bill which Deputy Byrne and myself attempted to bring before the House.  At the Fianna Fáil Árd-Fheis a few weeks ago the Minister, according to a report which I read in the <i>Cork Examiner</i>, described drug-taking as a sub-culture and said that he could not stop it.  He felt that all he could do was try to contain it and that he was drafting new legislation. The drug squad do their best and are hard-pressed in coping with the increasing drug circulation.  The increase in the drug squad is still being considered by the Minister for Justice. The Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice should have a serious discussion about this matter. An early decision should be arrived at as to how the problem should be tackled.  There are many parents throughout the country who are deeply disturbed about drug-taking and its problems.  They are inclined to lose patience with the Minister who is taking too long to introduce legislation dealing with the control and distribution of drugs.  Before the Minister gets an opportunity to reply to this debate I hope that he will introduce legislation to control the use, abuse, pushing and distribution of drugs.</P>
    <P>The Minister described at length the hospital building and the hospital improvement programmes.  The figures he has given us are quite impressive.  They refer to the improvement and extension of hospitals throughout the country. We all accept that a real attempt is being made to provide more and improved accommodation for our people who must go to hospital.  The Minister should be assured of the willingness of the public to provide this money.  At some stage most families have the experience of seeing one member of their household going to hospital.  They see for themselves the hard work and dedication of the hospital's staff.  They see the conditions under which the nurses work.  We should press on strenuously with the completion of the hospital building and improvement programmes.</P>
    <P>This brings me to a subject about which I shall have some harsh criticisms <Col N="1030" /> to make, namely, the position with regard to Mallow Hospital in my constituency.  I am glad that the Minister is present and if I say anything incorrect I would ask him to let me know.  The proposal to downgrade Mallow Hospital and to close its major surgical unit was defeated by a majority vote of the Southern Health Board in the County Hall, Cork, on 6th December, 1971.  The proposal was defeated by 19 votes to eight votes.</P>
    <P>That was the result of a long and strenuous campaign conducted by a committee which was known as the Retention of the Mallow Hospital Committee.  That committee had worked for the previous 12 months in consultation and co-operation with the different public bodies and voluntary organisations throughout north Cork.  On the committee there were people of all political persuasions, of different organisations, and of different religious creeds, and they were from an area which contains some 70,000 people in north and north-east Cork. When it transpired that there was a suggestion in the FitzGerald Report that the Mallow County Hospital, like others, might lose its major surgical unit they commenced their campaign.</P>
    <P>They were convinced of the severe and unnecessary hardship which would be caused to people in that large area. The campaign took the form of meetings and parades; there was a petition signed by some 12,000 people and practically every organisation and association in the area sent representatives to the many public meetings held during 1971.</P>
    <P>The Institutional Care Committee of the Southern Health Board, one of three Committees in the board, considered the proposals for downgrading Mallow Hospital at a meeting which was held in committee.  It aroused great interest in the locality, especially among those who had fought strenuously to upgrade the hospital.  Although the decision of the Institutional Care Committee could only be a recommendation to the Southern Health Board there was tremendous interest in the outcome.</P>
    <P>It is only right to say that the general view in the area was that the <Col N="1031" /> Minister would not interfere.  On at least two occasions, Deputy Tom Meaney, who is close to the Minister, said in public that the final decision rested with the health board and he was so quoted in the public Press.  He said the Minister could not reject the decision of the health board because such rejection would be tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the board and the Minister would have no option but to dissolve it.  Subsequently Deputy Meaney was joined at a meeting of the Northern Committee of Cork County Council, at which I was present, by a Fianna Fáil county councillor, Mr. Jerry Fitzpatrick who expressed the same view and said the Minister would save the day.  It is only fair to say that at a meeting of the same committee held in the same county council office on Friday, 25th February, 1972, both Deputy Meaney and Councillor Fitzpatrick admitted that they had made these statements at the December meeting.</P>
    <P>A few days before the important meeting to which I have referred was held in the Cork County Hall on 6th December, the Minister for Defence&mdash; who represents north-east Cork with other Deputies and myself&mdash;who resides in Mallow, and Senator O'Callaghan, a Fianna Fáil Senator who resides outside Mallow town, spoke in favour of the upgrading of Mallow Hospital and the retention of the major surgical unit for the hospital. They wrote a well-worded letter to the <i>Cork Examiner</i> and to the <i>Corkman</i> an I shall quote an extract from that letter.  I hope I can find the newspaper because it makes interesting reading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the letter here; I shall not read it in its entirely because it may not be relevant to the debate.  The letter appeared in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 3rd December, 1971, and in the <i>Corkman</i> on 4th December, 1971.  It reads as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the great public concern and disquiet caused by the <Col N="1032" /> proposal to close the surgical unit at Mallow County Hospital, we feel it necessary to state our views clearly in regard to this proposal. The surgical unit at Mallow has given an entirely satisfactory service to the needs of the area it serves. Since it was first set up as a surgical hospital, it has catered for as many as 2,500 cases of major and minor surgery in one 12 month period.  The service it gives to the public of this area will not easily be replaced.  Up to the present time the surgical units at Mallow County Hospital and at Mount Alvernia Hospital catered for the county area north of Cork city.  Together these hospitals are capable of accommodating approximately 150 patients and have done so adequately up to this time.</P>
    <P>It is the experience of many who have sought admission to Cork hospitals that frustrating and dangerous delays are very often experienced in gaining admission to them due to the already overtaxed bed situation in city hospitals.  Severe stress would be imposed on the already heavily burdened bed situation by the closing of both surgical units at Mallow. We are adamant that these surgical units must be maintained to provide a full surgical and medical service both now and in the future for those who are presently serviced by these hospitals.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the plan for the provision of surgical services for the Cork/Kerry area entails the provision of a comprehensive regional hospital in Cork and an equally elaborate hospital in Tralee. The building of the Cork hospital is about to start but, because of the size of the project, it must be a considerable period before it is ready for use.  Considerable extensions have to take place at the Tralee hospital and these are not scheduled for completion for many years.</P>
    <P>I am coming to the concluding and most important part of the letter:</P>
    <P>Mallow is a point centre to Cork and Tralee.  It has many obvious <Col N="1033" /> advantages for the extension and co-ordinated development of surgical and medical services for the very big area it serves.  If both hospitals in Mallow are fully integrated, two surgeons, two physicians and a full complementary staff could be maintained here, thus giving a full-time service to all those in the area who need it.  Any attempt to close both of the surgical units at Mallow and to transfer the surgical patients to other hospitals already heavily taxed for bed space, must be opposed by everyone who is concerned about the administration of an adequate health service in this area.</P>
    <P>This letter was signed by Jerry Cronin, T.D., Minister for Defence, Main Street, Mallow, and Kevin O'Callaghan, Senator, Eden Hill, Mallow.  That letter more than any words of mine gives the true position with regard to the needs of the 70,000 persons involved here for the retention and upgrading of the surgical unit at Mallow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, the description &ldquo;simple&rdquo; is an oversimplification. I want to explain what happened subsequent to the publication of this letter, within the last week or ten days.  The majority and democratic decision of the Southern Health Board was made and the recommendation sent to the Minister for Health, that Mount Alvernia should be purchased and integrated with the Mallow County Hospital&mdash;Mount Alvernia is a hospital about three miles from Mallow&mdash;and that the two hospitals should be upgraded. After some few weeks, when <Col N="1034" /> there was no reply, Deputy Phil Burton from Mid-Cork and I tabled a question to the Minister in the House asking him if he had yet made a decision with regard to integrating Mount Alvernia and Mallow and upgrading them.  The extent of the Minister's reply was that he had caused a letter to be sent to the Southern Health Board and that he would not like to discuss it further until the health board had seen and discussed the letter.</P>
      <P>The health board discussed the letter only yesterday but when I pressed the Minister on that occasion in the Dáil for the gist of the reply he had sent he said that there was nothing sensational in it.  I can assure him that the people of North Cork and North-East Cork did not look at it in the same tame way as the Minister did.  They thought and still think that there is something really sensational in it and they intend to make that known to the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of reading in full the letter the Minister wrote back and which has been published in the various papers but the gist of it is that, in any case, the Minister does not believe that the Mallow hospital should be upgraded and integrated with Mount Alvernia.  In fact, he suggests that the Southern Health Board should possibly acquire Mount Alvernia Hospital and use it as a psychiatric unit.  Like him I have no doubt, and neither has Deputy Healy who is sitting behind the Minister any doubt, of the need for more room for the treatment of psychiatric cases but to bring that need into this issue was just a damp squib.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my belief.  The Minister says in his letter that it may not be easy to integrate the two hospitals because of the distance of three miles from Mallow County Hospital, out the road as I would call it, to Mount Alvernia.  Does the Minister not agree that the people who live in Ballydesmond, 40 miles from Mallow and 60 miles from Cork city, would be much more satisfied to have a surgical unit available to them in Mallow than to have to travel from Ballydesmond through Mallow to Cork city and have <Col N="1035" /> to pass through all the traffic in Cork city in order to get to the new regional hospital to be built at Wilton?  Does he think that that would be fair to them? The Minister says that the Southern Health Board should have another look at this whole proposal, he, having completely turned down the recommendation that they made.</P>
      <P>That brings me back to the point I made some minutes ago as to the usefulness or otherwise of the health boards.  Have we now reached the stage when their decisions may be so easily changed by the Minister for Health and his Department?</P>
      <P>When the Southern Health Board met yesterday they had something to say about this problem.  I have before me today's issue of the <i>Irish Independent.</i> A banner headline in regard to a discussion the Southern Health Board had on this problem in Cork County Hall yesterday says: &ldquo;Rubber Stamp Status Angers Board.&rdquo;  Why would it not?  Is it a fact now that any decision the health board makes can be rubber-stamped by the Minister and his Department?</P>
      <P>I was a member of a deputation that attended at the Cork County Hall on 6th December, when this majority decision was taken.  I have been a member of a local authority since September, 1960, and I have never yet seen a more representative or larger deputation than that which attended that meeting.  It was representative of all classes and creeds.  The Southern Health Board heard three members of that deputation.  They put their case in a sensible, plain and clear manner and they impressed the board, if they were not impressed previously, to the extent that they voted 19 to eight in favour of upgrading Mallow Hospital.  Everyone was pleased and people in the town of Mallow and in the hospital were particularly pleased.  We saw photographs in the following day's paper of the nurses and staff dancing around a bonfire on their return home, but their celebrations have turned into misery because they are still in doubt about their future and the people who depended on the hospital for so many years are still very much in doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> I want to suggest that since the eminent surgeon we had in Mallow for years, Mr. Henley, left some months ago and went to Tralee County Hospital, Mallow Hospital as a surgical unit has been floundering.  The belief down there, and it is my belief also, is that this is the way the Minister and the Department want it.  Temporary surgeons are coming and going and eventually it will work out all right for the Minister and the Department because if that situation continues, the number of people looking for beds there will be diminishing and then their case will be, possibly in a few years time, that the bed population in Mallow Hospital does not warrant the appointment of a surgeon there in any case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to intervene because he has cast doubt on the veracity of the Minister for Defence and Deputy Meaney in regard to the point they made, that it was a decision for the health board.  I told them that the position in Mallow Hospital was a decision of the health board at a time when I assumed that either the health board would adopt the principles of the FitzGerald Report in regard to Mallow or the <i>status quo</i> would remain, pending the building of the Cork Regional Hospital and an examination of all the proposals in the FitzGerald Report in detail by the regional health board, by the hospital boards yet to be set up, the health boards and the county advisory committees. I did not conceive at the time, and I said to Deputy Meaney and the Minister for Defence that it was a decision for the health board, that there would be a proposal for the upgrading of Mallow hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I simply cannot accept as national policy the upgrading of a hospital in the area where Mallow is.  I can accept it remaining for surgical purposes for a future period; I can accept it being integrated according to the FitzGerald proposals and changed into being a hospital run by medical doctors, obstetricians and gynaecologists, but I cannot accept in any area a deliberate reversal of the proposals in the FitzGerald Report.  Therefore, when I <Col N="1037" /> spoke to the Minister for Defence and to Deputy Meaney, I was speaking correctly because I just did not conceive that the final proposal would be an upgrading and not either the <i>status quo</i> or else proposals on the lines of the FitzGerald Report, so that they were not deceiving anybody and I was not deceiving them.  I hope the Deputy appreciates that.  At the conclusion of my letter I say that if the health board are not willing to consider again the proposals of the chief executive officer they can consider the preservation of Mallow Hospital for surgical purposes in its present form.  The Deputy will realise that that is in the letter.</P>

      <P>I want to assure the Minister that not for a moment do I doubt his veracity, or the veracity of the Minister for Defence or Deputy Meaney.  I was simply repeating what they said and I would like that to be accepted.  The Minister says that he cannot accept that Mallow Hospital should retain its status or should be what the people of North Cork wanted it to be, a surgical unit where, between itself and Mount Alvernia, two surgeons would be employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly the position.  It is no wonder they were incensed when they read the Minister's letter because they really had legitimately believed and accepted that all their troubles were over, after years of hard work and agitation and protest meetings in the town hall and in private. They believed that everything for them was right and that they had attained what they believed to be their civil rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I learned a very valuable lesson from it because I have learned that in connection with these controversies, I must now advise health boards where there are hospitals in this position, that whatever they do, I simply will not accept an enlargement of a hospital in an area where there is a general reconsideration of the service.  I can accept a hospital retaining its status but I simply could not accept going into FitzGerald in reverse, in the opposite direction, and I learned a valuable lesson from this because I did not really believe that a proposal would emerge, not for the <i>status quo</i> but for an enlargement of the surgical facilities.  I was innocent enough to believe this was not possible and if I had believed it was possible, I would have perhaps prevented misunderstanding by clarifying the position.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has learned a valuable lesson from all this, I assure him that the 70,000 people in north and north-east Cork have had a real stinging from the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>There is another thing which annoyed these people, and the retention committee members in particular, who have taken such a keen interest in this matter&mdash;the letter, dated 24th February, 1972, addressed to the secretary of the retention committee.  That letter reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1039" /> With reference to your letter of 1st February, 1972, regarding the representations of the north Cork committee for the retention of Mallow County Hospital, in respect of the proposed competition for the above-mentioned post, I am to state that the Commissioners are unable to proceed with the competition due to circumstances outside their control.</P>
    <P>This, by the way, was the plea that was made for the appointment of a permanent surgeon to Mallow Hospital, but the Civil Service Commissioners wrote this letter on 24th February, to the town clerk, who was the secretary of the retention committee, so it does mean, in effect&mdash; and this has brought it out more clearly than anything else&mdash;that even the proposal or expectation of a permanent surgeon being appointed there is now stymied through something outside the control of the Local Appointment Commissioners.  It is true to say that the Minister last week &mdash;I saw a report of this in some paper, and we can only learn from reports because we can get nothing direct from the Minister&mdash;met Deputy Meaney and others and said that he was prepared to sanction a permanent appointment there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>They made the Minister <Col N="1040" /> realise something last week.  I hope that what I am saying here will make him realise that these people are not going to accept a downgrading of the hospital.  I believe, and I am not saying this in any threatening way but in the full sense of my responsibility, that I know exactly the way those people feel. The matter is so serious and important to them that in all churches from Ballydesmond on the Cork/Kerry border to Ballynoe at the end of Cork county, a radius of some 60 miles, notices were read out last Sunday saying that a public meeting would be held in Mallow next Saturday night at 8 o'clock to air views and see what the people feel and what they are prepared to do to retain what they believe are their rights and privileges.  This is a public meeting and its size and nature will, I have no doubt, be conveyed to the Minister next week by the Minister from the constituency and the other Fianna Fáil Deputies for the area.</P>
      <P>Very seriously I say I have warned the Minister of the feelings of the people there and I, as one of their representatives, want to make the case for them that they are making outside.  I think that is my duty and I feel so strongly on it that I think it only right to have devoted the time I have given here in the House telling the Minister the nature of their intentions.  Having said that, I appeal to him now in the name of commonsense before the matter escalates into any kind of nasty situation&mdash;God knows we have enough of those without having them in Mallow on our own doorstep, but it is building up in that way&mdash;to have another look at the matter in the interests of the people and in the interests of harmony between the Southern Health Board and the Department.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister say to me now in regard to the appointment of surgeons to Mallow Hospital and in regard to the floundering position in which it now stands since the permanent surgeon, Mr. Henley, who had made a great name for the hospital before he left for Tralee&mdash;the best of luck to him there; the people should be very glad to have him&mdash;that he will leave the hospital now floundering along indefinitely until it comes to the stage in five or six years time when he says that the Regional Hospital in Cork will be available, that it has become so bad that we cannot have it there anyway?  Is that the intention?</P>

      <P>I do indeed.  I do not want to be accused by anybody afterwards of not having warned the Minister. As the representative of the people of north Cork and north-east Cork and recognising their plight I know the taking away of the privileges that they had over the years is not something that will be taken lightly and I appeal again to the Minister to have another talk with his colleagues who represent the area as well as I do and who know as well as, if not better than I do, the feelings of the people of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to the training of nurses.  From time to time we hear there is a shortage of nurses in the country and no doubt it exists.  That is a pity when so many young girls go to England to be trained.  Unfortunately, it is very hard to get them back again. Are we right in this?  This is something I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  To be accepted as a trainee nurse a girl must now have her leaving certificate.  I think this loses the profession many girls.  I know many excellent nurses whose education did not go beyond the primary certificate but because they were suitable nursing material they made very good nurses. To be a good nurse does not necessarily require an extra high standard of education; it involves something much more important, having a way with people, having a good sense of humour and having a good bedside manner.  In view of the shortage of nurses here I think the Minister and the Department should reconsider the conditions imposed on girls who wish to train as nurses, especially the obligation to have the leaving certificate. <Col N="1043" /> I think most Members of the House will agree in that.</P>
    <P>I am not clear on this&mdash;I am sure the Minister is&mdash;but I hope that in regard to the new regional hospital being built in Cork there will be good accommodation and facilities for the training of nurses there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

      <P>At present St. Finbarr's is one of the best training hospitals not only in the country but in the British Isles but, unfortunately, as it stands, only 40 trainees can be taken on each year.  I am glad to hear from the Minister that added accommodation and improved facilities will be available if and when Cork Regional Hospital is completed.</P>
      <P>I was glad the Minister referred to the choice of doctor scheme and pleased to know that this will shortly come into operation in the Eastern Health Board area.  It is only fitting at the commencement of this phase in our health services that we should pay tribute to the dispensary doctors in that area and throughout the country who did such remarkable work over the years and who were always at the disposal of their patients.  They served the community well in the past and at times when conditions for them, as for the rest of us, were not as good as they are now.  It is only right that we should put on record our appreciation of the services they rendered to the public.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred also in his speech to the strike of psychiatric nurses which took place some time ago and of which the Minister appeared to have been rather critical.  Like him, I hope that there will not be a strike by this body of people in the future.  However, on my way home on Thursday evening I noticed a report in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> for that day, March 2nd, headed &ldquo;Mental hospital nurses' dispute&rdquo;.  It read and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Psychiatric nurses of Our Lady's Hospital, Cork, are in dispute with <Col N="1044" /> the management of the hospital because they have not yet received their 13th round wage increase&mdash;of £2 per week which was due on January 1.</P>
    <P>They are further incensed by the management's attitude in asking for increased meal contributions before they pay the 13th Round.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the nurses told the &ldquo;Examiner&rdquo; yesterday that they had no objection to paying increased meal contributions.  &ldquo;At present we pay 35p per day and are asked to pay a further 5p or 10p.  We have no objection to this and we appreciate that rising costs generally have affected food prices.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is the management's attitude in demanding that we pay this increase before they agree to pay us our 13th Round increase that we object to.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>From yesterday the psychiatric nurses were refusing to eat at the hospital until the whole issue is settled.</P>
    <P>A spokesman for the management said that settlement depended on the nurses paying increased meal contributions. He declined to comment when asked why the management had looked for increased meal contributions before paying the £2 per week the nurses are entitled to.</P>
    <P>Have those people not a just cause for complaint if that report is true?  I only mention the matter in passing but it will be seen that in this case, as in any other, there are always two sides to be considered.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note also that the Minister referred at length to the psychiatric services.  I am sure every Member of this House would join with the Minister in expressing hope for the improvement of these services.  Much work remains to be done in this area of health services.  I understand that the problem of overcrowding in the Cork Mental Hospital manifests itself in other hospitals also.  There is a need for a considerable expansion of the diagnostic services, and a greater attempt must be made to provide sheltered workshops and suitable hostel accommodation for <Col N="1045" /> the mentally handicapped.  There is a need also for greater domiciliary attention. A greater effort in this regard could result in fewer people having to be hospitalised.  More short-stay accommodation should be provided and also more out-patient clinics.  Although I have only one particular case in mind I am wondering whether the follow-up visits by social workers or doctors or others is adequate.  Such follow-up is necessary to ensure that when patients leave hospital they continue to take whatever drugs are prescribed for them. Social workers should be in a position to discuss the progress of a patient with his or her relatives.</P>
    <P>Regarding health education, I compliment the Minister for the attention he has given to this matter.  Health education plays an important role in regard both to mental and all other illnesses.  Regarding mental illness, people must be assured that there is effective treatment for the mentally ill in the same way as there is treatment for all other illnesses.  Also, there must be no stigma attached to this illness as there was in the past.</P>
    <P>During the year I asked the Minister a question regarding occupational therapy and in his reply he assured me that he was considering the possibility of improving conditions of pay and promotion of occupational therapists and also that this field was being developed.  However, I see no reference to that in his speech and I mention it now for the purpose of bringing that promise to his mind.</P>
    <P>I have said here that some effort must be made towards cutting the cost of the health service.  I have said that health charges should be met in full by the Exchequer.  I have said also that more than 80 per cent of our people are dissatisfied with the costly health services we are providing.  Of course, it is easy for one to say such things and I might be asked what I would do if I had responsibility in this matter.  In anticipation of somebody making such a remark I have jotted down a few suggestions that might be useful to the Minister and his officials.  The Republic of Ireland has more beds per thousand of the population than has any other country in Europe and hospital beds <Col N="1046" /> are costing between £30 and £80 per week.  That is a startling figure.  We must do everything possible to effect a reduction in the numbers of people going to hospital.  In 1971-72 the total expenditure on hospital services was 70 per cent of the total expenditure of the capital amount for health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In asking for a Second Reading for this Bill I am very glad to have the opportunity of pointing out to the Minister in particular and to the Government in general the need for action now in regard to pollution.  I emphasise the word &ldquo;now&rdquo;.  The facts I hope to bring to the notice of the Minister and his Government during the course of this debate will, I think, show beyond yea or nay that the situation in regard to pollution is rapidly deteriorating. There is no shadow of doubt about that.  Now, unless the Government take action immediately, the problem may become completely out of hand and the monetary resources available to us now may not be available at some period in the future to deal effectively with the problem if we permit it to get out of hand.</P>
      <P>Pollution is not a problem to be dealt with today and forgotten about tomorrow.  Pollution is something which affects the lives of all of us.  It must, therefore, be regarded as a serious matter.  But pollution is something more because it affects not only our own lives but it will seriously affect the lives of generations yet unborn. We owe it to future generations to ensure that they will have an opportunity of growing up in a healthy and happy environment.  According to the Scriptures, faith without good works is death: the affluence people may acquire will be of no avail if their life span is endangered by the environment in which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1047" /> I regard pollution of our natural waterways as a form of violence against mankind.  How would one react if a neighbour were to dump rubbish on one's property?  How would one react if a neighbour poured poisons into one's drinking water?  I am sure there are few of us here who can afford the luxury of a private swimming pool but, if we had a swimming pool and that swimming pool was contaminated by a neighbour, how would we react to that?  Most of us would react very angrily and possibly aggressively in such circumstances. How then can we go on tolerating these self-same acts on a national level?  How should we react to those acts?  We should not, of course, tolerate them both in our own interests and in the interests of those who will come after us.</P>
    <P>We are at the moment in a very favourable position to deal with pollution because 95 per cent of our waterways are under our own control. This is due to our island position.  With goodwill and co-operation on the part of our citizens I believe we can become a very special place in which people can live and enjoy themselves in pleasant surroundings.  The tourist industry has been in the news of late. Through circumstances beyond our control and matters entirely beyond the influence of the present Government the tourist industry is in a very, very serious position.  I believe it is the intention to try to attract tourists to this country.  Apart from that, every Member of the Oireachtas should spend his holidays at home this year. Every Member of the Oireachtas should also encourage and influence those he knows outside this country to come and spend their holidays here. Certain tourists who have come here in the past may be discouraged because of some belief on their part that this country is suffering the same violence as is being suffered unfortunately by those in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
    <P>We should make every effort now to eradicate the pollution of our rivers, lakes and streams.  If we do that we will be able to offer tourists the <Col N="1048" /> unique attraction of bathing, fishing and boating in waters free from pollution. I spoke about goodwill and co-operation.  I believe pollution is a problem which every normal citizen wants to solve.  I appeal to the Government and, in particular, to the Minister to allow the Second Reading of this Bill to go unchallenged or, at least, allow a free vote so that every Deputy can decide for himself, irrespective of party affiliation, whether he should vote for or against the Second Reading of this Bill.  This is not a party political matter.  Granted the names of those supporting the Bill belong to the one party; maybe it would be better if the names of members of the Government Party and the Labour Party had been included. However, I wish to point out that this Bill was first mooted by the National Waters Conservation Association of which I have the honour to be a member and of which other Deputies from the different parties are also members.</P>
    <P>In the actual framing of the Bill I had to seek assistance from senior members of my own party and certain members have appended their names to this Bill as a sign of their goodwill and their wish that this Bill be implemented.</P>
    <P>Most, if not all, Deputies are concerned to maintain high standards of public health and to preserve the amenities that nature has given into our care.  High living standards cannot be divorced from environment.  Can we regard it as progress if Mrs. X possesses a dishwasher which is using polluted water or if someone has a fibreglass boat to carry him through sewage on the coast?  I do not think we can measure progress in terms of people's material possessions.  Progress can better be measured according to the environment in which people live. In this connection I wish to quote from the <i>Sunday Times</i> of 7th September, 1969, in which a true phrase was coined:</P>
    <P>One man's sewer is another man's water supply.</P>
    <P>I wish also to quote from an article by Denis Coughlan in <i>The Irish Times</i> 6th January, 1970, which shows how true that phrase is:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1049" /> Rivers provide most of the tap water in Ireland and in inland communities they take back most of the sewage which is, in the main, untreated.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves if we can afford to allow such a situation to continue. Again, let me quote a statement by Harry Kramer, Director of the Taft Sanitary Engineering Centre in Cincinnati, in <i>Our Polluted Planet</i> which is published by the Ambassador College Research Department in England:</P>
    <P>A few years ago the only waterborne virus diseases were hepatitis and polio-myelitis.</P>
    <P>Today, according to him&mdash;and he is regarded as an authority&mdash;there are over 100 different diseases listed.  The analysis of one American river, the Connecticut, reveals how foul fresh waters can become.  One random sample of the Connecticut disclosed disease bacteria such as typhoid, paratyphoid, cholera, salmonella, tuberculosis, polio, anthrax, tetanus, plus countless other viruses.  That is not all. Repulsive parasitic life forms such as tapeworm, roundworm, hookworm, pinworm and blood flukes were also present in abundance.</P>
    <P>Similar conditions also exist on the other side of the globe.  Disease organisms abound in that beautiful and natural harbour of Sidney in Australia.  The <i>Australian International News Review</i> says: &ldquo;Name your disease&rdquo;, and with very little effort you can catch it merely by going swimming in the harbour or almost anywhere along the coast for 20 miles above and below the city.  Reports of typhoid and paratyphoid organisms have made headlines in Sidney newspapers.</P>
    <P>A form of pollution which is very prevalent in Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland, is pollution from silage.  It has become one of the most persistent forms of pollution and has proved very destructive to fish life in our rivers.  It is contended by two Irish scientists, Mr. T.S. Spillane and Mr. J. O'Shea of the Agricultural Institute&mdash;and again I quote from an article entitled &ldquo;Costing Clean Water&rdquo; by Denis Coughlan in <i>The Irish Times</i><Col N="1050" /> of 6th January, 1970&mdash;that simple equipment costing £4 and using water power, can be used effectively to deal with the menace locally.  I do not think it would be imposing any hardship, and definitely no financial hardship, on farmers were they compelled to install this system in order to deal effectively with silage pollution.</P>
    <P>There is another type of pollution which is common in rural Ireland, that is, from the disposal of animal manure. The same writer says that the oxidisation ditch may provide the answer to this.  Therefore, compelling farmers to adopt methods to deal effectively with the pollution menace would not appear to impose any great financial strain on their resources.</P>
    <P>Salmon and trout waters have always been a source of pride to us. They are a great source of income to the tourist trade as well as being a very valued amenity to the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>Industrial pollution has provided many instances in recent years of the destruction of fish life in our rivers. Industry suspected of guilt were quick enough to make amends and it would seem from this reaction that the possibility of heavy fines might go further to persuade such industries to research ways and means of avoiding a recurrence of this form of pollution.</P>
    <P>Coarse fishing in recent years has been a further tourist attraction and it has created a very prosperous atmosphere in many inland towns.  This thriving attraction has been threatened not alone by river pollution but by inland lake pollution.  The principal cause of this is the seepage of fertilisers which promotes underwater plant growth.  This underwater plant growth uses up the oxygen in the rivers.  If you have a big increase in the growth of plant life naturally it will use up the oxygen and this renders it almost impossible for fish life to exist in those rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>I realise that the problem of pollution like every other problem cannot be fully controlled by legislation, but I think that it calls for the setting up of research teams to investigate remedies and to co-operate with the local <Col N="1051" /> angling associations and other interested parties in an effort to combat this menace.  Special mention should be made of the local angling associations because they are primarily interested in the fish life and in seeing that normal health conditions of rivers are maintained to allow fish to live in them.  Special regard should be had to their demands in this matter.</P>
    <P>Pollution in rural Ireland is mainly from silage and artificial manures, but in the city areas most of the pollution problems are due to effluent from industries.  To those who feel that industry would oppose any legislation being implemented in regard to the control of pollution, I wish to quote from the Newsletter of the Federation of Irish Industries of 13th January, 1970, which stated:</P>
    <P>Then there is the story of the industrialist proposing to set up his slightly noisome process in a certain part of Ireland and his wish to satisfy Government's fear as to the BOD rating of effluent; the Government Department concerned analysed samples sent forward and found them grossly unsatisfactory, whereupon, they were amazed to learn that these were samples not of effluent but of intake.  The story, even if apocryphal, well illustrates industry's double interest in the present concern about the general problem of pollution.  The problem has assumed serious social and health as well as economic implications in some parts of the country already. Clean air and water and a generally more demanding attitude to the conservation of the physical environment are of importance to us all as persons, and, by the same token, although perhaps not to quite the same extent, as potential users of or polluters of the physical environment. A great deal of publicity has been given recently to the sad state of many Irish rivers&mdash;fish have died in some and others are said to be incapable of maintaining any form of life.  Public opinion can very easily look for a scapegoat in industry and ignore the fact that family households by deed and local authorities <Col N="1052" /> by omission are more likely to be the culprits.</P>
    <P>It is two years since we had what was called Conservation Year.  Some people rather humourously referred to it as conservation year.  At the beginning of Conservation Year there was a statement in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 28th February, 1970, headed &ldquo;Authority for Conservation&rdquo;&ldquo;Flanagan's earnest hope&rdquo; and it stated:</P>
    <P>An authority is likely to be established by the end of the year to co-ordinate at national level all activity related to the preservation of the environment.  In Dublin yesterday, Mr. Flanagan, Minister for Lands and Chairman of the National Committee for Conservation Year, said he was convinced that this country could no longer afford to have responsibility for environmental issues spread haphazardly over a whole range of Government Departments and other bodies with no one authority charged with general co-ordination to a definite national plan for management, maintenance and improvement of the natural environment. &ldquo;It is my earnest hope that before 1970 is out, we will have found means of meeting this need&rdquo; Mr. Flanagan told a meeting of TCD's Elizabethan Society.</P>
    <P>This was early 1970 and the Minister for Lands hoped that an environmental ministry would be established in which one particular Department would be concerned with all aspects and not have it spread over seven or eight different Departments and a countless number of different State and semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>A British MP once proclaimed in the House of Commons that it was no longer possible to swim on the English beaches.  He said that all that one could do was to go through the motion of swimming.  The experience of bathers in Dublin Bay last year was on the same lines, in particular in the part of Dublin Bay which I have the honour to represent&mdash;Dollymount Strand, commonly known as the Bull Wall.  Families who for generations enjoyed the swimming facilities there and whose families enjoyed happy <Col N="1053" /> days on this strand are no longer inclined to take their families to Dollymount. Many of them will not allow their children to bathe in this particular stretch of Dublin Bay because of its polluted state.  I have spoken to people who have been in the habit of swimming at the other end of the bay, in Sandycove and such areas, and they have told me that they would now be very reluctant to swim there.  Dublin Bay has reached a very polluted stage. I should like to refer to and praise the attempts of the Dublin Bay Preservation Association to bring this matter to the notice of the public in general and to try to have something done.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bay is just one area which is polluted.  There are others.  Our famous River Liffey is heavily polluted. Somebody passing through Dublin remarked that he knew when he was crossing the Liffey with his eyes shut, that even if he could not see it he could smell it.  The River Tolka in Dublin has also been badly polluted.  I must say there has been a reasonable improvement in this river since Dublin Corporation installed a new pumping station in the Finglas area.  This has helped to some extent to relieve the pollution on the Tolka.  But it still remains a very serious matter and requires a lot of attention.  Not all the effluent from various factories is directed away from the Tolka.  In addition, certain residential areas, if they can be regarded as residential, in close proximity to the Tolka are unable, due to their low lying position, to connect with the main sewer; and it is a known fact that untreated domestic sewage in this year of 1972, goes into the Tolka, which flows through some of the most picturesque parts of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is the aim of this Bill to have one Department responsible for dealing with pollution and matters appertaining thereto.  People are confused about who they should approach or who they should blame for the pollution of rivers or lakes.  Four or five years ago I addressed a parliamentary question to the then Minister for Local Government and he told me that it was entirely outside his sphere and that if I wanted to inquire about this I should <Col N="1054" /> address my inquiries to the sanitary services section of Dublin Corporation. I took his advice and wrote to the sanitary services section about the River Tolka.  They told me that they were not aware of any serious form of pollution or anything being really wrong with the River Tolka except that certain domestic articles such as prams, beds, bicycle frames and parts of cars had been dumped there.  It happened to be a time when the level of the river was low and they felt that when there was rain and a rise in the level of the river everything would be lovely. I got in touch with the medical officer of health and he told me that he was aware of different types of effluent and raw sewage which were flowing into the river.  He said he was fully aware and had been for years of the fact that where the Tolka flows through one of our main tourist attractions in Dublin, the Botanic Gardens, it is highly polluted and smells to high heaven, to use his words.  Where there are several different bodies dealing with a problem you cannot pinpoint or blame any particular body for being responsible and if you want redress you cannot approach any particular body.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, there is also the River Dodder which was heavily polluted but, to give credit where it is due, I am informed that it is now free of pollution. I understand that its pollution in the main was due to effluent from a particular factory&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly.  Whether we are cleaner on the north than the south or <i>vice-versa,</i> we are referring only to Dublin and although we regard Dublin as the capital of the country&mdash;in many ways we in Dublin regard ourselves as the most important people and it used to be said that Dublin Corporation were the premier local authority&mdash;Dublin is very small territorially.  There are rivers all over the country and when I refer to them I hope it does not sound too much like a litany.  I will refer to rivers, lakes and streams which in the last few years have been reported to be polluted heavily.</P>
      <P>In Killarney, for instance, the famous lakes have been polluted by untreated sewage discharged at Rossbeigh.  In Cork Harbour, both channels of the Lee are regarded as being in a stinking mess at low tide in front of and above Cork's renowned City Hall.  In Dungarvan the entire harbour was almost silted from effluent from the town.  The river Arra&mdash;this is worth noting&mdash;was badly polluted by effluent from the urban district council plant.  In 1969, untreated sewage from Mallow and Fermoy and effluent from the beet factory seriously polluted the Blackwater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection, I am informed by the fishery association there that a fishing competition could not be held in Fermoy in 1970 because people felt it would be unjust and malicious on their part to invite anglers to fish in streams which were not capable of sustaining fish life.  In 1969 also, the Barrow had shoals of dead fish between Carlow and Leighlinbridge.  According to <i>The Kerryman,</i> the Feale in <Col N="1056" /> October, 1970, was heavily polluted due to dumping of refuse.  The Martin river at Blarney Castle was so heavily polluted by effluent from piggeries that fish life was extinct.</P>
    <P>In case any Deputy might think this was entirely peculiar to the south in County Monaghan Lough na Glack near Carrickmacross, according to <i>The Sunday Press</i> of 6th June last, was heavily polluted.  We know that Lough Sheelin at the moment is very severely polluted.  Some people say this is mainly due to piggeries.  A heading in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 5th March last states &ldquo;The pigs that may bring death to Lough Sheelin&rdquo;.  There was a photograph of a gentleman with a large fish and the caption read: &ldquo;Pollution spells an end to fine fish like this Lough Sheelin brown trout, shown by Michael McCabe of the Sheelin Shamrock Hotel.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Recently I was asked to go to Mullingar to a meeting summoned by an association very much concerned with the pollution of Lough Ennel. There were also certain technical people concerned.  Lough Ennel is becoming polluted mainly because the Brosna River, which is very heavily polluted, flows into the lake.  I understand that nobody at the meeting, with the exception of one gentleman, was willing to drink water from any part of Lough Ennel within a quarter of a mile of where the Brosna River enters it.</P>
    <P>The Suir has been polluted heavily by the discharge into it of untreated sewage.  An action was brought against the Clonmel Corporation, a local authority from whom one would expect better.  They had attempted to discharge raw sewage into the Suir.  I do not know what the outcome of the law case was. The Barrow and its tributaries particularly the Oweness are heavily polluted by discharge from abattoirs. We all know of the Clare River.  This was polluted by discharge from a beet factory and fish life in it became particularly extinct.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the purpose of the Bill is to get the Government to have some Department responsible for dealing with pollution and I must here refer to a statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister <Col N="1057" /> for Agriculture and Fisheries who said that the matter of pollution had been grossly exaggerated.  I do not for a moment agree with him.  He also said that applications for grants towards the building of new industries or the extension of existing ones were examined from the point of view of preventing pollution and of keeping it at a tolerable level.  He said that officials of the Department and of the county committees of agriculture had been advising farmers on how to treat pollution.  I agree it is a necessary qualification for people looking for grants from the Industrial Development Authority for the setting up of industries that they provide certain facilities for dealing with pollution. This, however, is in no way compulsory. The Parliamentary Secretary pointed this out as a proof that the Government were taking action.  This has been the case and it is as a result of a condition laid down by the IDA over a number of years that this has been so.  It is only to qualify for certain grants that they must do this.  It is not said anywhere that they are prevented from setting up those industries if they do not provide facilities for dealing with pollution.</P>

      <P>I must give people credit.  For many years the standards here were those of the Royal Commission in Britain.  The standards are now set by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  They have published a booklet.  There are recommendations for the disposal of industrial effluent.  These are no more and <Col N="1058" /> no less than recommendations.  They are not compulsory.  They are just recommendations which are made.  A recommendation without the backing of law has no teeth and cannot compel people.</P>
      <P>I must commend the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on the very fine booklet which they have issued.  Their recommendations are slightly higher than those of the Royal Commission in Britain.  The provision of free and unpolluted water is a tremendous asset and encouragement to the tourists coming to this country.  We need every incentive and attraction at the moment to encourage tourists to come here.</P>
      <P>I have a list of the various Acts. Some people say there is no Act to prevent pollution: I say that there is no Act which covers the prevention of pollution.  Those who disagree with me can say that there is a series of Acts. What power have they?  There was the Rivers Pollution Protection Act, 1876. This Act makes it an offence for any person to put, cause to be put or to fall or knowingly permit to be put or to fall or to be carried into any stream the solid refuse of any factory or manufacturing process, any rubbish, cinders, other waste or any putrid solid matter so as either singly or in combination with other similar acts of the same or any other person to interfere with the flow of the stream or to pollute it's waters.  In proving an offence under this section it may be shown that a number of repeated acts caused the interference or pollution even though each individual act would in itself not be sufficient to have done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 61 of the Waterworks Clauses Act, 1847 makes it an offence for a person to cause the water of any sink, sewer or drain, steam engine, boiler or other filthy water belonging to him or under his control to run into any stream, reservoir, or waterworks of the sanitary authority or to do any other act whereby the water of the sanitary authority shall be fouled.  The penalty provided is very small&mdash;£5 and £1 for each day the offence is continued. I do not think this could be regarded in the present day as being a sufficient deterrent to people who <Col N="1059" /> might feel like committing such an offence.</P>
    <P>Under the Water Supplies Act, 1942, the same powers of preventing pollution of our water source as reside in an owner of land contiguous to the source are conferred on sanitary authorities.  The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959, contains two sections dealing with the question of water pollution. Here we have a modern statute but again we find that the wording used is not scientifically precise.  It is hard to determine exactly when an offence might be committed.  There are several other Acts.  There is an amendment to the 1959 Act.  Then there are the rights as between private owners.  This is something which is very hard to prove. It can be very costly to try to secure a prosecution.  It is no defence to such an action to show that other persons are also discharging pollution effluents into the river, nor is it a defence to plead that the neighbour stood idly by while the works causing the pollution were being constructed and took no steps to protect himself.</P>
    <P>There is also the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  There are many different sections of Acts to deal with those things but it is practically impossible to enforce those Acts and to deal with this crime of pollution.  We would hope in this Bill to bring home to the Government and the Minister the necessity of co-ordinating all those within one particular Department.  In regard to pollution we have to deal with the Department of Local Government and they cannot act entirely on their own. They must pay attention to the requirements and needs of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Pollution is the concern of the Department of Lands, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and of practically all Departments.  This Bill only asks the Government to deal with the main causes of pollution.  It is only when an appeal for good citizenship and good behaviour fails that fines should be imposed in order to ensure that people comply with the required conditions.</P>
    <P>Pollution is defined as &ldquo;any matter <Col N="1060" /> or substance which on its discharge into waters causes, or tends to cause, the same to become polluted&rdquo;.  We know that the major sources of pollution are organic.  Pollution is caused mainly by cyanides, by the metal treatment of industrial plants or pesticides.  In this connection an example was the poisoning of the Rhine.  Polution can be caused by untreated sewage and waste from industry. In this regard some of the main causes are waste matters from industries connected with meat or milk plants.  The discharge of waste from paper mills causes a considerable amount of pollution.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pollution of beaches, this is caused mainly by untreated sewage, by oil spillage, or by the dumping of dangerous substances. In this connection I would draw the attention of the Minister to a question I put down recently asking why this country has not signed the Oslo Agreement which deals with the dumping of dangerous substances.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that this matter was under serious consideration by various Departments and that as yet a decision had not been made.  This agreement was submitted to approximately 15 countries and 12 of them have signed it.  The only countries who have not signed are the Soviet Union, Finland and Ireland.  I understand the Government have six months in which to decide whether they will sign the agreement and I am sure that they will arrive at a mature and considered decision.</P>
    <P>The dumping of bilge from ships causes a considerable amount of pollution and I would ask the Minister to refer to this matter in his reply.  I have been told on reliable authority that this is done quite regularly but I cannot vouch completely for this information. I understand that in America and England heavy fines are imposed on ships which dump bilge or &ldquo;blow their tubes&rdquo; as it is known.  I do not know if our law provides for heavy penalties in this regard.  If there are regulations prohibiting the dumping of bilge I have been told on fairly reliable authority that there is wholesale violation in this regard.  Immediately ships leave Dublin <Col N="1061" /> port frequently they dump bilge and no action has been taken on this matter.</P>
    <P>The dumping of untreated sewage into rivers constitutes a health hazard and can be the cause of some diseases, including typhoid and hepatitis and we are concerned that this practice is continuing. Although we wish industries to thrive here we should not, as I understand happens in some American cities, allow industries to be established regardless of the way they dispose of effluent.  Requirements in this regard should not be merely recommendations; they should have full legal backing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right, as long as we agree on that.  I do not think there is an insurmountable problem in this country in dealing with pollution inasmuch as practically all our waterways, possibly 99 per cent, are within our own control and we are not dependent on other countries.  European countries are confronted with an entirely different problem because most of the rivers in Europe flow through more than one country and a country has to depend on the goodwill of other countries in respect of this matter of pollution.  It is not much use for one country to ensure that its stretch of a river is unpolluted if the country which is responsible for the stretch above it allows the river to become polluted.</P>
      <P>In this regard I would not envisage that we should compel industry, new or old, or for that matter, farmers who would be responsible for pollution in rural Ireland to wave a magic wand and dispel all forms of pollution.  I would envisage a period of at least 12 months in which to conform to these regulations and, as the Minister seems satisfied that new industries are amply covered by present legislation, new industries would not come within the sphere of this proposal.  It would apply to existing industries which at the time of their establishment did not take effective steps in the matter, for one reason or another, either because it was too expensive or they were not compelled to do so. I do not for a moment believe that anybody would expect that all our rivers, lakes and seaside areas should be free of pollution immediately.</P>

Those were taken at random, and if the Parliamentary Secretary wishes me to do so, I can mention 20 more at a later stage or I can show him cuttings and reports from papers, if he disbelieves me.  My purpose in doing this was merely to illustrate, to make the Minister and the Government fully aware of this problem of pollution.  If I were to list every river, every lake, every stream and every seaside area in Dublin, Deputy Cunningham could possibly say to me that it was confined to Dublin, that it was not widespread and not national.

      <P>I did not say that. What I was trying to convey to Deputy Cunningham was that this problem of pollution, two, three or more years ago, was confined to certain areas or districts. I remember when we started the National Water Conservation Association and tried to get certain Deputies interested, we found that they had not known or heard of pollution outside Dublin.  It was easy in Dublin because there were the Tolka, the Dodder, Dublin Bay and the Liffey&mdash;everything going for you in Dublin.  It was very easy to make people fully aware that pollution existed in Dublin but in rural Ireland, after we started it was very difficult to find people who would be interested because they said that they had never heard of pollution, but since then we have heard of it happening on a tributary of the Corrib and we know that it happened on the Blackwater, the Suir and the Nore.  These are the principal rivers.  We know that it happened <Col N="1068" /> in Lake Garadice and Lough Sheelin, and less than a month ago I was asked to go to Mullingar where the people were very seriously concerned with the amount of pollution in Lough Ennel, an inland lake which two or three years ago did not know of the horrors of pollution.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Agricultural Credit Bill, 1972: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass) Noel T. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to increase the resources of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in keeping with the growing demand for agricultural credit.  The Bill proposes to increase the limit on the amount which may be borrowed by the corporation and similarly to increase the amount of such borrowing which may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  It is also proposed to enable the corporation to raise moneys in foreign currencies and to enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee repayment of such moneys and indemnify the corporation against any foreign exchange risks involved.</P>
      <P>The Agricultural Credit Act, 1969, fixed the limit on borrowing by the ACC at £25 million.  Borrowing by the corporation at that time amounted to £11 million and it was thought that the new limit would suffice for four or five years ahead.  The growth in the corporation's activities has however been greater than expected and the borrowing limit of £25 million has already been reached.  The total amount of loans and hire purchase advances issued by the corporation has doubled during the past few years from £6.8 million in 1968-69 to an estimated £13.5 million in the current year, with total loans outstanding now exceeding £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is expected that lending by the corporation will increase to £18 million in 1972-73 and that the expanding demand for credit will accelerate over the next few years, particularly with <Col N="1070" /> the prospect of entry to the European Economic Community.  Farmers will require additional capital to increase their stocking rates and adapt their enterprises to benefit from the higher prices and improved marketing conditions available in the EEC.  Additional credit will also be required by the agricultural processing industries, particularly the milk and pigmeat processing industries.</P>
    <P>On the basis of this growing demand for credit, it is felt that the borrowing limit placed on the corporation should be increased to £70 million to enable them to meet their commitments over the next few years.  Section 5 of the Bill provides for this new borrowing limit and section 6 provides for guarantees by the Minister for Finance up to £70 million.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of foreign borrowing.  The existing borrowing powers of the ACC have been interpreted as empowering the corporation to borrow in Irish currency only. Suitable opportunities for foreign borrowing may arise from time to time and the corporation should be in a position to avail of such opportunities. Loans negotiated through the World Bank are a case in point.  Section 2 of the Bill enables the corporation to raise deposits in foreign currencies and section 3 extends their borrowing powers generally to include foreign borrowing.  Section 4 enables the Minister for Finance to guarantee such borrowing.  A conversion formula is included in each of these sections for calculating the equivalent in Irish currency of any foreign borrowing involved.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with losses or gains arising on foreign borrowing as a result of changes in exchange rates: the Minister for Finance would meet any losses and receive the benefit of any gains.</P>
    <P>I have given a summary of the objects of this Bill.  I now wish to give a brief review of the work of the ACC. The corporation provide a wide range of loan facilities tailored to meet the diverse and expanding needs of Irish agriculture.  Loans are available for the purchase of livestock, machinery <Col N="1071" /> and fertilisers, for land dainage and other land improvements, and for the erection of farm buildings and dwelling houses.  Periods of repayment vary, ranging up to five years for livestock, 15 years for land drainage and other land improvements, 20 years for farm buildings and 35 years for dwelling houses.</P>
    <P>The corporation also operate a budgeted loans scheme to help farmers to meet their seasonal financial needs; a written promise to repay is accepted as adequate security for loans up to £2,000 under this scheme.  Loans to agricultural processing industries are becoming an important feature of the corporation's work and it is probable that the corporation will have an important role to play in emerging plans for the rationalisation of creameries and bacon factories.</P>
    <P>The corporation's main interest rate is 8½ per cent but, as a concession to small farmers, a rate of 6½ per cent is payable by those whose total indebtedness to the corporation is not more than £400.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the rapid expansion in the corporation's business in recent years.  It is of interest to note that the bulk of this expansion has taken place without recourse to the Exchequer.  During the past two years the corporation were able to finance their lending programme mainly from repayments on existing loans and investments by the public in their farm credit bonds and deposit accounts.</P>
    <P>The scheme of deposits has been particularly successful.  The minimum initial deposit is £100, and the rate of interest ranges from 5 per cent on deposits subject to seven days notice of withdrawal to 7½ per cent on deposits subject to 12 months notice. The total amount on deposit at the end of December, 1971, was £20m. compared with £11m. at December, 1970.</P>
    <P>The ACC are pursuing a progressive and flexible lending policy geared to meet the credit needs of an expanding agricultural industry.  Their deposits scheme offers a good return to the investing public and gives them an <Col N="1072" /> opportunity of contributing to the development of the Irish agricultural economy.  This Bill will put the corporation in a position to increase their resources and thus sustain a rapidly expanding level of business.  I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary very properly included in his remarks a survey of the objects and activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  In this Bill he seeks greater borrowing power for the corporation and implicit in what he says is the extension of the corporation's activities.  So far as this party is concerned we would, of course, support a Bill of this kind in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the ACC goes back to the first decade of this State and it is well to remember and record in this House that the idea of agricultural credit being provided by a State organisation was made possible by reason of the vision of the men who composed the first Government of the State.  It was indeed part and parcel of their thinking and political philosophy that agricultural credit should be provided at a cheap rate of interest for working farmers.  It is refreshing and pleasant that now in 1972 we can pay tribute to the work of the ACC through the years and to the help they have given agriculture and particularly the small farmers and those who need credit for development.  It is also refreshing and a good thing to be able to say that we look forward now to the expansion of the work of the ACC in the immediate future.  Like so many other things that were set up during the first decade of this State, the Agricultural Credit Corporation have endured and have been proved by the test of time.  What is significant in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech is his indication that in the immediate future, by reason of Europe and the events now upon us, there will be need for an expansion of the activities of the corporation. I am glad to hear that.  We are all aware that there will be a tremendous opportunity and also a tremendous challenge to our agricultural industry in the immediate future.  On <Col N="1073" /> our entry into Europe we will be one of the primary producers of food in the Community.  We will have an opportunity of almost unlimited expansion in relation to our agricultural industry.  Therefore, credit must be available for every producer to enable him to get the optimum yield from his farm.  To the extent that the corporation need to be empowered to finance themselves to provide that credit, this Bill is timely and has our support.</P>
    <P>Correctly, the Parliamentary Secretary refers to the growing need for loans to agricultural processing industries. As everybody will appreciate, these industries are becoming more important all the time.  Many of us can look forward in the immediate future not only to a very rapid and a significant expansion in agricultural products but also the expansion of the food processing industry.  The groundwork is there for that expansion.  We will have increasingly the raw materials for a variety of food processing plants.  We will have a tremendous opportunity to lead significantly in the new Europe in this particular field, but we must rationalise and co-ordinate our efforts.  Perhaps we must set down a new pattern.  We may have to provide new finance for the adapting of existing plants and for equipping them for expansion.  This is a field in which the corporation can play a very significant role.  I am pleased to note from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that this role for the corporation is envisaged.</P>
    <P>There are other details of the work of the Agricultural Corporation that some of my colleagues will deal with but, generally speaking, I would say that this Bill is necessary and that there is need for an expansion of credit for our farmers, both small and big farmers.  There is need for gearing the corporation to provide credit for the food processing industry.  I wish the proposed legislation a speedy passage through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I assure the House that this Bill has our full support.  The role of the Agricultural Credit Corporation is becoming more important and the extra capital proposed here will be <Col N="1074" /> needed in the agricultural transition facing this country between now and the end of the decade.  This Bill is non-contentious. It is essential for the progressive development of Irish agriculture. By this measure the farmers, particularly the relatively small farmers, will be assured of the credit facilities which they need urgently if the industry is to meet the challenge of Europe and, above all, if it is to meet the challenge of the need for more intensive capital investment in the industry.  I have pleasure in supporting the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill, the purpose of which is to increase the resources of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in keeping with the growing demand for agricultural credit facilities.  It is worth noting that the Bill proposes to allow the corporation to borrow money from outside the State, which borrowing will be guaranteed by the Government.  The 1969 Act fixed the limit on borrowing at £25 million but this Bill proposes that the limit be increased to £70 million. This increase indicates the extent to which our agricultural services are developed.  It is worth noting, too, that the amount paid to borrowers increased from £6.8 million in 1968-69 to approximately £13.5 million in the current year.  From this increase one will realise that substantial aid is being given by the corporation to the farming community.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the purposes for which loans are made available are for the purchase of livestock, machinery and fertilisers, for land drainage and other land improvement and also for the erection of farm buildings and dwellings.  Of course, money is lent to smallholders who are anxious to purchase other smallholdings near their premises so that they can have a unit that is viable.  I do not think money could be allocated for a better purpose than the latter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a real need now to empower the corporation to lend more money to farmers because much money is required to enable farmers to get the maximum benefit from the great potential of the industry.  This money is needed also because of the increase in the value of land and also because of <Col N="1075" /> increasing cattle prices and increases in the cost of buildings.</P>
    <P>All these increases mean that the ACC requires more money for lending to meet even the existing level of demand.  It is very important that credit should be available to smallholders who have both the courage and the initiative to purchase land adjoining or close to their own holdings.  If these smallholders have the courage to tackle their own land problems then the credit they require should be available for them.  The ACC is the best organisation to provide this credit and that is one of the reasons why I support this Bill.</P>
    <P>Priority in borrowing should be given to farmers who have a development programme prepared in consultation with the local agricultural committee and the local agricultural advisory officer.  There should be a closer liaison between the ACC and the local agricultural advisory service. The ACC should not refuse a loan to a farmer who is commended by the local agricultural advisory officer. The corporation sometimes, not often, rely a little too much on the previous performance of the applicant for a loan from the point of view of the repayment of loans.  An applicant for a loan should be judged on his present standing and on the manner in which he is carrying on his farming at the time of his application.  Many farmers, big and small, run into difficulties and may on occasion find it difficult to repay loans.  The ACC, however, should have a second look at an application before they refuse primarily on the ground that the applicant was difficult from the point of view of repayment of a previous loan.  Farming today is being carried on on a very different basis and only a few farmers might find themselves in the position of not being able to repay loans.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary on the introduction of this measure.  I should like to take this opportunity also to pay tribute to the board and officials of the ACC for the manner in which they have carried out their duties down <Col N="1076" /> through the years, often under fairly onerous circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice in commendation of the officers of the board and the chairman of the ACC for the manner in which they have developed the company over the years.  This company was early in the field.  It was established by the late Paddy Hogan, God rest his soul, and when I used to go in there, not so many years ago, the man who received me at the door was a county man of my own, Lord rest his soul.  He was appointed by the late Paddy Hogan and I am glad to say that the man who now receives me is his son.  That shows how long the ACC has been on the road.  Their journey has not been wasted.  If there was a brake then that brake came from this House.  As I say, the ACC were early in the field in soliciting money from outside.  For many years the position was that the money came from the Capital Budget. I am right in saying, I think, that the ACC were second to the ESB in soliciting money from outside.  Certainly they were before the Industrial Credit Company. Indeed, they are the envy of the Industrial Credit Company now.  This is no criticism of that body.  It simply means that the ACC borrowed money in a most efficient and proper way and lent it at the correct rates and for the right term.</P>
      <P>It has been stated here that there is a huge need for agricultural credit.  Of course, there is.  There is a situation which was not adverted to in the Bill. Mine may be the first voice to be raised in criticism but, in the words of the song, &ldquo;Po-Po, the puppet, can do anything, when somebody else pulls the string&rdquo;.  I have always been interested in the work of the ACC and the first item I have always examined in the Capital Budget was the amount of lending to be permitted to the ACC. Even after the ACC had begun to borrow from outside they were limited in the amount of lending they could do in each financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in this Bill, as I understand it, which changes that situation.  About five years ago there was a deficit of £1.7 million in the amount being made available to the ACC in relation to the money they <Col N="1077" /> were to lend and there was no indication of how this deficit would be met. I questioned the then Minister for Finance, the present Taoiseach, and he said it would come from the repayment of loans.  Eventually, on the Adjournment, I extracted a promise from him that, if there was a short-fall, the Exchequer would make good the deficiency.  During the credit squeeze in 1965 or 1966&mdash;I forget the exact year&mdash;it was estimated that a figure of £6.7 million would be reached in loans.  That gave me the information on which I was able to check and prove that there was a limit.  I hope that, from now on, as we are now about to enter Europe, there will be no limit because there is no limit to the amount of money required by the farmer to go into Europe fully equipped to do the job.  There is, of course, good lending and bad lending. The fact is that repayments have never been less than 99 per cent.  They may have been slow on occasion but there have been very, very few bad debts. This excellent company have been to some extent retarded in their expansion over the years.  They should now be released from any binding of any kind by this House or the Government and in respect of moneys which they can borrow they should be allowed to lend to the Irish farmer, and if the amount they can borrow falls short of what is required as we move towards Europe, it should be supplemented as before from capital.  These are the things which are not in this Bill and which must be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance or by the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying.</P>
    <P>I note in one section of this Bill that the power to indemnify against loss in the transfer of a foreign currency to our money is taken by the Minister for Finance but the power is also taken to take gain.  That is hardly fair.  There could be a situation&mdash;and it is most unlikely&mdash;that there was a sudden devaluation of currency which would mean a crippling loss to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and which would have resulted presumably from a mistaken decision on the part of the board, and boards being human will make mistaken decisions.  That would <Col N="1078" /> be a crisis situation where the Agricultural Credit Corporation fund had been depleted by accident.  At the same time, over the year's trading there are many times when an astute executive of the ACC might be in a position to make a gain on borrowing abroad and, in so doing, he should be allowed to make that gain and to keep that money in the coffers of the ACC for lending to the Irish farmer.</P>
    <P>Let us take the situation in relation to the eradication of brucellosis.  The average compensation given to people is between £120 and £130.  It is of no use at all to the dairy farmer who has lost the income from the milk produced by that cow which has gone to be slaughtered because it had brucellosis.  The calf is lost as well, and that could mean as much as £40.</P>
    <P>I do not want to widen the scope of this debate, but this is something that must be considered and I want it to be considered in the light of my own story.  I had 37 cows down with brucellosis.  They were very good Friesian cows which were being bred by my late father for 20 to 25 years before I was ever farming.  The average compensation was between £120 and £130.  Having lost these 37 cows, I had to decide how I could get an income from the farm as quickly as possible. At that time young cattle about 6½ cwt happened to be cheap and I decided that the best thing I could do was to buy them.  I bought 46 and they cost £64 each, but within 12 months I got £124 each for them. You might think I did well.  Of course I did extremely well, but I had to sell to find out.  When I went out to buy stores to replace them, I paid £124 for them also.</P>
    <P>That gives an idea of the amount of money that is required by farmers to stock their land.  The fact that there has been an appreciation in the price of stores, beef and of calves does not mean that the farmer has the money in his pocket.  We must get full production and the land must be stocked to the hilt, and every heifer that can be mated must be mated in order to create an upsurge in our stock.  This is the area in which there will be a huge demand for credit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> We have not gone into the dairying areas yet in the eradication of this disease and the reason we have not is exactly the same as that in relation to tuberculosis eradication, that we are leaving them to the very last, because they are the worst areas for brucellosis. When we go in there every farmer in that area will be faced with the same dilemma with which I was faced.  I was lucky in the way I overcame it, but let us face the fact that, with the appreciation in the cost of stores, a farmer who gets between £120 and £130 compensation for a beast that goes down with brucellosis will not be in a position to get any income within the next 12 months.  He has to get money immediately to pay, perhaps, £160, £170 or £180 for a cow to replace the cow that went down.  I want to impress upon the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, that there will not be enough of those cows to go around.</P>
    <P>The terms of a loan with the Agricultural Credit Corporation are infinitely superior to those that can be got anywhere else.  Any bank lending money to a farmer at the moment desires repayment in a maximum period of seven years.  If this is a loan for capital goods such as a farm or for anything except, perhaps, a tractor which should be depreciated over a certain number of years, then that farmer is up against it.  Not only is he confronted with the difficulty that seven years is too short a term to repay from farm income but he also has to contend with the constant depreciation in the value of money, which you might think would be running for him; indeed, if he died and his estate was assessed or if he sold out, it might be proved to be running for him on the basis of what he borrowed, but as it happens, the stock, the machinery and all he requires to run a farm is also costing more, and his money is tied up in the land or in one way or another is not available to him.</P>
    <P>Even though he is working hard, even though he is doing a good job and making a reasonable profit, the only way he can operate is on the <Col N="1080" /> basis of increased agricultural credit. The only place he can get it over a long term for such things as farm buildings is the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  A decent farm building needs to be repaid over a minimum period of 15 years, because the capital expenditure thereon is too great to ask any farmer to pay it over a shorter period.</P>
    <P>An interesting commentary on how successful the Agricultural Credit Corporation have been in their lending appears in the Minister's speech, in which he says that no money is being provided from the Exchequer; when the Minister talks about £20 million being injected into the economy a few months ago and mentions a sum of £8 million in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, it means that the ACC have borrowed successfully £8 million and have put up £8 million of the £20 million from their own resources. I suspected that from the day the Minister for Finance said it, and the Parliamentary Secretary in his speech has now verified it as true.  That is a great commendation of the ACC, and I want to see no brake on this excellent machinery.  I want to see acceleration.  I want to see them expanding to the limit they can borrow and lending to that limit and more if necessary.  As I said, when we reach the worst areas in relation to the eradication of brucellosis and as the cost of agricultural goods and animals increases in Common Market conditions, it will be seen that more and more will be required, and that in fact this Bill is absolutely necessary and, if anything, does not quite go far enough.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of lending money to creameries, bacon factories and to what the Americans call agri-business.  This is necessary because this country is not sophisticated enough in regard to the services provided for our farmers.  In the dairying areas of the south if you are lucky enough to be near one of the first class co-operatives or near its headquarters such as perhaps Mitchelstown or Dungarvan you may get a service that is not available to your neighbour 50 miles away.  If you go right across the co-operative area of the south, and what <Col N="1081" /> is largely 50 per cent co-operative and 50 per cent business area of Leinster and the Midlands, it is quite clear that the amount of service which should be provided for farmers is not being provided. I say this merely in appreciation of the fact that there have to be millions of pounds properly pumped into the provision of a proper service for farmers.</P>
    <P>We do not want any great losses or failures.  Therefore, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, its executive side, the expertise in its executive side and the expansion of that is absolutely vital for this country and is something we have got to face up to in the most detailed way.  I mentioned on a Supplementary Estimate some time ago the question of machinery partnerships and the fact that farmers are not availing of the facilities of the ACC in this regard.  The old idea was you could not have a farmer in partnership with his neighbour owning something to make hay because when the sun shone each of them wanted to make hay in his own field and they inevitably fell out.  Making hay is gone and the conservation of grass in silage is in. The cost of machinery for the conservation of silage is only bearable if you have something in the order of 150 acres to cut.  You need to have the most efficient machinery and to have it in good order and 150 acres is quite a lot of silage on a mixed farm.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a machinery partnership with my two neighbours. We have a simple partnership in a solicitor's office.  I do not own a tractor, plough or silage harvester.  I do not own any piece of machinery and neither do my neighbours.  We have agreed on the basis of our average acreage of silage that we will take shares in the partnership, we will use Cork as a repository of funds and this will be a bank none of us deals with. We fine ourselves per acre for every acre we cut with this machinery for which we borrowed the money from the ACC, a sum which will not only pay the ACC's half yearly repayment but also have a figure for depreciation. After three or four years we can sell our machinery on the second-hand market and have enough money to go back to the ACC and say: &ldquo;There <Col N="1082" /> is a deposit.  Lend us money again.&rdquo; We always have new machinery and as well as doing our own three farms we now have two adjoining farmers who are not members of the partnership but who have agreed that they will come in and pay us the ordinary contractor's fee for doing their silage as well.  This is something which is not being availed of.  It is a service which the ACC are eager to provide. Farmers are inclined to be hesitant because of their old experience of binders, combine harvesters and hay-making machinery.  It is even possible in the making of silage to arrange in November or December or before that that you will have one farmer's grass ready at an earlier stage than the others by earlier application of fertiliser or an earlier withdrawal of cattle. It is possible to give every farmer in his turn the first cutting.  I hope this Bill will allow more of this to take place.</P>
    <P>The ACC over the years have scored on the institution of area managers and area offices.  They have one man who is a specialist in one particular type of lending.  It does not matter what salary this man has because his costs are very much lower than the cost of the bank up the street.  The bank is doing many things but this man is merely accepting deposits and lending money for agriculture.  This man is somebody who for one salary can report on the spot on whether or not farmers should get loans.  He can keep contact with the farmers in the area, he can collect deposits and he is not costing the ACC a lot of money. The ACC head office can mechanise to a greater degree, can departmentalise to a greater degree not only in areas but in various types of lending and so provide their specialists who know all about a particular field in which they are in rather than the position with the banks.</P>
    <P>It is possible for the ACC to borrow money at higher rates of interest and to lend money out at lower rates of interest.  I am aware that they are seeking less profits and, in fact, any profit remains in.  The Minister for Finance is the only beneficiary.  I hope he will not be a beneficiary, that all profits will remain in and that the <Col N="1083" /> expansion which should go on will go on indefinitely as we approach Europe.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, when replying, to tell us whether or not there is any hope in relation to the EEC, when we go in, of the difference between the economic lending rate which is charged by the ACC being reduced to a much smaller lending rate by any fund within the EEC. Would that apply to the whole country or would it apply to depressed areas? If you have, for instance, drainage in west Limerick and reseeding and development of the land afterwards, when a loan is required from the ACC would a farmer in that area, which is not the best land in Ireland, be entitled if he was borrowing at 8½ per cent to get any subsidy from EEC funds to reduce the interest rate to 2 per cent or 3 per cent?  If there is such a hope I would like to know whether or not a farmer in Meath, who is on the best land in Ireland, could also get this help.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see an expansion of this semi-State company.  We have, as usual, the extension from £25 million to £70 million and this is in keeping with the fall in the value of money and the expansion we hope to have. I disagree with the provision that any gain accruing from changes in the rate of exchange should go to the State. I think the proper thing would be that all gains should accrue to the benefit of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and if there was the occasional loss because of devaluation of currency or something like that it should be borne by the Minister for Finance.  I agree with section 8 that it should be lawful for the corporation to make such alterations in the memorandum and articles of association as are necessary because there is no point in coming back to this House for such a thing.  The memorandum and articles of association of a company are usually all-enveloping and allow the company to do anything and if perchance there are changes needed in the articles or the memorandum the board should have the power like any ordinary company to make those changes.</P>
    <P>I should like to close by commending <Col N="1084" /> the chairman, the officers and the work of the Agricultural Credit Corporation over the years.  The men who have done that work have contributed greatly to the prosperity of Ireland.  I hope the men who are there now will have as much success, and, indeed, greater success and that the expansion in personnel that will occur because of this Bill will result in men just as good coming into the employment of the board, men who will be able to keep the good lending rate expanding day by day, the good repayment rate at its high level and let this company remain as the shining example for all other semi-State companies within the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to commend the ACC and the Government for taking steps to make it possible to increase the amount which can be borrowed. This is a very sensible idea.  I would query whether it is a good idea to limit it to £70 million in view of the fact that if Ireland goes into EEC, and I hope it will not, the amount which will be required, I fear, will be very much more than £70 million within a very short time.</P>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Donegan has left because I was going to comment that Deputy Paddy Burke often says: &ldquo;Great things have happened in our time&rdquo; and I was very glad to hear Deputy Donegan commending the communal use of farm machinery.  No doubt in a few years time he will be talking about communal farms and we will be getting down to proper farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a little surprised, and perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would comment on it when he is replying, on the use which is made by very wealthy people of the ACC.  I was under the impression that the ACC in the main were intended to help those who really needed help in agriculture.  If in addition to that they are used for the purpose of helping to improve agriculture by lending money at reasonable rates to the wealthier people so that they can make the best use of their farms that is policy and we know it all right, but when one meets a farmer who says that he required a very small sum, a couple of hundred pounds, or maybe <Col N="1085" /> up to a thousand pounds, and he applied to the ACC but was refused and no reason was given for the refusal it makes one wonder if the money available for lending in the corporation is being allocated in the proper way.  Perhaps I meet more people who are not so happy with the activities of the ACC than Deputy Donegan does. Perhaps I meet people who are not as creditworthy in that they are not wealthy.  It is pretty rough on the small farmer who has been finding it difficult to carry on and who, when he needs some money and applies for it to the only body in a position to lend it to him, is told that he is not eligible.  The very least he should be told is that he is not entitled to get it and given the reasons.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising the ACC as such because as a business firm they seem to have done extremely well. There are very few such organisations handling big money in this country that can say that over a period of years they have had no major losses.  While this is a great credit to them it does, to me, mean that they are conservative in their outlook.  They do not lose any money because they do not lend it to people who, they believe, are not in a position to refund it.  Therefore, they take no chances.  The ACC should take chances, particularly with smaller amounts, because a few hundred pounds to a man who has not got the necessary money at a particular time may mean a lot.  I think this House would forgive them if they had an odd loss and if the record showed that when people really needed money they could get it from the ACC.  A few years ago it was the complaint that the only way to get money from the ACC was to prove you did not need it.  That is not so to the same extent now but people come to me and complain that they have applied and have simply got a letter of rejection.  If I ask for the case to be reconsidered I get a very polite note saying that following my representations the case has been reconsidered but it has not been found possible to make a loan, a loan of £200 or £300 to some poor devil who felt he could get out of the mud if he got it.  That attitude is wrong.  I would ask the ACC not to <Col N="1086" /> be so conservative and to consider the fellow at the bottom of the pile because I do not think the ACC was ever intended to supply money to the bigger people, particularly if there are two or three of them together, who can have 150 acres of silage and need the necessary money so that they do not have to sell any of their stock for the purpose of buying it.  Maybe I am wrong but that is my view.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I was instrumental in getting a certain organisation to deposit money with the ACC on a six months demand.  During that period they required that money in a hurry. It is normal procedure in most countries and indeed with a number of organisations in this country that in circumstances like that the money can be refunded to the lender on a fine basis, they lose a certain amount of interest.  The ACC said: &ldquo;No.  You will not get it until the end of the period which is six months.&rdquo;  I would hate to think that the fact that the organisation that had deposited the money was a trade union and that the money was required for the purpose of paying strike pay had anything to do with the decision but at the back of my mind I have an idea that it had. It had this effect: never again will that organisation, as far as I know, be prepared to deposit money with the ACC.  They made a mistake there. Again it is the conservative attitude. There should be some way of relaxing the regulations.  The amount would not break the corporation.  It would have meant that when funds were available further deposits would be made.  I hope this was simply a temporary lapse, that it is not the policy of the ACC to do this kind of thing.</P>
    <P>With regard to borrowing foreign currency, I do not agree with the suggestion that if the State is to carry the losses the State should not carry the gains.  Let us be fair.  I believe the State should.  A few years ago an astute Minister for Finance succeeded in making a fairly substantial profit through manipulating money borrowed abroad.  I grant you he got very little thanks for it.  He was rooted out pretty quickly afterwards.  He lost his job in the Government.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to people shaking hands.  If we all remember old sores for a long time we will make no progress.  I would love if we were in a position to shake hands with certain people at the other end of this country and settle some of the differences that exist at present.  There is no harm in shaking hands.  I believe, however, that that Minister was a very good Minister.  He succeeded in making a considerable amount of money and he did a good job generally in this House, but I wonder what is the situation in regard to it.  Although the Minister I referred to made a profit for the State, it was on the cards that the opposite could have been the case.  If we are to talk about profits and losses in foreign currencies, do we not involve ourselves in the danger that somebody might be inclined to gamble?  I do not think the present Minister would do that but no matter what happens it should be the Minister for Finance who would carry the responsibility because otherwise there is always a danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little more I wish to say on the Bill which has been fairly well flogged by the experts and I can be regarded only as a hurler on the ditch. However, I should like to comment on what Deputy Donegan said in regard to the amount, £20 million.  I do not believe it exists at all.  He spoke about a figure of £8 million found out of their own resources by the ACC, the rest being a paper transaction. No effect has been shown for that £20 million.  If this country is unfortunate enough to decide to go into the EEC, I am afraid the amount of money being given here and regarded as being the amount needed for borrowing for agricultural purposes for a number of years, is far too small.  In EEC conditions, particularly if one remembers the differences in costs between there and here, I am afraid some Minister will be coming back within a few years and asking for permission to borrow because they have not enough.  A few months ago the farming organisations were talking in terms of £900 million which they thought was required to gear Irish agriculture to Common Market <Col N="1088" /> conditions.  Here we say we are allowed to borrow up to £70 million. I honestly think this is not enough, that we need provision for further borrowing.</P>
    <P>The fact that all the money which has been lent has been repaid shows that the ACC are an organisation which does not take chances.  To my mind, one of their primary purposes should be to take chances on behalf of Irish agriculture and by Irish agriculture I mean those at the bottom of the pile, the small farmers whom the ACC were set up to help rather than the wealthier types who can obtain money from other sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is refreshing in that it enables the ACC, a major force in our economy, to continue to be an even greater force in our agricultural expansion. It enables the ACC to have better resources to meet growing demands. Deputy Tully advocated a strange policy.  I think he would be one of the first Deputies to criticise the Department concerned or the Government for allowing a situation to develop in which finance would be wasted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is to the credit of the ACC that they have transacted their business in the way they have done, and as a farmer I believe the worst service that could be done to any small farmer would be to load him with financial commitments that he could not carry. That is not to say that there could not be instances given or plans arranged for farmers by agricultural advisers to meet the requirements of the ACC.  It is in this range of farming that credit is greatly needed.  For years many of our farmers have fought shy of credit for many reasons, some historical.  This is disappearing and as it disappears all of us want to see a massive injection of finance, a new approach to this whole question through which our farmers can see advantage in investing money in their farms.  They can be enabled to do it by help from the ACC which have been providing not only the necessary business organisation but the expertise to put the finances available to them into the more remunerative areas of farming.  The ACC have also been <Col N="1089" /> capable of determining the type of action and the line of approach each farmer should take.  Almost every field has been covered.</P>
    <P>There are just two points I should like to make in particular.  The first is in relation to the stocking rate in this country.  We have seen a fixed growth in the stocking rate, better use of fertilisers, more reclamation of land, improved advisory services, all contributing towards growth in agriculture, but now as we look into Europe and as we see for the first time great coming opportunities for our farmers not tied as deliberately as in the past to the British market, which was often very much to our disadvantage, we must be able to get credit directed to our farmers so that they can obtain the maximum benefits from new markets and so that the country as a whole can consequently gain immensely and immeasurably.</P>
    <P>This will take even greater confidence from this House and it will need greater confidence from our farmers. It will call for a wider approach in some instances on the part of the ACC.  I can see instances at the moment of small farmers, particularly, selling young breeding stock because of the temptation offered by increased prices.  I should like to think it would be possible for that kind of small farmer to hold on to those breeding animals which will not only push up numbers in the country but will enable the individual farmer to build up his dairy herd, if he is in dairying. To do that he needs capital now to supplant the income that would be available to him if he were to sell his young animals.</P>
    <P>We have the case where land becomes available, small parcels of land which would enable small farms to become viable.  Small farmers are not now capable of purchasing these patches of land because they are unable to compete with larger farmers. The ACC should be empowered to give loan facilities to this kind of farmer at an even lower rate than is available at the moment.  I wonder whether the ACC would consider the case of a group of small farmers who wish to purchase a fairly large-sized <Col N="1090" /> farm and either develop it collectively or add it proportionately to their own farms?  Could they encourage this kind of investment to build up the farming range which is capable of becoming viable and which would strengthen the rural scene?</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to the machinery syndicate.  The Deputy said machinery can be utilised over a long period.  Where the need did not exist for a machine on a particular farm on a particular day the overall costs of production can be reduced by farmers involving themselves in getting credit facilities over as long a term as possible and ensuring that the machine is operated economically. This is of advantage to the group. This is to be welcomed.  It would be encouraging if arrangements could be made for the implementation of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Referring earlier to the purchase of land, I neglected to mention the ceiling of £6,000 which operates at present. Land prices have soared in recent times and the only kind of credit which is worth while to the smaller farmers for the purchase of land is credit over a long term.  Very often a farmer may find himself unable to purchase land while the £6,000 ceiling operates.  I know that that ceiling has some advantages. It attempts to direct to the right areas the limited financial resources which have been mentioned already. At the same time, some flexibility might enable farmers reach the level of land prices which are sometimes necessary.  It appears that in the future prices will be even higher.</P>
    <P>The question of the ACC being involved in granting credit facilities to the food processing and meat processing plants all over the country has arisen.  These plants are mostly allied to agricultural production.  The desirability of rationalisation demonstrates the need for credit in this area.  In my short experience in public life, I have watched how the corporation operate in this particular field.  Their schemes and their methods of investigation, and the thoroughness with which they go about their job, are, in fact, examples to the business community as a whole and particularly to the semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1091" /> There is nothing else I wish to add except to say that agriculture today and in the future needs more and more capital.  I see the ACC as the body capable of supervising and maintaining the momentum and drive to ensure that our farmers reap the vast benefits from the credit facilities available to them. This House welcomes this Bill.  We hope that in the years to come many other similar Bills will come before us, phased intelligently and laying down the demarcation line in progressive development in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill arose because of the increased demand for credit from the agricultural sector in this country.  We, on this side of the House, welcome this Bill because it provides scope to the lending agency, the ACC, to borrow.  It also provides that additional sums will be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance. In the past 12 months the deposits of the corporation have doubled.  That indicates the confidence in the corporation and the willingness of the lending public&mdash;the business people, professional people, and people who have money to put into lucrative investments. It indicates their confidence in this lending agency.</P>
      <P>What is most important in the ACC and what, in fact, has given rise to this expansion in credit which is so obvious is that they have established an administrative structure.  They have gone throughout the country and established area offices with area officers.  They have decentralised their administrative structure and set up a chain of command throughout the country.  This has established communication with the people.  They have come closer to the farming public and become more intimate with their requirements, and because of that there is possibly a more prompt and expeditious approach to requirements.  The waiting period for a loan has been reduced because the administrative problems have been dealt with more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know about the activities of the ACC outside the country.  I know of a commercial bank which set up an office in England and in a short time a sum of £1 million was invested in the <Col N="1092" /> bank.  If we established some contacts in that country I am sure our emigrants would invest in the corporation.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to explore this possibility and to permit officers of the ACC to go to England to investigate this matter.  When we enter the EEC we will need finance to meet the demands of the farmers who will be forced to adjust to more modern methods in agriculture.  I do not believe that we lag behind any of the EEC countries.  In fact, my information is that in many sectors we are ahead of them.  It is vital that we have more confidence in our ability to survive and succeed in the EEC.</P>
    <P>The priorities of the ACC are the replacement of livestock, the purchase of machinery and fertilisers and drainage of land.  It should be realised that the less developed areas of the country should get a considerable share of the capital available to the ACC and I hope that adjustments can be made to channel a greater share of the money invested in the corporation into those areas.  I know of areas where the farms are small and the quality of the land is comparatively poor but, because of the combined activities of the farming organisationts, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Land Commission and the ACC, the farmers have succeeded in obtaining a good standard of living.  I know of the achievements that have been made in the pilot areas. They have pointed out the way in which we should go in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a disease that is ravaging the herds in the dairying areas in the western counties, namely, brucellosis.  In the well-known dairying areas the prices of livestock have doubled in the past three months; the price of in-calf heifers has increased from £100 to more than £200.  I hope that the ACC will help those people who have low valuations and that they will lend them money at low interest rates.  It is necessary that the farmers be helped if we want to keep up production.</P>
    <P>The farm credit bonds and the deposit accounts of the ACC have been so sound that it has been found possible to give loans in the last few years from the repayments that have <Col N="1093" /> been received.  We must give credit to those who administer the affairs of the corporation.  We cannot speak too highly of the economic experts in that organisation and of the men in the field.  I am proud that the chairman and secretary, both of whom have done wonderful work, are from County Clare.  They deserve credit for their achievements.</P>
    <P>I appeal to people with money to invest it in this country.  We will achieve real progress if we have a developed and sound agricultural industry. When the farmers have increased profits the money is circulated throughout the rest of the community. However, it should be realised that the ACC must have money if they wish to finance worthwhile projects.  I am sure that the EEC will realise that the corporation are the body best equipped to deal with loans to the agricultural sector.  I am sure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and other have made known to people in Brussels that the ACC are the agency best equipped to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>The number of 40,000 borrowers gives the lie to those who think that few people benefit from the activities of the ACC.  That figure indicates that the activities of the corporation extend to every county.  However, more people could avail of the services of the ACC.  We have been rather shy in accepting credit&mdash;that fear probably goes back to the days of the lending offices and fear of eviction.  I do not know of any case where the corporation have brought a person to court. People should not be worried about applying for loans from the ACC. In a way the ACC have a socio-economic outlook with regard to the long-term policies of farmers.</P>
    <P>It might be asked if we should always accept the advice of a particular group when money is given out.  The corporation would be well advised to reflect on the fact that the number who avail of advice from qualified graduates in agriculture is comparatively low.  There are others who have possibly greater contact with farmers. They are agricultural advisers of various grades who allocate grants for <Col N="1094" /> farm buildings and so on in land project offices.  They have greater contact with farmers and their advice should be sought before loans are issued.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill to increase the power of the Agricultural Credit Corporation to issue credit from £25 to £70 million and we know that the increased credit facilities will be very productive.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to join the other speakers in welcoming this Bill, the primary purpose of which is to increase the resources of the Agricultural Credit Corporation in keeping with the growing demand for agricultural credit.  I notice from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that it is expected that lending by the corporation will increase to £80 million in 1972-73 and that the expanding demand for credit will accelerate over the next two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we are about to enter the EEC it is most important that farmers should be fully equipped to obtain the maximum benefits from that entry. Ready cash is required by farmers to increase their lands and to purchase machinery and livestock.  It is important that they should make full use of the services provided by the ACC. Some years ago it was almost impossible to get farmers, in particular small farmers, to borrow money but I am glad to say that that position has changed.  Some years ago I attended agricultural classes where the agricultural instructors pleaded with farmers to borrow from the Agricultural Credit Corporation in order to increase their output from the land.  This was something that they were afraid to do. The small farmer always tried to pay his way.  He resented anybody thinking he had to borrow from any institution in order to improve his farm.  I am glad that this idea has been dissipated.  At present the small farmer can go to the Agricultural Credit Corporation and borrow money to enable him to build up his herd, improve his farm buildings and, if land becomes available in his locality, to purchase it in order to enlarge his holding.  This is very important and is something that I welcome because in many cases where <Col N="1095" /> small holdings come on the market they are snapped up by big farmers. Without credit facilities the small farmer is unable to compete for land. The small farmer has always been the backbone of the nation and should be given every opportunity to expand.</P>
    <P>The pilot areas selected in the western counties have proved what can be achieved on a small holding when capital is available, where the advisory service is available and where the farmer is willing to co-operate with the agricultural adviser and work to a given plan.  Dr. John Scully, in a recent report on western farming, has stated that there are almost two million acres in the west of Ireland which are not being utilised.  Perhaps if sufficient credit had been available in the past, the picture might be different but even at this late stage I hope it will be possible for the Agricultural Credit Corporation to contribute towards the reclamation of some of this land.</P>
    <P>The Agricultural Credit Corporation have done a magnificent job for the farmers and I want to congratulate the corporation, the board of directors, the field staff and everybody else connected with the corporation on the magnificent job they have done for Irish farmers.  They are contributing to the expansion of the agricultural community.  It is vital to the economy that the agricultural sector be improved. I wish the Agricultural Credit Corporation every success and I hope they will be able to keep up the good work.</P>

      <P>In conjunction with other Deputies, I welcome the Bill.  It would appear that there is a provision of £70 million as against £25 million but when we consider the cost of materials and of livestock, there will not be very much left over. At the moment a great portion of land is not properly developed.  Along the western seaboard there is a great deal of land that is not in full production. That is due to the fact that the farmers are starved of capital.  That applies to practically every country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte represent the second biggest industry in the country, tourism, and the Agricultural Credit Corporation <Col N="1096" /> cater for the largest industry.  Bord Fáilte have a scheme whereby they pay the rate of interest on borrowings from the bank.  I see in the Parliamentary Secretary's opening speech that the rate of interest payable by a small farmer should be 6½ per cent.  That rate of interest to a man who is starting from rock bottom leaves him in the position that he will be struggling for the rest of his life.  The amount of stock that some small farmers have is negligible. To enable small farmers to derive the profits anticipated from EEC membership, they should be put in a position to build up their stocks.  For this they would require interest-free loans. That is the only method by which they can come into full production.</P>
    <P>I know hoteliers who spend hundreds of thousands of pounds in improving their hotels in order to be able to meet modern demands.  If Bord Fáilte can devise a scheme to provide them with interest-free loans, the Agricultural Credit Corporation should be able to provide a scheme whereby a certain sum of money would be available interest-free to the farmers.  This should be done in the case of farmers under £45 valuation.  In order to enable a small farmer to increase his stock, to purchase up-to-date machinery and the necessary manure and lime, he will require about £1,000.  The interest on that at 6½ per cent is £65.  It is not a practical proposition.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that most other countries provide loans to farmers at much lower rates of interest than have obtained here.  If the Agricultural Credit Corporation are not themselves in a position to provide the necessary finances, they could make arrangements with finance houses and others who are only too willing to lend money to farmers provided a satisfactory scheme was worked out with the assistance of the agricultural officer to ensure that the investment would be profitable and that the return would be commensurate with capital outlay.</P>
    <P>Most people in my constituency who seek loans are already up to their necks in debt and have been struggling for years to pay a high rate of interest to the banks.  Invariably they <Col N="1097" /> are seeking to borrow more in order to pay off the bank overdraft and to try to purchase a little stock and to improve their position.</P>
    <P>The corporation should advise farmers in regard to the desirability and feasibility of co-operation in the use of farm machinery.  Deputy Donegan could probably buy and sell me.  He is quite a wealthy man.  He is running a co-operative scheme with his next door neighbour.  I think it is an excellent idea to do so because it is quite impossible, with the cost of machinery today, for anybody, unless he is in a fairly strong way of farming, to buy machinery.  The only tractor you can buy at the moment under £1,000 is the Zetor and that, unfortunately, is manufactured on the other side of the Iron Curtain.  The prices of all other tractors have gone up to absolutely astronomical heights and the same thing applies to all farm machinery, so that what agriculture really wants is a tremendous inflow of capital, but there is no use in giving capital on the terms suggested in the Bill, or not so much suggested in the Bill as suggested in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.</P>
    <P>There is a small paragraph on page 3 which says that the corporation's main interest rate is 8½ per cent.  Even big farmers who are trying to build themselves up find it hard to pay 8½ per cent.  I do not think it is economical or profitable to do so because they are national producers and the entire nation is dependent on agricultural production such as it is to service the money paid for the import of raw materials and so on.  As a concession to small farmers, a rate of 6½ per cent is payable by those whose total indebtedness to the corporation is not more than £400.  That is mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary as if it were some great innovation, some great benefit being conferred on the small farmers.  It is not, of course; a rate of 6½ per cent is not a low rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make refers to the interminable delays in getting a loan granted.  Farmers are not people who think a long way ahead, particularly small farmers, and if they are <Col N="1098" /> looking for a loan, and I know many cases of people who have applied for a loan, there seems to be interminable delay before it comes through.  I suppose that as a finance corporation, the Agricultural Credit Corporation has to ensure that it is lending money to a person who is creditworthy, but if a farmer decides that he wants to buy, and he may be in the position of having established exactly what he wants and where he can buy it, he is held up pending the coming through of the loan.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the purchase of farms for which, I understand, the Agricultural Credit Corporation provide money.  If a farmer decides to buy a farm, there is, again, this interminable delay, even though it is communicated to the corporation that he has to have the money or a guarantee of the money by a certain date and that otherwise he cannot bid.  It simply means that the deal is off and he is not in business.  I would direct the attention of the corporation to the fact that there is a human or social side to it.  Most of those people have not got a bean to their name and they are entirely dependent on securing services from the Agricultural Credit Corporation and I would hope that they would bear these facts in mind.  It is we, the elected representatives, who living in rural Ireland know this because we have people constantly coming to us with these problems.</P>
    <P>I have been somewhat critical of the Agricultural Credit Corporation but I want to say that they have always treated me with the greatest courtesy. I never tried to borrow any money from them yet and, perhaps, they would not give it to me, if I did try.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and would like to pay my tribute to the chairman of the Agricultural Credit Corporation and his staff.  The work they are engaged in is worthy of praise.  Agriculture is our main industry and it is only right and proper that funds be made available to this industry for expansion, particularly in view of our forthcoming entry to the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect I should like to <Col N="1099" /> mention.  I do not know what proportion of the investment in the Agricultural Credit Corporation comes from the farming community, but I feel that a further campaign should be launched, with particular emphasis on investment by the farmer in the corporation, because the corporation should have special attractions for investment by the farmer.  He knows full well that the money he invests will be utilised in his own industry and, perhaps, the people in the Agricultural Credit Corporation might devise some new means of encouraging the farming community to invest more of their savings in it.</P>
    <P>Last week we had a motion by Deputy Tully on the workings of the Land Commission and we had quite a bit of discussion on the Land Commission. One of the criticisms of the Land Commission, with which most people agree, is that it is very cumbersome and very slow to acquire land for allotment, that the whole machine is very slow and tiresome, that it does not work very well.  I wonder if some working arrangement or form of co-operation could be devised between the Land Commission and the Agricultural Credit Corporation whereby corporation funds could be utilised for the purchase of land when it comes up for sale.  We are all very tired of the system by which the Land Commission acquire land mainly through land bonds.  This is criticised all over as being an unfair way of purchasing land, that it is unfair to the seller and does not work very well.  I feel sure that some working arrangement could be devised whereby the Agricultural Credit Corporation could come into this scheme of land purchase, thereby making it more workable and much quicker for the benefit of everyone concerned and particularly those who are in need of land, people who have non-viable holdings and need more land.</P>
    <P>I know that the Agricultural Credit Corporation are involved in this in their own way, but perhaps the corporation and the Minister for Lands, with the Minister for Finance, might be able to devise a better scheme.  The <Col N="1100" /> Minister for Lands is anxious to do a lot of reconstructing in the Land Commission and this is one means by which he could get on with what he has in mind.  I would ask the Minister concerned to look into this and see if the funds which are now available and which will be available in the future with further expansion of Agricultural Credit Corporation funds could be utilised for land purchase for the benefit of the agricultural community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Apart from the foreign currency sections of this Bill, the principal section as far as I am concerned is section 6, which extends the borrowing powers or the lending powers of the ACC from £25 million to £70 million, or at least authorise the Minister for Finance to give guarantees up to £70 million instead of £25 million as at present. I welcome that provision because I think it will enable the ACC to extend its activities and to have regard to inflation, the increased cost of land and the increased cost of machinery and manures and so on which it enables farmers to purchase.  I would like to say that from my experience of the ACC it is doing a good job and doing it efficiently within the powers available to it at the moment and within its policy, about which I shall say a few words before I conclude.</P>
      <P>I was interested to note from the Parliamentary Secretary's speech that the activities of the ACC are being financed out of repayment of loans and by borrowing of money from the people of the country in the form of credit bonds and deposit accounts.  I am glad to hear that.  I think it really means in effect that with the tremendous rise in the amount it is lending the ACC is financing most of its activities from borrowing.  It is an ill wind that does not do somebody good.  The stupid bank strike of a couple of years ago has probably done a good deal to channel money into the accounts of ACC.  The bank strike was stupid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> At any rate if the lock-out, closure or suspension of business, strike or whatever it was directed the attention of our farmers to the fact that they had money lying in the banks at a miserable rate of interest and instead they channelled it into institutions like the ACC, it did a good day's work.</P>
      <P>As regards borrowing, I did not know that the ACC adhered rigidly to its withdrawal notice provision.  If that is so it should change its policy in that respect.  Personally, I did not know that was the practice and I had advised people from time to time to put money into the ACC.  I was asked by somebody the other day when he could draw out his money and I said: &ldquo;Any time you like.&rdquo;  I hope he does not want to draw it out in a hurry, at least until the ACC change their policy. As Deputy Tully said, there are banks in the country with which people became familiar during the bank lock-out, suspension of business or closure and they certainly gave higher rates of interest for longer notice but if somebody wanted to withdraw at short notice he could do so and get a lower rate of interest.  That is good business and a reasonable approach.  People will not want to withdraw money unless some unforeseen circumstances crop up and if they do want to withdraw they should be allowed to do so at a reduced rate of interest.  It is unlikely there would be a run on the ACC which would seriously hinder their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been controversy as to whether the policy of ACC should be to gamble a little or take risks.  Deputy Tully thought they should; Deputy Smith seemed to think they should operate on a sort of gilt-edged security basis.  As I see it the ACC was created by statute in 1927 to provide a service, an agency for lending money to farmers, which existing lending agencies were unlikely to provide.  That is a fair description of what the corporation <Col N="1102" /> was founded to do.  I do not believe it should take unnecessary chances but neither do I believe it should refuse to lend on other than gilt-edged security.  In my opinion and experience the corporation have relaxed and are a little more flexible than they were.  I think they are doing a good job.  I can only speak from my experience in my own constituency &mdash;I shall come to that again.  I should think the fact that they have no bad debts and that they have 100 per cent repayments is perhaps evidence that they are not as flexible as they should be.  Therefore, I recommend that they should be more flexible.  I do not want them to lend even small sums to people borrowing for other than agricultural purposes but if there is a reasonable doubt as to whether a man will make good or not if put in funds, I think the corporation should err on the side of giving such a man a chance and allowing him credit.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to note that borrowing from the ACC has jumped from £6.8 million in 1968-69 to an estimated £18 million in 1972-73.  That is a healthy sign.  The fact that they have no bad debts is evidence that they are lending to the safest borrower and the most conservative community, the agricultural community, in the country.  The difficulty over the years was to prevail on the farmers to avail of credit, go into debt and build up their farms.  Up to not very long ago a farmer was not prepared to take a chance of putting a millstone around his neck or burden himself with debt. That was one of the difficulties in getting agriculture into action.  I am very pleased that one section of the agricultural community now seems to be providing the money to lend because it is mostly farmers who are investing in the ACC and other farmers are availing of the credit facilities provided. That is as it should be.  I cannot help thinking that the advice and propaganda of the farming organisations, notably the NFA, Macra na Feirme and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, and their encouragement of farmers to expand and to borrow money are largely responsible for the fact that so many farmers appear to be availing of the facilities.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> On a point of order, while the House was in recess because of the Government party not being here, the Parliamentary Secretary gave notice to the effect that he would become out of order if there was a quorum.  I had dealt with the borrowing and lending activities of the corporation.  It was suggested here today that lending rates should be reduced and that borrowing rates should be increased.  I appreciate that that seems a contradiction in terms but, nevertheless, it would be a good day's work if the Government decided to subsidise interest rates to the farming community because in that way they would be encouraging further the agricultural community to avail of the facilities provided by the corporation.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I would recommend that, as the corporation are costing the Exchequer nothing, the Government should consider seriously subsidising rates in certain circumstances.  I know this could not be done in individual cases, that it would have to be done in classes.  The rate of interest at 8½ per cent is rather high.  Of course, I appreciate that the corporation must pay a reasonable rate in order to attract money in but if possible the Government should subsidise the interest rate charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> This brings me to the point that I want to make in so far as my own constituency is concerned.  I do not think that in recent times the Agricultural Credit Corporation have realised the extent of inflation or the dramatic increase in the price of land. At present the corporation have a policy whereby they will give the full cost of a farm to a farmer who intends to buy it for the purpose of bringing his existing holding up to an economic level.  That is a sound policy.  As has been said here recently, the Land Commission are slow in their operations. This is not through any fault of their own but it causes frustration among people who are waiting for land.  Small progressive farmers with holdings of 30 or 35 acres should be encouraged in every way to purchase another 25 acres. Up to recently the Agricultural Credit Corporation were doing that but they have a regulation whereby they will not advance any more than £6,000.  That figure is out of date now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I come from a constituency where land, perhaps, fetches less than land in the average constituency but even at present £6,000 is in many cases insufficient to buy 30 or 40 acres, which amount would be required to bring a smallholder's farm up to economic level. I encountered the case of a man the other day who is, admittedly, one of the most progressive farmers in his area.  He lives in what would be regarded as the best part of Cavan, the region adjoining Meath.  His land is grossly overstocked and he is taking grass.  There was a farm for sale within a few miles of him which he wished to purchase, but in order to be able to do so he would either have to sell his stock completely or borrow more than £6,000.  Because of the policy of the corporation in confining their loans to £6,000, so far as I know this man was deprived of the opportunity of purchasing the farm and it is not likely that within the next ten or 20 years there will be any land available to the Land Commission in that vicinity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> I urge strongly that the corporation should now change this policy of confining their loans.  I am surprised that in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief there was no mention of land purchase in connection with the activities of the corporation.  In my constituency their most important activity would be the advancing of money to farmers who wish to bring their smallholdings up to economic standards.  I hope I will be forgiven if I have harped on that particular aspect and I urge the policy-making body of the corporation to make a revision there.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation are a worthwhile semi-State body.  It is refreshing to be able to discuss a semi-State body in these terms.  Many others are not as successful or are not doing as good a job as the corporation are.</P>

I hope the activities of the Agricultural Credit Corporation will continue and that the corporation will get sufficient money to finance its activities. My advice is to relax the rule &mdash;which, according to Deputy Tully, is inflexible&mdash;about the withdrawal notice.  If that is done I think the ACC will get more money and, if the Government will subsidise the corporation, then the corporation will be able to give more by way of interest to lenders and charge less to borrowers.</P>
      <P>The £6,000 limit must go.  It was the policy of the corporation to lend only to a farmer who was buying a farm in his own immediate vicinity. In the days of horses and carts that was a sound policy.  Now, with tractors and motor cars, it is not so important that the two farms should be adjacent. A few miles does not matter.</P>

      <P>The general agreement on this Bill is an indication of its importance.  We have always maintained that agriculture was starved for credit.  Had a measure like this been introduced five years ago the benefits would be quite evident now. When money is injected into agriculture the farmers automatically produce more; increased production on the land means increased employment.  If, in the past, some of the money invested in tourism and other industries had been invested in agriculture we would not today have the appalling high rate of unemployment that we have at the moment because, as a result of increased production on the land, there would be increased employment in the processing, the transport and the marketing of that agricultural produce. Fianna Fáil failed to realise that agriculture was our major industry and the sheet anchor of our economy and, by failing to make available sufficient credit to enable farmers to get the maximum potential from the land, the Government killed the goose that laid the golden egg.</P>
      <P>We are glad that this extra credit will now be available for farmers.  On the Minister's Estimate I was critical of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I am still a little disappointed because of loans refused to some applicants on whose behalf I made unsuccessful representations. I thought that they were creditworthy and that the loans should be forthcoming.  Since then I have had discussions with the area officers in Cork city and I have heard the other side of the story.</P>

    <P>It is necessary to have in this House an all-party committee that would have discussions and consultations with semi-State bodies, that would become conversant with the day-to-day workings of <Col N="1108" /> these semi-State bodies.  We are not in a position to tell our constituents what the position is in relation to these bodies.  Having had the opportunity of holding discussions with the area officers in Cork, the criticism I would have of the ACC is that, like some other State bodies, they seem to work behind closed doors and it is very difficult to get the information that is so necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not want to repeat what has already been said here over the last two hours.  Some very good points have been made and I should like to add my voice to that of a number of Deputies who referred to the smallholder who is anxious to enlarge his farm.  Every assistance possible should be made available to him.  The only other way in which he can reach a viable holding if sufficient credit is not available is through the Land Commission.  It is a few years since I started farming and I know from my experience in developing a small farm that it would be of greater assistance to the farming community if cheap credit were made available to them rather than the grants that are available at the present time. This is a personal view, but where there is, in particular, a dairy farmer who cannot reach the maximum herd because sufficient credit is not available to him, if the dairy farmer who is supplying milk to the creamery enters into a contract with the creamery to repay the instalments to the ACC, this should be security enough to enable him to obtain an advance in order to support himself and his wife and family.</P>
    <P>In every parish in rural Ireland today you have, say, two sons the second of whom, either through foolishness, lack of initiative, or whatever you like to call it, stays on the family farm. When the parents pass on the other son is left high and dry.  The only thing he was qualified to do was to farm efficiently because he was not reared to anything else.  The ACC should advance credit to such people to enable them to buy a farm.  The ACC should be enabled to come to the rescue of this second son who perhaps has emigrated and who, if he does not get the wherewithal to purchase a farm will be lost to the country.  However, a <Col N="1109" /> maximum grant of £6,000 is not relevant to present-day costings or to the high price of land and the increased costs of production.</P>
    <P>The question of co-operative farming was raised by Deputy Donegan.  I am very much afraid that some of our younger people have not a proper knowledge of the application of credit. A farmer's son takes over a farm and because his neighbour has a tractor, a harvester or some other machinery, he feels he must be in a similar position. There should be greater co-operation between the agricultural advisory service and the ACC.  When a farmer buys machinery he does not always realise that this machinery in which he has invested so much money will be lying idle for three-quarters of the year.  The advisory service should encourage three or four people to combine together so that one would have a tractor, another would have a muck spreader and another a silage harvester and so that there would be a pooling of this machinery.  I am rather surprised that the ACC and the other State agencies dealing with agriculture have not done more to encourage this kind of co-operation, because it is vitally important, particularly in our preparation for entry to the EEC.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary when he is replying to clarify a point for me.  It says here:</P>
    <P>Additional credit will also be required by agricultural processing industries, particularly the milk and pig-meat processing industries.</P>
    <P>I want to know if this is a new departure, or was this always available to processing factories and to bacon or pig-meat factories?  Processing, transport and everything else in connection with agriculture will have to be efficient. There is no point in having efficiency inside the farm gate unless there is efficiency right down the line to the consumer.  If efficiency is lacking this will reflect back to the producer, and it is the farming community that will suffer as a result.  If this is a new provision I want to welcome it because it can play a very important part in the development of agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is the question of whether the ACC should be more flexible.  A more <Col N="1110" /> appropriate phrase would be &ldquo;more generous&rdquo;.  As regards the extra money that is being made available under this Bill I should like to see some of it used in connection with the re-examination of some of the refusals that have been made in the past year or so in relation to making money available to people.  I can quote one case where a man borrowed money to buy a farm.  He got married and started to rear a family and because of the cost of rearing the family and the cost of trying to bring his farm into full production by applying lime, fertiliser and so on, he has not got over the initial debt he incurred.  I made a statement here in this regard that I thought it was because such people were already in debt that the ACC would not make money available to them.  Maybe this is not so and there is some other reason for it.  This is why I believe it is so necessary to have the all-party committee set up to engage in constant discussions with the semi-State bodies. I believe that many people in offices, although having the best intentions in the world, do not realise that when you buy a farm at present it will cost more than half the purchase price to stock it and to get it into working order. Farmers need a lot of credit for machinery and everything else that is required at present.</P>
    <P>The ACC did a very wise thing in setting up area offices because up to that time the position was that where a man was refused a loan by the ACC he only received a note saying that he was deemed to be ineligible, or words to that effect.  This gave the impression that you had a type of ivory tower decision.  Now you have the situation, for instance, that in Cork, where you have an area office, when a farmer requires credit he goes to this office and discusses the matter with the area officer.  It is necessary to show to the farming community that the ACC are human beings like everybody else and that you can go in and discuss your problems with them.</P>
    <P>I am not sure of the number of offices they have but I hope they will extend them to cover the country because in the years to come this will be a great advantage.  We have heard <Col N="1111" /> much talk about regional development within the context of the EEC.  I have been told that all this regional development will be channelled through the ACC.  Even though they have provided a very important service to the agricultural community up to now once we become members of the EEC the ACC will become far more important because it will be their responsibility to channel credit into regional development. In preparation for that there should be a further extension of area offices.</P>
    <P>We have heard about investment in the ACC and we have heard a number of people suggesting ways and means to do this.  If you had a greater incentive towards saving you would have, in turn, a greater investment in the ACC.  The ACC never get what is regarded as dead money which wealthy people lodge in banks.  I appeal to the farming community to invest in the ACC rather than leave money tied up in banks at very low interest rates.</P>
    <P>It was stated in the Parliamentary Secretary's brief that the total amount of loans on hire purchase issued by the Agricultural Credit Corporation has almost doubled during the past few years from £6.8 million in 1968 to an estimated £13.5 million in the current year.  We are glad to see this progress being made.  There is also an enormous increase in production costs.  If you take the position in relation to cattle, land and machinery it is very important that increased credit should become available. When a small farmer is anxious to purchase a farm quite close to him he can avail of credit from the ACC. You also have the bigger farmer fighting for credit.  I believe there is a strong case to be made for giving the smaller farmer a loan at a reduced rate of interest.  If we are serious about solving the flight from the land this is one way we could encourage them to stay at home.  The objective of every farmer, whether he owns ten acres, 20 acres or 100 acres, is to make his farm an economic holding and one important way we can do this is to give him credit at a reduced rate of interest.</P>
    <P>The fertiliser scheme has done more to improve farmers' incomes than any <Col N="1112" /> other scheme.  It is not too long ago since the Fianna Fáil Government realised grass is very essential but you cannot have good grass without fertilisers and lime.  The credit made available can be reflected in the green fields all over the country.</P>
    <P>We have the beef incentive bonus scheme and because of the appalling price paid for milk over the past two years people were forced to get out of milk and go over to beef.  I know from experience that the price of milk would not pay for the amount of effort put into producing it seven days a week.  When the farming community moved over to beef production you had the situation where the monthly cheque, bad and all as it was, stopped. In many cases where multi-suckling was involved, an investment had to be made in order to buy more calves. Some farmers put as many as four calves with a cow.  During the year the farmer had no income.  I am glad to know that the ACC came to the rescue of those people.  Many farmers were not aware that such credit could be obtained and many of them sold their stock at low prices.  The middleman came in and made the profit which the farmers should have made.</P>
    <P>The ACC through their advisory service should make known to the farming community that credit is available so that they will not have to sell their stock when prices are low. They could carry them over until they are two years old and make the maximum profit from them.  This is where the ACC can be of great benefit to the farming community.  In order to do that there must be proper liaison between the agricultural instructors and the ACC.  They are very familiar with the farming community.  They are very capable people, very interested in their job.  They know what is happening in their areas and they can transmit this information to the farming community.</P>
    <P>Is there any money available from the ACC to pay a debt already incurred? There are people who are anxious to get money from the ACC to pay off outstanding debts to the bank.  This is important and I should like to know if this can be done.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step in the right direction.  I welcome it and I want to <Col N="1113" /> point out to this House, and particularly to the Government, the important role which the ACC can play in the development of agriculture, in getting maximum results.  We should encourage people who have money to invest, to invest it in the ACC.  Somebody already mentioned an appeal to our emigrants. There are Irish people working in other countries who have made money and who would be anxious to invest if they knew of this.  I wish the ACC well and I hope they will continue to do their work and to improve the farmer's income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I agree entirely with the Parliamentary Secretary as regards the urgent need to increase the resources of the ACC to keep pace with the growing demand for agricultural credit. We on this side of the House have faith in the farmers.  The ACC now seem to have faith in them.  I think it is agreed by all that 1972 will be heavy with destiny for the people of this country because political decisions taken in the referendum will settle the future of our country for years to come.  The farmers have been in the front line trenches in many wars in the past&mdash;national, social and economic. They and their labourers saved our people from starvation by hard work during the last war.  I have no doubt now that if the farmers get what they will need in the years ahead, more and more money, they will be able to put this country on its feet and provide employment for those who unfortunately have had to emigrate and indeed for the unemployed in our midst at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed in the Bill to enable the ACC to raise money in foreign currencies.  I agree with what Deputy Creed said with regard to incentives to save and the appeals he has made to Irish people abroad to take an interest in their own country and if they have spare money to invest it in the ACC.  By doing that they will be proving that they have faith in their country; they will be investing in its future and perhaps in the future of their children because if this country prospers as we would all like to see it prosper there could be jobs here to <Col N="1114" /> which they or their children could return.</P>
    <P>I think we should also appeal for repatriation of at least some of our external assets.  Deputy O'Donovan knows more about this than I do.  I think we have £400 million in external assets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <P>We should appeal for some of that money to be brought home and invested here.  We should also appeal to people who have money lying dormant at very low rates of interest.  Many of those people have been afraid to take a chance in the past.  They have left their money in the bank at low rates of interest.  Any of us who can help to mould public opinion should try to get those people, in their own interest, and in the interest of the nation, to have faith in the farmers, to have faith in the future of the country and to invest their money here where they will get a good rate of interest and where undoubtedly it is quite safe.  We should all be interested in the future of our people. It should be pointed out to those people that the prosperity of all our people depends on what the farmer and his labourer can get from the land and export profitably.  Since we have very little underground wealth the prosperity of each and every one of us, in the last analysis, depends upon this.  It is of the utmost importance that we should appeal to those people, whether they be Irish people at home with money lying dormant or people abroad, to invest here.  They will get good interest rates and their money will be safe because it is backed by the State.  The figures we have got from the ACC prove that it is good business to lend to the farmers, that 99.9 per cent of them meet their commitments and live up to their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture is under-capitalised.  The only fault I find with this Bill is that I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has gone far enough.  We need <Col N="1115" /> a massive injection not of £70 million over the next few years but, as many experts have pointed out, we almost need a yearly injection of £70 million for the next five years.  What is needed at present is a well-defined programme or plan for agriculture, particularly with the prospect of our entry into the EEC.  We have 12 million acres of fertile, arable soil.  We have the grass. The people, perhaps, may not have believed in it in the past but late conversions are no harm and we have the people to work it.  However, most people realise that the land is not worked to its full potential and we may ask why.  The answer any farmer, agricultural inspector or person connected with agriculture will give you is that the land is not worked to its full potential today because of shortage of money.  The Parliamentary Secretary was quite right in stating that the expanded demand for credit will accelerate in the next few years.  It certainly will and we must be prepared for it.  Therefore, I submit we are not going far enough in this Bill.</P>
    <P>We may ask where is the planning we should have today for agriculture? Where is the design for the future of agriculture?  The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have been too conservative and lacking in initiative. The Department and the ACC must become more active and more alive to the situation and they and the farmers' organisations must work together to have a proper plan for the injection of £70 million per annum into agriculture, not that figure over a period of several years.</P>
    <P>After all, agriculture is the foundation of the country's economy.  As I pointed out earlier, if the people on the land are more prosperous so will the whole nation.  If they are poor on the land the whole nation will be poor. Therefore, more and more agricultural credit is necessary.  So far, those concerned with agricultural credit have been doing a good job throughout the years.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is necessary to point to the disparity between investment in agriculture and industry.  According to figures given by the Parliamentary <Col N="1116" /> Secretary, investment in agriculture in 1972 is unlikely to exceed £18 million. We can compare that with the £95 million which it is expected to expend in industry.  I have always said we should endeavour to bring those two arms of our economy closer together but I think in the matter of investment the reverse should be the case.  According to all the experts, we must have massive extra investment in agriculture. We have 12 million acres of land. Roughly 11 million is grassland.  We must remember we have the best grassland in the world.  Because agriculture is undercapitalised&mdash;admittedly grants are available to bring land up to proper fertility&mdash;that grassland is carrying only 1.7 million cattle, 200,000 heifers, 1.1 million beef cattle for sale, 2.8 million others, totalling 5.8 million.  If agriculture were properly financed by an extra £70 million a year we could sustain at least, according to the experts, 5 million cows, 1 million heifers, 1 million culled cows and 3.5 million beef cattle of 10 cwt. for sale each year. That would be an output of £1,490 million, compared with our present output of £470 million.  This, adjusted to Common Market prices, would mean an increase of £1,020 million.  This would be good for the whole country and it would help to solve the problem of 80,000 unemployed by providing useful employment.</P>
    <P>I believe our farmers would and could meet this challenge if given proper leadership, backed up by proper services and proper finances from the ACC.  The farmers of Ireland represent 28 per cent of the population; they are responsible for more than 65 per cent of total exports; yet they have for themselves only 17 per cent of the national income.  We all know of the misinformed opinions given of the farming community which have helped to bedevil them for so long. What is needed at the moment is an injection of capital each year to the extent I have mentioned.  This would make agriculture more efficient and more competitive in EEC conditions.</P>
