      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves:</P>
      <P>The Agreement on the Implementation of a European Project on Pollution, on the topic &ldquo;Analysis of Organic Micro-Pollutants in Water&rdquo;</P>
      <P>a copy of which Agreement was laid on the table of Dáil Éireann on 2nd day of February, 1972.</P>
      <P>This project forms part of the European Co-operative Programme in Science and Technology in which 19 countries are taking part.  This programme was initiated by the European Economic Community.  In addition to the EEC member-countries, including the three new member states, ten other European countries are participating in the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motivation behind the programme is the realisation in western European countries that the scale of research and development required to deal with many current problems is increasingly beyond the resources of single European countries.  It is felt that these problems could best be dealt with by the pooling of the efforts of <Col N="976" /> European countries in joint research and development programmes.</P>
    <P>The exploratory work for the programme commenced in 1967 in a number of sectors.  A number of the projects which have been considered have reached the operational stage.  At a ministerial meeting on Science and Technology in Brussels, agreements have been signed by various countries in relation to the particular projects in which they propose to participate. Ireland has signed the agreement relating to the project dealing with the analysis of micro-pollutants in water, as well as indicating its willingness to participate in four other major projects.</P>
    <P>The aim of the micro-pollutants project is the development of methods for analysing as completely as possible organic micro-pollutants in water.  It is hoped that the project will result in the development of instrumentation enabling rapid and automatic analyses to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The results of the project should extend considerably our knowledge of the organic micro-pollutants present in water.  This is a subject of growing concern because of the increasing diversity and complexity of effluent residues present in water, which may give rise to hazards to public health through various pathways such as drinking water, irrigation, food chains, <i>et cetera</i>.  The immediate interest is in fresh water but the methods developed will be largely applicable also to sea water.  The project will also facilitate the tracing of the origin of micro-pollutants and the assessment of the efficacy of treatment methods in removing them.</P>
    <P>A copy of the agreement on the Implementation of a European Project on Pollution on the topic &ldquo;Analysis of Organic Micro-Pollutants in Water&rdquo; has been laid before the House I recommend this agreement to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For some reason, I have not been circulated with a copy of the Parliamentary Secretary's introductory speech and I hope I have taken in what he said correctly. Why the departure from precedent in this particular respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> The agreement is one we certainly support, but there are a couple of points I should like to raise.  If I understand the Parliamentary Secretary correctly, he said this primarily concerns fresh water but it may have some application to sea water also. We have relatively more sea water than fresh water around us and we would, I think, be more concerned that the sea water implications of this research would be fully developed and that we would benefit from that. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Irish contribution.  What is to be the Irish contribution?  Where sea water is concerned there would be special problems in areas like Dublin Bay and Cork Harbour.  I understand the agreement makes provision in cases where countries do not wish to carry out this work to help to finance research in those countries.  That would imply that we would undertake research on our own.  Who will undertake such research here?  Unless I missed something, I did not gather what in fact is intended.  Will we undertake research here and who will do it?  Where will the Irish project be located?  What shape and form will it take?  It is rather curious that the agreement should be presented without giving any explanation as to how the work will be carried on here, or whether it will be carried on here.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the contribution.  I can see how the contributions were arrived at.  A minimum limit was apparently fixed and we fall within that limit, but the effect of that system would be that the scale of contributions between countries would be in no way proportionate to their size and gross national income or to the amount of fresh water involved. That would obviously operate to our detriment because it seems to me that our contribution per head as a percentage of GNP would be ten times that of, say, France.  This would seem to me to be excessive.  Is there any reason why our contribution could not be related to the scale of our resources?  Perhaps we have a particular interest and perhaps we intend to make a major contribution. If that is so, the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="978" /> remained silent on that aspect. He could have told us plainly what the cost would be, how our share was arrived at, what the proportions would be and why our proportion was disproportionate to our resources.  The sum is small but, if we accept the proportion, we could be levied with a totally disproportionate sum in proportion to our economic strength.  If these agreements multiplied, as they will in the context of the EEC, the burden would be considerable.  It seems to me the Government have a duty not to concede any proportion which could be used against us in subsequent negotiations covering other international agreements about sharing the cost between the countries involved.  The Parliamentary Secretary has a duty to tell us how the figures were arrived at and to assure us that the figures arrived at will not work to our detriment on future occasions in relation to other agreements.</P>
    <P>I also want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to what extent this research is intended to produce solutions to the problem.  The agreement does not seem to contemplate that but, in his closing phrases, I think he did say that the project would involve an assessment of the efficacy of treatment methods in removing micro-pollutants. How far will that go?  Is it merely designed to test whether existing methods are, in fact, efficacious or will the project draw conclusions of a constructive kind designed to provide guidance for the development of future methods of dealing with pollution?</P>
    <P>It is important to know how far this project goes because the agreement itself is not very specific on these points as I read it and the Parliamentary Secretary has not brought matters much further.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points I should like to make.  I am pressing for a fuller explanation on the financial side so that we will have some information as to who will do what work in this country.  Or, are we in the position where, despite the very grave need to undertake work of this kind here&mdash;and certainly to do it as part of international policy would be very beneficial&mdash;we <Col N="979" /> are exporting our contribution and paying somebody else to do some work somewhere else?  Is that the case or is the work to be done here and, if so, by whom?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be very brief and all I should like to say on behalf of the Labour Party is that this kind of international co-operation is welcome.  We believe there are other areas in which it could be used.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat hypocritical for the Government to make such high-sounding utterances here this morning about the benefits of this project dealing with pollution while in our capital city we have two canals running through its centre and it does not need any research by experts to show that they are very heavily polluted.  The Government are now entering into co-operation with 18 other countries&mdash;at some considerable expense, I presume, although we did not get the figure&mdash;and, at the same time, we can see the condition of these two canals which are in the ownership of a State-sponsored body directly responsible to a Minister.  I sincerely hope the representatives of the other 18 nations will not visit Dublin and see the condition of these two canals and judge our earnestness by what they see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this project.  I recently attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Rome where many countries submitted views on this subject.  The vast majority of them are very concerned about the way things are going and if we do not take some action on an international scale we shall have nothing left to preserve.  It is the general feeling in Rome that developed countries should in the main subscribe to this type of research as they were the countries that could afford to do it and that the greatest percentage of finance for this type of research should come from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy representing west Cork where we shall have pretty extensive development entailing some danger of sea pollution, I am very interested in this type of development.  Perhaps Deputy FitzGerald has something when he says we should know what cost is <Col N="980" /> involved for us but we should not take the cost into account so much as the value of any projects undertaken on an international scale as far as we are concerned.  As an island we have a vested interest in the protection of our sea water and our fresh water also, both from the tourist and the survival points of view, in that we need fresh water to survive.</P>
    <P>In general, pollution can only be controlled on an international scale. The micro-pollutants in water require very advanced research of which I do not think we would be capable.  We on this side of the House welcome all such agreements on this scale.  We could even go much further and use the international forum as a place in which we could put pressure on developed countries to ensure that they allocate some of their vast resources for this much needed research.</P>
    <P>In west Cork at the moment we are concerned that all necessary steps are taken by the people who will be erecting oil refineries in the Bantry area to ensure there will be no pollution of our sea.  By the time they have obtained full planning permission I think almost every risk will have been covered and the danger will be absolutely negligible. Nevertheless, the dangers are there and that is where an agreement of this kind can be of enormous benefit to us especially if it produces any worthwhile solution to the problem.  I shall be brief in order to give others an opportunity to speak, but I welcome the agreement wholeheartedly and hope it will pave the way towards further agreements on the problem of pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome any international co-operation on this very important matter.  Unfortunately pollution has reached such an advanced stage in many countries that they have had to spend enormous sums in recreating a water supply. What puzzles me is that we on these benches have been pressing for legislation on pollution from the Government and there has been no response. We have been told that they will introduce legislation.  The Government must have known, having studied all the implications of EEC and so on, that <Col N="981" /> some form of international legislation such as this would be put forward and therefore it seems extraordinary that the Government did not put their own house in order by having an antipollution Bill here long ago.</P>
      <P>Anybody who imagines that pollution does not exist in this country should think again.  One need only lean over the Liffey wall and sniff to know that the Liffey is entirely polluted. The same applies to the Lee in Cork which is also heavily polluted. If one wants to get an infective bronchitis or sore throat one can get both out of either the Lee or the Liffey by breathing the pollution coming up from these rivers.  There is also advanced pollution in many areas of Europe and although we are an island the pollution existing in Europe and in their major waterways&mdash;which are considerable&mdash;eventually finds its way to the sea and reaches our shores. That applies not only to sewage pollution but to oil and other forms of pollution that are gaining ground every day in every part of the world.</P>
      <P>Another factor which is largely responsible for pollution is the extensive use of detergents and this is something that has only come into existence in the past 20 or 30 years.  This negatives treatment works and produces pollution.  The Government have been extremely remiss in the matter of pollution.  It is an extraordinary thing that when we are discussing this subject and bringing our provisions up to international level, it is a Parliamentary Secretary, and not a Minister, who should deal with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I signed the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is important enough to warrant the attendance of a Minister.  The Parliamentary Secretary accepts that pollution exists and is a vital problem. Will he give us some idea of what the thinking is at Government level?  I should like to know what plans the Government have to deal with pollution whether from sewage, silage waste or other causes.  Is it the intention to introduce legislation to deal with this or are we to go into Europe <Col N="982" /> as the only country of the Nine who have taken no action on pollution?  I do not know what reasons our Minister will be able to produce for our failure to deal with pollution.</P>
      <P>In addition to the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary, he should indicate, as Deputy FitzGerald has asked, what exactly the agreement entails.  Will it mean that we will have to pay a vast sum, disproportionate to our population and to our economic position, towards the analysis of pollutants?  The House is entitled to that information.</P>
      <P>In the context of our entry into Europe, the Government should have prepared briefs on the matter of pollution and be able to give the House more information than is contained in the meagre statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary.  My sympathies are with the Parliamentary Secretary.  He has been sent in here as a small boy because no Minister can face the House and explain why nothing has been done about pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>This, of course, is a very important document to which the Parliamentary Secretary has appended his signature.  With respect to Deputy Esmonde, let me say that Deputy Noel Lemass is quite capable and more than able to deal with any problem that we may have to bring before the House.  He has proved his ability in this and other respects.</P>
      <P>I am a fresh water fisherman&mdash;for brown trout, for the benefit of Deputy Bruton who finds the whole thing a bit of a joke.  Pollution is a very serious matter.  I took the opportunity during the summer recess to go to County Cavan, where I have connections. My membership of the Inland Fisheries Trust entitles me to fish on Lough Sheelin.  At the time Lough Sheelin was an open sewer, a receptacle for effluent from the surrounding area.  Everybody knows where the effluent is coming from and where it is going to and the damage it causes and yet the situation continues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of credit for publicity in relation to the condition of Lough <Col N="983" /> Sheelin must go to Mr. Burrows, the fishing correspondent of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  I thoroughly agree with what he says.  If the lakes are not protected there will not be a fish left in them. If there is a good breeze, it clears the scum off the top of Lough Sheelin and it is possible to get a fairly decent fish but if there is a calm extending over a week or two, a scum forms on the top, in places to a depth of one foot.  We must protect our heritage.  I protest in the strongest possible terms against the destruction of places like Lough Sheelin.</P>
    <P>The right to fish is not the preserve of any individual or group of individuals. Fishing is not exclusively a rich man's pastime.  There are many lakes accessible to people who pay £1 to the Inland Fisheries Trust.  They can go on any lake under the preserve of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  May I pay a special tribute to the Trust who are doing a wonderful job against all the odds?  There is lack of co-operation. The Trust have produced reports and continue to do so.</P>
    <P>There are wonderful lakes in Connemara, many of which are free fishing lakes and which are pollution-free and will remain so unless a factory is sited on a nearby mountain from which effluent is discharged into the lakes.</P>
    <P>If the agreement that the Parliamentary Secretary has signed will bring about a situation where we can preserve our heritage, he will have done a wonderful job for the country.  If in the next 20 years people discover that our heritage has been polluted they will want to know the reason why.  In future people will have more leisure time and will be looking for places in which to spend this time.</P>
    <P>Anybody who suggests placing an oil refinery in the vicinity of Killiney Bay &mdash;the Bay of Naples of Ireland&mdash;has a damn cheek.  It is incredible that anyone would suggest a plan under which oil tankers would come into Killiney Bay to offload.  I will not go any further than that because I believe it is way outside the actual terms of the debate.  I deeply appreciate the indulgence of the <Col N="984" /> Chair, but I feel very strongly about this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I had known he was so indulgent this morning.  I would have said a lot more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel very strongly about the whole matter of pollution. We have an obligation to ensure that our country is pollution-free in every respect.  We have not got a bad record on this, in the main, in comparison with other countries.  One just needs to go to Germany to see the open sewer running through the heart of the country, the Rhine.  About ten or 15 years ago there was a wonderful fish known as the Rhine salmon.  There is not a fish to be seen in that river now. Going along the banks of the Rhine we had to describe it, unfortunately, as an open sewer, no more, no less.  I say that without any denigration of the hospitality we received from our German friends during our visit to their country.  That is the reality.</P>
      <P>The Liffey is no more, no less, than that.  I am very pleased that the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and I am sure that this is in addition to what the Parliamentary Secretary has signed&mdash; has said that this problem will be solved in the not-too-distant future and that Anna Livia Plurabelle will be that once more rather than Anna Livia &ldquo;Plurasmell&rdquo;.  Forgive the crudity; it is a rather heavy-handed joke, but there is a certain seriousness in it, nevertheless.  I want once more to thank the Parliamentary Secretary for carrying out this very important function on behalf of the country, and to thank the House and the Chair for their indulgence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was even funnier than he realised.  That is the funniest speech I heard in this House for a long time, with all respect to the Parliamentary Secretary who was being serious about it and who did not intend to be very funny.  First of all, he compliments the Parliamentary Secretary on the signing of the agreement.  The motion reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the Agreement on the Implementation <Col N="985" /> of a European Project on Pollution...</P>
    <P>He then proceeds to tell us about the situation in Europe.  He talks about the Rhine.  If we have to look to the standards in the EEC at present and try to apply those standards to this country, the Liffey and the Boyne and every other river will be like the Rhine before very long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>What is funny about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is funny because obviously the Parliamentary Secretary did not appreciate&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will accept that the Parliamentary Secretary may think that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it.  I am just being funny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This is his funny morning. He talked about his fishing experience in Cavan.  I was born and reared within a stone's throw of the lake he talked about and I know that over the past few years it has become polluted.  Who is responsible for that?  In my opinion there are three factors causing pollution not only in Cavan but in other rivers and lakes throughout the country.  Something should be done by the Government apart from signing an EEC treaty. The first cause of pollution is industrial effluent which should be stopped, and there is a way of stopping it.  The second cause is effluent from silage pits which can also be stopped, and the third is raw sewage from towns and villages.  No serious effort has been made by the Government to do anything about pollution and we are supposed to stand up and cheer because the Parliamentary Secretary tells us that this agreement has been signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was also being funny when he said that in the years to come people would have more free time to fish. They will, unless we have a change of Government.  Many people will have nothing to do except fish because no <Col N="986" /> effort is being made to find employment for the thousands of people who are seeking it.  I meet a lot of people who spend their time fishing&mdash;I am not quite sure whether they are giving the worm a bath or fishing because, in some of the places they are fishing, there is not much chance of catching anything.  They are passing the time between their visits to the labour exchange. It is ludicrous for the Parliamentary Secretary, who is an intelligent man, to come in here this morning and treat us to this sort of thing when we know that, unless the Government decide to make an all-out effort to deal with the situation, all the agreements in the world will not have any effect.</P>
    <P>I think&mdash;and I mentioned this previously in the House and elsewhere&mdash; it is extraordinary that the only method of sewage disposal is the old-fashioned system of piping it out to sea, or allowing raw sewage to flow into running streams or into a septic tank.  We have now reached the stage where nearly all the reasonable sites where there is no public sewerage are used up, and local authorities and planning authorities are refusing planning permission. They claim there are too many septic tanks and there is no sewage disposal and, therefore, with a growing population, we will be in serious difficulty. The amount of suitable building land available is getting smaller every day. Because of this the cost of building sites is increasing.  If a smaller number of sites is available naturally the demand is greater.  The whole thing is tied up with the Planning Act and its interpretation by local authorities.  My local authority are attempting to operate the Planning Act and are about to revise the county plan.  This question looms large in that attempt. What can we do about the despoilation of so many places by pollution?  No serious effort seems to be made.</P>
    <P>One thing which was not referred to so far and which I think should be referred to is the question of air pollution. I drive on the Dublin-Belfast road every morning and, at the time I come in, there are many vehicles on the road, particularly many lorries, and particularly many Northern Ireland lorries.  In the main they have no <Col N="987" /> number plate on the back or they have a different number plate on the back and on the front.  They are blowing out poison as they drive along.  They cannot do that in the North, and why should they be allowed to do it here? I wonder do they use a different type of oil when they come in here?  We talk about the danger of lung cancer from cigarette smoking but breathing the polluted air in this city is a greater hazard than cigarette smoking.  Nobody seems to be enforcing the law.</P>
    <P>The matters which give rise to serious complaint can be dealt with under existing law but nobody seems to give two damns about it.  Nobody is prepared to enforce the law.  If the Parliamentary Secretary is really serious about doing something about pollution he should not mind the signing of this document.  It is grand in its way.  It looks nice.  We have our name on another international document.  The sensible thing to do is to start from square one and use the existing legislation to prevent air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution which is also happening at present.  Those are my comments on the matter before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a narrow motion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So we thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which asks the Dáil to approve the agreement on the Implementation of a European Project on the specific topic, &ldquo;Analysis of Organic Micro-Pollutants in Water&rdquo;.  I am very pleased to see it before the House.  I hope that when the House approves it the Government agency responsible for representing Ireland in its implementation will press for as speedy and as large-scale a development as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the causes of pollution.  Generally, they are due to domestic sewage in the main, but becoming nearly as large a cause is effluent from the land as a result of the application of artificial fertilisers, and particularly in Lough Sheelin you have slurry from pig farms.  These types of effluent have different types of reactions on the water they enter and their <Col N="988" /> effect has to be scientifically determined in order that the scientists may find the answers and arrive at a solution.  The scientific knowledge available to us and to Europe generally and the means of measuring pollution are defective in the sense that they are not able to provide the full information necessary scientifically to cure pollution and this topic we have been discussing is designed to come up with an answer to that.</P>
    <P>In Lough Ennel in Westmeath we have a problem that needs as part of its solution a more detailed analysis than is at present possible.  Going into that lake there is raw sewage from Mullingar and consequently Westmeath County Council must take some blame. However, we pass a lot of blame to the Government, in the <i>persona</i> of the Department of Local Government, in their failure to assist us in our efforts at an improvement.  Part of the difficulty in making improvements there is due to inability to find the exact type of sewage in Lough Ennel, a mixture of domestic sewage and agricultural effluent.</P>
    <P>The present measuring systems and the systems of analysis are defective in determining the proportions of the different types of effluent in the water and consequently of determining how they should be tackled.  In so far as this motion is geared to improve that situation it is welcome.</P>
    <P>The position in Sheelin is pretty bad.  It is due to a new type of sewage, and whether we like it or not it is here to stay.  One of the types of pollution in Lough Sheelin comes from what I shall call the industrialisation of agriculture in so far as intensive farming involves the use of artificial fertilisers, and industrialisation of pig farming in that there are now pig factories in that area which are discharging an immense amount of slurry, pig manure in other words. This is finding its way into neighbouring streams and eventually into Sheelin.  Lakes in Leitrim are being polluted and if Lough Gowna becomes heavily polluted the entire Erne waterway system can become polluted by agricultural, not urban sources.</P>
    <P>Our scientific knowledge is not sufficiently wide to enable us to analyse <Col N="989" /> this to the degree necessary to find a solution.  I have no doubt science will provide a solution.  This motion makes us part of a European problem in which the resources of all the European countries may be used to find a scientific solution.  I disagree with Deputy Tully that we should not take a headline from Europe.  Perhaps we should not, but we should take a warning from Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>We should ensure that our waterways do not become like theirs and we are heading fast in that direction.  We must prepare our defences in time, which they did not do in Europe, and this motion is in the forefront of our defences because the analysis of the causes is the first step towards the cure.  I welcome the motion and urge the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government to ensure that whichever State agency are charged with co-operating in this matter will, if they find any slowness on the part of our European colleagues, take the lead.</P>

      <P>He has not finished. Deputy Esmonde said nothing is being done.  Of course something is being done.  Quite a lot is being done, but the question is: are we doing enough?  Deputy Tully said it is a job for the Government.  This is not so, because he must appreciate that pollution begins with people, not with governments, and unless we get the message across to each person that he has a part to play, that he has a grave responsibility, we could reach a stage in the future when the human race could not go on existing.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and during the programme there was a shot of the refuse problem in New York city which is getting out of hand.  We appreciated how much more polluted they are than us.  We are not over-industrialised or over-populated and we still have time to learn from the mistakes of others and make every possible effort to ensure that this country will not become as bad.  Let each of us play his part.  Another Deputy mentioned the Rhine, the sewer of Europe, and I note that a new scheme for cleaning it has been announced at a cost of £100 million.  The work is to be undertaken by Germany, Switzerland and the other countries affected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that in the Deputy's mind an attack on Fianna Fáil was synonymous with an attack on Labour.  In England the Greater London Council are attempting to <Col N="991" /> solve the problem of the Thames.  The Thames was so polluted that at one time if a person fell into the river it meant instant death for him.  However, the Thames has been cleaned and in some stretches of the river there is fish life and the authorities are hopeful that at some stage marine life will return to the entire river. Shipping traffic on the Thames is tremendous, and when we see what has been done to clean up that river we need not be too despondent about the Liffey, because the problem here is much smaller.  As Deputy Andrews pointed out, Anna Livia Plurabelle may not be so &ldquo;plurabelle&rdquo; at the moment but the problem is not insuperable.</P>
      <P>In the new Planning Bill I hope there will be some provisions to deal with possible pollution problems.  It might be possible to have &ldquo;no go&rdquo; areas for certain industries.  In the war against pollution it would save considerable money and time if we had some rules and regulations regarding the location of industries which might cause pollution.  In a few months' time the Dodder river will be cleaned and this should help in the fight against pollution of the Liffey.  I hope this measure will be our first step in playing our part in the struggle against pollution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is discussing a most vital and urgent problem and I welcome any international co-operation to tackle the problem of pollution.  Pollution can have serious effects on the citizens of this country.  I hope the statement made by the Parliamentary Secretary will not be used as an excuse by the Government to do nothing about the problem.  However, I am afraid it may be used in the future as an excuse and that the Government may just await the results of international surveys. The danger may arise that national legislation will be shelved pending reports of international surveys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad so many Members of the House have contributed generously to this important debate.  I should like to bring to the attention of the <Col N="992" /> Parliamentary Secretary the serious problem of the pollution of beaches with tar and oil.  When our beaches are polluted it means we must face a considerable loss in our tourist trade and many of our tourist resorts suffer.</P>
    <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister for Local Government would work together on this matter useful and practical work could be done.  The first practical step which could be taken to combat pollution is to get the Department of Local Government to increase considerably allocations under the Sanitary Services Acts to the local authorities.  Many of our rivers, canals and lakes are destroyed completely because local authorities cannot act in the matter.</P>
    <P>There are various forms of pollution. In my constituency, when pigs are killed in the bacon factories the river is red for three-quarters of a mile.  Surely it is not outside the scope of modern engineering to prevent this kind of pollution.  In a heavily populated area this pollution causes a very bad stench and there is evidence that where industrial waste and discharge from agricultural undertakings including pig farms, is allowed to flow into rivers the fish stock is destroyed.  Can the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what steps will be taken to prevent the destruction of our fisheries?  In this country we have some of the finest coarse fishing in the world and we should not stand idly by and allow it to be destroyed.  This will happen if we do not introduce suitable legislation and take the necessary preventive action.  Failure by the Government to take practical action means the fish stock is being diminished.  I hope the Government will remedy this and take some practical action.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what steps are being taken to ensure that local authorities close the open sewers that exist in most of our provincial towns. A report was submitted by a principal school teacher in my constituency that 195 children cannot use a playground because of defective sewers.  Surely we can act on these problems without waiting for an example from Europe? <Col N="993" /> We should not have to wait for standards to be set for us in Europe in relation to this kind of pollution. In 1972 our fisheries should not be destroyed because of pollution.  Many public protests have been made about the open sewers in our towns and villages.  We do not need a headline from Europe to get rid of this problem. All we need is initiative and energy to tackle the problem and ensure that open sewers are not discharged into our rivers and canals.</P>
    <P>The use of septic tanks and dry toilets should have been discontinued long ago.  In many areas in the midlands there are open sewers.  Some areas have no proper sanitary facilities and we see loads and buckets of what we can describe as human offal being brought to the rivers or buried near the rivers.  This constitutes a menace to public health and a disgrace to civilisation.  No part of Europe is as primitive as parts of this country after 50 years of our own Government.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary visit parts of my constituency where there are neither water nor sewerage facilities and human offal has to be buried near where a large section of the rural population live. The stench is intolerable.  Gas masks should be supplied.  The River Barrow and the river which runs through Tullamore have been described as seriously polluted because of open sewage flowing into them.  The public have protested about it over the years. Must we wait until standards are imposed from Europe before steps are taken to deal with pollution?</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore and Deputy FitzGerald have referred to the pollution of the River Liffey.  An effort is to be made to clean our waterways and our beaches.  An effort is also being made to construct an oil refinery near the city.  This has been referred to by Deputy Andrews.  I admire Killiney and Dublin Bay.  It would be a great pity to spoil that area by constructing an oil refinery nearby.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will tell us of the Government proposals in relation to pollution.  Have the Government any plans to close in open sewers? Are there any proposals for suitable <Col N="994" /> sewage tanks so that sewage will not flow into our rivers and canals?  It should not be beyond the bounds of engineering ability to cope with this problem so that fish life in the rivers and the lakes will not be destroyed.</P>
    <P>There have been fish deaths in the River Brosna.  This has been brought to the attention of the Inland Fisheries Trust.  The Inland Fisheries Trust is one of the most progressive and outstanding organisations in the country. They have shown practical progress. They have commented on the way the coarse fishing and the brown trout fishing have been seriously affected by the failure of the Government to take practical steps by giving the local authorities financial assistance to pay for the necessary remedies to this problem. Legislation is necessary to deal with such matters.  The general public cannot tolerate the situation indefinitely. The general standard of health calls for serious action in relation to immediate preventive measures to avoid pollution.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about open sewers in our towns.  I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to come to Daingean in my constituency to see the open sewers flowing through the town.</P>

      <P>These remarks will focus public attention on the serious wrongs being inflicted on people.  The Parliamentary Secretary should try to influence his colleagues in the Government to introduce legislation to deal with pollution because they are responsible and they must give financial support to deal with it.  I have spoken to people who know that industrial discharge is responsible for some of the pollution in our waterways. They are anxious to apply remedies but the remedies are expensive and there is no State aid to assist <Col N="995" /> them in providing the proper tanks to prevent the pollution.  We are committed to this matter on an international scale.  Let us not use that as an excuse for delaying the introduction of legislation.  The House would then have an opportunity of discussing this serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support this motion in respect of the Agreement on the Implementation of a European Project on Pollution.  My only regret is that the motion is so confined and restricted as to apply only to water.  It is understandable that, in a small community such as ours, if we are to grapple effectively with the problems of pollution, we shall have to seek the aid and advice of the larger communities throughout the world.  To deal effectively with this problem is beyond the resources of any one small country. Therefore, we can see the sense of seeking to deal with the problem by pooling the efforts of all the European countries in the matter of a research and a development programme.  I am sorry that we are dealing with the matter in a rather piecemeal way.  The pollution of water is very important but so also is pollution of the air and of the land. I appreciate that the measure is restricted but I am bound to say that I do not see any worthwhile breakthrough or achievement in the matter of dealing with the whole problem of pollution until and unless we put our house in order and set aside the present unsatisfactory position whereby pollution seems to be the responsibility of no particular Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the Chair has already pointed out that we are not dealing with pollution, we are just dealing with an agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I merely mention this in passing.  It is all right seeking the support of European countries to deal effectively with water pollution, but what we need most of all is to have one piece of legislation and one Minister dealing with the whole matter of pollution.  I think the responsibility is spread over several Departments <Col N="996" /> of State.  It would seem that the Minister for Local Government is primarily responsible but here today we have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, who represents in the main the Board of Works, coming in and dealing with this aspect of pollution in so far as it affects the European Community.  This is indicative of the grossly unsatisfactory state of affairs.</P>
      <P>We know well that we need more effective legislation to deal with the pollution of our rivers, lakes and sea coasts.  We know that, in respect of planning, industry in this country has got away with too much for far too long without the kind of restraints and restrictions which a good Government should apply to ensure that new industries do not add to our pollution problem. Many of them have done untold damage by allowing effluent pollute our waters.  Our laws are not sufficiently rigid in that regard.  However, it is good to see that our planning officers are more rigid of late in ensuring that a proposed industry is properly vetted.  We now have the advice of bodies such as the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and An Foras Forbartha to ensure that they conform to the best standards in respect of hygiene and the like.</P>
      <P>There is simply no control at all over the effluent from farmyards.  The experts tell us that the effluent from piggeries and silo pits is the most toxic, the most devastating of all, and it has been responsible for the elimination of fish life in many of our rivers and lakes.  There is unbridled liberty in this regard.  I understand that one hardly requires planning permission for the erection of a pig byre or a silo pit.  This is a truly deplorable state of affairs.</P>
      <P>We have been guilty of some mortal sins in this whole matter.  Large industries erected on lakesides are appalling spectacles.  It is bad enough to see hotels being built in these places of great scenic beauty, but to see crude factories erected there and to see obvious pollution going into the air, spilling out on the land and into the sea and rivers is deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As yet our country is very largely <Col N="997" /> unspoiled.  We see the signs of pollution all round us, but it has not reached the stage we have witnessed in European countries.  Now is the time to put our house in order.  Our country is largely unspoiled but with the kind of apathy and indifference I see it could rapidly become as polluted as the modern progressive countries of Europe.  We escaped the effects of the Industrial Revolution.  We are starting off from a very firm and sound base and, if we avail of the research, the information and the development programme of the combined effort of the European countries, we can prevent the disaster which has happened in so many countries.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of attending the International Parliamentary Conference on the Environment in Vienna in June last with my colleagues here and with the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was a very pleasant and happy experience and also a very enlightening one. It was gratifying to see the representatives of virtually all the nations of the world meeting for a week in Vienna and showing such dedication to duty, such great interest in the problem of the threat of pollution to our very existence in this world, the destruction by man himself of the beauty which God gave us.  There was concern shown and important decisions were made there on how to deal with the problem. We who attended had a bounden obligation to come back to our national parliaments to report on the findings there and to impress upon our own people the urgency of getting together on a world basis and grappling effectively with the problem.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleagues who have said that the disposal of raw sewage into our rivers is a very serious problem. We who are members of local authorities know that, despite the best intentions of the members, the officials and the managers, local authorities cannot possibly cope with the proper treatment of raw sewage without State assistance.  The finances of local authorities are limited and do not permit of the very costly process of dealing effectively with raw sewage.  This problem will continue until the appropriate Department comes to the aid of local <Col N="998" /> authorities and provides specific grants to enable them to tackle that job.</P>
    <P>It is demoralising to have to witness this pollution going on.  It affects many of our rivers and Dublin Bay, where large sections of it have become stagnant cesspools, because it is difficult to resolve the problem of directing sewerage out to the sea.  Many of our State bodies have been very remiss in the matter of dealing effectively with animal life and bird life.  There does not seem to be any co-operation between the various State bodies in dealing with the problem of pollution.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary controls a Department which can be of tremendous assistance in resolving the pollution of our rivers.  We know much of the stagnation and pollution is caused because our rivers are silted up for want of dredging.  In many of our small tributaries one can hardly discern the rivers from the streams any longer. The trees and their branches entwine; you would imagine you were in the Amazon jungle when you see many of the tributaries of the River Suir in my area.  This is caused because we have not dredged the tributaries and the main arteries in the country.  We have often asked the Parliamentary Secretary and the Board of Works to implement the arterial drainage schemes for our rivers.  The stagnation, the hazard to health and the threat to fish life could be minimised if this extensive drainage work was carried out and if the channels of these rivers and tributaries could be cleaned of the rubble and dirt in them.</P>
    <P>There were many State grants in the past which were widely used for cleaning those rivers and streams, such as the Local Authorities (Works) Act, but they have been stopped.  No moneys of any kind, other than those from the rates, are available to effectively ensure that there is pure water in our rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>We all desire very much to see the day when we will achieve pure air, pure food and pure water.  We all endorse enthusiastically any measures which are brought in here towards that end.  That is why I support this motion, limited though it may be, in the hope that we can deal more <Col N="999" /> effectively with the problem of ensuring that we have pure water.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reinforce some of the comments that have been made with regard to the concern that is felt about certain recent suggestions which will affect the port area in Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  The Deputies representing maritime constituencies recently had a meeting with the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Finance when this matter was discussed.  The concern expressed then reflected the views of all public representatives at certain projected developments.  It is important that this matter should be understood and recognised by the Government as one which concerns very many people.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary and his Department, and also other Government Departments, will realise this.</P>
      <P>The pollution problem in this country is nothing like as great as it is elsewhere.  That is almost entirely due to our circumstances; but it is equally true to say that we have been in this country, probably because it has not been a serious problem, rather complacent about taking the necessary precautions.  Generally, it is only when a particular incident arises that focuses attention on the problem that either the public or people resident in certain areas become aware of and are alarmed by what happens.</P>
      <P>The considerable publicity after the recent announcement by the Dublin Port and Docks Board has naturally alerted everybody, including the people residing adjacent to the coast, and different associations, who have made representations to public representatives. It is important therefore that we should, in passing this motion, reinforce it by getting the views of the elected representatives to bear on the Government and on the various Government agencies to take the necessary precautions while there is still time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies who represent maritime constituencies have from time to time had to deal with particular or specific problems of pollution in limited areas. <Col N="1000" /> I am naturally more familiar with my own constituency and places like Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Sandycove, Killiney and Dalkey.  This particular scenic area is a tourist attraction, but it is also a very important fishing area. According to the statistics published last year, Dún Laoghaire had the fourth highest landings of fish in the country.  That puts it in a very important position and concern is expressed by the fishermen as well as the residents that the problem caused by pollution will be very serious in this area.</P>
    <P>Of course pollution results from effluent from factories and from sewage.  Now there is also the threat of pollution from the oil refinery depot which would affect Killiney as well as the Bay generally.  It is important that the Parliamentary Secretary conveys to the Government the concern at these recent developments.  He should take this concern into account also in the work of his own office.  We have time yet to take the necessary precautions. We have advantages which other countries do not have.  Also we have been warned by the deterioration of conditions elsewhere.  Although the problem of pollution here is less than elsewhere, it has manifested itself in a number of ways which should alert us to take preventative action while there is time left to do so.</P>
    <P>This is a limited motion for the purpose of enabling the country to avail of the agreement on the implementation of a European project on pollution.  Much of the analyses of micro-pollutants in water is of a technical nature and, obviously, it is a matter to which scientific and technical development can be applied to advantage. I wish only to reinforce what has been said already and to express particular concern on behalf of maritime areas, especially those in my constituency. We should ensure that every possible step is taken to prevent pollution that would lessen the attraction of these areas either for fishing or in so far as tourist amenities are concerned. Even more important are the amenities for the people who reside in those areas, whose health must be our main <Col N="1001" /> consideration and whose welfare must be our constant concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the problems connected with discussions on pollution in this House and elsewhere is that contributions consist of very impressive oratory and much talk of doom but contain very little by way of hard proposals as to what can be done in this regard.  In so far as this project will increase scientific knowledge of the subject as distinct from oratorically expressed concern, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to ask: what are we discussing?  What are organic micro-pollutants and how are they distinguished from non-organic micro-pollutants? What are organic macro-pollutants and how are they distinguished from non-organic macro-pollutants? This is the sort of basic information we should have.  Not being scientists we cannot be expected to know the answers.  The information is not contained in the brief.  Neither have we been told in that brief where this research will be carried out.  We have been given very little information as to the type of research involved. We have not been told what Irish agencies will be carrying out the research.  I presume it will be carried out by An Foras Forbartha, but we have not been told that.  An Foras Forbartha have carried out a survey already on the level of pollution in various rivers.  We have not been told how that survey will fit into this research project.  Neither have we been told how the terms of reference of that survey compare with the terms of reference of the survey to be carried out under this project.  We are entitled to have this basic information, and until such time as it is at our disposal all the pious expressions of concern, from the Government benches particularly, are of very little value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it odd that the Chief Whip of the Government party who is responsible for the time of the House should come here and make a moving speech about pollution while, at the same time, his Government are refusing to provide Government time <Col N="1002" /> for the Fine Gael Waters Preservation Bill, which is one of the few legislative measures to deal with water pollution that has been introduced in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to set down minimum standards of tolerable levels of pollution in rivers and to make provisions for enforcing these standards.  If the Parliamentary Secretary was serious in what he said he would have made provision for time to deal with our Bill.  The fact that he has not done so belies the concern that he expressed so movingly a moment ago.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other specific steps which can be taken to deal with water pollution but which the Government have not taken.  It has been rightly pointed out by Deputy Esmonde that the use of certain detergents can lead to reducing the efficiency of sewage disposal works and other works involved in dealing with pollution.  Perhaps that has been the most important point made during this debate.  Most of the European countries have introduced laws to deal with the content of detergents so as to ensure that they do not contain materials which are pollutant. This is a matter that we should be taking note of, but we have no law here in relation to the content of detergents.  I have raised this matter with the Minister for Health on a number of occasions but have received no satisfaction.  This is a matter that has a direct bearing on water pollution.  The research project and all the talk are of little value until we take legislative action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area which is of great importance is the use of disposable non-returnable bottles.  How many of these bottles find their way into rivers and render them unsightly?  They are a contributing factor to the solid pollution of these rivers.  The Parliamentary Secretary must be given credit for the fact that, while representing the Government recently at an international conference, he called for government control of the production <Col N="1003" /> of these bottles.  However, when I tabled a question to the Minister for Local Government to ask him if he intended doing anything to control the use of these bottles, he told me that he had no such intention.  I presume this is because the glass bottle interests have told him that Deputy Lemass said something that would not be of benefit to the party because the glass bottle interests are good contributors to the party.</P>
    <P>These are the two levels of concern in respect of pollution that we have from Fianna Fáil.  At international agencies, when they wish to impress their colleagues, they express much concern.  They send out people like Deputy Lemass to make suggestions that are valid, but, when it comes to the hard business of implementing the suggestions here, the interests of the polluters who are strong contributors to the Government party are taken into consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the seriousness of the Government in regard to matters of pollution.  The Parliamentary Secretary can say something abroad, but the Minister for Local Government can say something very different here.</P>
      <P>Another problem which is very important in regard to pollution in this country is that of sewage disposal.  On the Waters Preservation Bill I mentioned figures in this House as regards sewage disposal which indicated it was a major contributor to pollution.  I understand these figures were incorrect and I should like now to withdraw them.  However, I understand that the lack of sewage disposal facilities is a substantial contributor to pollution in the rivers.  We want to know how substantial it is.  I asked the Minister for Local Government if he could give me information as to which towns had no sewage disposal facilities and were discharging untreated sewage into the rivers, which towns had primary treatment facilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we want to implement the agreement and if the research findings coming from the agreement are to have effect, surely we must have information as to the various types of sewage disposal facilities which are in operation in the country.  I asked the Minister for Local Government if he could give me this information as to how many towns had primary sewage disposal facilities, how many towns had secondary sewage disposal facilities, and how many towns had tertiary sewage disposal facilities.  He could not give me these figures.  We talk about planning for pollution when we do not even know the position as it stands. Yet he is the man in whose Department sewage plan proposals are held up for lack of approval.  This is not planning, this is messing.  I would ask the Government to bring their concern about pollution down from the level of oratory to the level of practical legislative proposals which can have a tangible effect on the level of pollution.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the motion has been generally accepted.  Perhaps Deputies have not read the agreement itself which is available in the Library, but it is a highly technical type of Bill and for that reason I thought it would be difficult for me to go into the great technicalities. However, I shall expand on my original brief now.</P>
      <P>The first question I should answer is that asked by Deputy Bruton as to what we are talking about.  In the title of this resolution &ldquo;Analysis of Organic Micro-Pollutants in Water&rdquo; I think that the word &ldquo;organic&rdquo; in this context means non-metallic chemical compounds, for example, insecticides and herbicides, and &ldquo;micro&rdquo; in this context means difficult to detect because of their presence in minute quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does &ldquo;organic&rdquo; not mean coming from a natural source?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is non-metallic.  This is the description that applies to it in the context of the European Agreement. As I say, &ldquo;micro&rdquo; means difficult to detect because of their presence in minute quantities, therefore requiring special methods and equipment to detect them.  I shall give a little more information on that later.</P>
      <P>The EEC set up a working party in 1967 to study the possibility of co-operation in science and technology between the member-states of EEC and other European countries.  On the basis of the working party's recommendations the EEC sent invitations to participate in co-operative research in selected projects to Ireland and the other applicant countries for membership of EEC&mdash;UK, Denmark and Norway&mdash;and five other European countries&mdash;Austria, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  All accepted. Last year four additional countries, Finland, Greece, Yugoslavia and Turkey expressed interest in taking part and their participation was agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to clarify this matter because there is some misunderstanding and some Deputies referred to this as an EEC project.  There are 19 countries in the whole programme but only 12 <Col N="1006" /> of the 19 countries are participating in this particular project.  These are: The Federal Republic of Germany, which was referred to here in the debate, Spain, the French Republic, Ireland, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the Kingdom of Norway, the Republic of Portugal, the Swiss Confederation and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  Seven working parties were established to examine the possibility of co-operative research in certain sectors.  The sectors examined were: Information science, telecommunications, new means of transport, meteorology and oceanography, metallurgy, pollution and a European meteorological computing centre.  By decisions taken in July and November of last year, the Government approved the participation of this country in the following projects: European computer library, research into factors affecting the utilisation of high frequency radio-waves, analysis of micro-pollutants in water, meteorological observing buoys, study phase, and a European meteorological computing centre.</P>
    <P>The Government also approved participation by this country in two projects which as yet have only a minor status: Forward study of passenger transport requirements between major European conurbations, and standardisation of meteorological equipment.</P>
    <P>In relation to Ireland's participation in this project it is proposed that some of the experimental work will be carried out in this country.  This will take the form of a specific project, which will be the isolation and separation of organic constituents of Irish river waters.</P>
    <P>Initially the work will be concentrated on the development of suitable procedures for the quantitative extraction of organic compounds in river water.  The degree of recovery of organic matter will be monitored by total organic carbon analyses throughout the various stages of the extraction process.  Gas/liquid chromatography, which is a special <Col N="1007" /> technique for the separation of chemical compounds from each other, and possibly liquid/liquid chromatography will be used wherever possible to resolve mixtures obtained.  When suitable techniques have been evolved examination will be made of as wide a range of river waters as possible, enabling a significant bank of basic data to be compiled. It is not envisaged that attention will be paid at the outset to the identification of individual compounds or specific classes of compounds though, as work progresses, the scope will widen to cover this.  The main direction of the project on the technical side here will be undertaken by the Department of Local Government.  A senior research officer of An Foras Forbartha, seconded from the Department, has been nominated as Irish representative to the management committee in Brussels.</P>
    <P>The estimated time for completion of the project is three years.  The precise cost figure is not available but the cost of the total project will be of the order of £1.45 million, of which an average of £15,000 per annum will be met from public funds here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan and, indeed, some other Deputies also, said that we will just pass this motion and then sit back and do nothing; there will be an excuse for doing nothing because we are awaiting the results in the report. That is not so.  This matter, not only of pollution, but of environment and environmental control, are matters under very serious consideration by the Government.  In fact, an inter-departmental committee have been set up to consider all aspects of air and water pollution.  I am hoping we will have the report from this committee before too long.  Naturally the Office of Public Works will participate in it because of its interest in the Shannon navigation, the national parks, <i>et cetera.</i></P>

      <P>The committee is under the auspices of the Department of Local Government and the secretary of the Department would be the person, I imagine, with whom to communicate.</P>
      <P>I should like now to refer to Deputy Bruton's remarks about my contribution abroad when I spoke about nonreturnable containers.  I should like to point out that that was the first international inter-parliamentary meeting to deal with these matters.  If you like, it was a consequence of the United Nations' activity that parliamentarians felt they should get together and hold a watching brief on what was going on. Each country was asked to submit a problem existing in the particular country and to put forward possible solutions. The aim was, having expressed views at the conference, to get a worldwide consensus of agreement as to how the problem might be dealt with; unfortunately we did not reach that stage on this particular problem, but we did reach agreement on other problems.</P>
      <P>In reply to the point raised by Deputy FitzGerald, this is a specialised project dealing with extremely small quantities of pollutants.  An evaluation of results will be the next phase of a long-term exercise.  With regard to the cost, it was agreed the contributions should not be based on GNP in this particular case.  It was to be based on the minimum size of the research team. In other project agreements GNP has been used, but there is no precedent being created.  Of the contributions, we pay the minimum.  That is also the contribution paid by Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway.  As in the case of Ireland, these countries will pay the minimum contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Cluskey's point, this is one of the few areas in <Col N="1009" /> which immediate conjoint action could be agreed between the countries participating. I refer to pollution of canals. Deputy Cluskey expressed the fear that people from Europe might come here and see the condition of the canals. This is precisely what we want them to do.  This is the area in which we would like to see some action taken. Arising out of all this, I hope we will be able to improve the situation considerably, though I understand that it will be improved as soon as the new Dublin drainage scheme goes through.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 2, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know if the Minister has thought about the matter which I and Deputy FitzGerald were referring to last night.  It is not a major point but a minor drafting point which would appear on the face of it to contain an apparent contradiction between one provision of the section and another.  It says that from 1st January, 1973, the treaties governing the European Communities and the acts adopted by the institutions of those communities shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
      <P>The problem, as far as I can understand it, arose from the fact that Deputy FitzGerald felt, and I shared his view, that this section would be at least ambiguous in its application to EEC directives because these are not framed to be directly applicable but framed so that, in order to make them applicable, the Government must introduce legislation through the domestic process of the nation state. This section would appear to make these directives directly applicable by saying that acts adopted&mdash;which would include directives&mdash;shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law thereof under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a directive were not implemented <Col N="1012" /> in time there might be some difficulty in deciding whether or not an individual could sue to have the provisions of the directive implemented by the Irish courts.  I cited an example last night of a directive existing in regard to agricultural matters by which the countries are directed to introduce within a certain time limit a premium for farmers who keep accounts; but the countries are also decided to be free to decide that in certain regions, as far as I know, this provision shall not apply or shall be varied in its application.  The decision whether it should apply in a certain region is something that must be decided by the nation state and must be implemented through legislation.  If the Irish Government failed to introduce any legislation to implement this provision and the time limit for doing so expired and if at the end of that period a man who had been keeping accounts took action against the Government to make them give him the premium which the EEC had directed should be given, the problem would arise.</P>
    <P>Part of the section says that the directive shall be part of the domestic law of the State.  If you are interpreting that part of the section it could appear that, even though the country had not introduced domestic legislation implementing the provision regarding farm accounts, the man would be entitled to enforce it against the Government.  Yet the State could say: &ldquo;Perhaps in principle we should be giving this but we are free to make regulations that this provision shall not be applicable in certain parts of the country and that the conditions of it shall be spelled out. We have not done that; there is no domestic provision on this matter and therefore your general claim for a premium in regard to farm accounts falls because no domestic provision has been made for the precise terms and area of applicability of the premium.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This seems to me to be a problem. I do not think the Minister or his advisers would be acting in bad faith in this matter.  His advisers have had time to consider the point overnight.  If they are satisfied that no conflict will arise as a result of the difficulty I envisage and that the Bill as it stands is perfectly satisfactory, I would be prepared <Col N="1013" /> to accept that on the expertise of the Minister's advisers; but if there is a problem the Minister should not hesitate to introduce a separate section to deal with the particular method whereby directives, as distinct from directly applicable regulations, will be brought into the domestic law of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. Hillery)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given my interpretation and stated my belief that this is the way to give effect to the Act of Accession in our law.  I have done this several times, as did Deputy Haughey and other Deputies who understood it. If I thought there could be any finality in the situation I would repeat again what I have already said.  The Deputy has made no proposals.  In many continental countries a treaty once concluded becomes part of the domestic law and it is established in those countries that provisions of a treaty as part of the domestic law are of two kinds, self-executing&mdash;in the case of the Treaty of Rome these would be directly applicable&mdash;and executory.  Executory provisions, although part of the domestic law, require further implementing to bring them into force.  This distinction is applied by the Communities' treaties in Community secondary legislation. Some acts are directly applicable; others require to be implemented by member states.  It is carried down into our law by making the treaties part of our domestic law and by providing in section 2 that acts of the institutions are part of the domestic law under the conditions laid down in the treaties.  The conditions laid down in the treaties, as I have said several times, are that some acts are directly applicable while others are brought into force by action of our own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things.  One is, I am quite satisfied that this section 2 covers the situation.  Largely speaking, it is true that regulations have direct effect <Col N="1014" /> and directives have to be implemented by action of our own but some directives have directly applicable effect and many regulations need ancillary legislation.  I do not know how you bring finality to the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a draftsman and the Minister has told us we are not draftsmen and I agree with him.  The problem I would like the Minister to settle would be this: if an individual person wants to enforce a directive which has not been implemented as it should be by the Government introducing implementing provisions, would that case fall because the directive was phrased in general terms and for it to be effective there must be specific provisions and therefore the case would fall in the domestic courts or could it be enforced in the domestic courts despite the fact that there were no specific provisions made by this country?  The essence of a directive is that it is not directly applicable and therefore there are no specific provisions which can be relied upon by a litigant and the essence of a directive is that there be specific provisions.  If a person is trying to enforce law in the normal way he can rely on specific legal provisions. In this case, when trying to enforce a directive against a government which has failed to make the provisions the individual has no specific provisions to rely upon in making his case.  All he can do is rely on a directive made in Brussels which of its essence is phrased generally and which of its essence very often allows discretion to the government.  Therefore, there is no specific legal base upon which a person can take legal proceedings in the Irish courts to enforce against a government a directive which they have in general accepted under section 2 but for which they have not introduced the <Col N="1016" /> necessary implementing provisions. That is the point I am trying to establish. I think we could deal with it if we could draft some separate section which would lay down the position in this matter, but I agree with the Minister, I have not got a specific proposal. Perhaps on Report Stage we may be able to devise something.</P>

      <P>May I put it this way: here we are legislating to bind the Government to do a certain thing to implement directives and into this legislation the Deputy wants another section to bind the Government to introduce them.  You want to do it twice.  This in fact is what the Deputy wants to do.  Once we bind the State to the treaties and to implementation under the conditions laid down in the acts of the institutions, that is done: that is binding on the Government.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Bruton's query, which is a very valid query, and the kind of problem that individuals, companies and the State will have to deal with once we enter the European Economic Community, the answer is that if the State or any person here fails to discharge obligations, an action would lie against the State or any person who defaulted in fulfilling the obligations.  If the remedy was not available in the Irish courts, it would be available in the courts of the Community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I would like to support the arguments which were made last night in criticism of section 2 and I would refer the Minister to the Treaty of Accession which provides under Article 2 that &ldquo;from the date of accession the provisions of the Treaties and the Acts adopted by the Institutions of the Communities shall be binding on the new member States and shall apply in those States under the conditions laid down in those Treaties and under this Act.&rdquo;  The difficulty that arises in relation to section 2 stems not from the Community documents but, in fact, from our own Constitution.  It was felt, I suspect, by the draftsmen necessary to introduce the phrase &ldquo;domestic law&rdquo; by virtue of section 6 of Article 29 of the Constitution which provides that &ldquo;no international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;  It may be felt that, unless one captures in section 2 directives as well as regulations, directives need never become part of the domestic law of the State because of Article 29 of the Constitution. This is my own thinking on the matter.  I may be wrong but it seems to me that that might have been the difficulty the draftsman foresaw, that the directive might never be effective, could never become part of our domestic law unless we identified it as something requiring control under Article 29 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I still think the particular form used in the Bill is untidy and certainly gives rise to the difficulties which have been very properly identified.  These difficulties were overcome in the European Communities Act in Britain by clearly differentiating <Col N="1018" /> between regulations on the one hand and directives, recommendations on the other.  Article 2 of the British Act reads&mdash;and it is worthwhile putting this on the record:</P>
    <P>All such rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions from time to time created or arising by or under the Treaties, and all such remedies and procedures from time to time provided for by or under the Treaties, as in accordance with the Treaties are without further enactment to be given legal effect or used in the United Kingdom shall be recognised and available in law, and be enforced, allowed and followed accordingly; and the expression &ldquo;enforceable Community right&rdquo; and similar expressions shall be read as referring to one to which this subsection applies.</P>
    <P>That emphatically brings without further enactment into the law of Britain only Community regulations, that is, these obligations which under the treaty without further ado or further act of government or a minister go into the domestic law of member countries. We are doing more than that in section 2.  Not only are we bringing in Community regulations but we are providing an umbrella for directives, decisions and everything else which might subsequently be done in relation to them by a Minister.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we should break down section 2 in some way so as to make it clear that, while we are providing an umbrella, we are not creating legal obligations and legal rights which are unenforceable or require further action. We ought to differentiate between the deed that is done and requires no further action, and the deed or the act which requires some further action on the part of the Minister.  If we separated those two things we would avoid a great deal of confusion.  Therefore, I would hope that, between now and Report Stage, the Minister might have another look at it and see if, without in any way infringing on what the Minister is trying to achieve, we could do something to identify these two separate areas.  They are separate and they ought to be identified as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to section 2 of this Bill which has been read by speaker after speaker, in order to clear up any misunderstanding that may be in my mind, may I take it that every order, regulation and directive in the explanatory memorandum is covered by the Bill, and that all the regulations in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated from the General Office on the European Communities Bill, 1972, automatically become law on 1st January, 1973?  Am I right in assuming that, or am I wrong?</P>
      <P>If I am right in assuming that I want to put it on record that this is a most undemocratic procedure, in my opinion.  First and foremost, we are adopting laws about which we know nothing.  Secondly, they will have a vital effect on the economic, social and cultural life of the country. Thirdly, they are amendments to certain of our existing laws on which the public have not been consulted.  I will be seriously perturbed if I find that, as a result of the passing of this section, Regulation 184/66/EEC of 21st November, 1966, will become part of our domestic law immediately. This regulation deals with the collecting, checking and transmitting of statistics obtained with a view to determining revenues of agricultural holdings.</P>
      <P>Regulation 91/66/EEC of 29th June, 1966, refers to the selecting of farm units for the purpose of determining incomes on agricultural holdings.  Am I to assume that those regulations will be included in our law from New Year's Day?  Does this mean that those who are engaged in agriculture will be subject to statistical checks for the purpose of extracting new and additional taxation from them?  This has not been clearly explained by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or any Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also find that on the passage of section 2 the Land Act, 1965, will be altered with regard to the provisions on the right of establishment in land &ldquo;in certain limited cases&rdquo;.  I am not aware of what is meant by &ldquo;certain limited cases&rdquo;.  We had undertakings from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, <Col N="1020" /> and from every other Minister associated with him, that prior to 10th May, 1972, certain safeguards would be available to protect the land of Ireland for the people of Ireland and that neither now nor in the immediate future would foreigners be allowed to compete against Irish nationals for land available on the public market. I have no explanation, no condition, no serious data to convey back to those I represent.</P>
    <P>This House is entitled to know in what circumstances are our existing laws to be changed with particular reference to the Land Act, 1965, and the purchase of land by foreigners in competition with Irish nationals on the open market.  Committees may have been set up by the Department of Foreign Affairs and perhaps all these matters have been gone into by farming organisations and others but, if the regulations in the document which was circulated to us are to be binding as and from 1st January, 1973, very serious implications arise.</P>
    <P>I want to direct the attention of the Minister to Regulation 120/67 of June, 1967 on the common organisation of the market in cereals.  I want also, as the representative of an agricultural constituency in which wheat is grown on a large scale, to refer him to Regulation 2394/70 of 27th November, 1970, on communication between member states and the Commission on quantitative data on imports and exports of wheat and wheat flour.  This has not been explained or discussed and we are not in a position to say in which way it will affect our constituents.  Regulation 1893/70 concerns the sale of butter from public stocks.  This will have a serious effect on the lives of our people.</P>

      <P>Directive 68415 of 20th December, 1968, refers to the freedom of assets for aids to agricultural workers who move from one member state to another. Again there is nothing of an explanatory nature in regard to the character of the aid or as to who qualifies for it.  In other words, <Col N="1021" /> we are buying a pig in a bag.  Assuming that some agricultural workers may come from any of the other member countries to here, what will the effect of this directive be on us?  This has never been discussed.  In this section we are taking on ourselves a volume of regulations, directives and laws about which we know nothing.  The Government have failed miserably to provide the House, the country, the farming organisations, the trade unions, the workers, with information and data on the directives, regulations and laws which will so affect our domestic legislation. It is not a democratic way of doing things.  While he is still here, the Minister for Foreign Affairs should see that the House and the country are made aware of the effects of these regulations and laws.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not about to buy a pig in a bag.  On 10th May last we bought that pig.  The decision then was taken in the full knowledge that certain things were being done.  I and my party bitterly opposed the proposal to buy the pig.  We did our best, we gave the explanations Deputy Flanagan has now been given to as many people as we could, but the people did not believe us and voted overwhelmingly in favour of accepting what Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil had told them.</P>
      <P>It is idle now to talk as if we could have the referendum again.  It is idle to make pre-referendum speeches.  They are a waste of time.  We are now dealing with facts, the decision having been made.  We either have to accept the decision of 10th May last, which was given by an overwhelming majority of the Irish people, or we can say that the Irish people had no right to do that and try to reverse engines. It is section 2 we are discussing now, not an amendment&mdash;amendment No. 4 was dealt with, withdrawn, last night. What we are doing is putting into legislation what we are required to do if we are serious and if the Irish people were serious on 10th May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Bruton and Ryan that, if it is at all possible, we should try to protect our interests as far as possible, but nobody has come up with a solution.  The fact that the British Parliament used a lot more <Col N="1022" /> words does not solve our problem.  I have always been critical of the number of words used in legislation.  We tend to use a superfluity of phrases and expressions which could be cut down into plain, simple language.</P>
    <P>Section 2 seems very plain&mdash;whether it is right or wrong I do not know. I cannot say whether it is the correct thing to do, but the Minister must be satisfied because at the end of the year he will have the problem of seeing that these things are done properly and we will have a successor to him.  We have to decide now that we must try to save the bacon, but I do not think there is a thing we can do.  If somebody has a concrete proposal he should have put it down here today or we should have it for the Report Stage. If we talk on this section until 31st December and prevent the passing of the legislation, we are still stuck with the EEC.  We debated this matter all yesterday evening and part of today. Either we should agree to let it pass and have a proposal for the Report Stage or, alternatively, call a vote and decide whether the Members want this legislation to go through.  It is a waste of time and a lot of codology to continue in the way we have been conducting the debate.  I am as opposed to the idea of the EEC as I ever was but I am a practical man and I realise the people have decided.  I realise I have no right to try to thwart what they wanted to do.</P>

      <P>What is at issue is not an intention to thwart the decision of the people in this matter but, as far as possible, to lay down precisely their rights under this legislation and their rights as citizens of the EEC.  This is what we are trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan made a point which should be borne in mind by the Minister.  In the explanatory memorandum there is a list of legislation which will be affected.  For instance, in regard to the Finance Act, 1932, section 37, it affects provisions regarding the importation of materials for ship building.  It does not tell us precisely how they will be affected.  A <Col N="1023" /> little more detail could be given at a later stage on how the items mentioned in the annex could be affected so that people will know where they stand.  We will be in a unique situation where there will be two bodies of law affected at the same time, namely, the Irish law and the European law, and it is important that people should be clear about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that copies of the regulations mentioned in the Annex are available in the Library. However, they are available in English translations by Her Majesty's Stationery Office.  I understand the translations were rushed through and were not good translations.  As a result of Irish representations to the British Authorities, many of the translations had to be changed because when the Irish officials were working from the British translations they found they were inaccurate.  They were rushed through for prestige purposes by the British Stationery Office.  If those are the only translations on which we can rely we are not in a good position.  The point made by Deputy Flanagan is in relation to existing legislation but I am more concerned with proposed legislation.  However, draft directives which have not yet been agreed by the Council of Ministers are available in the Library only in French.  Some of the draft directives dealing with agriculture are translations made by the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  We are not even producing our own translations for the use of our officials, let alone for the use of Members of the Oireachtas.  If our interests are to be protected we must improve to some degree the translation facilities so that Deputies and officials can have translations of the regulations by Irish officials. Obviously we would not have the manpower to do all of this work but we should examine the problem and see if we could do more in our own interests.</P>

      <P>With the greatest of respect to Deputy Tully, who is a very senior and much respected Member of this House, he misconceives the <Col N="1024" /> situation.  On the 10th May the people of Ireland said Ireland may become a member of the EEC.  The people gave permission to join the EEC but the ultimate decision as to the manner of joining rests with the Oireachtas by virtue of Article 29 of the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I would ask the Deputy to bear in mind our responsibilities. Article 29 of the Constitution states:</P>
      <P>No international agreement shall be part of the domestic law of the State save as may be determined by the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>What we are doing in this Bill is to determine the extent to which the obligations will be applicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have the right to determine the manner of implementing Community obligations.  We must discharge this obligation and it is a pity that there are not more Members here to discharge it and to understand it. We can say what methods we are going to adopt to implement these agreements. The point at issue in section 2 is whether everything is to be brought in one swoop under section 2 by applying everything regulations, decisions, directives, recommendations and all directly, immediately and fully, or whether we will do no more than we are required to do by the treaties, namely to permit regulations to come into force once they are adopted in Brussels.  In relation to secondary legislation, we want it to be separated from section 2 to require that it be processed by ministerial regulations subject to review in this House.  The question is whether we want to apply everything immediately and directly under section 2 or whether we decide to do under section 2 only as much as we are obliged to do and do the rest under a system which will allow us to review the matter from time to time.  That is the great difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the debate I quoted the <Col N="1025" /> first subsection to section 2 of the British Act but I omitted to quote the second subsection.  I think it is necessary to do this in order to emphasise the way in which the British Parliament overcame this problem.  I do this with great hesitation because I do not like to hold up British conduct as an example which Irish people should necessarily follow.  However, English is the language in which most of us have facility and, therefore, British legislation and example is readily available and is easily understood.</P>
    <P>I have already emphasised that the British specify that regulations will come into effect without further enactment. They deal with directives in subsection (2) of section 2, in a different way as follows:</P>
    <P>Subject to Schedule 2 to this Act at any time after its passing, Her Majesty may, by Order in Council, and any designated Minister or Department may by regulations, make provision&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) for the purpose of implementing any Community obligation of the United Kingdom or enabling any such obligation to be implemented, or enabling any rights enjoyed or to be enjoyed by the United Kingdom under or by virtue of the treaties to be exercised, or,</P>
    <P>(b) for the purpose of dealing with matters arising out of or related to any such obligation or rights or the coming into force of the operation from time to time of subsection (1) above.</P>
    <P>There you will see an important distinction is made in the British legislation. They spell out clearly that regulations come into effect without further enactment, and spell out separately what must be done to bring directives and other secondary legislation into operation.  We do not do that.  We put them all under the &ldquo;do it without further enactment&rdquo; clause and, rather untidily, in section 3 we say that, if a Minister thinks he should make regulations to facilitate the operation of what we have brought into operation under section 2, he may do so.  We use loose phrases such as &ldquo;the Minister may <Col N="1026" /> make regulations which he considers proper&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <P>I do not take any strong issue with it except to say that it is bad, clumsy draftsmanship, and I am sure Deputy Haughey will agree with me on that.  We ought to separate the two points: first, regulations will specifically and clearly come into operation without further enactment, and second, directives should be covered separately by section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We have studied the British Act.  It is invidious to make comparisons with other countries.  It is not in my nature to accept that everything done in Britain is better than what we do here.  The British way of doing it adds nothing to the clarity of the situation.  As I said last night on many occasions, it is not that easy to separate regulations and directives under the treaties.  There is a blurring in some areas.  After long deliberation we have decided that this is the better way for our situation.  One is limited in what one can say when comparisons are made.  It is invidious to make a comparison with what was done in the British circumstances.  This is what is most suitable for our situation.  We have a decision to change our Constitution to make it possible to be members of the Community.  We also had in the referendum a consultative aspect, which was clearly stated by the Taoiseach, asking the people if we were to join it.  The absolute position is nothing like what the Deputy said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By the accession treaty we have undertaken certain obligations.  In Article 2 what is proposed is what precisely we are required to do by the accession treaty.  This is absolutely necessary because the accession treaty says that from the date of accession the provisions of the original treaties and the acts adopted by the institutions of the Communities shall be binding on the new member states and shall apply in these states under the conditions laid down in these treaties and in these acts. It is absolutely necessary to give the force of law to those provisions in the <Col N="1027" /> treaties and of the secondary legislation which are directly applicable to the member states.  It is difficult to draw a line between those provisions which are directly applicable and those which are not directly applicable.  In the last resort this would come to be decided by European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>In certain provisions of the treaties, it is considered by us that the best way we can give effect to them&mdash;that is, these provisions which may not be directly applicable such as those establishing the legal capacity of the Community and of the European Court of Justice and the jurisdiction of that court&mdash;is to make them part of our domestic law.  For those reasons, it was deemed better to give the force of law to the treaties in full rather than to go along an uncharted road, which would be futile.  Others think such a course would be open to the risk of confusion and misinterpretation in trying to separate provisions for which the force of law is necessary or desirable and provisions for which it is not.</P>
    <P>I would like to repeat that in our circumstances the law, as we have drafted it, is for us better than what was drafted in Britain for the British circumstances.  This section proposes no more than precisely what we require to do under the act of accession to the treaty.</P>
    <P>Other points were raised by Deputy O.J. Flanagan.  These points could be called &ldquo;water under the bridge&rdquo;.  We made it clear before the referendum that the right of establishment generally is not yet an act of the Community, but there is a right to establish on land which has been idle for two years.  A labourer in agriculture in any of the countries of the Community, if he has been an agricultural labourer for two years, becomes entitled to buy agricultural land in that country.  This has been no problem to our people here.  The general right of establishment on land is not there.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned part of the arrangement for collecting statistics. He is concerned with the imposition of taxation.  There is nothing to force a person to give information. It is a matter of allowing the collection <Col N="1028" /> of statistics to make information available for the structural policies which will be of benefit, as nearly all the things we are proposing will be of benefit, to our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If those engaged on the land are asked to return their incomes and the prices they receive for their agricultural produce and to give a full account of their revenue derived from work on the land, will that not be used against them for taxation purposes?  People in the country will be slow to disclose such information.</P>

      <P>If they do not have to do it, we may take it that that is one of the EEC regulations which will not be binding on the people.  The Minister should say a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or a &ldquo;no&rdquo; in relation to this point concerning our whole hearted adherence to Article 7 of the Treaty of Rome which clearly indicates that within the field of application of the treaty any discrimination on the grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.  That relates to the purchase of land.  Whatever concessions may be obtained during the transitional period, Article 7 of the Treaty of Rome clearly precludes discrimination against foreign purchasers of land, just as it precludes discrimination against foreign fishermen fishing in our territorial waters.  I am perturbed as a result of the arrangement made in regard to our fisheries and territorial waters.  These arrangements are to be reviewed after a number of years.  Is there any prospect, now that we are entering the Community on 1st January next, having accepted the full responsibilities&mdash;even though some of these responsibilities may slightly or even to a major degree be disagreeable to us in some form or other&mdash;of having representation made by this Parliament so that there will be earlier reviews, particularly an earlier review in relation to our fishing limits and the extent of our territorial waters?</P>

    <P>We are enacting the regulations now as agreed in the negotiations.  If the laws as regards our fisheries are allowed <Col N="1029" /> to stand as negotiated, our fishermen will be put out of business in a very short time.  We cannot wait for a period of eight or ten years before a review.  We must have a review in a much shorter period because we will see the detrimental effect which the foreign trawlers will have by depriving our own fishermen, who are not well-equipped, of their livelihood and forcing them to compete with them. Earlier reviews are desirable.  The people engaged in the fishing industry, as was the case with many small farmers, had their fingers burned on the 10th of May last.  If everything we read in this memorandum is correct, they have suffered a severe scorching. We can help to apply a remedy.  This House can impress on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and on the Government in general that frequent review is necessary with a view to easing the hardships imposed on us as a result of section 2 of this Bill.  In view of the hardships facing the fishing industry in the EEC it should be possible for the Minister to arrange for a much earlier review than was decided on in the negotiations.  Our fishermen are ill-equipped to compete with the foreign intrusion which EEC membership imposes on them.</P>
    <P>I feel that they will be put out of business.  Somebody must have a voice in these things in this House, and not within a period of ten years.  In ten years' time, unless something is done in the meantime, they will be gone and foreigners will have the full benefit of Irish fisheries which should be safeguarded and protected for the Irish fishing industry.</P>

      <P>May I just say that I am astonished at the fact that somebody who is as long in public life as Deputy Oliver Flanagan is not aware of the simple fact that our Central Statistics Office has been collecting statistics of this nature both from the farming community and from the industrial community over the last 40 or 50 years and fundamental to that whole structure is the fact that these statistics are not disclosed to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>I would point out that as amendment No. 5, in the names of Deputies Cosgrave and Ryan, is consequential on the acceptance of amendment No. 9, amendment No. 5 should be postponed until the Report Stage when it can be moved if amendment No. 9 has been accepted. As amendment No. 10 is consequential on amendment No. 6 perhaps it would be possible to discuss both together. One decision would suffice.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 16, to delete &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;member of the Government&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I would urge on the Minister that he should accept this amendment.  I believe there are very cogent reasons for making the change I suggest.  The Bill, as it is drafted, speaks, in two instances, about a &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo;. I want to go back again to what I said about the importance of this Bill.  This Bill, when it becomes an Act, will have constitutional status and it will rank in importance just immediately under the Constitution itself.  Therefore, it is very important that we should adhere as near as we can in the legislation to proper constitutional terminology and phraseology.  The Constitution knows no such animal as a Minister of State. The Constitution speaks about a &ldquo;Member of the Government,&rdquo; it speaks about a &ldquo;Department of State&rdquo; and it speaks about a &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; who may be assigned or put in charge of a Department of State.  Nowhere does it mention a Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest, with all due deference, that there is constitutionally no such animal and that we should insert here, in these two cases, the proper description, namely, a &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo; because that is the legal person or the legal personality which the Constitution recognises or refers to.  I strongly urge the Minister to make these two fairly simple changes.  I think they are important in the constitutional sense and will undoubtedly <Col N="1031" /> improve at least the constitutional language of this piece of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I do not see anything very objectionable in the amendment except that there is a definition in the Interpretation Act, 1937.  A &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; is defined as a &ldquo;Member of the Government having charge of a Department of State&rdquo;.  That would include the Taoiseach.  Listening to Deputy Haughey the only possibility, to my mind, of somebody not being caught within that definition would be a Minister without portfolio.  Whether such a Minister would, by definition, have functions in relation to a Department making orders to fit in with European Acts is unlikely.  I do not feel very strongly about it.  The definition is in the Interpretation Act, 1937.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey's point in relation to the Bill is interesting, but not his suggestion that any amendment should be passed through in this House simply to humour Deputies. For a Member of the Government party who might not have spoken in the House for two years to suggest now that various concessions must be made in order to humour him is to make a suggestion which many people would find totally unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo;, as the Minister has pointed out from his quotation from the Interpretation Act, is that one might be a member of a Government without being a Minister. A Minister is a person who has a particular responsibility for a Department. I would not think it desirable that a Minister without portfolio, if we had such&mdash;and I think under our Constitution we could have such&mdash; should be making laws by way of regulation.  It would be terribly important that this power should be confined to Ministers who have particular responsibility for their Departments and are answerable to this House for their Departments and would be handling in this House questions related to their performance of their duties.  A member of the Government, who is not a Minister, would not have the specific responsibility for the particular area in relation to which he would be making his regulations unless he were to have assigned to him a Department, in which case he would become a Minister.  This phraseology is one which we have been using in legislation for countless years.  It might be wiser to stick to the terminology we know and understand and which has been interpreted from time to time in the courts rather than to use phraseology which might well <Col N="1033" /> create more difficulties than the ones which Deputy Haughey is no doubt trying to avoid.</P>

      <P>A &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo; is Tweedledum and Tweedledee; there is no difference, but if this will put Deputy Haughey into a reasonably jovial mood I do not see what objections Members of the House would have to seeing Deputy Haughey in a jovial mood.  May I suggest putting into the Bill &ldquo;Minister of State&rdquo; and, in brackets immediately afterwards, &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo;.  Would that not solve the whole problem?  Tweedledum and Tweedledee would be in the Bill, Deputy Haughey would be pleased and in jovial mood and Deputy Ryan would be satisfied in the knowledge that the phraseology that has been used up to now still stands.</P>
      <P>Let me offer as a peaceful solution to the problem an expression with which we are most familiar nowadays &ldquo;the Minister might consider the matter&rdquo;.  On Report Stage he could put in brackets &ldquo;Member of the Government&rdquo;. If the Minister feels that a Minister of State should go there he could bring in this amendment on Report Stage.  It means the same thing as a member of the Government.  I do not think it will change the substance of the section one way or the other whether you call him a Minister of State or a member of the Government because it is known what his responsibility will be.  I believe Deputy Haughey has a valid point and I think it should be seriously considered.</P>

      <P>I do not want to hold up the House because I do not think the matter is important enough to delay too long on it especially in view of the fact that Deputy Haughey included the other expression which is in this Bill.  I believe in precedent.  This House is guided by precedents.  The precedent has been to use the phrase which <Col N="1034" /> it has been decided to use in this Bill.  If it is changed now, would somebody get the idea that in fact, constitutionally, we were not entitled to use the existing phrase and could we bring down more trouble on ourselves than we would be avoiding?  We should not waste too much time on this because I would remind the House that Questions are not until 3 o'clock. Those of us who have been here all day will not be able to leave until we either make some progress on this Bill or until Question Time comes and we all like to eat some time.</P>

      <P>This debate is rather at cross purposes.  We have in this country Ministers of the Government and we also have Parliamentary Secretaries.  In other parliaments they have Ministers of State who are a sort of halfway between members of the government and parliamentary secretaries.  They are called junior ministers in other countries.  We are largely dependent in this country for protection of the democratic right on the Ministers, the people who represent us at the particular time.  I can see what is in Deputy Haughey's mind and I have quite a lot of sympathy with it, I do not think we have had a Minister without portfolio in this country for a great many years.  I believe about 30 or 40 years ago we had a Minister without portfolio who was responsible for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey's amendment covers the wider sphere.  Anything we discuss in a Euro-Bill is not confined entirely to Dáil Éireann but to the wider sphere of nine countries.  There is a Minister of State in all British Departments who is an intermediary between the Minister, the man who has overall charge, and what we call parliamentary secretaries here.  A somewhat similar situation exists in the German parliament.  The French parliament is so complicated that I could not possibly analyse it here. Deputy Haughey's amendment does not in any way affect the Government here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan's suggestion to meet the problem, if the Minister can accept it, is to have in brackets &ldquo;Member <Col N="1035" /> of the Government&rdquo;.  I do not know whether that would actually meet the bill but the Minister must have advisers who could tell him whether a Minister of State, which we have not got in this country but which we might find it desirable to have in the future, would meet the situation.  I see the difficulties which face the Minister in Deputy Haughey's amendment but there is a good deal to be said for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey is one of those far-seeing Deputies who looks to the future.  We are discussing problems which the European Parliament may be discussing in the future.  We may find ourselves up against whether a Minister of State can function or not. We might find it desirable at some future date to create Ministers of State so I think the Minister might give sympathetic consideration to it.</P>

      <P>My advice is that the Interpretation Act&mdash;I am not familiar with this area&mdash;lays down definitions.

The Act is directed at statute law.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 16, before &ldquo;make&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;with the prior approval of each House of the Oireachtas,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment suggests an alteration <Col N="1036" /> of section 3 (1) which states:</P>
    <P>A Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect.</P>
    <P>If the amendment is accepted it will read:</P>
    <P>A Minister of State may, with the prior approval of each House of the Oireachtas, make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Our reason for putting down this amendment is quite a simple one.  During the debate on Second Stage the Minister in Vol. 263, No. 2 of the Official Report of 26th October, at column 251, stated:</P>
    <P>The directives of the Community are to be applied in the member States by whatever method the national governments or Parliaments choose to adopt and it is these directives which are concerned in the ministerial regulations which will be made under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Later at column 254 he said:</P>
    <P>On the safeguards, the section which provides that the ministerial regulations will cease to have effect unless they are confirmed by Acts of the Oireachtas not later than the end of the year following the one in which they were made gives a very strong safeguard because it means the ministerial regulations will lapse if the Oireachtas does not pass them.  It allows for debate but, as Deputy Ryan has pointed out, there will have to be a majority decision situation.</P>
    <P>I intervened to say:</P>
    <P>They will be in operation for 12 months before the debate takes place?</P>
    <P>The Minister replied:</P>
    <P>They will...</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister, Deputy Hillery, was not quite correct and neither was I correct in saying that they would be in operation for 12 months because we are told that the section which provides for ministerial regulations will cease to have effect unless confirmed by Acts of the Oireachtas not later than the end of <Col N="1037" /> the year following the one in which they were made.  That means that if in January of one year the directive was made almost two years could elapse before it could be debated. Members of this party as well as members of other parties have always been severely critical in this House of legislation by ministerial order. We have the right to debate orders made within a matter of 21 sitting days but here there is a different situation whereby ministerial regulations not made on the initiative of our own Ministers but made because they are directives of the EEC, can be introduced by a Minister and can be in operation for almost two years, regardless of whether a majority of the House approve them, before opportunity is given to debate them.  This would be entirely wrong and on reflection I am sure the Minister will agree with me.  I suggest that instead of having this regulation as it is in section 3 (1), we should have the right to debate the directives before the order is made.  In that way we would safeguard the rights of the House and at least the Minister would be placed in the position of knowing that the order he was making would be given general approval.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Flanagan will agree with me when I say that I can foresee a situation arising whereby a regulation which may be suggested in a certain way by a Minister would not safeguard matters that are dear to the hearts of Members of the House and to people throughout the country affected by any such regulation.  An effort must be made to provide safeguards.  I am being reasonable on this matter.  As the Minister is aware, I opposed membership of EEC.  I consider it to be a bad bargain but we are now committed to going in and I shall not endeavour to hold up any necessary legislation in regard to our membership.  However we are entitled to ensure that there are safeguards and, consequently, I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.  It would be unfair of me to comment on Deputy Bruton's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 13 seeks to do a number of things but <Col N="1038" /> basically it seeks to write into this Bill the setting-up of a committee of the Dáil which would have the power to examine and advise the Minister on proposals that are before the Council of Ministers and which will be decided on in the future.  There is not much point in having a discussion here on any matter that has been decided already and which, therefore, cannot be affected by any such discussion. What is really valuable is that Members of this House should bring to bear on matters that have not been decided their knowledge of the effects on their constituents of any proposed legislation. What I am suggesting is consistent with Deputy Tully's suggestion, that is, that we should create a committee which would be in a position to examine all draft directives coming from the Community.  There are a vast number of draft directives covering a great many technical matters.  I am proposing that these should be examined in detail by a committee of this House.  Such committee should have available to it the best possible technical advice so that the committee, possibly with sub-committees, would be in a position to examine in detail draft proposals and how they would affect Irish law as well as affect the constituencies of the Deputies concerned.  The committee would be able to give to the Minister an informed opinion which would enable him to participate more effectively in the discussions of the Council of Ministers at which a final decision would be taken.</P>
      <P>One of the great strengths that a Minister can rely on in any negotiations with the Council of Ministers is to be able to say to his colleagues there: &ldquo;Unless you can give me this, I shall have great difficulty in justifying the position to my people at home.&rdquo;  If there has been no advance discussion on a particular proposal the Minister would not be able to say that with much force.  Obviously his hand would be strengthened if he could produce the deliberations of a Dáil committee referring to certain difficulties that might arise in relation to the implementation of any proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such a committee, too, would serve to educate Deputies on what is going <Col N="1039" /> on in the EEC and would enable them to give greater advice and assistance to their constituents.  Also, when the implementing legislation is going through they would be better able to participate usefully in suggesting the implementing regulations.</P>
    <P>Another point that is important is that the type of committee I envisage, and which would operate directly on the Irish members of the Council of Ministers, would bring a democratic voice into the legislative processes of the Community, a voice which at present is lacking.  The European Parliament is not elected directly by the people.  It is elected indirectly.  It has only consultant powers.  The ten Irish members will have to spend, perhaps, half the year away from this country. Therefore they will not be as much in touch with their constituents as would the members who spend almost all of the year here.  If this proposal is accepted we will be able to supplement our membership of ten in the European Parliament by having the views of those Deputies who are resident in the country for the greater part of the year brought to the attention of the ten members who in turn, will bring their views to the Commissioner who, ultimately, will be the man to make the decision on behalf of this country.  This would strengthen the process and would bring into the legislative machinery a greater number of people who are elected directly.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Tully will correct me if I am wrong but if I understand his amendment it is to ensure that there must be advance consultation with this House and with the Seanad in regard to any regulations which the Minister proposes to make in implementing the regulations.  I do not think that goes far enough because what the Deputy is proposing is that after a decision has been taken in principle in Brussels the Irish Minister must consult this House when he comes to implement that proposal by means of regulations.  My proposal is that not only must the House be consulted before then but that it must be consulted before any Community decision has been reached in Brussels.  The setting-up of a committee would be the means of implementing <Col N="1040" /> that proposal.  It is clear that every draft directive emanating from the EEC could not be discussed here across the floor of the House; that would take an enormous amount of time and money and many of the provisions that would be considered would contain matters that might not have any great implications for this country.</P>
    <P>Therefore I believe this function, which is a very detailed and technical one but nevertheless a very important one, could best be dealt with by means of a committee.  That committee must have fairly wide powers.  It must have a substantial secretariat which will automatically be able to bring every proposal before the committee in translation and also provide it with a memorandum on the basic effects of proposals on Irish law, spelling out what statutes are likely to be affected by any draft proposal which is before the Council of Ministers.  On the basis of that memorandum which the committee would receive they would be able to invite the Minister to come and explain his attitude to the proposal.</P>
    <P>It is important that this committee should not rely for its interpretation of the implications of a particular EEC proposal on the official version coming from the Department of the Minister concerned.  It must also have an independent secretariat of its own which could produce its own interpretation which would equip the committee members to debate on equal terms with the Minister any interpretation he might have.  This is something this House has lacked for many years and something which this committee should have if it is to deal with this very technical matter of EEC legislation.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary to have a very large committee because EEC legislation covers a huge area.  If we have a committee of 14 or 15 people, we are unlikely to get enough people who will be specialists in each particular area or we might have only one man who is a specialist, say, on fisheries legislation, and in that situation the committee would have to rely on that man only.  What we would need is a reasonably large basic committee, with subcommittees considering, broadly <Col N="1041" /> speaking, the areas of each Department and submitting its opinion to the committee itself.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other problems which will need to be decided upon in regard to any committee we set up.  One of them is to what extent the committee should be in private, to what extent it could require the Minister to appear before it.  I believe it should have the power to require the Minister to appear before it.  It is very important that that power should not be used frivolously.  In the EEC Ministers will have a greater burden of work than they have at the moment and it would not be fair to be asking them to appear before the committee all the time.  However, they must have that power and it must be used responsibly.  It should also have the power to call officials before it, to call outside evidence.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey raised another important point yesterday in relation to committees.  He said such a committee would diminish the effectiveness of the House in that every member would not be able to put his view to it.  I think that could be got around if it were given as a right to any Member of the Oireachtas to make an oral submission to the committee in relation to any directives and if, during the period that his oral submission in regard to directives was being discussed, he would be present to give his views on the matter.  This right of audience for Members of the House in committees of the House of which they themselves are not members is not without precedent. I understand it operates in the American Congress and it would get around Deputy Haughey's objection to committees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey seemed to suggest that this work should be done by a committee of the whole House on Fridays.  I am sure he is aware of the volume of Community legislation and the detail into which it sometimes goes, and also of the fact that a draft may be published at one stage by the Commission and before any final decision is taken that draft may be altered a number of times.  There would be grave difficulties involved in discussing that on the floor of the House.  Would you <Col N="1042" /> have to bring the matter before the House a second time if, before a decision was taken, the draft had been altered in some minor respect? I do not think it would be practical to adopt the procedure of having the whole House consider this matter.  A relatively informal committee with a specialised secretariat would be able to deal with this matter more efficiently and, as I suggest, all Members of the House could be allowed to make a submission or give evidence on a particular directive which would be before the committee at the time.  This committee should also publish a report every year, or maybe more often, on its deliberations, on its contact with the Minister, on whether or not a particular recommendation to a Minister had been accepted.</P>
    <P>I can see that there will be certain difficulties in regard to the operation of these committees.  The main one is that the Minister will hold all the cards.  If he is being asked to justify the fact that a particular proposal accepted by the EEC was not in the terms in which the committee of the House wished it he would be able to say: &ldquo;I am the only person who was there at the Council of Ministers.  I am the only person who knows exactly how the powers lay within the committee.  I am the only person who can say what attitude each other member of the Council adopted.  Therefore I am the only person who can say whether or not it was possible to get a particular proposal which reflected the view of the committee accepted by the Council.&rdquo; That is a constraint we shall have. Again perhaps the Minister will not want to disclose or possibly will not be able to disclose the attitude adopted by other members of the Council of Ministers, even to a committee of the House.  This will restrict the debate to some degree.  However, it is important that the Minister should be bound to disclose his position to the committee, should be prepared to explain how he acted on behalf of Ireland.  The Minister is acting as a Member of this House on the Council of Ministers and the Government of which he is a member is responsible to this House.  While he may not be able to give details <Col N="1043" /> about every other Minister, he should at least give details to such a committee of the attitude he adopted so that the committee can establish whether or not he has been doing his job.</P>
    <P>The procedure I am envisaging is not at all without precedent within the European Community, and this is something to which I referred last night.  The German Bundestag, when it was doing what we are doing today, namely, ratifying the European Communities legislation in 1958, inserted a clause into the Act which bound the Government to communicate projected EEC decisions to the Bundestag prior to a decision being taken on them so that the Bundestag could express its view on them.  What has happened I understand is that when the President of the Bundestag receives from the Government a particular draft directive which is proposed he refers it to a committee of the House which will then be able to go into it, tease it out and see how it affects existing German practice and advise the Minister as to the line he might consider taking on the matter.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise the great complexity of EEC legislation and the fact that our fellow parliamentarians in Europe have the benefit of a very comprehensive and well-developed committee system which can go into, in much greater detail, any legislative proposal, whether it be European or national, than can this House: a committee can obviously tease out matters much better than a forum such as this in which we are bound by certain procedures.  In setting up a committee to deal with European affairs we would be, I think, taking a necessary step to redress the balance <i>vis-à-vis</i> parliamentarians in Europe who have already available to them a committee system, which is, to my mind, a more effective check on the activities of Ministers than is our present procedure here.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, vitally important that the committee and the fact that it exists is not interpreted by the Ceann Comhairle, or anyone else, as in any way justifying a diminution of the <Col N="1044" /> rights of Members to raise EEC matters here by the existing procedures. Members must have the right to put down parliamentary questions on EEC matters and the right to have a debate on the Adjournment, should that be necessary, on these parliamentary questions.  That right must be preserved quite independently of a committee being set up.  This is something to which Deputy Flanagan referred; it is imperative that existing rights should not be eroded; it is vital that whatever we do should not be allowed to justify any diminution of existing safeguards.</P>
    <P>My amendment is constituted of three parts.  So far, I have dealt with one, namely, the provision that:</P>
    <P>( ) Any Committee referred to in the foregoing subsection shall have power</P>
    <P>(a) to examine and advise a Minister of State and Irish Members of the European Parliament on all EEC Commission proposals prior to decisions thereon being taken by the Council of Ministers, and...</P>
    <P>There are two other provisions in the amendment.  The one I have just quoted relates to draft proposals which have not been agreed by the Council of Ministers.  The other two proposals relate to the implementation of matters already agreed by the Council of Ministers but, in relation to which, it is still open to the Government to implement them in a particular way and the Government are given a certain freedom as to the way in which an agreed decision may be implemented.  These are basically directives of the EEC.  First of all, my amendment proposes that the decision as to whether or not a particular directive shall be implemented by means of a regulation, a procedure which does not allow for the same degree of public debate, or by means of legislation, which makes for great public scrutiny, shall not be a matter for the Government because, quite clearly, the Government and civil servants, naturally enough, will want only the minimum inconvenience in implementing EEC proposals.  They will not want every line of their proposals <Col N="1045" /> to be scrutinised here and they will, therefore, tend towards wanting to implement directives by means of regulation rather than by legislation which could be publicly debated here.</P>
    <P>The protection in this regard is very weak.  The Taoiseach, when introducing the Bill, said that a Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Bill to have full effect and he also said that some directives are more important than others and it may be that it will be found desirable in a particular case to implement by statute Community legislation which might not be directly applicable.  It may be that it will be found desirable to implement it by statute and it may be that it will not be desirable to implement it by statute.  Who will find it desirable or otherwise?  The Minister.  He will be the person to decide whether or not he will have the inconvenience of introducing a particular matter here by legislation or merely implementing it by regulation which nobody may possibly discuss at all.  He will be the person who will decide whether he himself will have to go to this trouble.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly, this is giving this power to an interested party, to someone who will want to minimise personal inconvenience and, because of that, he will reduce the extent to which debate can take place here on the precise implementation of directives, directives in relation to which the Government may have quite a degree of freedom as to the manner in which they will be implemented. My amendment proposes that the decision as to whether or not a particular directive is important enough to warrant implementation by legislation should not be a decision for a particular Minister but rather a decision for a committee of this House. It is important that this should be accepted.  Where it is decided by this committee that the matter shall be done by regulation rather than by legislation, there might be, as I said, considerable leeway for the Government as to the way in which they may implement a particular directive.  In the case of directives with regard to <Col N="1046" /> farm structures the Government may be free not to implement a certain directive at all in certain parts of the country; they might be free to vary the terms of the scheme introduced under the directive in relation to different regions.  They might, for instance, be able to give a higher rate of grants for the keeping of farm accounts in the west than they do in the south.</P>
    <P>This is something left to the Irish Government.  This is not something laid down in Brussels.  Quite clearly, the Government will have a very wide area of discretion and, since the Government are responsible to this House, it is important that the way they exercise this discretion should be amenable to discussion in this House.  My first proposal is that the manner of implementation should be decided by the committee and will obviously be gone into in great detail.  Suppose the committee say that the directive may be implemented by regulation, the present proposal in regard to such regulations is, to my mind, without precedent.  The existing procedure for regulations is that any Member of this House may seek to have any regulation annulled within 21 days and, as a matter of right, he is given Government time to have that motion for annulment discussed.  That is an important protection of the rights of Members in regard to the exercise of ministerial power in the making of regulations. The Bill before the House proposes to take away that power and, if I understand the provision correctly, there has to be a recall of the Dáil during the recess to have these regulations discussed. There is no provision in regard to the 21 days' motion for annulment. The provision in the Bill reads:</P>
    <P>If when regulations under this Act are made, or at any time thereafter and before the regulations are confirmed or cease to have statutory effect, Dáil Éireann stands adjourned for a period of more than ten days and if, during the adjournment, a majority of the members of Dáil Éireann by notice in writing to the Ceann Comhairle require Dáil Éireann to be summoned, the Ceann Comhairle shall summon Dáil Éireann <Col N="1047" /> to meet on a day named by him being neither more than twenty-one days after the receipt by him of the notice nor less than ten days after the issue of the summons.</P>
    <P>In order, therefore, to get a particular regulation discussed, not only has one to raise the matter during the recess but also &mdash; possibly I am wrong in my interpretation here&mdash;one has to have a majority of the Dáil behind one.  There is nothing in this Bill which says that regulations made under it shall be subject to the normal procedure in respect of annulment, which provides the power for a motion of annulment within 21 days.  I believe the original procedure is itself an inadequate protection because it only allows a motion to annul the regulation: you have to reject the regulation <i>in toto</i> or you are not allowed to discuss the matter at all. Many regulations may be brought before the House in pursuance of EEC directives which, while generally all right, may require amendment in regard to specific provisions.  Clearly we could not have this House amending those regulations in a way which would be inconsistent with the original directive of the Community.  If a Member wished to put down an amendment to modify a particular regulation there would obviously have to be some mechanism for deciding whether or not that amendment was inconsistent with the basic Community directive and therefore impossible.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that these committes of the Dáil which I suggest be set up should be given power to decide whether a particular proposed amendment of a regulation is inconsistent with the basic directive and if it is, obviously the amendment will fall.  It is important that that decision should not be a matter for the Minister who might have an interest in getting it through but it should be a matter for an organ of the House in which all parties would be represented.  It is also important to recognise an important distinction made in this amendment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the existing procedure in regard to regulations, that this amendment proposes that Members of the House shall be free to <Col N="1048" /> amend regulations.  At present you may not discuss a regulation made unless you are prepared to have it annulled <i>in toto</i>.  To my mind, that is not adequate, you must have power to amend it.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, that is the position but I see Deputy Haughey shaking his head.  I am not experienced in these matters and I may be wrong.  It is important that we should discuss proposals made by the EEC prior to a decision being taken on them by the Council of Ministers.  It is not much use coming in, as this Bill proposes, and having a global Bill implementing everything that has happened in the past 12 months, or something like that.  Such a discussion would be quite unreal, just as unreal as it is at the moment in regard to many regulations which have already gone through.  We require a procedure for discussing draft regulations and draft directives before a final decision has been taken so that this House can have an influence on the position ultimately adopted by the Minister at the Council of Ministers when the decision is actually being taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me that the Minister could not possibly accept amendment No. 7 as it would be completely impracticable to put in a provision of this sort.  It is clear that as the Community evolves and develops and as we participate in its economic and social programmes and policies&mdash; particularly in its economic programmes&mdash;there will be occasions when the Minister of the Irish Government would have to make regulations which would become immediately operative.  It is not difficult to visualise the circumstances that might make this necessary.  They could arise in regard to dumping or animal health or 101 other situations could evolve where it would be necessary for a regulation to be made here by a Minister to deal with an immediate, urgent, emergency situation.  I do not think that Deputies could possibly insist on the prior approval of the Oireachtas before any regulation is made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy Bruton's amendment I say broadly that I do not think what <Col N="1049" /> we are going to do in this area should be done by an amendment of this Bill. We are fairly well agreed that some new machinery, some new procedure, must be devised but I suggest that should be done through the Standing Orders of the House or in some such way by agreement.  We should not incorporate in this legislation, as Deputy Bruton attempts to do, details of this new machinery or procedure.  That is something we should look at separately on another occasion.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Bill on the Second Stage the Taoiseach made a very good point when he said this Bill was more or less confined to broad general principles.  He said:</P>
    <P>However, the Bill now before the House is a measure of broad principle rather than of detail.  It would be inappropriate to distinguish between Community provisions by dealing with some of them and not with others in such a Bill.</P>
    <P>That is a good principle to which we should adhere.  I would have a number of specific objections to Deputy Bruton's proposal as he has spelled it out in this amendment but it should be sufficient at this stage that the amendment should not be pressed particularly in view of the fact that the Minister gave an undertaking yesterday that some such machinery will be provided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I did not want to comment on Deputy Bruton's amendment because I was not quite sure what was intended until he explained it.  It is rather a pity he did not treat my amendment in the same way.  He referred to the large number of regulations. When the Minister was replying to the Second Reading debate he said their estimate &ldquo;without fixing it because it is something we know we do not know, is that once you get over the number of regulations a Minister requires now for the period of entry, an average year would see about 20 ministerial regulations brought to this House&rdquo;.  These are the Minister's words as reported at column 254, volume 263 of the Official Report.  We are talking of about 20 regulations a year and many of those need not come <Col N="1050" /> before the House, only those which are challenged.  I assume this is the way our amendment would operate; that is what we intended.</P>
      <P>For a few minutes I thought Deputy Bruton was becoming mixed up in his Ministers.  We have the Ministers of the Council of Europe of whom we have one here, a Commissioner.  We would not have a Minister here.  The Minister we are talking about who would be introducing these regulations would not have got his instructions in the Council of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He might not.  I see no reason why even Community legislation should not be discussed by everybody who has an interest in it or can influence it in any way before it is finalised.  I do not think we should reach the stage where, if we did not agree with what the Minister was doing, there should be some peculiar committee which would have the effect of nullifying it.  The right to nullify or to amend must rest with the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may be misunderstanding my amendment.  The amendment proposes that draft regulations that have not yet been agreed could be discussed and that in regard to the other regulations that they would decide (a) whether or not they should be implemented by regulation or legislation and (b) whether or not an amendment put down in the House to a particular regulation was in order as regards compatibility with the basic directive from which the original Government regulation sprung.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not proposing in any way to delegate the powers as regards the acceptance or rejection of the final regulation which is made by the Government. That clearly rests with the House.  But, a committee would obviously <Col N="1051" /> be able to go into the matter in greater detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, I have difficulty in accepting that that would be possible. I believe it is ludicrous to suggest that regulations of the kind described here which may have a far-reaching effect on the country should be allowed to stand for up to two years before they would even be commented upon in the House.  Therefore, I want to tell the Minister that I propose to press this amendment to a division, if necessary, in order to ensure that the Minister or the party does not get away with a proposal which will leave us in that position. It is bad enough that Estimates are discussed in the spring when the money has already been spent.  It is now suggested that up to two years after a regulation has been made we should be allowed to talk about it in the House.  My party will not agree that this is the way it should be done. If the Minister says that he agrees that this is not the right way and that he is prepared to propose something else on Report Stage, then we can have another look at it.  As it stands, I would have to tell the Minister that we would have to oppose the section.</P>

      <P>An extraordinary change has come over the House in 30 years.  In 30 years all of us experience inward and outward change.  It may be that our intellect grows dimmer.  Can one imagine the reception that a proposal of this kind would have had in the House 30 years ago?  Can one imagine the reaction of the House 30 years ago to any effort to diminish or to surrender the right of Parliament to discuss and to decide matters of national, international and local concern?  Deputy Vivion de Valera last night maintained that this Parliament is the sovereign authority.  In my view our entry into the EEC takes from this Parliament the sovereign right to legislate and the right, authority, power and supremacy of Parliament is diminished by our entry into the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must ask what was the purpose of the Labour and Fine Gael Deputies in putting down these amendments <Col N="1052" /> for the consideration of the House. Is it not right that Parliament should know what is going on in Brussels? Is it not right that Parliament should be consulted in relation to matters concerning agriculture, fisheries, wages, prices, industry?  In the event of a regulation being made which may affect industry, trade unions, workers, which may bring about a credit squeeze or be responsible for inflation or deflation, which may have some bearing on our agricultural policy, there would be no point in discussing that regulation two years after it had been made.  Parliament must be in a position to express an opinion and to guide our Minister in Brussels.  Public opinion can only be expressed through Parliament and the opinion expressed by Parliament will be the guideline for the Minister in acting on behalf of this country in Europe.</P>
    <P>It is right and reasonable in any democracy that Parliament should have the right to express an opinion in regard to any order which may be made in Brussels affecting this country. How can a Minister subscribe to an order without knowing whether the order is welcome or not in his own country and whether its effects will be in the public interest?  Or, is this House to give Ministers a licence to make orders in Brussels as they see fit?  Now that we are entering the EEC the Members of this House must maintain the right of this Parliament to discuss and to express an opinion.  We cannot change the proceedings in Brussels but we have the right to criticise and we should have the right to debate every order and every regulation and, as has been pointed out, there is no point in discussion when the order has been made and is in force and is part of the law.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that all these regulations and orders should be debated in committee.  If, as we are told, approximately only 20 of these orders and regulations will be made per year, and many of them will be just noted by the House without discussion, assuming that five of them are of vital importance, cannot the House devote ten days to them?  I am sure two days for each of the five orders would be sufficient for Deputies <Col N="1053" /> to express their opinions on them and would either hoist the green light of clearance or the red light of danger to the Minister.  It has been suggested that it would be impracticable for the full House to debate approximately 20 regulations per year.</P>

      <P>That is wrong in principle.  There are certain Deputies who look upon themselves as specialists in agriculture.  There are certain Deputies who look upon themselves as trade union specialists, who speak for the workers and who are entitled to speak for the workers. There are Deputies who have legal training and who speak in high terms on constitutional and other law.  There are Deputies who are qualified to speak on industrial relations and on industry in all its aspects.  Then there may be the Deputy like myself who chances <Col N="1054" /> his arm and speaks on all these subjects, from time to time with a greater degree of intelligence than the specialists.</P>
      <P>I would never have a snowball's chance in hell of being appointed to a committee to deal with EEC matters. I want to protect my rights as a Deputy.  I want Members of Parliament to retain, so far as possible, their right to speak on matters relating to the EEC.  I am not alluding in any way to my own party but we have in every party what is known as the lap dog Deputy who will be appointed to these committees whether he qualifies or not.  That is not in the interests of Parliament.  I am not referring to my own political party; I am referring to all political parties.  No matter how a Deputy may have sounded public opinion, if a committee is appointed to look into these rules and regulations, if he cannot get inside the committee room, he is in an inferior position to that of the Deputies appointed to the committee.  That is wrong.  It will prevent the free and proper functioning of Parliament.  We must preserve Parliament.  If we are to preserve Parliament we cannot cut out some Deputies and put others on committees.</P>
      <P>If the House goes into committee that is all right but, if a select committee is appointed to deal with all EEC matters, I will feel a very small boy if I have to ask the committee to allow me to make an oral or a written submission.  I will be degrading and lowering my standing as a Member of this Parliament.  That goes for every other Member of the House who is a backbencher.  We must preserve our right to speak.  We must preserve our right to represent our people.  We must preserve the right to make known the views of our constituents. We cannot do that if we cannot get inside the door of the committee room, if we cannot get into the secret chamber to do it.  The only place we can do that is in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always cherished Parliament. I have always cherished the right of people to speak in Parliament.  I have always thought that it was the greatest possible exercise in democracy that, no matter what standard of intelligence a person had, if he came here as an <Col N="1055" /> elected representative of the people, provided he kept within the rules of order, no one could prevent him from speaking.  That is the great essence of democracy.  That is what democracy is all about.  If we are to have privileged Deputies who are lucky enough to reach the dizzy heights of being appointed to a select committee and in a position to express their views that will be all right for them, but what about the Deputy who does not attain those dizzy heights?  How will he express an opinion?  Will he have to go cap in hand and ask to be allowed to give evidence before a committee of his own colleagues, Deputies elected in the same way, and given the same rights by the people? That will make second-class Deputies. It will lead to a lower standard of Deputy.  It will be a reflection on him in regard to all aspects of social, economic, financial, agricultural and industrial matters.</P>
    <P>The Deputy outside the committee cannot speak.  He will not be in the know.  He will be a second-class Deputy.  The lap dog Deputy who is appointed to the committee will have all the inside information.  In the interests of democracy I say that is not right.  Deputies have, and should have equal rights.  The day this House prevents all Deputies from sharing jointly in the making of laws, in the expression of opinions, will be a sad day for this Parliament and for democracy. We should cherish our rights.  They are going away slowly from us.  They are dwindling before our very eyes. I would feel seriously agitated by any steps taken to restrict Members of this Parliament in the exercise of their official duty to speak on behalf of the people they represent.</P>
    <P>Strangely enough, I find myself in agreement with Deputy Haughey. There was a time when both of us could speak from the front benches. I do not think either of us could be farther back now&mdash;one of the changes of the past 30 years.  I agree with him when he says that a day or two could be set aside by this Parliament solely for discussion of EEC matters.  They involve the whole Parliament and if any Deputy says he does not understand <Col N="1056" /> these matters, that they are documents of a highly technical character, there will be no obligation on him to attend.</P>
    <P>But at least Parliament should facilitate Deputies who have an interest in such matters to come in to join in a general discussion.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs last night or this morning spoke about certain confidential orders and regulations.  We quite understand that some of the EEC business is of a confidential character but in my 30 years in the House, even during the last war when we had to discuss censorship and the security of the State and matter of supplies, there has never been a time when Parliament insisted on discussion behind closed doors and barred windows.  Are we now to have the spectacle of Deputies hooded or disguised entering a room and behind closed doors secretly discussing matters which will be of vital importance to the community?  These matters will affect the lives of all of us and I do not think we should consider for one moment that we should resolve ourselves into moonlighters, legislating in the dark, behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>That is why I say that even if there are to be 30 decisions taken, 30 debates, in the course of a year, these should occur openly and above board. Do not let us legislate behind closed doors.  I cannot understand the type of regulation or order, unless it involved important security matters, which would demand that we do this.  We are living in modern times when efficiency is being sacrificed for speed. In an elected assembly like Parliament, however, there cannot be speed at the expense of efficiency.  Therefore, there is no need for hush-hush debates or discussions on these orders and regulations: they must be debated deliberately in open Parliament, having been presented by a Minister who must explain openly the entire circumstances involved.</P>
    <P>I have no serious axe to grind with those who advocate the appointment of committees beyond saying that it is wrong to have what I might call a selection of Deputies.  It is wrong to <Col N="1057" /> create a situation in which some Deputies would be looked on as being superior to others in matters affecting EEC membership.  That would be to diminish the authority, the right and the power of Parliament.  Members of this House are all of equal standing in so far as they are concerned with public business and that is why I say that all orders and regulations that have to be discussed must be discussed openly in this Parliament before they are sent to Brussels for approval.</P>

    <P>Lead pollution of the environment may arise from lead emissions from motor vehicles and in this connection I would refer the Deputy to the reply by the Minister for Local Government to a question on the 17th November. 1971, to the effect that the level of lead <Col N="1061" /> emissions from motor vehicles in countries such as Ireland does not constitute a danger to human health.</P>
    <P>With regard to lead content in foods, the position is that the presence of trace elements of lead in food from raw materials or manufacturing processes is controlled by the Health (Arsenic and Lead in Food) Regulations, 1972, and samples of food are examined from time to time in the public analysts' laboratories with a view to ensuring that the lead contents do not exceed the levels laid down.</P>

      <P>The suggestion in the newspaper article referred to by the Deputy that Irish farmers would lose money by the operation of VAT in relation to exports of livestock is without foundation.</P>
      <P>I would draw the Deputy's attention to the statement issued by the Revenue Commissioners on November 3rd, a copy of which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P Just="Center">Statement by the Revenue Commissioners Value-Added Tax in Relation to Cattle Exports</P>
      <P>The attention of the Revenue Commissioners has been drawn to a recent newspaper article on the application of VAT to the livestock trade with particular regard to the export of cattle.</P>
      <P>A person who is registered for VAT and who purchases live cattle from an unregistered farmer is entitled to treat 1 per cent of the price as tax available for credit against his VAT liability, or available for repayment if he has no liability.  Thus, if the price paid were £100, this could be treated for tax purposes as follows&mdash;</P>

    <P>The effect of this arrangement is that a registered buyer who would be willing to pay £99 for an animal before the commencement of VAT, is now in a position to pay £100, and thus the price obtained by unregistered farmers for cattle should rise by 1 per cent.  (This will compensate the farmer for VAT borne on his purchases of seeds, <i>et cetera,</i> but will not give rise to an increase in the price of meat or other livestock products.)</P>
    <P>A registered exporter will be entitled to repayment of 1 per cent of the cost price to him of the animals exported, and he will thus, as in the example quoted, be in a position to pass the 1 per cent tax credit on to the farmer in the form of an increase in the price. <Col N="1068" /> He will sell to the foreign buyer at a tax-exclusive price and, consequently, there would be no question of passing on any portion of the tax refund to the foreign buyer.</P>
    <P>It is necessary, for control purposes, to channel all tax credits through registered persons.  A foreign buyer who merely purchases cattle here would not qualify for registration and would not, therefore, be entitled to repayment of the 1 per cent tax.  One livestock mart has met this situation by arranging that all cattle for export will be sold to and subsequently exported by a separate non-profit making export company. Under this arrangement, the animal is sold to the export company for a tax-inclusive price of, say, £100, the company exports the animal, charges the same tax-inclusive price to the foreign buyer, claims back the 1 per cent tax, and later passes on the benefit of this repayment, after a deduction for expenses, to the foreign buyer.  The result achieved is approximately the same as if the foreign buyer were a registered person, had exported the animal himself and had obtained repayment of the 1 per cent tax included in the cost price.  In either case the farmer would have obtained a price which included the 1 per cent tax compensation, and the foreign buyer would effectively have acquired the animal at a tax-exclusive price.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners were consulted about these procedures and they confirmed that they would achieve the desired result.  They are aware that the two bodies mainly concerned with the livestock mart trade are fully informed of the position. Discussions on the setting up of suitable procedures are continuing. 3rd November, 1972.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave him on 1st December, 1971, Vol. 257, col. 926, regarding the draft proposal to which he refers.  As I indicated in that reply, the proposal would provide that, as from 1st January, 1976, excise duty in excess of certain limits would not be levied on fuel oils.  As these oils do not, at present, bear any effective charge of excise duty in this country the draft directive would not affect the current tax burden or the structure of our duties on oils.  The necessity for discussions with trade interests does not, therefore, arise.  The draft directive has not yet been adopted by the Council.</P>

      <P>The EEC proposal to which the Deputy refers relates to a draft directive which sets out the conditions that would apply to the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of a range of self-employed activities in the member states of the European Community.</P>
      <P>As I indicated the document is in draft form and has been before the Council since June, 1971.  Present indications are that it is not likely to be adopted before the enlargement of the Community takes place.</P>
      <P>The draft directive is under examination by the various Departments which may have functions in relation to areas of activity covered by it, but its adoption in its present form would not appear to present any particular difficulties for this country.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The draft directive does propose, in respect of certain occupations, a certain minimum period of training before one may avail of the benefits before taking up that profession in another member country.  The matter is being examined at present. The stage has not been reached where it would be fruitful to have consultation with any interests affected here. There is not yet sufficient clarity on what is involved.  Discussions are going on about that.  In so far as any consultation is necessary with the interests, in Ireland, this would be a matter for the particular Departments involved.  I cannot say with certainty at what stage that might happen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be a matter of considerable concern if, as a result of this directive, the qualifications for entry into any profession here had to be diluted to a level below that which exists at the moment, thereby reducing the standards of the profession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not answer that question in theory.  It would have to relate to a particular profession.  It would also have to relate to what was, in fact, happening rather than what is in the draft.

He realises I am sure, as well as I do, that the local estate which is not divided yet would not be sufficient for the congests in the area and that this 77 acres would be a great help. I warned the Land Commission several months ago that there would be trouble in this area if the Land Commission did not acquire this estate and the Minister must be aware now that there is trouble brewing in this area. I would ask him at this point to ask the Land Commission to acquire this estate for division among the congests in the interests of justice and fair play.</P>

      <P>It was hoped that the holdings referred to&mdash;with the exception of the Flanagan property&mdash; would have been allocated last spring. In the event this did not prove possible due to delay in obtaining possession of one of the holdings.  Possession of all the lands has now passed to the Land Commission.  Composite proposals have been drawn up for the disposal thereof together with a Colgan holding in the same area, aggregating 264 acres, and it is hoped to allot the lands within the next few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the lands in question were advertised for sale by public auction to take place on 24th January, 1972. Prior to the auction&mdash;on 13th January, 1972&mdash;the Land Commission served a notice, under section 40 of the Land Act, 1923, of their intention to inspect the lands to ascertain their suitability for the purposes of the Land Acts. The service of such a notice prohibited, for a period of at least three months, a sale of the land without the consent in writing of the Land Commission. The auction was held and the lands were purported to be sold.  As a result of their inspection, however, the Land Commission decided to institute proceedings for the acquisition of the lands.  The relevant statutory notices were published and no objection to the proceedings was lodged.  The case then proceeded to the price negotiations stage and at this point the auctioneer acting for the owner informed the Land Commission that an adjoining smallholder was prepared to buy the lands.  Having investigated the matter the Land Commission decided to allow sale to the smallholder in question and to terminate their proceedings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that when this land was offered for public auction quite a number of farmers bid on it, eventually one of them was successful but in the eyes of the Land Commission he was not suitable?  After the usual paper work the Land Commission decided that they would acquire the land.  They later decided they would not acquire the land because some individual made an application to buy it.  Were all those people who bid for that land at the auction not entitled to the same opportunity to buy that land from <Col N="1078" /> the Land Commission as the individual in respect of whom the Land Commission sanctioned the sale of the land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Land Commission to have inspections carried out and decisions conveyed to interested parties as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>As regard compulsory proceedings, I may add that where the Land Commission serve an inspection notice it is statutorily provided that the lands which are the subject of the notice shall not be sold, transferred, let, sublet or subdivided without the consent in writing of the Land Commission for a period of three months, and this period may be extended by another three months.  In practice, however, in the vast majority of cases the inspections are carried out and a decision made within the first three months and it is only rarely found necessary to extend the period.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister do anything to expedite the acquisition and, subsequently, the sub-division of holdings acquired by the Land Commission? There is too much delay involved and it is this delay that is responsible for the questions tabled here today.  I do not know how anybody can justify the delay of six years by the Land Commission in sub-dividing a holding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the subject of acquisition the reply I have here refers to the three months-six months statutory period.  However, I do not think the Deputy is referring to that but to negotiations or other attempts by the Land Commission to acquire land other than through the section 40 procedure.  Obviously there cannot be a delay of more than six months as the delay can be of only three months which can be extended to six months.  There would have to be a decision within six months.  The Deputy must be thinking of other cases where negotiation is protracted over a long period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The quality and grading of Irish timber are influenced largely by practices and standards applied in the sawmilling industry and the Forest and Wildlife Service has arranged in liaison with the Home Grown Timber Merchants Association to initiate a study of this and other aspects of our timber production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Difficulty in the organisation of sales arises primarily from the relatively small production of sawlog size timber which is as yet coming from the State <Col N="1088" /> forests but some steps are being taken to increase sawlog supplies in the short term.  Detailed information on this matter will be made available to the trade as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The planning of the State afforestation programme requires the maintenance of a substantial land reserve to ensure orderly development and to avoid violent fluctuation in the labour force.  The existing land reserve is barely adequate to support the 25,000 acre planting programme which was restored last year and which it is intended to maintain in the coming planting season.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the group certificate examination is fulfilling the purpose for which it was intended originally?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education in what circumstances (a) a student was accredited with a D in honours leaving certificate geography which was not taken in the examination, (b) a student received honours in art for which he had not studied, (c) five student have been awarded honours in science for which they had not studied and (d) a boy student in a vocational school passed in Italian, a subject not taught in his school; if he considers that parents can have confidence in a system which permits such results; and what action he has taken or proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaving and intermediate certificate examinations involve catering for over 66,000 candidates and the marking of over 650,000 answer books.  All the work entailed is done by reference to the examination number assigned to candidates. If, for example, a candidate wrongly enters on an answer book the examination number of another candidate in the case of a subject not <Col N="1092" /> being taken by the other candidate it is only when the results are issued that the error can be detected.  The same thing can occur where an assistant examiner enters results in the wrong column on the results sheet.</P>
      <P>It is because of this that the leaving certificate results issued in August are provisional.  Results incorrectly credited to any candidate come to light immediately that the provisional results are issued.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the number of candidates and answer books involved, it is to the credit of the elaborate checking system adopted by the Department that so very few mistakes occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister cannot look lightly on a very serious mistake such as is implied in the question.  Is he not aware of the grave lack of confidence of parents in the whole structure of the leaving certificate?  Furthermore, can the Minister tell us if he has taken any steps in regard to disciplinary action against whoever was responsible for issuing so many incorrect results in the leaving certificate, and whether any single one of us in business who would be responsible for such a gross error could remain five minutes in business?  What does he propose to do about the serious implications of these errors which he admits are a fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept at all what the Deputy says.  I have pointed out to him that there are 650,000 answer books, that the number of errors are very slight and are often caused by the fact that a student puts down a wrong number on his answer paper.  It also can happen where an assistant examiner enters results in a wrong column.  To suggest that this is a very serious matter is ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell me, since he has personally investigated this matter, if it is a fact that, in the case of the five students who had been awarded honours in science, each of them gave the wrong number?  I can assure the Minister that is not so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say those particular students did.  I said very often the reason why there is an error is that they give a wrong number.  In this case what happened was that the examiner, in error, entered five results in chemistry under two different sets of examination numbers on his marking sheet.  That is the case which got very considerable publicity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very few cases, and, in fact, nobody was at any loss in relation to this, because it was inevitable, as soon as the results were issued&mdash;and, as I said, these results are provisional results&mdash;that the error is detected.  I was rather amused at seeing some headlines in the newspapers, that the parents were very disturbed that their children had been allotted marks to which they had not been entitled because they did not do the examination in the particular subjects. I could quite understand parents being disturbed at the opposite.</P>

      <P>I have already pointed out that there were 650,000 <Col N="1094" /> examination papers.  Surely nothing can go wrong in this particular instance for the simple reason that if a student is not awarded marks for a particular subject which he has done in the examination, he or his school will not be very long about letting us know about this and this matter can be rectified immediately.  Nobody is ever at any loss over it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say something further on this?  The students who make up this 4 per cent repeated the examination in September and as a result of that the final percentage failure was 2.9 per cent.  In actual fact, the number who failed the leaving certificate examination because of Irish alone is .3 of 1 per cent.</P>

      <P>In reply to a further question here in the Dáil in relation to that I said that the Minister for Finance has set up a commission to examine the whole question of people's attitude and so on to the Irish language and that I did not propose to make any changes until such time as I had the findings of this commission.  At the time I indicated that this would take about two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will state the number of married women who are employed as teachers in (a) secondary and (b) vocational schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>1,099 married women are employed as recognised teachers in secondary schools.</P>
      <P>There are 434 married women employed as whole-time teachers in vocational schools and 355 as part-time teachers.</P>
      <P>The Department has no information as to the marital status of part-time teachers in secondary schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister if he is satisfied with that level of expenditure and if he is satisfied with a situation where no information at all exists about the use of audio-visual aids in primary schools, which seems an extraordinary state of affairs in 1972?  The figures he quotes&mdash;£25,000 for secondary schools and £17,000 for primary schools&mdash;are very small.  Has he any plans to increase this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>These schemes have been introduced relatively recently and we have been increasing the amounts of money being made available for the purpose of audio-visual aids.  One of the reasons why we have not got the information in relation to primary schools is that the scheme of grants was introduced only last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the main reason why some national schools are not able to install audio-visual aids is that there are no facilities <Col N="1097" /> available in the school for their installation&mdash;for instance, there is no special room available into which to put these audio-visual aids&mdash;and that this will hamper the expansion of this idea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it will hamper it.  We can be proud of the manner in which we have been making available special rooms, new schools and so on in recent years.</P>

      <P>Before Questions I was dealing with the right of a Member of Parliament to speak in Parliament.  Unless Parliament can be used for this purpose, then the whole function of Parliament falls by the wayside.  This is relevant to the views expressed by Deputy Enright, with whom I sympathise very sincerely, in relation to the situation of a particular industry in the constituency he and I represent.  We will perhaps have an opportunity of raising this particular matter more fully with the Minister on an appropriate occasion.  We are dealing now with the serious aspects of this European Communities Bill. We are dealing, in particular, with the right of the House to discuss and debate regulations before they are made by the appropriate Minister. It has been suggested that a committee should be set up for this purpose to ensure that the regulation is consistent with the provision of the original Community directive which the regulation seeks to implement. The amendment further provides:</P>
      <P>( ) Any Committee referred to in the foregoing subsection shall have power</P>
      <P>(a) to examine and advise a Minister of State and Irish Members of the European Parliament on all EEC Commission proposals prior to decisions thereon being taken by the Council of Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the Council of Ministers of the EEC.  Nobody could find fault with that.  I would certainly prefer, instead of any committee advising and conveying its views prior to the action to be taken by the <Col N="1103" /> Council of Ministers, this House in Committee to express its opinion on all these matters.</P>
      <P>Subsection (b) of the amendment provides:</P>
      <P>(b) to decide whether any EEC directive (i.e. proposal which is not directly applicable) should be implemented by regulation under this Act or by new legislation.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult for one not to subscribe to the idea of an amendment of this kind but I am afraid, and here I am giving the House the benefit of my own opinion and experience, that to restrict the right of Members of this House and to create what could be described as privileged Members of the House, would not be in the best interests of democracy.</P>

      <P>It is very, very clear that the whole EEC set up is designed to restrict the rights of Parliament. Let us be cautious and careful that we do not further restrict our own rights as Members of this Parliament. The matter of examining and reporting on regulations and deciding whether new legislation will be required is something that should be debated in <Col N="1104" /> Parliament as a whole.  It may be that the suggested committee may make recommendations and report back to the House and discussion may then take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to agree with the Deputy.  We all agree on the lack of rights.  I do not want any of my rights to be discharged in Brussels; I want to discharge them in this House.  Brussels will be no part of my constituency.  I want to preserve the rights of this, as Deputy de Valera described it, sovereign authority.  I want to preserve the rights of this Parliament as a sovereign authority. I do not want to see some Deputies brought into inner rooms to discuss EEC matters <i>ad lib</i> and other Deputies left out and dependent on getting reports back from the privileged Deputies on the committee.  That is not democracy; it is curtailing the rights of Parliament, preventing Parliament from discharging its full responsibilities in regard to EEC matters.</P>
      <P>I trust the Minister will see the point of view of Deputies who may be anxious to co-operate in every possible way in Parliament but who may not have the privilege, the capacity or the luck to be appointed or elected to or co-opted on to such a committee. In the case of certain committees of the House of Representatives in the US a notice is placed on the notice board inviting members of the House to participate in various committees but there is no restriction on any Congressman from actively participating in any committee because most of the debates take place in the House as a whole in committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To restrict a committee of this kind, dealing with such a wide and important range of topics affecting the social, moral, political and economic life of <Col N="1105" /> our people <i>saecula saeculorum</i> is too much to accept without probing deeply into it.  That is why I say: do not restrict the rights of Members of Parliament to investigate every aspect of every regulation and piece of legislation and consider whether it is advisable or not.  The advice and opinion of Deputies should be obtained because they come from the grass roots of the community and speak with authority on industry and agriculture and on all aspects of life in their areas.  The Deputy is the only link between the people and the Parliament.  His voice stops here and it must be relayed by the link between here and Brussels. It is therefore vital that the main link of Members of the Irish Parliament should be kept intact.  That is why any move to restrict the right of Members of Parliament from discussing or questioning any decision or directive or regulation or say it should be done in secret or <i>in camera,</i> should be questioned in public.</P>
    <P>I hope we are not entering into a period in this country which might eventually lead to what we might describe as &ldquo;Iron Curtain law&rdquo; in which the elected representative is squeezed out, the press denied the right of attendance and in which you have a consideration of legislation behind closed doors where the public have no means of being acquainted with the proceedings of a confidential committee.  I warn Parliament that this is the one opportunity they will have and I ask the Minister in the interests of democracy not to tie up Parliament seriously in a matter of this kind.  It is too deep a matter.  We are now only entering EEC: give free expression and deliberation and give freedom to the Parliament elected by the people so that they may be as constructive as possible.  We are joining in accordance with the people's wishes: there is nothing any of us can do to keep us out but what we can do is help the country to go in with credit and distinction so as to influence Europe for the better.  That is what we all want. That will not be done by reducing or minimising the rights of Parliament to legislate so far as possible.</P>
    <P>I hope that the serious considerations&mdash;and <Col N="1106" /> they are very serious&mdash; of preserving the voice and rights of Parliament will be safeguarded as far as is humanly possible.  Parliament must be sovereign.  If it sheds its responsibilities and hands them over to others it also sheds its sovereignty. For that reason there is grave danger that in years to come there will be a lack of interest in committees unless it is kept alive by Members of Parliament. I cannot sufficiently emphasise how vital it is for Members of our Parliament in EEC to regard the voice of Parliament as the voice of the Irish people by which we can advise and assist and express our views.  This will be more effective if it comes from Parliament as a whole rather than from a committee set up under Parliament. I hope the Minister will seriously consider this aspect of the matter. I am sorry that in the case of such a vital Bill as this greater interest is not taken by all Members of the House.  This is one matter which affects the future of every Member of the House.  Now is the time to talk.  If we do not talk now let us remain silent hereafter, perhaps for ever.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a most moving oration from Deputy Flanagan and one can understand his fears but I would ask him to reflect very carefully, and I believe if he does he will find that the only way we can preserve the right to criticise and the right to influence is to have a proper parliamentary committee here to deal with European affairs.</P>
      <P>This Bill is sounding the death knell of the Dáil.  Both amendments seek to muffle that death knell.  Deputy Flanagan is also concerned at hearing that death knell being sounded.  I would urge upon the House and the Government not to go any further in relation to Community legislation than is absolutely necessary and to leave to this House and the organs of this House every effective power which they have the right to exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as drafted takes far more away from this House than is necessary under the European Treaties and, as Deputy Bruton said in moving his amendment, by weakening the powers of this House and the other House, by <Col N="1107" /> weakening the right of public representatives in Ireland to make their contribution to and to offer their criticism of Community activities, the Commissioner from Ireland on the Commission and any Minister from Ireland sitting on the Council of Ministers will be thereby weakened in any contribution he can make or any influence he might seek to exert in the European Communities.</P>
    <P>We are a very small country.  We will have only ten members of the European Parliament.  We will have only one member sitting in the ministerial institutions.  There may be some more favourable vote for the smaller countries than for the larger ones. Nevertheless, we are only one small voice in this very large world.  We need every voice that can speak up, every influence which we can bring to bear and that influence can best be exerted by having some control and some opportunity for this Parliament to express itself.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, even when we cannot control or cannot change a decision we, nevertheless, have a clear obligation to the people who sent us here to understand what the Community is doing, to understand its regulations, its proposals and to be in the position, even if we cannot effect a change in them, to explain them to our own people.  We are not yet in that position and are not likely to get into that position if we do not have some form of committee in this assembly.</P>
    <P>The report of the working party examining the problem of the enlargement of the powers of the European Parliament known as the Vedel Report, deals with the links between the national parliaments and the European Parliament and it is proper for us to recall that the parliaments of each of the other member states of the EEC operate effective, worthwhile committee systems.  We are unique in not having committees to deal with several different aspects of State activity.  If this Parliament, for instance, had an industrial committee dealing with industrial problems we would not have experienced the frustration <Col N="1108" /> of Deputy Enright today when he was endeavouring to raise a matter crucial to over 150 families in his own constituency, dealing with the closing down of a factory in his constituency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan said that everybody in this Parliament must have an equal right to raise their problems. On many problems, as Deputy Flanagan knows, at the moment we have an equal non-right.  There are hundreds of unanswered questions on the Order Paper.  There are 101 other problems that individually we all want to raise but our present procedures do not enable us to raise them.  If we had a committee system at least some of our problems could be processed in the committee, even when they could not be taken here on the floor.  It is a very rare occasion when we have all Members of the House present or even more than 50 per cent or even more than 20 of them present.  While I sympathise with the notion that Deputy Flanagan has that it would be wrong to have a committee from which people would be barred, from which persons would be excluded or prevented from having their say, we must face the realities of this Parliament, as others have.  We are not working effectively because our present rules and procedures prevent us from raising the issues crucial to our constituents and to the electorate and this is breeding a contempt for the whole parliamentary and democratic process which will have very serious repercussions unless we as a Parliament tackle this problem.  We are now presented with a challenge and an opportunity in European affairs to establish the first worth while working committee.</P>
    <P>The Vedel Report states that it is legitimate and democratic that national parliaments should try to bring their influence to bear within the Community.  They recommend that the committees in the individual member states should become involved directly with the European Parliament so that the members of those committees and the parliaments in turn would be better acquainted with the problems of the Community at national level and they could also convey <Col N="1109" /> more effectively the views of their own national citizens at the European level.  This, therefore, emphasises the need for the kind of committee which is referred to in the excellent amendment by Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister was rather carping in his criticism of many matters. Like so many people when they are in that mood, he can be incorrect. He suggested there was a conflict between the motion which had been tabled by Deputy Cosgrave and myself and the amendment proposed by Deputy Bruton.  I suspect that the Minister had been guilty of the same offence with which he had charged others, to wit, that he had not read the resolution and the amendment because, far from there being any conflict between them, they are compatible with one another and, in fact, one supplements and is essential to the other.</P>
    <P>The motion suggests that a select committee, consisting of 14 Members of this House, be joined with a select committee, consisting of six Members of the Seanad, be appointed to constitute a standing joint committee on European affairs, to examine the draft regulations, directives and decisions and other proposals and acts of the institutions of the European Communities and to report thereon to the House.  In the motion it was also suggested&mdash;and this, I think, would meet one of the points raised by Deputy Flanagan &mdash; that the committee which would be 20 in number, would have the right to co-opt five other Members from time to time who are concerned with particular problems, so that they could be brought in.  We might, in fact, operate a system on the committee such as operates in European parliaments and in the Council of Europe which would enable any Member of the House to go to the committee, not merely be there to hear but also to contribute to the debate. Such Members might not have a vote on the committee as such unless they were to be co-opted but I would say that most Deputies would be much comforted by the opportunity to address the committee on a matter <Col N="1110" /> which related to their own constituencies.</P>
    <P>The amendment of Deputy Bruton very clearly leaves open the form which any committee would take.  It refers to &ldquo;any committee of the Dáil&rdquo;, leaving it for the Dáil to determine what the powers of the committee should be.  It could even be a committee of the whole House.  What Deputy Bruton identifies in his amendment are some very crucial matters. First of all, he is suggesting machinery whereby within 21 sitting days of an order being made the order could be annulled or amended in this House. That is a considerable improvement on what is offered in the Bill whereby up to two years could elapse between the making of a regulation and its ultimate annulment and no provision is made for its amendment.  We consider that there are certainly a number of grey areas in many regulations to which it would be fitting for this House to make an amendment.  When amendments can be made within the law and within the obligations of the European Community, it is proper that this House should have an opportunity much sooner than two years after the regulation is made, to make them. Admittedly the period might be shorter.  A regulation can be considered at any time within a year following that in which it is made.  That means that at least one year elapses, but, as Deputy Tully pointed out, this could grow into two years and that is not a very safe position to have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also suggested that this committee should not merely be dealing with accomplished facts but should also be looking to the future and offering opinions and assistance on proposals coming from the Commission and the Council of Ministers. His third suggestion was that a decision as to the method to be adopted to implement directives, whether it be by way of regulation or legislation, should be taken by some authority larger than an individual Minister of State.  He therefore suggested that a committee of the whole House which under our Standing Orders, would, have to be impartial and have to represent all parties, would be a better <Col N="1111" /> group to make the decision than an individual Minister.</P>
    <P>It is no personal criticism of any Minister to say that all Ministers tend to opt for regulations rather than legislation. It is less troublesome.  It does not involve a debate, although it certainly does not seem to avoid delay. There are many regulations covering a wide number of fields which could be made today to the benefit of the nation, and which are not being made. Sometimes civil servants can take longer to make up their minds than legislators.  There is a tendency to opt for regulations.  We will not merely be doing serious damage to our parliamentary system but doing damage to the whole outlook of our people towards the new world which is opening to them in Europe if we do not involve them.  Involvement means the fullest possible scope for public representatives to offer their opinions on future proposals as well as established facts.</P>
    <P>The amendments we are now discussing&mdash;we are discussing two together&mdash; have one thing in common, that is, a desire to preserve the greatest possible power for the people's representatives here to criticise the activities of the Community and to offer the views of the people of Ireland so that the Community will have the benefit of those views before making their decisions. We are also asking that this power should be kept in our Parliament so that the ten Members of Parliament who go to Brussels will be better informed. I do not think it would be wise to send ten Members of our Parliament to the European Parliament who, when they arrived back here, would find that the Dáil and Seanad never discussed European affairs or never offered criticism of European affairs.  It is also undesirable that there should be no Parliamentary thought on European matters while the ten Members of the European Parliament were away at meetings of the European Assembly or of the various committees.</P>
    <P>Unless we have a permanent committee sitting&mdash;I would say certainly twice a month or possibly weekly&mdash;we will have a very serious void and, if we have that void, the people of Ireland <Col N="1112" /> will find themselves left outside when decisions are being made in Europe. Where I think the Labour Party amendment errs is that perhaps it is asking too much to ask that all regulations should be considered in this House before they are made.  Should that proposal be adopted the danger is that voluminous regulations or draft regulations will be tabled and, after a while, Members will lose the capacity even to read through the list and they will not be able to identify those regulations which involve some new departure in policy from regulations simply dealing with routine matters.</P>
    <P>I would suggest, therefore, that a committee with a very useful and working secretariat would be able to sift through all the drafts, all the proposals and all the regulations, pending or made, and having identified the ones that mattered and discussed them with the Members of the House, we could then have a very useful debate here once a month or thereabouts on exactly what was happening in Europe.  If we could agree on the principle of maintaining the largest possible amount of parliamentary control I believe we would be doing a very useful service for our people.  The Fine Gael Party will be supporting the Labour Party amendment because it endeavours to keep some control within this Parliament. We think that perhaps it goes too far, but the principle is so crucial, and there are so many different ways of preserving Parliamentary control, that anything that seeks to protect our people against the dead hand of the Fianna Fáil Government, who are trying to put their hand across the mouth of the public representatives of this country, is a good thing.  We will vote for anything which keeps the Fianna Fáil hand off the Irish mouth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support these amendments on the principle on which the Deputies have based their arguments, that is, the attempt to keep some authority for this House in the situation of having minority representation in the European Parliament and the European Community.  It is very hard to understand how the Government cannot see the wisdom of the arguments put forward, and how the <Col N="1113" /> Minister cannot see the <i>rationale</i> for accepting that there should not be any avoidable diminution in the powers of the Deputies of this House.</P>
      <P>I must confess that I have very little use for the parliamentary process as it has been operated in most of the Western democracies over the past half century, but there are some uses for the system.  Probably the most important factor was the right of individual minority opinion to be given expression even in spite of the fact that it happened to be a minority opinion.  As somebody who has held a minority opinion here for many years on a number of occasions I have been pleased with the practice of the Government having to put orders on the table of the House, and Deputies having the right to question orders in a specific period.  This has been most useful.  At least it ensured the right to a discussion and the right to a debate even though it might be a very limited protest or a very limited debate.  We could voice a minority opinion and there was always the possibility that it might appeal to those who had the power to change the legislation or the proposal, or that eventually it might win more support if not here in the House, in the country, presuming it got to the general public and the electorate generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt there will be a very considerable diminution in our power now that we propose to join the European Community.  All three Parties will now feel for the first time what it is like to be in a minority in a Parliament which will probably do what it wants to do anyway, no matter what the minority may think or say. The majority hold their opinions, as the majority in this House have always held their opinions, because they believe them to be the correct opinions, the right attitudes, the right actions at that particular time and no matter how persuasive or compelling the arguments of the minority may be, if they have arrived at these conclusions, our minority within the European Parliament is going to be about as ineffectual in changing the mass attitudes of the majority parties within the Parliament as have been minority voices, such as my own and others in this House, over the years in changing the major parties <Col N="1114" /> in their attitudes and decisions.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I can see no case whatever for yielding up any part of the right to public debate and discussion upon any issue whatever which affects our people as a whole. While we may have little effect on the end result of the discussion, there is always this other factor involved in a debate in this House, that we are not really talking to one another, few as we usually are in this House, but we are talking in the context of a situation in which all the national newspapers, many of the provincial newspapers, television and radio&mdash;this is our nexus with the people&mdash;have access to whatever is said here. Although quite obviously one can never predict what is likely to get to the public through this very powerful communications medium, there is always a possibility that something worthwhile may get through to the electorate, to the people as a whole, and in that way there will be the continuous possibility that we may win support from the community for any protests which we may wish to make on their behalf to the European Parliament and that the power of that protest of our people can be of some support to those Deputies who represent us in the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>That is a particularly important consideration and again I support Deputy Flanagan's plea for this House as being the most important debating forum rather than committees.  I have no great objection to committees but the right of the individual Deputy is a very important right.  As he said, it does not matter of what intellectual calibre they may be or what professional or technical ability they may have, they have the rather wonderful privilege of having been elected by their peers in our society to come here and talk and do their best on their behalf.  That right, that authority, that power is being mitigated to some extent by the attitude of the Government in this Bill.  No serious case has been made and no justification has been offered as to why we should concede one iota of the authority or power of this House, tiny and all as it may be, small as it certainly is and limited as it certainly is going to be <Col N="1115" /> in the years ahead.  This is an occasion on which any authority we derive from the public collectively should, if it is possible to do so, be enlarged, enhanced, extended, increased rather than in any way reduced or minimised.</P>
    <P>The voice of our people as expressed by us is the one last criticism that is left to us in the situation of a great Parliament of people within which there will be others fighting for their own special national rights, and the Minister must know well, and know very much better than any of us do, from his own negotiations and his own dealings in the run-up to the Economic Community, the formation of the Economic Community and our admission to it, quite how unimportant is the voice of a tiny offshore island like ours in the deliberations of the great western European communities and in their consideration of what is best for western Europe. He more than any others must know how little it will matter to them whether a factory closes down in Deputy Flanagan's constituency, in the Minister's constituency or in any of the other areas all over the country where these tragic happenings are taking place.</P>
    <P>How could that matter in the context of a debate on shifts of power in the Ruhr or in the great industrial areas of Italy, France or anywhere else?  We are the only people who can be said to have a serious concern, and it is our responsibility to have a serious concern, for our own people in every corner of the country.  We should guard very jealously indeed the tiny shred of authority which I think is now left to us and if it is possible for these amendments to be accepted by the Minister, I think he should do what he can to get the Government to accept them.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that, as I said earlier, I do not have much faith in the effective authority of Parliament.  As I have seen it here over the years, it does not matter very much what the Opposition think, and within the Opposition it does not matter very much what the minority within that <Col N="1116" /> Opposition think.  Effective power it seems to me, has always not even stemmed from the majority party here, not even from the total Cabinet, but from an oligarchy within the Cabinet and, for many years, from an individual, or at most two or three individuals, within that Cabinet.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the elaborate facade of the 130 of us here who debate legislation represents the power within this House.  True power, in fact, lies and has lain with a handful of men during the years, and that is simply a microcosm of what is likely to happen within the European Parliament. All that we can retain is our right to do what we can to the best of our ability, a right to protest, a right to criticise, a right to retain where possible and a right to reject on the part of our people something which could be in the interest of the European Communities but at the same time could in some way be damaging, or indeed disastrous, to our people simply because considerations in a particular issue do not carry the weight of those considerations as expressed by this House acting as representatives of the total community in this country.  I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with some of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Browne.  The democratic system has already in it a large measure of what one might call indirection, in that the people elect the Parliament and the Parliament elect the Government and within that Parliament there is the party system which involves a dilution of popular control beyond what is in theory, and I believe in practice, desirable.  In the Irish context, the system has worked less well than elsewhere because somehow or other conventions have grown up here under which the Government seem more immune to the pressure of public opinion, expressed through Parliament, than anywhere else, certainly than in the system of our nearest neighbour, of whom in the matter of Parliamentary procedure we are naturally very conscious because our institutions derive from theirs much of their shape and <Col N="1117" /> form and, indeed, many of the traditions, though we would like sometimes to pretend they do not.</P>
      <P>In the British Parliament there is a degree of responsiveness of the Government to Parliament.  There is a sufficient effervescence within the parties accepted as a normal, natural and proper element of the parliamentary party system which we have not here because convention has tended to rule it out.  So the Executive here have tended to be freer of control and more arbitrary in their acts.  That makes us sensitive to anything which will increase the power of the Executive.</P>
      <P>Given the weakness of the European Parliament at this time, the lack of any apparent progress towards improving that position and the lack of any great conviction in the summit communiqué or in the attitude of the Irish Government at the Summit as recounted to this House by the Taoiseach, Members of this Parliament can be forgiven for expressing a certain concern at the idea that the Government, in matters of great importance, can, without any adequate provision or prior consultation with the representatives of this country in this Parliament, or in the European Parliament, direct that a member of the Executive of this country, acting presumably after agreement among the Members of the Executive or Government as a whole, and in concert with the members of the Executives of other countries, take decisions which when they come to be implemented will not be amenable to any consideration in this House or by a committee of this House, if the Executive here decide to table them at particular periods of the year when, under the inadequate provisions of section 4, they will not come before the House.</P>
      <P>Even in cases where the Constitution of the EEC permits and is designed to permit a measure of tolerance to the member country, in the application of a particular decision, where it takes the form of a directive indicating the lines to be taken by legislation in that country but not laying it down in detail, this is clearly inadequate and I think we have to do better than this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment in Deputy Bruton's <Col N="1118" /> name is very well designed to do this. It is a particularly well thought-out amendment because it manages to fit within its compass a number of different useful concepts which should commend themselves to the House. I am not, as Deputy Ryan has said, enamoured of the Labour Party's amendment because it seems to me they are proposing something that would not readily be workable.  If everything to be done had to be adopted by this House, and bearing in mind the vast quantity of purely technical legislation involved, the House would be clogged up with matters with which it would not wish to be concerning itself.  What is important is the right of this House to bring before it any matter which it is concerned about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I do.  I am very unhappy with the inadequacies of the present system, with the inadequate research facilities available to Opposition parties and even to Government Deputies.  It means that things come forward in the form of orders and regulations at present which are not sufficiently closely inspected and are passed without scrutiny even when there are points in them which should be raised.  I agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them do not have to be raised because they are trivial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter how trivial they are the House has a right to look at them should somebody here decide they are not trivial.  It seems to me that the best way to tackle that is to ensure that a committee of this House are given the opportunity to examine such legislation and to sift through those things which seems to be matters of policy and those which seem to be technical, so as to help and guide this House and to ensure that at least those matters which a well-equipped body of Members of the House, with a good secretariat, <Col N="1119" /> decide are matters of importance will come before the House.  In the process of that scrutiny, should there be a division of opinion, should there be individual members of that committee who believe that some matters which other members consider to be trivial are not trivial, these members should be able to bring them before this House; should there be some Members of this House who in reading the reports of the committee or who have attended the committee as part of the audience believe there are matters which are not trivial, then such Members must be entitled to bring them before the House.  This is the kind of procedure we need.</P>
      <P>There are, obviously, different ways of doing this and it seems to me that the method proposed by Deputy Bruton is ingenious and that it would be effective.  It covers the needs of the situation.  On the other hand&mdash; perhaps I do not understand it correctly&mdash;the Labour Party amendment requires that prior approval of the House be given as an essential element before a regulation can be made&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  That is my understanding of it.  It requires that before a Minister here can make a regulation giving effect to any directive, the House must approve of it positively, regardless of how trivial it my be or how little is the element of policy in it.  That seems to me to go beyond what is necessary.  We want a safeguard clause that sieves what comes back in the form of directives and we want to ensure that the House will be alerted and given a chance to debate anything that is of importance. I can see there is a divergence of views on this.  Deputy Bruton's amendment, which is necessarily rather long and rather more complex, meets the needs of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier in the debate I said our aim must be to make the European Parliament effective.  I think the Minister muttered something at the time that this was a bit optimistic and that it was somewhat in the future.  Perhaps <Col N="1120" /> it was Deputy de Valera or someone sitting behind the Minister who made that suggestion.  All I was saying was that we should not become so devoted to setting up procedures here to ensure adequate consideration of these matters, we should not become so absorbed in this, that we might take our eyes away from the main principle of having an adequate legislative system in Europe so that legislation is not by members of the Executive of member Governments but by the people who have been elected for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I realise it will be some years before that comes into existence but in the meantime we must try to ensure that, pending the implementation of such a system, we do our best to fill the gap.  I realise that even when a European Parliament is operating effectively it will continue to be of vital importance that this Parliament should have a right to express its views on the way Community directives are to be implemented.  It would not be a bad thing if, to supplement the work of the European Parliament, this Parliament had the opportunity in matters of importance of considering draft proposals before they go to the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>At this stage, given the inadequacies of the European Parliament, of its powers and its methods of election, it is important for us to ensure that matters relating to indirect legislation by way of regulation should be brought before the House and that this House should play an active role in considering whether they are necessary. On those grounds I commend Deputy Bruton's amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

Last night the House accepted the decision to join the European Communities, to change the Constitution; and the Act of Accession <Col N="1121" /> gives within a certain area of activity powers to the institutions of Europe which we can no longer decide on here. Regulations will be made which will be directly applicable in the member states.  At the moment the development of the European institutions is such that the Council of Ministers is the deciding body.  In theory there is a weighted voting position there, but in actual practice they do not take decisions that are against the vital interests of any member states&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>For a small nation that is a more powerful position than would obtain in the weighted voting position or in a position where the Parliament was fully developed, as Deputy FitzGerald wants.  The present decision-making situation is not to our disadvantage. The Minister taking part in the decision-making process will be responsible to this Parliament.  The implementation of directives and decisions of the institutions which are not directly applicable here will be implemented by whatever method is chosen and we are seeking powers to have this done by delegated legislation.  Let me remark in passing that it would be inappropriate to the concept of delegated legislation to have it amended rather than rejected by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To put the matter in perspective let me give the following example. The annual number of regulations made here by a Minister to implement Community directives would be about 20.  Last year we had 350 statutory instruments and there was not too much worry about them in the House.  If Deputies want to measure it in this way, they could say we are going from 350 instruments to 370.  What bothers Deputy Bruton and other Deputies who want a committee is in regard to the power given to a Minister.  They <Col N="1122" /> would like to have a committee that would come in on this power of the Minister, but Deputy Flanagan is equally worried about the power that would be given to members of such a committee.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are talking about the power taken by the institutions of Europe.  I think we should have a committee of the House.  After listening to Deputy Haughey and Deputy Flanagan I take the point that this committee should not limit the powers of Deputies who are not on the committee. The idea I had was that a committee should make it possible for this Parliament to make the full use of its powers.  I do not think we would set up the committee under this legislation.  I think we should do it by way of a motion and by whatever procedures this House may set up.  The committee should have an expert and adequate secretariat so that they can advise the House on the volume of legislation coming from the European institutions and point out which item is a policy matter that can affect vital interests.  This will require a fairly high level, active and full-time secretariat.  The whole concept will have to be to help Deputies in the House to know what is going on and where they can have an influence.  They should not be excluded from consideration of legislation of the European institutions.</P>
    <P>There were 350 statutory instruments last year and it is suggested that they be laid before the House for examination and objection if people wish to object.  The method we propose is stronger.  Under the system of laying them before the House they can pass unnoticed, as I am sure happened in the case of many of the 350 last year.  Under the proposal in section 4 the Minister would have to come in with legislation, and the House would go through the whole process of legislation on the statutory instruments put out by Ministers during the year.  I accept the point made by Deputy Tully that the end of the following year is too far away if the regulation is made in January. My answer is that the ordinary processes are available.  Deputies can put <Col N="1123" /> down a question on the Adjournment, they can raise the matter at Question time, there is private legislation or Private Members' motions.  The making of a regulation will be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i>.  If we accept Deputy Tully's way of leaving it for 21 days then, having passed that process, we could not choose any other process. I think our method is the stronger method.  I take the point that given motions on the Adjournment, Question Time, Private Members' motions and private legislation there is something to be said for trying to have the legislation dealing with the ministerial regulations brought nearer to the event of the regulations.  Deputies will appreciate from what has been going on in the House over the last few days how slow it would be if the Minister had to make all the regulations at the end of the year.  There might be 70 regulations to be made between now and the end of the year. We would not limit it to having the legislation at the end of that year.  It might suit if we had the legislation confirming regulations coming into the House within a year or six months of the making of the regulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am putting a suggestion to meet the objection that Deputy Tully has that there could be a delay of two years if regulations were made, say, in January of this year but the legislation might not be dealt with until December of next year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I put that as a suggestion, because I believe that having to have the process of legislation brought in by the Minister in a positive way and having the House debate it is a stronger safeguard.  After a time the enthusiasm will be gone and matters will be left to a small number of people, but if the Minister comes in with legislation everybody will be aware of it and can come in and debate it.  If it is a matter of laying it <Col N="1124" /> before the House and waiting to catch something and put down a motion about it, this would be slower.</P>

      <P>The other procedure is stronger.  I am concerned about the effectiveness of the procedure.  The whole discussion has been on the basis that whatever will be done in Europe will be to our disadvantage. At least the vast majority of the regulations which will have to be made by Ministers will be to enable advantages and benefits to accrue to our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a strong argument for being in a position to fit in quickly with directives made by ministerial regulations.  The arguments are all in favour of being able to implement quickly the European legislation which will have passed through with this provision of seeking concensus or unanimity in the Council of Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To go back now to the amendments, the method under section 4 is better. There is more debate and a fuller examination.  Motions in the House are available.  Private legislation can be brought to the House.  We have Question Time and matters can be raised on the Adjournment and Private Members' Motions can be put down at the time of the making of the regulations.  If regulations are made when the Dáil is not in session there are provisions for bringing the Dáil back if the regulations upset a sufficient number of people.  The actual watchdog effect of legislation being promoted by the Minister is much stronger.  Where there is an area for improvement we must consider the time lag.  So far as a committee is concerned, I accept that there should be a committee but I do not think that Deputy O.J. Flanagan's arguments are invalid.  The committee should not include Members of this House.  They should be there to help the Members.  I suggest the Deputy <Col N="1125" /> should withdraw this amendment. Under the procedures of the House we can set about creating an effective committee to meet the tasks which we know must be undertaken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of a committee but we must be reasonable about this.  Possibly the method of selection of committee members may be open to question.  If we look around the House and see how many Deputies are interested in the Bill itself, we have the answer to the number of people who might be interested in committees. Most of us are stuck with committees. Deputy O.J. Flanagan's point about people being selected because they are well in with the party leader is not valid.  The only reason we are on committees is that we may know something about the subject concerned, and we may be the only people available who want to do a bit of work around the House.</P>
      <P>It is quite easy for people to stay away from this House for a long time and then complain that they are not getting the facilities to which they are entitled.  In fairness to those working hard on committees we should make it clear that there is no question of being lapdogs at all.  People who go on committees are those who want to go on committees and who are available to go on them.  Many of us have been put on committees which we would much prefer not to have to go on.  There are no kudos for sitting in a room debating matters affecting the other Members of the House while some of those Members are away at race meetings or doing their own work at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be said that we might have a special day on which the whole House will turn into a committee.  Is it suggested that the whole House should do as we are doing here now?  That would mean that Deputies would be allowed to talk as long as they wished. If that were so, a day would not be much use; we would need a whole year to allow some of the Deputies to continue talking as much as they liked. Without being offensive about it, I feel that the committee system is a good system but we must remember that the committee are people who are prepared <Col N="1126" /> to do their work and even if we left it open to everybody in this House there might be extreme difficulty unless particular persons were named on the committee.  There might be extreme difficulty in getting enough people into the House to discuss some committee matter without making special efforts to do so.</P>
    <P>I can see the points raised by Deputy Haughey and Deputy O. J. Flanagan about the necessity of giving everybody an opportunity of being involved.  As Members of this House, we are all entitled to be involved.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party are also entitled to claim that they have the right to be Parliamentary Secretaries and Ministers.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party are not allowed into discussions with the Ministers.  Deputy O. J. Flanagan must be aware of this.  He was a member of a previous government. As Parliamentary Secretary, he must have known that there were places where his colleagues would not be allowed to discuss matters with him because they were not on the same standing as he was.  We can only do the best we can.  We should try to have a committee system.  But it may be felt that following discussion of the committee&mdash;and this is where our particular amendment comes in&mdash;we should come back and debate it with an informed opinion being put across, not by the Minister but by the various members of the committee who have discussed the matter.  If the idea is that the matter can be tossed around, that might be the solution.</P>
    <P>Without throwing out our suggestion, the Minister is, in fact, throwing cold water on it by suggesting that this idea of having a matter discussed would take up a lot of time.  We do not want that.  At present we lay matters before the House.  That is the procedure.  Many of the matters that go before the House could be raised here by way of motion, but few of them are.  I brought the first motion to refer back a ministerial order which was ever taken in this House about 1956 or a little later when Deputy Childers was Minister for Transport and Power.  It referred to a Bord na Móna pensions scheme.  We had a <Col N="1127" /> good debate and eventually the Minister got his way because he had the Government behind him.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that we could raise these matters at Question Time. The Minister knows what happens. The Minister mentioned raising matters on the Adjournment.  We all know what happened to the Deputy who tried to raise an important matter on the Adjournment yesterday and today. I do not blame the Chair for this.  A private Bill was mentioned. We have been talking today about two private Bills in which the Fine Gael Party are interested.  There is no hope of having them taken.  When can we have a discussion on a motion? Some of the motions are on the Order Paper for three years.  None of the solutions offered by the Minister are solutions to the problem before us this evening.  I wish they were.  The Minister also says that the discussion of motions would take much time. Not necessarily all the regulations which will come here as ministerial orders from the EEC are going to be detrimental to the country.  I believe, however, we should reserve the right, in the event of one or more of them being against the interests of the country because of the way in which it is suggested it should be operated, to say: &ldquo;No, it should not be done that way.&rdquo;  That is where the Minister and the Opposition differ.  I would say that perhaps out of the 20 maybe four or five would fit into that category.  We should be entitled to debate it not two years, not a year afterwards.  It is idle for the Minister to say this can be debated more fully under the suggestion in the section. You cannot do that, because if the regulation is put into operation and has been in operation for 12 or 18 months the people will have come to accept it whether it is good, bad or indifferent.  You are then late in attempting to change it.</P>
    <P>Without trying to tie any Minister's hands, I think this is the right of this House, in view of the fact that, in my opinion, and in the opinion of my party, we are handing over a tremendous amount of power which we had <Col N="1128" /> to an institution in Europe.  Having done that the very least we are entitled to is the right to interpret certain orders in the best way for this country.</P>
    <P>The amendments may not be perfect; they may not be the answer; but the Minister has not come up with a suggestion which fills the bill either.  If the Minister says he is prepared to look at this to see if it can be improved before Report Stage then I, on behalf of the Labour Party, will withdraw the amendment which is down in our names.  If he is not prepared to do that I will divide the House on this, because if we do not do this we are handing over lock, stock and barrel the authority this House has had up to now to make its own laws.  We are not prepared to make a fight for even the little bit that is being left to us and we will not stand for that.</P>

      <P>When the Minister speaks of a committee to deal with orders, regulations, <i>et cetera</i> does he consider that the House, as it is sitting at present, is a reasonably good committee?  If because of our present parliamentary set-up this House is not considered to be satisfactory in disposing of public and parliamentary business, that is not the fault of the majority of us who are here.  It is the fault of the parliamentary system. There would not have been this extraordinary backlog of work if there had been longer sittings.  Unfortunately there was a holyday last week on which the House did not sit.  When there is pressure of work there is no reason why this House should not sit four days a week.  Farmers have to work seven days a week.  For that reason I do not accept the excuse that there is not sufficient time to dispose of parliamentary business.  This is the price we must pay for being a democracy. We must express our views, we must exchange opinions and we must make parliament effective by using it. We are sent here to express the views of the people.  I want to put it to the Minister, through you, Sir, that if there is an important order or regulation to be made concerning the EEC's sugar beet quota, concerning the import or the export of wheat, concerning the <Col N="1129" /> dumping of foreign wheat into this country or if cloth exports are to be restricted by regulation, I want to be in a position on behalf of the industrial workers in my constituency, on behalf of the sugar beet growers, on behalf of the workers in the beet factory in Carlow and elsewhere, to know about it and I want to put forward their views and the views of those interested in that sector of agriculture. Discussing an order after it has been made will be of no use.  We had the case of the EEC's sugar quota.  The regulation that was made caused serious alarm to beet growing farmers and those engaged in sugar factory employment last year.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is not accepted there will be no question of our using Parliament for the purpose of discussing what we consider to be a restriction on the right of the farmer to grow beet or a restriction on the right of the management of Carlow or any other factory producing sugar for the EEC pool of sugar.  We were faced with a problem of that kind this year. When it comes to reviewing the sugar quotas, which are of concern to all beet growing constituencies, when we have the wheat order and other cereal regulations, there will be no point in discussing them 12 months after the orders and regulations are made.  Secondly, there will be no point in discussing them behind closed doors.  Parliament is the place.  I would like to hear what kind of committees Deputy Bruton has in mind.  Does he mean these committees to be in private or does he want the press, radio and television people brought in if necessary?  Are the committees to be in private?  Are the officers of the House to be present? Is there to be an official record, as <Col N="1130" /> there is in the case of the Committee of Public Accounts?  I am against hole-and-corner committees.  This is the only opportunity I have had of saying that.  This is too important a matter to allow certain privileged Members to be in a position to have information that is not available to other Members of the House.</P>
      <P>I can see Deputy Tully's point of view about committees.  I claim, as one of the longest serving Members in this House today, that I never sought an appointment on any committee. I never asked any Member to support me.  I never sought selection. I am on no committee and I have no desire to be on any committee but the position is that there is a tug-of-war for nearly all of these committees and that is wrong.  It winds up that who ever has the best &ldquo;pull&rdquo; and the best influence is on the committee.  When it comes to discussing important aspects of EEC regulations, which may affect every Deputy in every constituency in some way, this House in committee ought to be the means of dealing with the orders, directives and regulations.</P>
      <P>If there is to be a select committee I presume that the Members will not be handpicked by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I presume they will be appointed by the various parties and that there will be a seat for an Independent Deputy if there is one in the next Dáil, or even 15 Independent Deputies, as happened some years ago.  No Deputy should have to solicit the support of his party colleagues to be appointed to such a committee.  That is a wrong position for any Member of Parliament to be in.  If we are to have the entire EEC business done through committees it will eventually lead to disrespect for Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We already have people all over the country advocating an abstentionist policy.  We want to preserve Parliament as the place in which the people's laws are carried out on their instructions.  It must be Parliament for the people and by the people.  It is difficult enough for us in present circumstances to advocate respect for Parliament throughout the country.  There are people all over Europe, as well as in Ireland, anxious to pull down our parliamentary institutions. <Col N="1131" /> We will help those people if we create an atmosphere of silence and inactivity within Parliament.  If Parliament is the institution in which every Deputy has the privilege of talking, provided he keeps within the bounds of order, you have democracy functioning 100 per cent.  When you cannot have that you muzzle the people's representatives. This affects Deputies and their constituents.</P>
    <P>Our job is to build up confidence in Parliament throughout the country.  We are not doing that if we relinquish our rights as parliamentarians.  We must have the machinery available by which we can look after the interests of our constituents.  I am not happy about the volume of work which will be undertaken by certain privileged Deputies. It is regrettable that we can foresee a time in which Members of Parliament will be expressing thanks for being allowed to talk.  This is not democracy functioning as I see it.  If we want Parliament to be effective, when we are in Europe, the business of Europe must come to Parliament and be discussed in Parliament.  Discussion of all the regulations and directives is vital if we are to maintain confidence in our institutions as at present established.</P>
    <P>The more we weaken our institutions the worse it is for the community; the more we take away from Parliament the less respect people outside have for it and the more we silence those within Parliament the more deadened the feelings of the people outside become. We could not be discussing anything more vital than this.  I hope my voice will be effective in driving home to everybody the importance of keeping Parliament free to be the medium by which we can talk, show our feelings and get work done.</P>
    <P>Perhaps our present parliamentary system needs some improvement.  The answer to that is that we have to work harder and work longer hours if we want to get the business done.  It is no use saying we cannot overtake the European work when we cannot do our own work.  There is no use saying that questions cannot be answered, that the private business and public business of this House cannot be done.  It can <Col N="1132" /> be done if you have the proper system. The way to do that is to allow Parliament to function freely.  Unless you have that we cannot describe ourselves as a democracy.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister if there is to be a committee appointed to have the quorum one more than half the Members of this House so that we can all participate in it.  There are many who believe that a small committee gets work done quickly.  That may be so but I do not think it is democratic. I do not believe it is the right way to do business for the public.  I hope if such a committee is appointed that any Member of this House who wants to walk in to it and ask a question can do so and that he can participate in voting on such a committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>So far the Minister's reply to the debate has been disappointing and there is an ominous implication in his approach to the very full and thoughtful case presented by the Opposition for the preservation of the rights of individual Deputies in this House.  I say it is ominous for this reason: most of us who have spent most of our time in Opposition in this House could be forgiven for having a sense of much frustration because of our own impotence during the years to have implemented proposals or ideas which we considered might be of benefit to the community. We have not been able to influence the Government in any significant way on any of the questions on which most of us have spoken during our time here.  Perhaps we could be forgiven for developing a sense of frustration to the extent that we might say this place is useless, that it is pointless coming into it or contributing to a debate, that it is pointless to express a point of view and that the best thing to do would be to eliminate this Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In saying that we would be echoing a sentiment that is widespread not only in this country but in many Western European countries in relation to what they consider to be the talking shops of Europe, as they are called by the Communists.  As Deputy FitzGerald implied, Parliaments have transpired to be no more than talking <Col N="1133" /> shops and that the great basic idea of popular election&mdash;the idea whereby people with different views are returned to Parliament for the purpose of expressing their views from which can be got a consensus to create the kind of society for the benefit of all the people&mdash;has not worked.</P>
    <P>For those of us who, as I say, have spent most of our lives in opposition, that attitude is understandable, but it is very dangerous that it should come from a Minister who has had absolute power in a number of important ministries in our society, for instance, Education, Industry and Commerce and Foreign Affairs.  It is dangerous that he should have appeared to have developed a sense of disrespect, this sense of the impotence of this House and that he should imply that whatever power it has is unimportant, or at least that it need not be cherished to the extent that those of us in opposition are attempting to preserve it.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Flanagan that the Minister is subscribing to the general sentiment, not only in this country but in other Western European countries also, that our Parliaments are a very costly charade and that the bureaucrat is the important person.  He is subscribing to the Communist idea of the democratic centralist approach whereby there are bureaucrats of one kind or another in the centre who decide for a Parliament that meets once a year, once in two years or once in five years and that there is no need for this hideous process of individuals coming from all parts of the country to express their points of view to the best of their ability.  At any rate the implication is that there is no need for this process, that there is no virtue in having this assembly.  The Minister has already caught this disease of the bureaucrat from his spell in Europe.  He tells us that we can have a talented secretariat who will monitor the proposals going through concerning our country and that they will tell us from time to time that there is something we should keep an eye on, something that is worth debating because it might affect, for instance, our fisheries or the livelihood <Col N="1134" /> of our farmers or that it might affect the trade union movement.  That would all be very helpful and all very pleasant, clean-cut and efficient in the computerised-type of society proposed in the EEC, but it does not happen to be democracy.  It is not either parliamentary or representative democracy because the function of monitoring is the function of the elected representative.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of 350 regulations that have gone through the House without question.  In so far as I am concerned I have taken advantage of my power to question many regulations that have gone through. However, the important thing is not whether the powers were used but that we had them to use if we so wished.</P>
    <P>It is no use having a <i>post mortem</i> debate on a decision taken already on our behalf.  None of us can undo the damage of the decision taken <i>bona fide</i>.  Let the Commissioner have our point of view and, then, armed with whatever support we can get for that point of view, he can make his final decision; but he would do so in the knowledge of having the full authority and the considered opinion of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Flanagan's view regarding committees.  I have no objection to them but in my experience they are comprised of hand-picked people; and, even if they are not hand-picked they are not as effective or as efficient as is debate in this House.  The Minister displayed a certain intolerance or implied criticism of us because of the 350 orders that have gone through without question. Can he tell us what he proposes to do about them?  Is it his opinion that that indicates a significant defect in the process of Parliament?  Does he propose to change this process?  Does he consider it to be inefficient?  Has he recommended that because it is inefficient we are failing in our duty to the community?  Does he propose to do in respect of these many orders, the 350, what he now proposes to do with the 20 to which he refers?  Why should one system be acceptable in respect of certain orders and a different system be indispensable to the Minister in <Col N="1135" /> respect of other orders?  I should like to see a serious case made for what he calls the &ldquo;stronger action&rdquo;.  I do not understand the words &ldquo;stronger action&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As I say, there is an implicit criticism of Deputies in this.  In some way or other, because we did not criticise or debate these 350 motions, therefore, we must now change so that we may do our job correctly and properly. Why not introduce this system in relation to all these other orders? Should we not be made to do our job properly in respect of all these other orders as well?  The Minister knows well that the speed at which changes take place makes it essential that if any Deputy in any of the parties feels that in some way or other the welfare of the people he represents is jeopardised by an order made by the Ministers in Europe, he should have the right to protest, to criticise, to analyse, to make his case, and that then, having done that, he has discharged his job as a Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Minister made, in my view, a contradictory case on this issue.  In the first part of his statement he said the Council of Ministers are not going to make any decision which is contrary to the vital interest of any State. I necessarily cannot believe that, but I know the Minister made it meaning it to be true.  He then went on to say that the vast majority of the decisions made will be to our advantage.  There is a difference between &ldquo;a vast majority&rdquo; and &ldquo;no decision will be against the vital interest of any State&rdquo;. When he talks about the vast majority, he leaves a number of decisions which will not be to our advantage.  He said so himself and these are the decisions we are interested in.  These are the decisions which should be considered and discussed here and criticised, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us we are justified in our insistence on our right to discuss any question we wish to discuss before any final decision is taken, because he has told us, in effect, that decisions will be taken in respect of Ireland which will not be to our advantage.  It is for that reason that <Col N="1136" /> most of the 350 orders or reports to which he referred&mdash;in fact, I think I queried one of them myself in relation to the Department of Health last year &mdash;have followed debates, discussions, motions, or whatever other parliamentary device we have here for debate, which have taken place in this House, and we have done our best to see, to the extent that we can help it, that they will not be damaging to our constituents and to our people generally.</P>
    <P>The situation in relation to the 20 orders which the Minister has in mind is quite different, and, therefore, far from retaining the controls and the safeguards which already exist here in relation to the 350 that he mentioned, if it were possible to do so, we should be asking for even greater, more powerful rights to protect the interests of our people in respect of the 20 to which he refers.  This does not come completely as a surprise to me because I am afraid I have conceived the same disrespect for the parliamentary process; I have no belief now left in me at all that through the parliamentary process we are going to change fundamentally the structure of society.  Whatever I might have believed earlier on, I do not believe that at all now.  The only thing that surprises me is that I am now joined by such a distinguished, long-serving and experienced Member of Parliament who has had so much power in so many of the great ministries and who now appears to believe that this Parliament here can afford to have the few powers that it has reduced, minimised, and, in some cases, eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to comment on the debate, as Deputy Tully and I opened it in proposing amendments. First of all, perhaps, in contrast to some of the other speakers of my party, I should like to express in a personal capacity the view that there is no incompatibility whatever between our amendment and that of the Labour Party.  In fact, I would support wholeheartedly the amendment put forward by the Labour Party.  The difficulty which was adverted to by some speakers in regard to the Labour Party amendment may have arisen from a misconstruction <Col N="1137" /> of what it was intended to achieve.  As was pointed out, the number of regulations, that is, Irish regulations as distinct from EEC regulations, which will come before the House will be about 20 or 30.  These will be regulations implementing directives already agreed by the Council of Ministers of the EEC.  As the number is small, it will not be all that difficult to have a debate on them prior to their becoming effective in this country.  I certainly think the Labour Party amendment is quite practical and I would support it wholeheartedly.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to do something different but not incompatible. I should like to point out&mdash;and this is something which may have been misunderstood from what Deputy Flanagan said&mdash;that the amendment I am proposing involves no diminution whatever in the existing rights of members.  I do not know whether Deputy Flanagan misunderstood the amendment or not but he seems to be conveying the impression that setting up a committee somehow diminishes existing rights.  What it is proposed this committee should do is to supplement the existing procedures.  It is an additional line of defence.  It is not in any sense reducing the effectiveness of the existing lines of defence.  It is merely adding to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussing this matter, it is, I think, very important to make a very fundamental distinction between discussion on issues of EEC policy prior to a decision being taken thereon by the Council of Ministers of the EEC still to be implemented and discussion after a Council of Ministers' decision has been taken because, in the latter case, all we can do is influence the way in which the Irish Government can choose to implement such a decision. This choice will very often be limited. It is much more important then to exercise our influence prior to a decision being taken by the Council of Ministers.  My amendment proposes&mdash;it is dealing with a somewhat different aspect from the Labour Party amendment; it is dealing with draft EEC regulations and directives prior to a decision being taken thereon&mdash;that a committee be set up to go into each draft directive <Col N="1138" /> as it is published and advise the Minister prior to his going to a Council of Ministers meeting of the EEC to discuss it.  Quite possibly you could not have all these draft regulations discussed on the floor of the House but you could have the regulations made by the Minister after an EEC decision was discussed.  I say you could not have a discussion on draft EEC regulations because the numbers of these regulations are huge and many of them are not draft directives at all. Once they are agreed by the council they will become directly applicable. They cover a very wide field and debate on draft EEC regulations would be much wider than it would be in relation to implementing regulations by the Irish Minister on decisions already made at EEC level.</P>
    <P>I am proposing that a committee be set up to go into these.  It would be quite legitimate for a Member who was particularly interested in some particular matter to seek the right of audience at this committee, but it would not be possible to discuss all the draft proposals because they change and a decision might be taken before they came before the Council of Ministers at all.  I do not see any objection to the committee meeting in public or, indeed, any objection to any Member who is not a member of the committee coming before it.  That committee should present a report on its activities every month and it should be open to any Member to come in and discuss any regulation about which he felt concern. It should also be open to Members to use existing procedures.  This means they could put down Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <P>On today's Order Paper I have 30 or 40 questions relating to draft EEC directives and, if the Minister does not give me a satisfactory answer on any one of these, I will be free to raise the matter on the Adjournment.  Naturally, at Question Time it would not be possible to go into the necessary detail.  I would not, for example, be able personally to engage in consultation with private interests, with the NFA, with vocational bodies, <i>et cetera,</i> but the proposed committee would be able to engage.  Clearly, we need somebody to supplement the sort of probing questions <Col N="1139" /> put down here.  If I hear of a regulation and I know the subject matter and I put down a question asking what it is all about the Minister could quite easily pull a fast one because I might not be able to direct him to a particular interpretation of the regulation.  If we had a committee, however, that committee would be able to go into the matter in much greater detail.  That is why I think it is so necessary to have a committee.  May I emphasise for the benefit of Deputy Flanagan, that this committee does not in any sense involve any diminution of the existing procedure available to us.</P>
    <P>I come now to the second part of the process where you have a Minister implementing a decision already taken. Here we have a choice.  It can be done in two ways.  I should qualify this by saying that it would only arise in the case of EEC directives because regulations become directly applicable.  In the case of a directive, however, it has to be implemented by regulation or legislation.  Confusion can arise unfortunately by the use of the term &ldquo;regulation&rdquo; in different contexts.  I am dealing now with the implementing of an EEC directive after it has been decided. The Labour Party propose that this should only be done with the prior agreement of the House.  As there will only be about 20 or 30 each year, I see no objection whatever to that proposal.</P>
    <P>The role I envisage for the committee is that it would act as a body which would decide whether or not a particular directive should be implemented (a) by regulation or (b) by legislation.  If the matter is not of very great importance, if it is something of a technical character, it might be acceptable to have it implemented by regulation.  If it is a matter of far-reaching importance, a matter in which there is a fairly wide area of discussion open to the Government, then it should be open to the House to influence the Government in regard to the way in which they decide to implement the directive.  The choice as to whether it should be done by regulation or legislation should not be left to the Minister himself because, <Col N="1140" /> if it is left to the Minister, as it would under the Bill if it is not amended, the Minister will naturally choose the line of least resistance, of minimum inconvenience to himself, which would be to implement the directive by regulation.  This power should be taken from the Minister and given to a committee.  It is the committee which should decide whether or not the directive should be implemented by way of regulation or legislation. Regulation would mean no debate at all but legislation would involve full debate by Dáil and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>In so far as it is decided to implement proposals by regulation we should have the present position with regard to regulations.  If, at the moment, a Member objects to a regulation he can have the matter raised within 21 sitting days.  The present Bill proposes that that fundamental traditional right should be taken away and the only method available should be by way of Parliamentary Question, Adjournment debate and so on.  These would obviously be less effective.</P>
    <P>I also propose an addition.  At the moment, if one wants a regulation discussed, one can discuss it only on a motion to annual the regulation.  It should be open to Deputies to amend a regulation and to have a discussion on a motion so to amend.  We might have debates here on regulations which would be quite all right in general but might be wrong in some particular respect and the right thing to do would be to amend them.  We should do that and so there is need here for a safeguard.  Any amendment proposed should be consistent with the original directive which the regulation is seeking to implement and it should be the function of the suggested committee to decide whether or not the proposed amendment is consistent with the basic EEC directive. Again, I do not believe such a decision should be one for the Minister because he will naturally seek the minimum of inconvenience by getting the thing through as quickly as possible.  That is why I think a Dáil committee is the proper body to decide whether or not <Col N="1141" /> a proposed amendment to a regulation is consistent, or otherwise, with the original directive.  The Minister said that it is inappropriate to the principle of delegated legislation to have it amended.  I do not know how he arrived at that conclusion.  That is what he said.  I think the purpose of any Dáil debate on delegated legislation is that the Minister should be persuaded to amend it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The concept is more or less the same thing as the principle and if he says it is inappropriate to the concept of delegated legislation to have it amended.  I do not agree with him in that interpretation.  The whole purpose of debating delegated or any other legislation is to have it amended. The Minister in seeking to arrogate to himself power to make delegated legislation without Members of this House having power to amend it is suggesting that he is the receptacle of all wisdom and that the House could not contribute anything by way of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to conclude by making the general point that it is essential not only in the interests of parliamentary democracy but in the interests of good bargaining that we should get this House as widely aware as possible of the contents of proposed EEC legislation so that there can be as much clamour as possible in this country and that the Minister, therefore, in going to the Council of Ministers will be in the strongest possible bargaining <Col N="1142" /> position to negotiate for this country to maintain any concessions we have got or preserve us from any intrusions which we oppose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically what we want to get here is some status for the House in the immediate future in the conditions of our membership of EEC. All Members of the House must be a little uneasy about the future of democratic participation of this Assembly in decisions in terms of EEC membership. We shall have Members in the European Parliament but the future of that Parliament is still to be decided as the Community develops and it is not certain that it can develop into a true Parliament with the usual constitutional relationship between it and the Executive which the home Parliament of the traditions to which we belong have developed over the years. Some people may have despaired of the parliamentary process but I would say despaired of it as contributing to social change or as being a satisfactory means whereby ordinary citizens can influence the state in which they live. All I would say in defence of it is that I know of no better substitute for it apart from social earthquakes or revolution. These would be ways to change your environment but survivors of revolutions have rather unhappy experiences. To maintain life and limb and generally give people an opportunity to live in peace together Parliaments still have a function if they are properly worked.</P>
      <P>The danger, which is perhaps a cloud no bigger than a man's hand in the Minister's proposal, is that it has a smack of the old Gaullist doctrine, that we should have this elitist corps which will superintend these regulations which do not really mean very much, with the implication that not many Deputies would be interested in these complicated matters. I could see in the Minister's early speech that he is adopting the position before he departs for Europe of emeritus schoolmaster on the EEC to the Members of the House when he speaks of the necessity of their reading more.  Incidentally, this is good advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Redundancy is not confined to manual workers in the new situation.  The Minister explains piously that he is helping the House and looks at us with compassion and sees that the work of the House is not proceeding with great efficiency and is perturbed lest its efficiency might be further impaired in the years ahead with these troublesome regulations coming along. His helpful suggestion is that another group of civil servants would meet in a place apart and vet these troublesome proposals and pass them on to the unwashed Deputies of the House who would presumably pass them into the oblivion of a unanimous vote.</P>

      <P>The point is that the Minister shows little desire to help from what I see of his attitude to the amendments between which there is not a great deal of difference.  The Labour Party amendment suggests that the House itself should be consulted here and the Fine Gael amendment says that we should have a special committee.  The common ground between both is that Parliament must have a function in this period and must not be deprived of the opportunity of discussing these regulations which the Minister estimates at an average of 20 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> We are between two unknowns.  We have not seen any great desire to see the work of this House reformed in the years gone by.  There has been a committee sitting on that matter but the reception its proposals will get from the Government is doubtful.  The working of the Dáil has remained unchanged for almost 40 years.  We shall be sending ten Members of this Parliament to the European Parliament but it remains very much with the distant future and with factors over which we have very little control&mdash;apart from what we can do ourselves, in that direction&mdash;as to what way that Parliament will develop.</P>
    <P>That Parliament may become a danger; it may become just another Council of Europe, just another Strasbourg.  We in this House can assess the situation when we see the persons chosen by the parties to go to the European Parliament.  We will know the status the European Parliament holds in the minds of the political parties selecting the people to go to Europe.  If we see these places being reserved for persons at the end of their political career, for persons who desire to end their political career, for persons in political disgrace with their parties, for persons not seriously concerned <Col N="1146" /> in seeing that the European Parliament will develop, we will know that the majority of the membership here is not interested in seeing the European Parliament developing in the proper fashion.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister can meet the Opposition in their amendments.  We are not against the idea of a secretariat. We should like the assistance of a secretariat.  We would not like to see the secretariat doing the business of Deputies over the lengthy period suggested by the Minister.</P>

Since amendment No. 9 is related, if Deputies are agreeable, we can take amendments Nos. 8, 9 and 12 together.  No. 9 is an amendment in the names of Deputies Cosgrave and Ryan.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 17 and 18, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The power conferred in the foregoing subsection shall not include power to repeal or amend any part of the domestic law of the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is an amendment to section 3 of the Bill and, in order to explain it properly, I wish to read the first portion of the section which provides:</P>
      <P>A Minister of State may make regulations for enabling section 2 of this Act to have full effect.</P>
      <P>That is subsection (1).  The amendment proposed to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>The power conferred in the foregoing subsection shall not include power to repeal or amend any part of the domestic law of the State.</P>
      <P>This, in fact, is the nub of the whole Bill.  We want to know from the Minister if we can safeguard the domestic law of the State or if, by regulation, a Minister may alter the law of the State, in other words, Acts passed by this House and the other House of the Oireachtas and signed by the President which are the law of the land.  Can they be annulled simply by the Minister making a regulation to conform with something in the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a very lengthy debate on the previous amendments and for that <Col N="1149" /> reason I feel that we all understand the position which exists here now or will exist here after 1st January and the Minister, I think, appreciates the desire of the Members of the House to ensure that no power which can be retained by this House should be given away easily.  We have put down this amendment because we feel that if we are going to allow the domestic law to be changed simply by a ministerial order, we are, in fact, giving away almost the entire authority of Oireachtas Éireann.  I should like to hear the Minister's comment on it before I make any further submission and, perhaps, Deputy Ryan would allow the Minister to make a comment on this amendment and on amendment No. 12 which seeks to delete &ldquo;(including provisions repealing, amending or applying, with or without modification, other law, exclusive of this Act)&rdquo;.  That is, in effect, simply a back up for amendment No. 8.  Perhaps the Minister might give us what he considers is the interpretation of that subsection and if we are satisfied that either it cannot be altered or our amendment is not necessary, we can take a certain line of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the amendment is acceptable because it would be a restriction on power which we seek in the subsection, on the basis that this is the best and most practical way of implementing our obligations under the secondary legislation.  The Deputy might have forgotten that each time we speak of powers of Ministers, there is a limitation on the Minister's power in regard to what we enable him to make regulations about. Any Minister acts within the limits of our obligations under the Act of Accession.  Perhaps I did not put it well when I said that the vast majority of Community legislation would be to our advantage.  What I should have said and what I wanted to convey was that in the vast majority of our cases, it is to our advantage to implement them quickly because there is a benefit to be gained by making some legislation exist but this amendment would restrict the power we seek.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as I said in the other cases, <Col N="1150" /> there is nothing new in this, enabling a Minister to amend or repeal existing legislative provisions, whether by delegated legislation or by means of statutory instrument.  There are examples of this.  The Agricultural Produce (Cereals) (Amendment) Act, 1958, section 7, gives power to assign by ministerial order additional functions to An Bord Gráin; the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966, section 2, gives power to amend by ministerial order the First Schedule setting out the animals to which the Act applies; and the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966 gives power to amend by ministerial order a schedule of the Social Welfare Act to add to excepted employment.  So we are looking for nothing that is new in concept. We are seeking power to make implementation of our obligation possible.</P>
    <P>There is another point which, I think, is important, that it is not certain&mdash;one could not possibly be certain&mdash;that a ministerial regulation made to fulfil our obligations would not be in conflict with existing legislation, with some existing provision, and if this conflict existed, the normal rules would apply to the effect that the earlier provision would be amended to the extent of the conflict.  If the amendment were adopted, the contrary would happen&mdash;the regulation would be invalid to the extent of the inconsistency and it would take away altogether from the effectiveness of the ministerial regulation, if such happened.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister mind repeating the last portion?  It is a little obscure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>We work here on implied repeal and that later legislation amends or is taken to amend unrepealed earlier legislation and if a regulation is made, with these powers we seek, to amend legislation, then any inconsistency which would arise between existing legislation and a regulation made by the Minister would be corrected on that principle in which the ministerial regulation with power to amend legislation would stand.  But if you limit that power and do not permit of a ministerial regulation <Col N="1151" /> amending earlier legislation, in the attempt to fulfil our obligations, he would make a regulation which in the event of conflict, would be found to be inconsistent.  These are the arguments for seeking to maintain the powers given in the section.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 relates to amendment and repeal and I think it would fall if amendment No. 8 fell. It provides for the application&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I think we are obviously entering into what for all of us is necessarily new and unfamiliar ground and that the doubts which we sought to allay by our amendment are not fully allayed, and, perhaps, cannot be, by the Minister's reply. We are in difficulty here in that the people have already accepted entry into Europe and there may not be alternative methods of entering.  We may not be able to qualify things in the way we might like at the present stage.  That part of the debate is already closed.  There were one or two things in the Minister's statement, however, which were very gently delivered as always but are, perhaps, somewhat disquieting all the same.  He said that he could not accept the amendment because it would set up restrictions &ldquo;on powers we seek&rdquo;. There are occasions on which powers which Ministers seek ought to be restricted in the interests of the working of Parliamentary democracy so that the mere fact that they are restrictions on powers which the Minister seeks, with due respect, is not an adequate reason in itself for turning them down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He also said that there is nothing new in the concept here but, in fact, the whole context is new in concept, new in scale, perhaps, in that individual precedents for particular aspects can be found but the whole thing is utterly new in concept for all of us and it is clear that the Minister or <Col N="1152" /> his successor will acquire very widespread powers of amending legislation made under Acts and general principles decided elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not allayed our fears and perhaps cannot.  We do not wish to be unreasonable or obstructive, nor do I think we have been, about this matter since the principle has been decided already.  We had hoped the Minister might be able to accept some of these amendments.  I accept that some of them have been discussed rather fully already.  I was attending the Committee on the Implications of Irish Unity and I do not want to go over ground which was quite possibly covered in my absence, but I should like to ask the Minister if he will go some way to meet our fears, which may prove to be ungrounded or not as firmly grounded as we think.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that in respect of the vast majority of these regulations it will be an advantage to us to implement them as quickly as possible. If so, it would be a solid reason, a very good practical reason for the benefit of our people, why these powers should not be restricted.  But we have yet to see whether this will be the case and how it will work.  When we have had some experience, say after six months, of being in Europe and being subject to such regulations and so on, will he allow for time to be provided in the House for a review of this matter in the same spirit as we are now discussing it, which I think is a constructive spirit all round?  If this could be done I think it would help us on this side not to press this to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>For the time being I will confine my remarks to the amendment standing in the names of Deputy Cosgrave and myself which seeks to put brakes on the power which the present section can give to Ministers.  We seek to ensure that Ministers will not, having been give a blanket power, have power to impose or to increase taxation, to administer justice, to declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission, to make any provision taking effect from a date earlier than that of the making of the instrument <Col N="1153" /> containing the provision, to create any new criminal offence, or to confer any power to limit the personal rights guaranteed by our Constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
      <P>It would be a grievous error to give to the Minister power to create any new criminal offence or to give him power&mdash;this is the proposal in the Bill &mdash;to breach personal rights guaranteed by our Constitution.  It will not be good enough for the Minister to answer that it is unlikely a Minister would abuse the powers in such a way as to commit breaches of these constitutional rights or the European conventions; the Dáil today is being asked to give unlimited powers to Ministers to make orders over a field of human activity wider than anything the House itself has control over.</P>
      <P>At present this House and the other House are subject to the control and the supervision of our own courts of justice and if Oireachtas Éireann exceed the powers conferred on them by the Constitution they can be tripped up in their tracks by a decision in the courts that the action of Parliament is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, is wrong and cannot be proceeded with. But the amendment of the Constitution carried by our people on 10th May last is so extensive, when coupled with the unlimited powers the Minister seeks in this Bill, that there could be many deeds done which would be breaches of our own Constitution were it not for last May's constitutional amendment and the immense powers this Bill proposes to confer.</P>
      <P>It will be agreed that everything is not black and white here or in the European Communities, that there are bound to be many areas of grey uncertainty, and unless we protect our people in the manner we suggest in the amendment, there is a possibility that serious injustice and harm could be done by various proposals made in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essential to the operation of democracy and to the preservation of freedom is not to impose taxation without representation.  Essential to the preservation of democracy and freedom is to give to the people's representatives <Col N="1154" /> an opportunity to discuss the purpose of taxation, the manner in which it is to be imposed and collected, and the purpose for which it is to be spent.  Even allowing for the immense powers the European institutions may have for setting the size of the budget and the manner in which the budget is to be expended, there is still left to the several national parliaments a considerable amount of freedom to decide the manner in which the taxation is to be collected.</P>
    <P>At present the revenues of the Communities come in the main from agricultural levies, and from 1975 onwards all taxes charged at the frontiers of the European Customs Union will be revenue of the Communities.  It is envisaged that the yield from the harmonised VAT may not be sufficient to meet the budget of the Communities. It has been specifically provided in Article 22 of the decision of 21st April, 1970, that any further changes in taxation would necessitate a special Council decision and endorsement by the individual member states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. The Community recognise that the different member states have different systems of imposing taxation and collecting taxation, have different authorities for imposing taxation and collecting revenue, and they have, therefore, specifically provided that each member state would proceed in its own particular way according to its own constitutional requirements, to conform to Community requirements.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that the Government need not come before Dáil Éireann to obtain additional taxation. It could be imposed simply by ministerial regulation.  This would be a serious breach of the democratic principle that there should not be taxation without representation.  It is not sufficient to say that because a government is elected by the democratic process it is in itself the essence of democracy and full democratic representation takes place at governmental level.</P>
    <P>The Constitution recognises the fundamental importance of giving Parliament a full say in the imposition of taxation and in the control of expenditure. The power to impose taxes <Col N="1155" /> is reserved to Members of this House as the directly elected representatives of the people who, on that account, have a complete mandate from the people to regulate taxation, to say what money should be paid and how it should be expended. That power is not given to the Seanad.  If the people who framed our Constitution and those who voted in favour of it decided it would be wrong to give the power of imposing taxation to any authority other than to all the directly elected people's representatives in this House, surely it would be much worse to pass this enabling Bill which would allow taxation to be imposed on a personal decision of a Minister.  No doubt he would consult the Government but it would not be a decision of the people through their directly elected Parliamentary representatives.</P>
    <P>This principle was recognised in the British Parliament.  In their Communities Bill the British Parliament specifically provided that the power of taxation would not go with the other powers conferred on Ministers. As I pointed out this morning, I always hesitate to quote British or foreign examples to this Assembly.  We should be able to make our own decisions on merit alone.  However, it is of interest that in Britain and in a number of other member States the power to impose taxation simply by ministerial order is not given to Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Minister acknowledged in his speech on Second Stage that many of the steps necessary to implement directives and secondary legislation might be taken by legislation.  It need not necessarily be done by ministerial order or regulation.  It is possible that a reasonable Minister and Government might consider they should not impose taxation without going to the Dáil and putting it in a legislative proposal. However we cannot assume all Ministers and Governments will act reasonably in the future.  In order to prevent Ministers succumbing to the temptation of collecting taxation in the easy way without debate it is essential that our amendment be written into <Col N="1156" /> the Bill and I hope the Minister will see his way to accepting this.  It would ease the public mind considerably, if he made it clear he had no wish to use regulations to impose taxation.</P>
    <P>As the Minister knows, more declarations in this House will not suffice to debar Ministers in future from using legislation in a particular way if the power is given to them.  From my reading of parliamentary history, I recall an undertaking given in relation to the Offences Against the State Act that the prohibition against demonstrations within half a mile of Leinster House would not be used against anybody except subversive organisations.  However, the first two organisations against which that power was used were the National Farmers' Association and post office workers.  I have no doubt the Minister of the day gave the undertaking in good faith; I suspect the Ministers who used the power in the way in which they did some 30 years later did not recall the undertaking previously given.  However, it indicates clearly the grave danger of putting on the statute book an enabling measure which could be used in a way not intended by the legislators.</P>
    <P>It would not diminish or take from the effect of the Bill if this restriction was imposed.  It would still be open to the Government to come to the Dáil and seek to get the increase in taxation by way of a Bill from the Dáil.  In fact, I think the Minister's position would be improved because the people would have spoken through their elected representatives.  That is the way democracy must work.  If we give away that power to the Minister we will be doing a grave disservice to the people.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Constitution recognises the importance of financial matters.  It is provided in the Constitution that the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance must be Members of the Dáil.  There is no such provision in relation to any of the other Ministers. This provision in the Constitution shows that there is clear recognition of the essential link in the <Col N="1157" /> democratic process between the imposition of taxation, the expenditure of public money and the authority of the people.  This must only be given after an open and free debate in this properly elected Assembly.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing here does not conflict with the obligations of the European Treaties.  In fact, it gives life to the obligations of the European Communities because the Communities want the people to be involved in decision-making.  This was clearly recognised in the October communiqué from the Summit Conference where the Ministers recognised as a serious weakness the structures and procedures which caused the people to be alienated from and to be too far removed from decision-making.  If we are to divest ourselves here of financial control over the Government we will be doing a grave disservice to our people and we will damage the whole approach which is necessary if our people are to accept and be content with the European institutions.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution also provides that justice must be administered in courts established by the Constitution.  The power conferred on Ministers in sections 2 and 3 of this Bill is so extensive that Ministers could, by order or regulation, establish their own tribunals to administer justice.  By virtue of the amendment made in the Constitution earlier this year, such tribunals would be regarded as valid. The amendment to Article 29 of the Constitution is so extensive that any act done and necessitated by membership would be valid.  It might be open to argument that what was done in the establishment of certain tribunals was not necessitated by membership but was done because a Minister considered it was the most convenient administrative way of achieving the objectives of the Community, but it is undesirable that we should have any area of doubt or argument.  There is certainly nothing in the European Communities which would prevent them from issuing a regulation or a directive which would require the establishment of such a tribunal for the purpose of administering certain <Col N="1158" /> matters which at the moment can only be administered in the Irish courts established and recognised by our own law.  We say it is essential to ensure that justice is administered only in courts established by our law, except on such issues as might arise in relation to the interpretation of European Community law, which would be matters for the European institutions. It would be wrong were we to have courts and tribunals established by ministerial order, and that could be done were we to pass the Bill without the brakes which we seek to apply in this particular amendment.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights say that it is wrong to declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so on the date of their commission. There is no such provision that I am aware of in the European Community Treaty.  While it is unlikely that the institutions of the Community would make such a requirement, it could happen.  Certainly this legal principle is not as universally respected in Europe as it is in our legal system.  If the Minister's reply in this matter is that it is unlikely that the European Communities would require us to declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the time of their commission, that kills any opposition to the amendment. It is better to write in this amendment to provide this safeguard in case of any future doubt about what may be considered at the moment to be daft and imprudent.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies in relation to subsection (4) where we seek to ensure that the power would not include power to make any provision which would take effect earlier than the date contained in the provision. We are not concerned with offences here, but simply with any other obligations and liabilities which could arise under the regulations to be made by the Ministers.  It is essential that we should keep within the control of this House, and of the Seanad, the right of creating new criminal offences.  It is an essential to our legal system that every person knows the law and is presumed to know the law.  The tragedy at present is that, whatever <Col N="1159" /> our knowledge may be of domestic law, we have little notion of many of the new legal obligations which will arise from the 1st of January next. In their annual report issued yesterday the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland stated that they had made urgent representations to the Government asking them to issue, without further delay, a clear guide to what the legal position would be after the 1st January, 1973, in relation to a wide area of legal matters, and particularly in relation to such existing Irish laws as may be amended or repealed.  The Incorporated Law Society have pointed out that the Government have not come forward with this guide so that even legal practitioners, who know more about the law than the ordinary man in the street, find they are in a fog created by Governmental inactivity.  The Government has done nothing to dispel this fog since the 10th of May last when they got the &ldquo;green light&rdquo; from the people indicating that they wanted to go into the EEC.</P>
    <P>This is a deplorable situation, but it must not be made worse by conferring on Ministers the right to create new criminal offences simply by means of ministerial regulations which will not get the kind of public debate which ought to take place before any new criminal offences are created.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of European Community law which might not be regarded as serious moral issues. Taxation offences could occur which would not be of a criminal nature and might not be regarded by people as matters of any serious degree of moral turpitude.  There might not be much public interest in legislation for new criminal offences dealing with financial and other Community matters, but if somebody was accidentally caught up in this new civil and criminal labyrinth this might have most serious consequences for him, his reputation, and his wife and family.</P>
    <P>The reservation which we seek to impose here is not one which will obstruct the functioning of the EEC. It will not prevent us fulfilling all our <Col N="1160" /> obligations under the European Economic Community, but it is a safe way of involving our people in the decision-making and a safe way of providing an understanding of what the Community is endeavouring to do.</P>
    <P>Finally, we provide that the powers cannot in any way be used to limit the fundamental personal rights guaranteed by our own Constitution or by the European Convention of European Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. There is often confusion in the public mind between the European institutions of the Community and the European institutions of the Council of Europe.  They are not one and the same, although the Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament meet in the one building and occupy the same seats &mdash; though not at the same time &mdash; in Strasbourg.  They are separate entities and the European Community institutions are not necessarily governed by the principles set out in the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The several nation states who are members of the European Communities are also participants in the Council of Europe, but at least one of the Member states of the European Communities has not yet ratified the European Convention, and two of them have not yet subscribed to the European Convention, in such a way as to give an individual who is aggrieved, a right of complaint to the European Commission.  While I would say, and acknowledge, that it is impossible that the European Communities will act in a way which would be contrary to the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms it is possible, particularly when one sees that some countries, when under stress, can avoid their obligations by notifying the Council that they are doing so, will even avoid their obligations though it is illegal for them to do so.</P>
    <P>Our amendment is one which I believe should commend itself to the Government, particularly at a time when Ireland has a complaint before the European Commission of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms <Col N="1161" /> and are glad to be able to use that institution in order to voice their complaint about allegations of torture and ill-treatment of Irish people in Northern Ireland.  We must ensure that this right continues.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be put off by advice which he may get from his experts.  The Minister knows well the consequences of expert advice sometimes.  The expert advice given to the Committee of Ministers at the Council of Europe, as the Minister knows well, was advice which would have prevented the European Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms being amended so as to prohibit discrimination on religious, political or racial grounds in respect of access to employment or the allocation of housing.</P>
    <P>The experts met for two-and-a-half years and said it would be awkward to do it.  The Committee of Ministers went further and decided that in their opinion it was not desirable or expedient, but that was a decision of the Ministers on political considerations. It was not desirable or expedient to them because it would have been a matter of some embarrassment to them if individuals were to make complaints about their conduct before the European Commission of Human Rights.  If the Assembly of the Council of Europe, the Parliament of the Council of Europe, had listened to the experts and had accepted the view of the Ministers that nothing should be done, that would have been the end of it, but the Minister and his Government&mdash;and more power to them&mdash;and all the Irish delegates to the Council of Europe insisted that we should not accept the view of the experts.  As a result the parliamentary representatives collected in the Council asserted their right to require that these matters be written in, even though the experts found it difficult and found that it was not an easy exercise to draft a convention to comply with the wishes of the parliamentarians. But it now has to be done because the Committee of Ministers has been overruled by the Assembly and the experts have been sent back to their desks to do the <Col N="1162" /> work that parliament says they must do.</P>
    <P>We are not doing anything which offends against our obligations in the European Community.  There may be some grey-haired men behind desks in Brussels or some young whiz-kids who might not like these brakes to be put on, but these brakes are to stop our own Ministers at home from running berserk and running amok. There is nothing here which in any way conflicts with our obligations to the European Communities, with our obligations to our people under our Constitution or the obligations which lie on us as Europeans to observe the European Convention of Human Rights.  I believe it would vastly improve the Bill and would certainly help to remove some of the grave worries which lie on Members of this House and members of the general public about the unnecessarily extensive powers which Ministers are seeking in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>There are four amendments here &mdash; two from the Labour Party and two from Fine Gael&mdash; and they are different.  I am concerned with the area of economic and related social activity which membership of the Community obliges us to accept &mdash; either direct regulations or implementation by our own regulations of their directives.  My concern is to fulfil our obligations under the Act of Accession and to be able to do this quickly and, at the same time, to have some parliamentary control.  I think I should argue again that the method proposed here in section 4 is more powerful than the method of laying something before the House and seeing whether it will be taken up by somebody and voted against.  Perhaps we could try to visualise how section 4 would work.  It will mean that there will be a full legislative debate, all stages, on regulations made by the Minister.  In actual experience it will mean that, if the Minister lost the vote on it or on any part of it, then the regulation made would lapse, but also, and I think more important, the making of regulations will be done with a view to the debate which is coming up.  These two things will have <Col N="1163" /> a big influence on the regulations made by Ministers.  Ministers will be entitled to come and make proposals through Bills here.  As I foresee it, there will be total consideration of the attitude of Parliament when a Minister is having a regulation prepared. Then when the Parliament comes to debate it, there will be the possibility of the Oireachtas just making the regulation drop so the Minister will not be implementing it as he wanted to and will have to find a new way.</P>
      <P>I accept the Labour Party point of view that there should be more frequent debates, that they should be sooner after these regulations and I will try to get an amendment which will bring in the second point, that of frequent debate.  If it is possible to draft, and I think it must be, a way of having the Ministerial regulations presented by the Minister in legislation in six months instead of at the end of the year after they are made, then you would have debates at the end of six months, regular debates, and you would have the Minister being conscious of them.</P>
      <P>I would like to retain the power which we have here.  As I explained to Deputy Tully, the power of the Minister must remain to amend legislation. That will be necessary.  Otherwise we will have conflict with failure of regulations possibly.</P>
      <P>The other area gone into by Deputy Ryan is the extent of the Minister's powers in terms of widening the scope of the wish of the people last May, in going into areas that we did not consider at that time to be areas in which we sought powers.  We sought power to become a member of the Community and to make the changes necessary or necessitated by membership which were economic and related social ones, but during the referendum I had approaches from people who were worried about the fundamental individual rights in the Constitution.  I saw no reason for that worry.  I could see no possibility of the rights &mdash; I think Deputy Ryan is unhappy at having Article 44 in his amendment&mdash;of the individual being given away by ministerial order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no possibility of this being done.  If a Minister makes an order to interfere with these rights that order will be made in the consciousness that it is going to be debated in the Oireachtas afterwards and the Oireachtas can change it.  If I thought there was any possibility of the decision of the public last May being so interpreted as to give such wide powers I would seriously consider putting in that paragraph (iv) but I believe, and the Government believe, that the method of legislation we have adopted, without which all those regulations would drop, is much more powerful&mdash;influencing the preparation and the continuation of the existence of the regulations.</P>
      <P>The power to impose or increase taxation already exists in the Imposition of Duties Acts.  I think I used to bring orders here when I was Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It relates to customs duties and excise duties and there is no limitation. Again, apart from the tidiness of the Bill, I cannot see it doing any harm to put it into the Bill.</P>
      <P>I do not take the point about the administration of justice.  That is a matter for the courts.  If we go so far as to make the changes the Deputy is afraid of, I do not think a debate in the Dáil will make a difference.</P>
      <P>Accepting any of these suggested amendments would mean that a Minister would come in with legislation rather than make a regulation and come later with legislation.  He would come the first day with legislation rather than within the period we are determined on.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (iii) is unnecessary.  It is: to declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission;</P>
      <P>This states the position as it stands. I do not think it is necessary to put it in.  It is in the Constitution and the Convention of Human Rights. Paragraph (iv) is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To make any provision taking <Col N="1165" /> effect from a date earlier than that of the making of the instrument containing the provision;</P>
    <P>It is necessary for us to have the power for the Minister to make that provision because sometimes the Community adopts legislation and decisions with retrospective effect.  There was one last week.  The Council made a decision on financial adjustments payable at internal Community borders to take account of changes in the rates of exchange.  In future these taxes or refunds are to be paid out of Community funds and no longer out of national funds.  This decision has a retrospective effect to July of this year in so far as refunds on exports to non-member countries are concerned. It is important that we retain that power.</P>
    <P>Part (v) is:</P>
    <P>To create any new criminal offence: It will be necessary to have the power to decide that something is a new criminal offence.  If the House wanted to put a limitation on the type of offence which could be created by ministerial order perhaps you could exclude indictable offences.  That would limit offences that could be created by ministerial order to those coming within the jurisdiction of the District Court. Again, we have ministerial orders to be followed by legislation in the Dáil in which the Dáil goes through the full process of legislation and if it does not pass it lapses.</P>
    <P>We have not given it much thought because we talk in terms of the Minister making regulations and it stands subject to confirmation.  It lapses if it does not get the full power of legislation. We will seek to have more frequent or earlier legislative confirmation of the orders.  I will try to have that drafted for the next Stage.  That would mean we would have the debates twice a year perhaps or it may be possible for the House to make other arrangements.  We are talking of having some help for the House to deal with this.  There was talk of a committee but Deputies made it quite clear they did not want all the work done in a committee, that they wanted to participate.  We will have to make some arrangements for the other procedures <Col N="1166" /> in the House and to have the House deal with these things by, perhaps, a combination of committees and the Dáil, so that the work can be done. I do not know how attached Deputies are to these.</P>
    <P>I cannot argue in regard to No. (iv). Many people want to be quite sure that these could not be easily changed. Of course, the protection is there that if the Minister made an order changing them the required legislation would have to come through the Oireachtas and could be beaten.  It would then lapse.  I do not see the need for it but if there was any idea in it I would accept it.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party welcome the assurance we have received from the Minister about early review.  In view of the unfamiliarity of the territory we are now entering into, this principle of early review is fundamental. I hope I understand the Minister right that he would give the Dáil an opportunity of debating the working of this at the end of a six month period.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister also tell us whether at that stage he would provide facilities for the offering of amendments to the Bill in the light of our experience of how it has actually worked?  Some of the fears expressed here may seem to be groundless, but others may seem to be borne out by experience.  Would the Minister offer facilities for that kind of review and not merely for a general debate with expressions of opinion?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We appreciate the Minister's readiness to leave at least some meaningful power, which is certainly four times better than what was originally proposed in the Bill.  It is better to be able to do something every six months than have to wait two years. It is better to have the opportunity every six months of having a look at what is happening rather than to have to wait two years to do anything in <Col N="1167" /> respect of orders which become effective on the 1st January, 1973.  It could be late in 1974 before we could get an opportunity of having a bite at the January 1973 regulations.  Some of what the Minister says tends to strengthen the argument for adopting our amendment.  He says that at the moment ministers have power to impose increased taxation.  It is very limited power and is related only to customs duties as he says.  If he has that power already he does not need a second enabling measure to do the same thing.  It is surely wrong to give a Minister two ways of doing the one thing.  That is very bad legislation and it would be a very bad practice for this House to adopt to give a Minister a choice of methods under the system of delegated legislation.  If he has the power already to deal with customs duties let him use it.</P>
      <P>We accept that the European Communities will in fact be laying down new customs regulations and will be providing that by 1975 all revenue from customs duties will go direct to the Communities.  We say this procedure is so important that it ought to be brought into the House and explained.  If my memory serves me right any order permitting the imposition of duties has to be brought to the House and approved within 21 sitting days.  One gets so confused about the various forms and methods applicable to different classes of delegated legislation that it is often difficult, without having the reference beside one to know what the precise method is.  It is certainly not as remotely controlled as what was originally set out in this Bill.  We will have to wait for the Minister's improvements on Report Stage to see if it will be improved.  The control was so remote that anything from 20 to 24 months could pass before we would get an opportunity of passing comment, much less of influencing or annulling, what the Minister has previously done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says he takes it that justice will continue to be administered by the courts.  I accept that is where it ought to be, but there have <Col N="1168" /> been a number of judicial interpretations here where Acts of the Oireachtas have been condemned as being unconstitutional because they sought to confer powers of decision on bodies other than the judiciary.  I think particularly of disciplinary bodies of professions like the solicitors profession which was given power to adjudicate on whether or not a solicitor would be permitted to continue to practice as a solicitor.  The legal fraternity walked into a trap as did this House and the Seanad, under prompting from the legal profession. The legal profession was given power to discipline their own profession.  This was ultimately found to be unconstitutional because the ultimate decision, it was held by the judiciary, had to be taken by the judiciary. If at some date in the future the Minister proceeds to set up a similar tribunal or confer authority on somebody other than the judiciary to adjudicate on some matter, he may find himself in a position in which he is creating new courts which were not envisaged at the time the Constitution came into operation.  It might be doubtful whether or not they were required by the European Communities.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the amendment which would stop this State of ours fulfilling its obligations.  All we are asking is that the decision as to the method would be left in the future as in the past, to Parliament.  The Minister on Second Stage acknowknowledged that there will be occasions on which even though a Minister could do something by regulation he would prefer to do it by legislation. We say: &ldquo;Why not identify some of these areas?&rdquo; so that we now, beyond any doubt, identify certain matters of principle on which we will not seek to legislate by ministerial regulation. It is as simple as all that.  I do not think it is unreasonable and I hope the Minister will see his way to correct the unnecessarily great power which he seeks to obtain.</P>
    <P>I am worried by the Minister's statement that it is necessary to provide power to make some provisions effective from a date earlier than that <Col N="1169" /> of the making of the instrument.  I already hit the Minister with the British Bill and I propose to tap him on the shoulder with it again and ask him if what he is saying is valid how he can explain in section 2 of the second Schedule to the British Act it is provided that the powers conferred on the Ministers do not include the power to make any provision taking effect from a date earlier than that of the making of the instrument containing the provision. The same wording has been adopted in our amendment.  If what the Minister says is true the British Parliament has already committed an offence against Community obligations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  The Deputy's wording relates to making provision taking effect from a day earlier than that of the making of the instrument containing the provision but the Community have instruments with retrospective provision.  Therefore, if what the Deputy has said means that they cannot have retrospective action before the date of the actual instrument, not before the date mentioned in the instrument, then the British are in trouble.</P>

      <P>If what the Minister says <Col N="1170" /> is true, and I will accept it for the purpose of this argument, it is a decision and it is left to the individual countries to devise their own ways and means of implementing the decision. What we are saying in our amendment is that the matter is so grievous that Parliament must decide the best way to implement the European decisions.  This should not be left to individual Ministers, particularly if it is to be retrospective. While we have the greatest respect for ministerial office the only way in which we can ensure adequate communication of information is by a Minister coming to Parliament and explaining why regulations are being made retrospective.  The fact that a notice is published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> or some Stationery Office publication does not mean that it will be communicated to an adequate number of people that something has happened which makes a retrospective provision in relation to Community laws, obligations and liabilities.  We have no certainty that because it happens in Parliament it will be promulgated sufficiently but we can be grateful to and can rely upon the gentlemen of the Fourth Estate who have a great capacity for extracting the essentials from rambling debates and communicating them to the public.  We will not have that process of valuable communication if the matter is left simply to ministerial regulation.</P>

      <P>I hope that one of the first acts of the Irish delegation to the European Parliament will be to devise different terminology so that we shall not find ourselves talking of &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; and confusing ministerial orders of the Republic of Ireland with crucial decisions of the Council of Europe.  In relation to the sixth amendment point the Minister says he cannot find any reason to object to it.  He considers it to be acceptable and good in principle.  It <Col N="1171" /> would be good for us to prove ourselves as people truly concerned with human life and fundamental freedoms, to recognise an international instrument in our own legislation.  It would be good in the Irish environment to spell out that we will not do anything which could trifle with fundamental rights and it would be good in the Community to show that we are very conscious of the need to preserve human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The Minister may think that it is somewhat verbose or in the nature of a homily to write it into this legislation, but it is something more than that.  It imposes a clear obligation on a Minister and his advisers to look at the European convention and to consider the human rights Articles of our own Constitution before drafting a ministerial regulation. That is a very good exercise and one that we ought to encourage.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will see his way to writing in these brakes.  They will not limit the power of this State to fulfil its obligations to the Community but they will indicate that we wish to be an effective Parliament within the European environment.  If we do that we will improve the status of our parliamentary members at the Community and also it will hasten the day when the European Parliament will become a truly democratic and effective Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the amendment tabled by Deputies Cosgrave and Ryan it is proposed that there shall not be power to impose or increase taxation.  Surely this House must consider that a request to impose or increase taxation should not be the responsibility of any Minister nor should this House give to any Minister this power.  What is more important is that the powers which the Minister is seeking under the Bill should not include the administration of justice and if it is not the intention to include power to administer justice the Minister, if he is not prepared to accept the amendment in whole, should at least accept the most important parts of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be an extraordinarily wide <Col N="1172" /> power to vest in any man the power to create any new criminal offence.  It would be a very great power to vest in any Minister to allow him, by a stroke of his pen, to create a new criminal offence or to interfere in any way in the administration of justice or in the individual rights which citizens are guaranteed under the Constitution. We have been told by the Minister that the field in which he is concerned is the social and economic field.  If it is the position that the role we will have to play will be mainly in the social and economic field there is nothing to prevent the Minister from accepting in full the Fine Gael amendment.  It has been stated by the Minister that there will be discussions in the House in relation to the EEC as frequently as possible, perhaps twice a year.  Will the Minister anticipate the expressed opinion of the House in relation to the powers he is receiving and to the manner in which he uses these powers?  I am at a loss to know how it could come within the ambit of the Minister to create a new criminal offence.  What would be the purpose of the newly-created offence unless it was in connection with taxation or financial matters?  To create new criminal offences as he thought fit would undoubtedly be an intrusion on the individual rights of citizens.  If such offences are to be created this is the Assembly which should create them.</P>
    <P>The powers which this House is now giving to Ministers are very wide-ranging. As I have said on a number of other occasions today, it involves a diminution of the powers which up to now have been invested in this House.  I welcome most wholeheartedly the undertaking given by the Minister to have frequent discussions of the whole House in relation to these matters. I should imagine that if it is the intention of the Minister to use the power which this Bill vests in him, the power to amend legislation, we shall have a considerable debate and exchange of views on whatever legislation the Minister proposes.</P>
    <P>If this amendment were written into the Bill, the House would have more confidence in it and people would know that no acts would be performed <Col N="1173" /> by the Minister not alone without consultation but without an expression of opinion from the national assembly. It is all very well to say that the House can wholeheartedly accept the advice given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but here we are handing over great power and great responsibility to any Minister.  The Minister cannot give a guarantee on behalf of future Ministers for Foreign Affairs that the powers we are now vesting in Ministers will be exercised in a completely responsible manner.  The Minister can give a guarantee for himself, and I presume the Minister would even attempt to give a guarantee on behalf of his colleagues, at least those with whom he is intimately associated. However, we have had irresponsible Ministers before.  We have had stupid and irresponsible governments in the past.  Taoisigh did strange things to alter which referenda had to be carried out.  I believe that this amendment proposed by the Fine Gael Party is a safeguard against the irresponsible exercise of power by any Minister.</P>
    <P>To create new offences is an extraordinary power for Parliament to vest in a particular man, and more extraordinary still, the right to impose increased taxation.  The right to impose increased taxation was always vested in Parliament.  The Minister for Finance had to come in here and seek the approval of the House for such taxation.  I believe this Bill would be strengthened considerably if the Minister would accept this amendment which Deputy Ryan has so eloquently recommended to the House.  We are all jealous in this House of the powers vested in us, and we are saddened at the transfer of powers to individual Ministers.  It carries with it great danger and it also creates deep resentment amongst those who cherish the right of Parliament to rule.</P>
    <P>As has been said by many in the course of this debate, there is nothing we can do to alter the decision that was taken by the people; neither is there anything we care to do about it because all of us here accept unquestioningly the majority decision of the people.  If we did not do so we would not be a democracy and, if we <Col N="1174" /> want to continue as a democracy within the EEC, we must provide the best possible democratic safeguards in any legislation we pass in relation to the EEC.  If we want to prevent extraordinary powers falling into individual ministerial hands the one way in which we can do that is by ensuring the EEC legislation passed here will have built into it all the necessary safeguards.</P>
    <P>What better safeguards could there be than those clearly spelled out in the amendments in the names of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Ryan? These are vitally important from the point of view of the creation, for example, of any new criminal offence or for the purpose of conferring any power to limit the personal rights guaranteed by Articles 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44 of the Constitution of Ireland. We must safeguard the rights and freedoms of all our citizens.  We would be betraying the rights and freedoms and liberty of our citizens if we allowed Parliament to vest in one man the extraordinary powers proposed in this Bill, powers vested in a Minister of State.</P>
    <P>As I said, I believe the Bill would be a much better Bill with this amendment written into it.  Those of us who are critical of the Bill would, if this amendment were accepted, have some of our fears allayed.  The amendment would be a brake.  It would prevent the Minister running amok. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that Ministers have run amok on occasions.  The present Minister, as I said, is a reasonable and courteous man and very approachable, but we have no guarantee that those who succeed him will be of the same calibre.  We must always, therefore, provide against the man who may act in the manner of a lunatic.  We have had such in the past.  We will have such in the future.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this very reasonable amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not have the pleasure of hearing all the remarks made by the Minister on this amendment. I came in in the middle of <Col N="1175" /> them and I am, therefore, somewhat inhibited from saying a great deal about this amendment but, from what I heard, the Minister did not seem to reject outright the desirability of some restriction of the kind proposed in the amendment, although he showed a certain lack of enthusiasm for the amendment.  It is, I think, relevant to refer to British legislation here, as Deputy Ryan said, because while the fact that the British made such a provision does not mean that it is necessarily a good thing to do &mdash;it is a matter for us to decide and we have to make up our own minds and make our own case&mdash;the fact that they have been able to do it, and that this is apparently comparable with the requirements of Community membership does, I think, largely estop the Minister from arguing that we cannot do what we propose to do in those parts of this amendment which are consonant with and in line with British legislation.</P>
      <P>From what I have heard of the debate it seems to me that a serious case has been made on each of the points made in the amendment, a case which the Minister, from the part I heard of his speech, did not seek completely to rebut.  The feasibility of doing something along these lines, even if it may be necessary to vary slightly the wording in this amendment, is demonstrated by the fact that much of what is in this amendment is, in fact, the British legislation.  It seems to me we have, therefore, reached the point at which we can reasonably ask the Minister to consider what has been said in this debate between now and the Report Stage and to come back to us with an amendment to meet the case made. I think it is a reasonable case and one which is capable of being met by an amendment, though some change may be required in the form of the amendment before the House. I would, therefore, ask him to consider our proposals, to consider the discussion that has taken place in the House and the views that were expressed here and to come back with some proposal on the Report Stage to meet those views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was saying when Deputy FitzGerald came in was that during the referendum people expressed anxieties about the range of powers given to us by the public to change the Constitution.  I have never believed and neither do I believe now that the Minister will have power to change Articles 40, 41, 42, 43 and so on and, in arguing these points, we have, I think, been guilty of losing sight of the actual Bill itself and what it does.  It does put an onus on the Minister of coming to the Oireachtas with legislation designed to confirm orders he thinks necessary and every order made by the Minister will lapse unless it is confirmed by legislation here.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, this will have two effects&mdash;not alone the total effect of the order lapsing but it is bound to affect the preparation of regulations if these regulations have to be made the subject of confirmatory legislation. For that reason I and the Government believe that section 4, which makes provision for that, gives a great deal more watchdog power to the Dáil than any other procedure.  To accept all these limitations without, as Deputy Cruise-O'Brien said, experience of how it will work would be to do away with the principle in the Bill of the Minister being able to take quick action to implement acts of the institutions of the Community which it will be to our benefit to implement and afterwards to have the Dáil and Seanad, the Oireachtas, confirm them by law. This is fundamental in the Bill.  If I accept this amendment that fundamental is gone and we will have no experience of it.  It seems to me to be a good idea to have this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are facing a new situation in which we shall require to be able to fulfil our obligations under the act of accession to the treaties.  Most of the time we shall be expected to react quickly and implement in our domestic legislation directives of the Communities. It appears to me only prudent to make it possible to do this and afterwards have the legislation in the Dáil, which if it is not successful would mean that the regulations would lapse. That is a very powerful control by the Dáil while at the same time allowing <Col N="1177" /> full freedom for us as a State to fulfil the obligations which we have undertaken in the act of accession.</P>
    <P>I did accept an idea from Deputy Tully &mdash;and it was a worry to me&mdash; that making the confirmatory legislation come in at the end of the following year could mean quite a long period in which something would be in force, and I have undertaken to see if we can draft a way in which this can be done every six months.  So that, as of now, we could envisage a Minister making a regulation for which he would have to get confirmation from the Dáil in six months' time. The power to do so is given to him so that the country can benefit from quickly implementing directives of the Communities and the care to make sure he does not use unnecessary power because the Dáil can take the power away and have regulations lapsed and so cease to exist.  We should give it a chance to work that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be clear on this.  I understand from what the Minister says that if the Minister makes a regulation as it stands now it must be brought within 12 months before the Dáil for confirmation. I gather that the Minister is prepared to reduce this to three months.  If these regulations are not passed by the Dáil they will be rescinded. Am I right?</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any reason the draft should not come to the Dáil before the regulation is made?  That seems to be the normal procedure generally in legislation, or with regulations.  That seems to be the simple point at issue and I think the amendment endeavours to secure that.  This would provide a greater safeguard.  If a regulation is brought to the Dáil what will be presented is a <i>fait accompli</i>.  The regulation is there for three months or six months.  The Minister says three months but if we happen to be in Recess it might be six months.  Why not reverse the procedure and surely this would satisfy <Col N="1178" /> the proposers of the amendment?  It would also be a more democratic way of proceeding.  Can the Minister give any real reason why we should not do this.</P>

      <P>The Minister is harping on the retrospective power of the Dáil to intervene by way of a debate six months&mdash;or whatever the period is&mdash;afterwards is rather missing the point.  Earlier in the debate I think he accepted that some of the decisions, recommendations, directives and so on of the Community would best be implemented here by way of legislation but most of them in practice, because of the matters of detail involved, would best be implemented by way of regulation.  Already, we have a division here between the different types of Community decisions requiring different kinds of action in this House.  We have been concerned with how we might segregate the two so as to ensure that all the matters that are proper for the House to discuss by way of legislation would come to us in that way.  Part of our discussion related to having a committee in regard to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned in this amendment that, given that we have not, in fact, got any method so far in the amendments by which the House or a committee of the House can ensure that matters which ought to be considered by the Dáil come to the Dáil, we can at least, as the amendment proposes, take certain types of legislation, which of their nature are unsuitable to be <Col N="1179" /> dealt with by regulation and which should not even be considered without coming to the Dáil and exempt them and say to the Minister: &ldquo;We have not so far succeeded in tying you down as to precisely what should be done by way of legislation and what should be done by regulation; we cannot lay down a general and absolute criterion with which you can check each time and decide what to do but what we can do is leave you, in the absence of any adequate parliamentary procedure, general discretion in the matter which will enable you in the vast majority of instances to proceed by regulation.  But we are saying that there are certain things which are so serious that we could not contemplate their being dealt with by way of regulation even if the Dáil has the power to come back six months later and annul them.  We are listing the things which we think fall into that category&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are asking the Minister: &ldquo;Are we reasonable in that?&rdquo; Is it reasonable to say that taxation should not be imposed in any circumstances but that if and when&mdash;it only happens very occasionally&mdash;the Community issues a directive or decision requiring legislation on our part which involves an increase in taxation here, then on those fairly rare occasions these matters must come to the House and that in accordance with general principles of government, to which there are few exceptions &mdash;some, but few&mdash;we would wish to have a voice in this.  We have made some exceptions because, for instance, customs duties are imposed by the Government and then dealt with by confirmatory order.  Those exceptions relate to customs duties which are decided by an Irish Government in the particular interests of Ireland, but here we are talking of taxation being imposed in the interests of the Community as a whole.  We think when taxation of that kind is involved it is a matter for the House to consider and not an appropriate matter for delegated legislation.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister: &ldquo;Is that a reasonable proposition?&rdquo; I accept that these things could be annulled by the Dáil refusing to confirm orders some <Col N="1180" /> months later; we know that and it is a possible, but not in our view, an adequate way of dealing with the vast bulk of regulations.  We would prefer that the House would have a chance to deal with them, if it sought to do so, at the very time.  We want to segregate those things for which that method is inappropriate.  Therefore, for the Minister to continue referring to the availability of this power of the Dáil to annul things afterwards is to miss the entire point of the argument.  That is all right as a general procedure.</P>
    <P>What the Minister could argue if he wished to do so&mdash;he has not done so&mdash;is that in the particular instances we raise the matters are of such little importance that they could be dealt with by regulation.  I have been trying several times to help the Minister to put the case in a sufficiently cogent way that we could possibly consider it: that is sometimes the job of the Opposition.  The Minister has not come back to say to us: &ldquo;We have this six months' power and I think that in these instances here that is adequate because I think it is all right to impose increased taxation by way of regulation and leave it to the Dáil six months afterwards.&rdquo;  Or: &ldquo;I think it is all right for the Minister for Justice to move by way of regulation and come back to the Dáil six months afterwards.&rdquo;  If the Minister tried to make those propositions we would consider them but the truth is that the Minister knows that the propositions concerned are ones that he could not make in a number of instances here with any conviction.  He is therefore avoiding the argument.  I found it frustrating in part of this debate that the Minister does not confront the arguments; he sidesteps them.  This is frustrating to those who are trying to argue in a sensible way.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to stand up and tell the House now whether he thinks, naming each of these items, that it is correct that he should have the power to deal with them by way of regulation and that the Dáil can do nothing about it for six months later. Does he really believe that?  I do not think he does believe it in respect of some of these items.  I believe he <Col N="1181" /> is dodging saying this because he himself has doubts.  If so, he shares our doubts.  Then let us together compile a list of those things which because of their very nature are so serious that in all circumstances they must be dealt with by way of legislation and in no circumstances should be dealt with by way of regulation even with the Dáil power to confirm the matter six months later.</P>
    <P>Do not let us dodge the issue now by talking vaguely about the Dáil's power.  Let us deal with each of these individual items.  If the Minister thinks it is perfectly all right for him to make regulations to administer justice in the Dáil and we can deal with them only six months after the system of justice may have administered many injustices, let him say so, but if he does not say so and is not even prepared to argue the case for opposing the amendment, he ought at least to be willing to go away and consider it.  We do not ask him to accept it necessarily at this moment. If he is willing to say that he sees justice in what we say, that there is a point in regard to some of the issues, that he is doubtful about others, that he will consider the matter and come back with an amendment on Report Stage, we will be happy to let the matter rest at that. If he is not prepared to do that, not prepared to give reasons for not accepting our proposition, not prepared to argue his case, even, at that stage, we have no alternative but to press the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to support the appeal just made to the Minister by Deputy Garret FitzGerald. I speak, of course, on behalf of a party which opposed entry on the terms proposed by the Government but we, like everybody else here, are bound by the decision of the electorate which was absolutely clear, to go in to Europe.  But, we think the fact that the electorate did take that decision, the fact that a direct decision of the people is governing all our proceedings here, does impose on us all, and we are conscious of this, a duty to treat this whole matter a little bit outside the regular confrontation process <Col N="1182" /> in which we have a &ldquo;go&rdquo; at each other from one side of the House to the other.  We know, as we do not know on many other things, what the general will of the electorate is on this matter.  We realise that this imposes certain restraints on the Opposition but we suggest that it ought to impose certain restraints on the Government also, that they ought not to say: &ldquo;We know best.  That is it.  We have decided that these amendments would restrict the powers we are seeking and therefore we are not going to accept them&rdquo;.  So, I hope the Minister will not flatly say that he rejects these amendments.  We hope that he will be able to say: &ldquo;The wording is not what we would like but the arguments put forward here have some merit and we will do our level best to enshrine as much as we can of that in amendments of our own&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In one or two things that the Minister said he seemed to hold out hope of that.  In referring to subsection (v) of amendment No. 9 he seemed to suggest that they could rule out at any rate the creation of any new indictable offence under this.  That is the kind of point that can come out of this debate.</P>
      <P>I am not really responsible on the Labour side to argue particularly in favour of what has been so well argued for on the Fine Gael side on the Fine Gael amendments but surely the basic principles in almost all of these must be unexceptionable.  Surely it ought to be possible to fit them in in words that are acceptable to the Government. I hope very much that the Government will be able to do that so that this very important measure will go through the House with the degree of consensus that it is clear the electorate would expect from us on this issue and not just dealt with as a contentious matter, that the Government have the majority, they override the Opposition, that is it.  If that is the spirit in which we go into Europe, it does not bode very well for us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making a polemical point against the Minister because I think the Minister would like to deal with <Col N="1183" /> it, in this way and I imagine he will make an effort to meet us here.  And when I say that, of course, it is appropriate that I should acknowledge, and acknowledge again, the degree to which the Minister has in fact met some of the points we raised.  We would not underestimate the concession made by the Minister when, in deference to a point made by Deputy Tully on behalf of the Labour Party, he agreed to the six months period of review.  That is very important.  It is an example of the value of parliamentary review and particularly committee review of this kind of thing.  Something important is achieved there&mdash;a greater degree of democratic control over this process.</P>
    <P>I would like to put this point to the Minister again, that this six-monthly exercise should not be limited to, &ldquo;Let us have a look at the regulations that have gone through and let us see whether we approve them or not&rdquo; and a limited short debate on that.  The Minister has already in part replied on this but I want him and his colleagues to keep on considering it. I hope that the debate would be one for which considerable time, adequate time, would be provided, not only for the not inconsiderable task of reviewing regulations already there but for having a look at how the whole process works, having a look back at how well-founded the criticisms and objections that have been raised here have, in fact, proved to be and how well the Act which we shall by that time have passed on the basis of this document as amended, has worked, and that there will be an opportunity not only for review of the regulations passed but for review of the working of the Bill as a whole.  That is to say, that the Government will allow the possibility of amendments to the Act. If we can have assurances on that at some stage&mdash;I think the Minister has indicated that he is not yet fully ready to give such assurances at this stage of the debate&mdash;but if he can tell us that he will come back to that on Report Stage, that he is ready at least to look now with an open mind at how far he can meet us on these amendments and on this point, it will be very helpful, not only to the House <Col N="1184" /> at this stage of this discussion but also to the spirit in which the Irish people are entering the European Communities.</P>

      <P>Deputy FitzGerald said that I was side-stepping.  In fact, I dealt with this point when he was not here.  The fact of his not being here does not mean that I was side-stepping. I will do it again, if it will do any good.</P>
      <P>First of all, I should like to go back to the principle of the Bill being to make it possible for us to fulfil our obligations with the speed that is necessary.  The House may not be aware of the difficulties which will be ahead for the structures of the State to fit it.  After a while in the European Communities, we may find the pace would become more leisurely; we will get used to it; but, it will be necessary to be able to have decisions taken quickly and applied, just as I accept it is necessary to have the Parliament make sure that Ministers do not take too wide powers.  The House will have to acknowledge that it will be necessary and the method we have suggested for that is that the Minister would make the regulation, that the regulation would die if Parliament does not confirm it.  It is not quite accurate to say, as Deputy FitzGerald said, that it is retrospective legislation, because it is dealing with regulations or Acts which may continue in effect if they are confirmed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the Deputy knows that.  The amendment suggests taking from the Minister the power to impose or increase taxation. Taking account of the limited area of directives from Europe and, at the same time, the existence of the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957 this is not consistent.  It may be necessary for a Minister to be able to do that and afterwards come to the Dáil for confirmation. That is quite an adequate protection.  I was puzzled about, &ldquo;(ii) to administer justice&rdquo; because I see no situation where a Minister would <Col N="1185" /> make regulations to administer justice. I do not think that arises.  Paragraph (ii) reads: &ldquo;to declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.&rdquo; That does not arise either. That is the position and we do not have to state it in the Bill.  It will continue to be the position in our Constitution and in the European conventions.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (iv) reads: &ldquo;to make any provision taking effect from a date earlier than that of the making of the instrument containing the provision&rdquo;. This is necessary.  The Community have yet to decide what instrument they will use.  They have made a decision which is retrospective.  If they have any directives with retrospective effect we should be able to fit in with them.  With regard to (v), &ldquo;to create any new criminal offence&rdquo;, I said I could personally see the desirability of limiting this to an indictable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think ours is a better Bill.  I was dealing with creating a new criminal offence.  This might have a limitation.  It would not be possible for a Minister to create a new indictable offence and that would limit it to the level of a District Court offence and put limits on the penalties.  I do not think paragraph (vi) is necessary. There is nothing in our thinking which would make it necessary to prevent the Minister having powers under Articles 41 to 44.  If there were, we have the protection of legislation six months afterwards.  The important thing is that this legislation will be coming up in the Dáil and the Dáil will be able to say: &ldquo;No.  This cannot survive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have a Bill here based on power for the Minister to act quickly with confirmation from the Dáil, and without that confirmation the regulations would lapse.  It meets the two points: the need for a capacity to fulfil our obligations and the watchdog of Parliament to make sure that powers are not abused.</P>

If he had seen their legislation would it not have been a guideline for him, and we could then base our legislation on the most liberal points in that legislation.  To me this would have been a commonsense procedure. If I had been more intimately acquainted with the Minister I would have whispered that advice into his ear before tonight so that he could have had the information readily available in the event of questions being put by Deputy Esmonde and other Deputies who are entitled to query the Minister about the legislation prevailing in other countries, and how it is working.

What we want to do by our amendment No. 8, which sets out that the power conferred in the foregoing subsection shall not include power to repeal or amend any part of the domestic law of the State, is to ensure that the domestic law may not be interfered with by a direction which the Minister may say he has got from the EEC.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, line 20, to delete &ldquo;proper&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to tighten up the Bill in the same way as Fine Gael's proposal tidied up the Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill which was voted on by the people. The Third Amendment to the Constitution Bill as introduced provided that no provision of the Constitution could invalidate laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities. In the Dáil the Fine Gael Party amended that Bill by providing that the words &ldquo;consequent on&rdquo; should be omitted and should be replaced by the words &ldquo;necessitated by the obligations of&rdquo;.  The purpose of our amendment, which the Government accepted, was to ensure that nothing would be done as a consequence of the extra power given in the amendment which would not be necessitated by the obligations of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the Government are asking the House to give to the Minister power to make regulations which may contain such incidental, supplementary and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister making the regulations to be proper for the purposes of the regulations.  We do not think the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; is sufficiently tight to ensure that the Minister does not use the power now given to him to make regulations which are beyond what is required by the obligations of the European Communities. What may appear proper to the Minister may not be necessary and I think the Minister would agree with me on that point.  The Minister might have a different measure of propriety to what might be absolutely required by the European Communities.  The whole purpose of the power being given here is to enable this State to implement the obligations of the Communities and no more.  We should not give in section 3 any power to a Minister to exceed the purpose of this legislation.  The sole purpose of the legislation is to enable the State to comply with the obligations of the Communities&mdash;that and no more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> The draft regulations might be convenient from the administrative point of view but this House and the people are not concerned with administrative convenience.  We are concerned with what power we give to Ministers and the purposes for which they are given that power and the way they use it. Our amendment complies with our obligations and does not in any way inhibit a Minister from discharging his obligations to the Dáil, to the people and to the Community.  I hope the Minister will accept this reasonable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference in the words may not be very great but I should like the Minister to explain why the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo; was used instead of &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;.  It is possible the Minister might consider something was proper but might not be necessary.  Before we debate the amendment, I should like to hear the Minister's explanation why this word was used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the draftsman's phraseology for what the Minister would consider proper to do to implement our obligations under the Act of Accession.  Perhaps the House would prefer that it should read &ldquo;as it appears to the Minister to be necessary&rdquo; instead of using the word &ldquo;proper&rdquo;?  So long as the Minister maintains the power that is all right.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 3, as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want to say in relation to section 3, as it now stands, is that I think it is absolutely pitiful and disgraceful that Dáil Éireann has not got the guts to do what the German Bundestag, the Dutch Parliament and the British Parliament have done and that is to put some curb upon ministerial power to make regulations to comply with European Communities obligations.  Why should we, with the aid of the Fianna Fáil Party, have belittled ourselves as a Parliament? It is thoroughly disgraceful and is clearly indicative of the contempt that Fianna Fáil have for the wishes of the people and for the wishes of the people's representatives.  They want to rule absolutely, to be absolute rulers without any review, not even the benefit of comment by the elected representatives of the people.  It is thoroughly contemptible and Dáil Éireann, I believe, will live to regret this day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil will have to confirm regulations and that is a review and the regulations will lapse if the Dáil does not confirm them. The Deputy should be aware also that it is to Ministers and the Dáil that power is given and not to any political party.  His own thinking on the future of the country is obvious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to what the Minister has said he is wrong. The decision tonight was taken with the votes of the Fianna Fáil Party and nobody else.  It is they who believe that the Government have an absolute right to rule without regard to the wishes of anybody else in the community.  The German Bundestag, the Dutch Parliament and the British Parliament have decided that the powers now conferred on Ministers here by the Fianna Fáil majority should not be given to any Government but should lie with Parliament. That is the difference and the Minister cannot escape from that.  He has shown Fianna Fáil's contempt for the whole parliamentary and democratic process.  It is no use to say that six months after the event we can come along and try to change taxation, criminal law and other fundamental matters.  That is no remedy.  The damage is then done.  What we sought was a right of trying to colour, influence, advise, beforehand.  You have denied us that.  You have now rendered Dáil Éireann impotent and sterile. That was your wish and you now have your wish.  I hope you are thoroughly ashamed of yourselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Any regulation made by a Minister will lapse if not confirmed by Dáil Éireann.  Even after the whole day the Deputy does not seem to know what we are doing.  It is not fair of him to say what he has said about the Dáil.  He must accept majority rule.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard what the Minister is hoping to do between now and the Report Stage but even six months criminal law, six months taxation will <Col N="1199" /> operate.  Why, if the Minister says it is valid to do it after the event, will he not allow the Dáil to be consulted beforehand?  He has shown he does not want to consult the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>If a majority of the Dáil, which is what counts, want to, they can, immediately a regulation is made, introduce private legislation to overthrow it, at once.  What we have done here is bring in effective law that makes it possible for us to take on our obligations satisfactorily and quickly and at the same time give the Dáil its right to confirm if such regulations are to be continued.</P>

      <P>I asked a question before and I got no answer. If three other Parliaments, the Dutch Parliament, the German Parliament, and now the British Parliament, are legislating to do it, can allow the matter to be discussed before it is made a regulation or an act in the EEC, why can we not do the same?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 3, line 36, to delete &ldquo;a majority&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;one-third&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I must frankly admit that there is some confusion about the import of section 4.  On first reading it would appear that the purpose of recalling the Dáil would be to review what the Government have already done but on a closer reading it would appear that, in fact, if the Dáil is not recalled, what the Government have done would collapse if they did not get the benediction of the authority of the Dáil to continue what they had done.  I would like the Minister to clarify any confusion which might exist before we press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think perhaps we were too solicitious for the Government's welfare in putting down this amendment. To me it reads if the section as it stands is allowed to stand it will require a majority of the Dáil to recall it. I do not know why it was put down in this way.  I have been reading it the same way as Deputy Ryan has.  If the regulation lapses, not being moved within the statutory period, then it is the Government's responsibility to see it does not lapse if they want to continue it.  If there is another interpretation of it as Deputy Ryan says, perhaps the Minister might explain it to us as otherwise we will leave them to look after that part of the business themselves and withdraw our amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, a regulation made by a Minister will lapse if not confirmed at a time fixed by the Oireachtas.  We have in mind <Col N="1201" /> here the other procedures which Deputies would like to avail of when a regulation is first published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Such as parliamentary questions, motions, private motions, motions on the Adjournment, or legislation, as I mentioned.  If the Dáil is adjourned these would not be available to Deputies.  I do not think they would lapse in the ten days mentioned.  They would not lapse until the failure to confirm by legislation six months afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more confused than ever because if it had been as originally intended, in operation up to two years, surely ample opportunity should have been given to ask the questions, put down the motions or use whatever facilities were available.  Again, I think that possibly we have misinterpreted but the Minister's explanation has not made it any clearer to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy thought that at the end of the period if the Dáil were not in session it would lapse.  It was not the intention.  The intention was that if Deputies wanted to use the normal process available to talk on the matter, to oppose it by motion, private motion, motions on the Adjournment or by legislation if the Dáil were not in session this would not be open to them.</P>

      <P>Section 4 agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>Before section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The enactments mentioned in the Schedule to this Act (being enactments that are superseded or to be superseded by reason of the European Communities' obligations and of the provision made by this Act in relation thereto or which are not compatible with the European Communities' obligations) are hereby repealed or amended, as the case may be, to the extent specified in the said Schedule with effect from the 1st day of January, 1973&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill is evidence of a thoroughly disgraceful situation.  On the 10th May last the people very emphatically authorised this country to join the European Community.  One would have thought that even before then the Government and the Government's legal advisers would have had available to them and be able to present to the people a clear statement of the domestic laws of this country which would be qualified or affected by Acts of the European Community.  If they did not have it on the 10th May last it was perfectly reasonable to assume that between 10th May and the 8th November following there would have been prepared a comprehensive list of the laws of this State which would stand amended, qualified or abrograted by European Community legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We find, to our absolute horror, this Bill does not contain any schedule of legislation to be amended.  There is in the explanatory memorandum an appendix which is described as: &ldquo;A list of existing Irish legislation which will be affected by Community law&rdquo;. This spells out 100, and possibly more, Acts because some of the Acts are described under inclusive and omnibus <Col N="1203" /> clauses like the Enforcement of Court Orders Acts 1926 and 1940 and other Acts like the Courts of Justice Acts 1924 to 1961 which, to my knowledge, include no less than five Acts, so the number of Acts which will be specifically, directly and immediately qualified on the 1st January, 1973, exceeds 100.  Even this appendix to the explanatory memorandum does not state in any respect to what extent the Acts in question stand repealed or amended.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful situation and one to which the Incorporated Law Society have had to draw attention. Everybody is, under our legal system, presumed to know the law.  Now we have for the first time on the statutes of this country legislative proof that the Government of the day do not know the law.  The Government cannot even produce evidence of the law in an explanatory memorandum to a Bill.  They do not know and are not capable of stating or setting out even in the explanatory memorandum the extent to which the existing domestic law of this State is being qualified by Community legislation.  They have a caviat in the appendix which reads:</P>
    <P>This list sets out the principle enactments which will be affected. The list is comprehensive but does not purport to be exhaustive.</P>
    <P>On a personal level the Minister has become immunised against criticism. He is off to Brussels next year and good luck to him but I have worries regarding the part that he will play for this country there since we find that he is leaving behind this nebulous piece of legislation which cannot even set out in Schedules to the Act the laws of this country that are to be amended.  I would ask Members to cast their minds back to other pieces of legislation during the years and they will recall Schedules to many Acts which contain the Titles of Acts to be amended.  Not only that but the amending Acts specified precisely, line by line, what parts of the former Acts were to be amended or repealed, but here we are with the most far-reaching piece of legislation in our history and we have not got in it a Schedule with a guideline as to what pieces of legislation being amended.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> I abhor that any Minister would think so little of the whole parliamentary process as to produce such a careless piece of legislation.  Even a first year law student would know enough about the legislative process not to produce anything so ridiculous as this Bill.  What is the Minister doing?  He is bringing in this piece of legislation to make sweeping amendments to the whole law of Ireland and his attitude is &ldquo;to hell with you if you do not know the consequences of the legislation.  It is your business to find out&rdquo;.  The Department of Foreign Affairs do not know the consequences, neither do the Department of Justice nor the office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the referendum many people did not wish to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department cannot produce a guide as to the precise consequences of the legislation.  In relation to Deputy Corish's intervention, it is one matter to know the general consequences of a decision but&mdash;I speak now with my legal hat on&mdash;it is another to know what advice one can give to a client when consulted on a particular matter when there is no piece of legislative evidence in existence having the extent of repeals of former legislation.  This is an atrocious position.  Already the Incorporated Law Society have made the most urgent representations possible to the Government but despite that we get nothing but this clumsy, careless and infantile piece of legislation. Earlier when I suggested that the Government were being contemptuous of Parliament, the Minister took umbrage at my remark.  He can carry that umbrage or shrug it off as he wishes but it is absolute proof of their contempt and of their unfitness to govern that they will not tell the people what they are trying to do to them.  This is because they do not care about the whole legal and legislative process.  They do not care what consequences or penalties may fall on people or what confusion may be caused.  So far as the Government are concerned that is somebody else's problem and so the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice, the Minister <Col N="1205" /> for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Finance say: &ldquo;we will not tell you the law; you can find out for yourselves&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It may well be that there will be a very lucrative world ahead for the legal profession.  I do not think that is the intention of the Government but it is the situation they are creating today.  While they are creating a whirlwind of profit for the legal profession they will impose on Irish people and Irish business an immense burden of trying to ascertain what is the law.  This results from the Government being too lazy and too indifferent to spell it out in the Bill.  It is because we are anxious that even at this 11th hour the Government will write into the Bill the extent to which our law is being amended, that we have put down this amendment. For the third time today I find myself saying to the Minister that I am no apologist for the British legislature or for any other legislature but the British Parliament found it possible to spell out the extent to which their laws, which are more ancient than ours, are being amended by the European Communities.  They are spelled out in Schedules and appendices to the Bill.  We have a legislative history of only 51 years and we have been too lazy and too indifferent to do the same.</P>
      <P>I am appalled at the Minister, and my respect for him evaporates when I see him producing such a contemptible Bill, a Bill that is so unhelpful to the people he will leave behind when he goes to Brussels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very unfair to lay this burden completely on the shoulders of the Minister.  The Government are responsible for certain matters and it is they, as a whole, who must carry responsibility for this proposed legislation.  Each Minister in his own Department should have been responsible for preparing the necessary documentation.  Deputy Ryan said that the Minister was contemptuous of the House in producing the Bill.  The Minister knew what he was doing.  In a short while the Committee Stage will have been completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> Deputy Ryan referred also to the question of what advice could be given to clients in respect of amended legislation. Let me remind the House that before the referendum all politicians were advising the electorate but we in the Labour Party were the only people who gave the correct advice.  There were a couple of exceptions in other parties but they merely whispered the correct advice.  The proof of the pudding is in the eating and we are now saddled with something which, apparently, we must accept.  It may be said that there was not time to compile the comprehensive information to which the Deputy has referred.  I shudder to think of what will happen on the 1st January next when there will be a whole new set of laws and, I assume, a whole new set of offences.  If we do not know what is the law, how is it to be administered?</P>
    <P>It may be said also that there were no facilities available to have certain things done.  I do not wish to repeat this too often but I would remind the House that an English translation of documentation from the EEC up to the 1st January last is in the Library and up to the present it is available in French.  It has not been found possible to translate the latter yet.  Yet it is found possible to delegate at least one civil servant to the task of translating the English text into Irish.  This has been done.  I do not know who will study it.  Earlier Deputy Flanagan was defending the rights of Irish speakers to have this documentation and the rights of Irish speakers in this House to know what was going on, but we have not been able to get documentation to show what will be the effect of the legislation we are passing through the House.  This is disgraceful.  I will not blame the Minister although he must share some of the responsibility since he has had to pilot this Bill through the House.  Neither will I blame the parliamentary draftsmen because they work only on what they are given from the Government.  Therefore, the entire Government must carry the responsibility for what has been done here.</P>
    <P>It appears that what has happened is that the Government, having got the referendum through with such a huge majority, were so tickled that they consider <Col N="1207" /> it hardly necessary to do anything more.  Maybe they prayed to St. Anthony but, in any case, I do not know how they hope to get out of this mess.  The amendments suggested here by Fine Gael would, perhaps bring matters up to date even at this late hour.  Will the Minister tell us if it is possible to have the information before the 31st December?  The Minister may say that a number of us might not understand the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have got Consolidation Bills in this House with tabulated amendments to various legislation, dating away back over 150 years, all listed neatly. They might not mean very much to me unless I was interested in one particular section and went to the trouble of researching on it, but to the legal people who will have to administer this after 1st January it must mean something.</P>
    <P>The attempt to put this sort of thing through the House without going to the trouble of showing what is being changed and how it is being changed is nothing short of disgraceful.  It is a typical example of what this Government have been doing with practically everything they have handled over the past few years.  They may have had, like the rest of us, their little internal squabbles but, over the last 12 months, they should have been in a position to find out what was being done.  Surely since last May they should have been able to tabulate the changes which have to be made in legislation in order to comply with EEC conditions.</P>
    <P>I am certainly not blaming the Minister for this.  I wish him very well in his new office.  I do not agree with what the Minister has been doing but I know he has been doing a tremendous amount of work in the EEC and has gone to a lot of trouble.  However, those who with him have the responsibility of governing this country must accept the blame for not doing their homework and for not having ready for the House, before this Bill came in, the necessary tabulation.</P>

      <P>Where a provision of existing domestic law is in conflict with a provision of directly applicable Community law, the domestic law will be <Col N="1208" /> automatically amended or repealed to the extent to which the conflict exists. That is in accordance with the rules of our domestic law on conflicting legislative provisions.  It is, therefore, not necessary to amend or repeal individual provisions specifically.  The Deputy knows the principle of implied repeal.  If you wanted to do it it would require a call on our manpower at this time that we should not devote to that work because they are at much more important work on membership.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one.  The point remains that the law is, by the principle we practice of implied repeal, amended or repealed to the extent of the conflict.  We have published here a list for the guidance of the public to make them aware what provisions in our domestic law are likely to be affected, as being in conflict with the Community law.  That is a guideline for them or their lawyers when they are dealing with something affected by the law, to know that there is a Community regulation which repeals this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned that the British made a list.  It is not exhaustive. If we took the list and repealed it or amended it as necessary it would not be exhaustive and it would lead to confusion, because there is an area <Col N="1209" /> then not indicated to the public.  It is not just for now; as we go on into the future new regulations applied here by the Community will have this effect.  The only way we can really catch up with it is to give guidelines to lawyers to watch out for it and read the law, get interpretations from the courts and, as the Taoiseach said when introducing this Bill, to have frequent revision Acts for the specific purpose of dealing with points to be amended or repealed, and this will be done.</P>

      <P>When the original Act was going through the House I protested strongly at the terms in which it was drafted.  As legislators we do not have to put up with this kind of thing.  We do not have to put up with the Government standing on the right foot yesterday in relation to the Marriages Bill and on the left foot today. Yesterday they were going to itemise everything in detail.  They were going to repeal a simple provision that marriages could be conducted in a registry office only between the hours of 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. so that the hours would be between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. That was repeated over and over again to the extent of a full page in the Marriages Bill yesterday.  No Government can do that kind of thing to me anyway.  If I am sufficiently concerned I will tackle them.  My own attitude towards this Bill is quite simple.  I believe that the original Bill that was produced in relation to our going into the Common Market was wrongly drafted and I said so.</P>

Even the Parliamentary Secretary agrees with me.</P>

      <P>In this House there is the tenth hour and the eleventh hour. There is this kind of suggestion that where there is a conflict, and I took down the Minister's actual words, the domestic law will be automatically repealed.  All that was required yesterday in the Marriage Bill was that this matter should have been referred to once, that the words 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. were to be replaced by the words 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. &mdash; period.  That was sufficient.  But it was repeated over and over again in section 16 of the Marriage Bill.  Now, we cannot have this global kind of legislation because the Department of Foreign Affairs is such a big place and so important that they can do what they bloody well like and the rest of us are to say nothing.  We are not fit.  I remember when the Minister would not answer me when I asked a most straightforward question about the extent to which the Germans had broken our bilateral trade agreement. I remember when it was rigged around the bloody House, &ldquo;goodo,&rdquo; that these questions would not be answered on the grounds, from the Ceann Comhairle, and he had it all prepared when I raised it with him&mdash;</P>

Eventually I went into the public office and said: &ldquo;Look, do you know what I want to ask?  You fix the questions.&rdquo; And they fixed the questions. But were they allowed then?  They were not and I will tell you why: it was because the Minister's dirty Department <Col N="1211" /> was interfering with the workings of this House in the filthiest fashion.</P>

      <P>All right.  On the Final Stage I will have a few words to say about it and I will say them with emphasis.  I am now dealing with the Minister's reply.  He said: &ldquo;We have published a list.&rdquo;  What was in this <Col N="1213" /> list?  What was in this list was just the minimum of words.  There was no worthwhile information at all, but there were 1,300 amendments of law, or something like that, amendments of directives, or whatever they are, or Acts.  There were 1,300 of them and the Minister said: &ldquo;We have published a list.&rdquo;  What use is this list to anybody? Here it is.  It is a massive document. This is the list in my hand.</P>

I do not approve of this method of legislating. I should like to know does Deputy de Valera approve of it either.  Does Deputy de Valera approve of this kind of thing?  Does he stand over what he said yesterday&mdash;that we are giving away none of our sovereignty in this whole situation?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will remember what I said when he made that remark yesterday.  We will leave <Col N="1215" /> it at that.  The Minister then said in his reply that the lawyers are put on their track.  What use is that to the ordinary citizens, that the lawyers are put on their track?  As Deputy Ryan said, it will create a bonanza for the lawyers.  He is right, of course.  This section will create a superbonanza for the lawyers.</P>
      <P>Finally, the Minister said that, if we did it in the same way as the British Parliament had done it, it would lead to confusion.  This is what the Minister said as I took it down.  I hope I did not misinterpret it.  In fact, if we approached this matter as the British did it might have created a lot more work, but a custom has gradually grown into our legislation of doing things in a slick manner and you provide that the Minister may by order do this, that and the other thing. There is no detail of what he may do. It amounts to saying that the Minister may do anything he likes to ensure that an Act is operated as he wants to operate it.  I am talking of ordinary legislation.  This has led gradually to this situation where we are presented, in probably the most important piece of legislation we ever had in this House since the legislation bringing the treaty between Great Britain and Ireland into operation, with generalised statements which, as law, are worthless.  No lawyer will accept them.  Therefore, I think Deputy Ryan is quite right to put down this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope so.  My contribution, I trust, will be brief and to the point.  The blame here lies on the Minister and on the Government fairly and squarely.  It is up to them to get from the civil servants the work they require and by now they should have required a detailed, comprehensive, exhaustive list of our own legislation which is being amended by the obligations of the European Communities. That is the absolute truth. I think the reality is that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, off to Brussels, could not care less what is left behind. The Government could not care less. Fianna Fáil have never shown much respect for legal obligations.  It has often been said that there are Members of the Opposition here who have made immense profits out of legal cases. Shame on the Government that have made this possible.  It was not possible when Governments were concerned about legal obligations.  Now they are not.  I believe profit will be made by the legal profession because of the <Col N="1217" /> mess and uncertainly left behind but losses will be caused to insurance companies which insure lawyers against what is called negligence, that is, failure to give clients correct advice.</P>
      <P>I do not believe there is in Dublin today a lawyer who could give to his client correct advice on what Ireland's domestic law will be from 1st January 1973.  There is no one library in Dublin&mdash;in fact, not all the libraries in Dublin&mdash;which can provide the total law of the European Community. The Incorporated Law Society have pointed out to the Government that the initial cost of providing in Dublin one reference library for the European Community would be £13,000 and that the cost of providing the annual increase in documentation would be £1,800.  The legal profession have not at present available the income to provide for that.  They have asked the Government to provide that library for the public.  I quote from the annual report of the Incorporated Law Society published yesterday.  They have made urgent representations to the Department of Justice and the Attorney General's Department that the Government should publish a guide to legislation which will become spent or obsolete following accession to the European Community because they regard that as the minimum essential to giving clients adequate legal advice.</P>
      <P>They have not got this from the Government.  It is not in the Bill and is nowhere available.  It is a thorough and complete disgrace.  Deputy Dr. O'Donovan is perfectly correct in saying that yesterday we had one process of legislation which spelled out in detail down to the hours at which you could get married, precisely the way the marriage laws were being amended. Here, according to the Government's own memorandum, we have legislation extending from agricultural produce, cereals, to the production of cement, to industrial relations, to dangerous substances, to weights and measures, to the enforcement of court orders.  Yet there is no indication in this mass of domestic legislation of the extent of repeal, and that is an essential guide to the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am appalled that the Government <Col N="1218" /> should do this.  I suppose we cannot do anything at this hour of the day.  Members have been treating contributions on this section with far too much levity, but be sure that you are putting the country and the whole legal system into a thorough and complete mess.  All we can do at this stage is to protest and to vote emphatically against it.  That is why we put down this amendment and why we insist the amendment should be carried to oblige the Government to set out in the Schedule to this Act an adequate guide to what is being repealed.  It is not sufficient to say, as the Minister said, that there is a doctrine of implied repeal.  There is, but that is no use to anybody who wants to confirm with the law.  There is no reference available to them to show such people what the law is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just say that we have been here from 10.30 this morning until almost 10.30 tonight.  As the Minister is aware&mdash;I cannot repeat this often enough&mdash;I was opposed to EEC entry; I think it was a mistake, but the country decided in its favour. None of us will get any thanks if we impede the passing of this measure. It appears that the Government have made a bad mistake; they have not produced the necessary documentation, but there is nothing we can do here tonight if we talk until 12 o'clock. I think we should have this matter decided now if we are serious about it, and I suggest we do that.  I am well aware that there are people here who have very valid points to make and they are entitled to make those points, but this will not alter the fact that the legislation must go through.  Unless we are prepared to spend another day on it I suggest we should bring it to a close now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>With due respect to my senior colleague in the Labour Party, the Minister made some dirty references to me in his reply.  He spoke about &ldquo;wild remarks&rdquo;.  I do not make wild statements in this House.  It is the Minister who, when I asked reasonable questions in this House, said it was argument.  I was treated with all kinds of nonsense and it was the Minister who was responsible for that.  The <Col N="1219" /> Minister can interpret the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; any way he likes.</P>
      <P>Coming back to the amendment, we have mentioned in the explanatory memorandum under &ldquo;community provisions affecting Acts&rdquo; the Companies Act, 1963, with a note &ldquo;Provisions regarding the disclosure of accounts, etc. in certain cases.&rdquo;  What does this mean?  I do not know. Neither, I suspect, does the Minister. The Minister might explain that, for example.  To take another, The Motor Vehicles (Registration of Importers) Act, 1968.  The explanation is &ldquo;The requirement in the Accession Treaty that provision be made for the introduction of a global quota in respect of vehicles other than those covered by the existing scheme.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  Has it any meaning?  The fact is that it has no meaning.  Taken by itself it has no meaning whatever.  It is all very fine for the Minister to suggest that I cannot say things about Government Departments.  I can and will say things about Government Departments any time I like.  I want to put my interpretation of this rule about not mentioning the Civil Service. It refers to not mentioning individual civil servants.  Everybody has the right to attack Government Departments, if they feel like it, in this House, and I stand over that.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle may rule me out of order if he likes but he is quite wrong in doing that.  Every Member of this House has the right to say that a Government Department is doing wrong.  When I say the Minister's civil servants are doing it, the Minister knows what the rules of debate are, that we are supposed to refer to the Minister.  What is the difference?  We all know the meaning of it.  We are not idiots.</P>

It is all very fine to talk but if we are here as legislators we should legislate properly and we should not go in for this kind of thing of giving a clean state to the Minister and allowing the to do what he likes and allowing the Communities to do anything they like to us.  This is not done.  This was not done across the water.  The Minister can say what he likes about my remarks but unless he withdraws his statement that I made wild remarks he is not going to get this Stage of the Bill tonight.

      <P>I will come back to the amendment straightaway.  The amendment is intended to provide that there are some powers left to this House to deal with matters which are essentially the prerogative of this House.  Of course, Deputy de Valera, having said yesterday that we gave away none of our sovereignty, is dead keen that we proceed to give away more of it today.  Let me put it this way&mdash;I could not care tuppence whether we get through this Stage of the Bill tonight or not because there will be other Stages and there will be plenty of opportunity for me to talk on them but I will be back on the Minister's reference to my wild remarks and I will deal with the Minister's wild remarks as I have already dealt with them.</P>
      <P>Let me repeat one of them: &ldquo;There is a principle of implied repeal&rdquo;.  This is a principle that I never heard of before and neither did anybody else. There is no such principle and, I do not care tuppence from whom he got that advice, it is wrong.  It is completely and absolutely wrong.  The Minister can come into the House and make this kind of statement if he likes but the House does not have to accept it. &ldquo;There is a principle of implied repeal.&rdquo; Yesterday things were spelled out again and again and again on the Marriages Bill, and repeated over and over again&mdash;the same old form of words, for a whole page, and then the Minister comes in today, on a much more important Bill, and says there is a principle of implied repeal.</P>

      <Col N="1222" /> We have had altogether too much of this business of a gradual attrition of the powers of Parliament here and the more we give way the more it continues and the worse it gets.

      <P>I can be here too. I do not see any problem in it.  I am glad to see the Minister picking up his papers.  That is a sign.  I have said, and I am entitled to say it, that if the Minister talks about &ldquo;wild remarks&rdquo; when in fact what I was saying was the literal truth, the Minister will have to put up with a great deal more of this from now on.  He had to put up with some of it today.  He did not get any of it from me today but he will have a lot more of it before this Bill goes through the House.  I am not going to put up with this from anybody.</P>
