    </Speaker>
    <P>Usually, on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach the economy generally and other general matters are debated and the substance of the Taoiseach's Estimate is not usually debated to any considerable extent.  However, a feature of the Estimate this year is the subhead which relates to the Markpress contract providing for expenditure of £53,000. This sum covers both the contract fee and the expenses arising from the operation of a network service which is, at present, operating in London, Paris, Milan, Geneva, as well as the local office in Dublin.  Since the date of the initial contract eight months ago, the total amount paid out of public funds was £35,000 approximately but <Col N="1547" /> this amount does not include the backlog of sums paid by the contractor on our account and not yet recouped to him by my Department.</P>
    <P>The Markpress contract has been the subject of comment in this House on a number of occasions and one of the charges made has been that the State is not getting value for the money we spend.  Quantifying value received is always a debatable exercise but I should like to tell the House that I have recently brought together an informal committee who will give advice, assistance and guidance in relation to the operation of the contract.  The members of the committee all have experience in the information field. That is all I propose to say at this stage about the Estimate.  Naturally, I shall in my reply tomorrow deal with any points any Deputies may raise in relation to the Estimate.</P>
    <P>To proceed to the other aspects of this debate, I should first inform the House that on its adjournment at 5 p.m. tomorrow the House will rise until Wednesday, 25th October, 1972. I have already informed Members that this does not rule out the special recall of the House in the event of the Government deeming such recall necessary. I want to repeat my indication yesterday in that connection that I will remain in close contact with the Leaders of the two Opposition Parties.</P>
    <P>The session of the Dáil which is now drawing to a close has witnessed a further unfolding of those events which will decisively shape the future of this nation.  In some cases the developments have been happy and decisive, as was the endorsement by the Irish people of the decision to become a member of the European Economic Community. In others, the pattern has been one of continual change and anxiety as instanced by the troubled course of events in the North.  Whether for good or ill, and whether in a decisive or a dimly perceived manner, each area has contributed its own portion.  This is an appropriate time, therefore, to take stock of our present position and to indicate the desired course of future progress.</P>
    <P>I propose first to deal with the EEC <Col N="1548" /> question.  A year ago negotiations on entry terms were still in progress and while there was confidence that a successful outcome would emerge there were a number of major issues still to be resolved.  In the event, our confidence proved fully justified for the terms subsequently agreed can be regarded as very satisfactory.  It is not necessary to review these terms in any detail since they were fully debated and discussed in recent months but two noteworthy achievements of these negotiations may justifiably be recalled. One was the retention of the tax relief on export profits, which is a powerful incentive in the attraction of new industries to Ireland.  The second was the special protocol for Ireland which gives formal recognition to the special problems of economic development which we face and which pledges Community support for achieving our development objectives.  These special arrangements coupled with the guaranteed markets for agricultural products made available by the EEC Common Agricultural Policy provide a sound and attractive basis for the future development of both industry and agriculture.</P>
    <P>Since the negotiations themselves were solely concerned with the terms of entry, it was understandable and, perhaps, inevitable that in the national debate prior to the Referendum in May, more attention would be paid to these immediate issues rather than to the wider and longer term consequences. Nonetheless, these more general questions did receive a welcome degree of examination and discussion.</P>
    <P>The people, in recording their verdict on this question, did so after a full debate of the issues involved.  Their verdict was a decisive endorsement of the policies pursued and the attitude adopted by the Government and the major political parties.  Following the referendum the way is now clear to push ahead with the preparations for entry.  So far as the Dáil is concerned one of the first items of business in the next session will be the European Communities Bill which will give legal effect to the decision to become a member.  Work on other tasks, such as the selection of Irish personnel for the Community posts and the composition <Col N="1549" /> of the Irish delegation to the European Parliament will continue during the coming months.  In the wider political field the Council of Ministers have been holding preparatory meetings for the proposed Summit Conference of the Heads of State or Government of member and applicant countries.  It is becoming increasingly clear that decisions are required on the next phases of developing the Communities and outcome of these decisions could have important bearings on the course of our future development.</P>
    <P>One such issue which has attracted considerable comment in recent weeks is that of Economic and Monetary Union.  A timetable for achieving the first stages of such a union was agreed upon by the present member states in 1971 and was accepted by the applicant countries including Ireland.  International monetary developments over the past year have both increased the emphasis on the specifically monetary aspects of this question and have retarded the formulation of detailed proposals for implementing the plans for economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>In the monetary sphere one of the steps agreed earlier this year was that the Ten States should narrow the extent to which the rates of exchange for their currencies can fluctuate.  We supported this arrangement since, among other things, it facilitates the operation of the common agricultural policy of the Community.  However, if the Community were to achieve, in effect, a system of fixed exchange rates among themselves, then some method other than changing the exchange rate must be used to deal with any economic imbalances which may arise between the Member States.  In our view a comprehensive regional policy for the enlarged Community is an essential part of the measures necessary to deal with these economic imbalances.  There is already a wide degree of agreement on this topic among the different States, but the Community has recognised the need to remedy structural and regional imbalances as being an important objective, and the first steps in setting <Col N="1550" /> out a detailed policy for the different areas of the Community have already been taken.  It would be our desire to see further major progress in the formulation of the Community's regional policies in the coming year.  It is our belief that securing the basis for harmonious development of the less-favoured regions will enable more rapid progress to be made towards economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Apart from clarifying and strengthening its own internal economic arrangements, it will also be necessary for the enlarged Community to press ahead with the task of defining its policies and relationships with other States.  It is probable that a Summit meeting would discuss the basis on which such policies would be formulated. Among the more urgent aspects of this topic is the question of trade with the United States, since the Community is due to undertake negotiations on this subject in 1973.  Relationships with Japan and also with the less-developed countries are other topics which may be expected to acquire a degree of urgency.  While it is unlikely that any major impact on the Irish economy would result from revised trading arrangements with other countries, there are some subject areas in these discussions in which we may be expected to have a special interest and which will accordingly receive our particular attention.  Some of these questions are also of more general concern, so that, while we would not be pressing for any specific or unique solution, we would be anxious to see a generally satisfactory outcome produced.  The Community's relationships with less developed countries, for example, fall into this category.  There is a wide measure of agreement among the ten in recognising the need for more positive Community policies towards these countries, but, as yet, there is no consensus as to the precise scale of support or the actual forms which aid for these areas might take.  Questions such as these ought to serve as an important reminder that although the initial emphasis may be on economic issues the Community ultimately embraces <Col N="1551" /> a much wider set of social and political questions.</P>
    <P>The Community was born out of a desire for continuing peace.  It is composed of like-minded democratic countries who seek to promote the prosperity and freedom of their peoples.  As the Community evolves it will seek to strengthen its friendly relations with other countries so that it may become a more powerful force for peace and progress throughout the world.  These are aims to which we fully subscribe and we will seek to play a full and positive role in their achievement.</P>
    <P>An important part of the preparation for EEC membership is getting our firms and enterprises geared for the more competitive climate which they will then face.  This leads to my second topic&mdash;the economic situation. The past year saw a gradual improvement in economic performance resulting in a gross rate of about 3 per cent for 1971.  This can be regarded as moderately satisfactory given the continuing difficulties posed for some sectors by the unsettled situation in the North.  A number of factors contributed to this improvement.  One important element was the satisfactory working of the National Wage Agreement which served to slow down the rate of increase in prices and the number of days lost by industrial disputes. It is welcome to note that last year the number of days lost was about 270,000 compared with more than 1,000,000 days in 1970.  In the case of prices the most recent figures show that the increase is now at an annual rate of about 6 per cent and compares favourably with the rate of about 9 per cent for 1971.  This downward trend is expected to continue despite the recent increase in some food prices, so that for 1972 as a whole there should be a distinct improvement on the performance of the past two years.</P>
    <P>A second factor which has contributed to the improved economic performance has been the budgetary policies pursued by the Government. Capital spending has been stepped up substantially in order to boost employment. The current budget saw major <Col N="1552" /> improvements in social welfare benefits and income tax reliefs.  While these changes were made in order to protect and improve living standards of lower-income groups, they also released extra spending power into the economy and so helped to stimulate output and employment.</P>
    <P>One welcome feature of this economic recovery is that it has been accompanied by improvement in our external trading position.  For the 12 months ending in May, the import excess showed a reduction of £47 million by comparison with the 12 months ending May, 1971.  This improved trade performance was partly due to higher prices for our agricultural exports, a factor which should continue to have beneficial impact in the coming months.  This better trade performance, coupled with a large capital inflow, has resulted in a considerable increase in external reserves. At the end of May the reserves were over £400 millions compared with £380 millions at the end of 1971 and £290 millions at the end of 1970.  The high capital inflow can be regarded as an indicator of foreign confidence in the strength and potential of the Irish economy, and in view of our entry to the EEC this trend may be expected to continue.</P>
    <P>Despite the undoubted progress which has taken place over the past year, it is essential that a further improvement in economic performance be made.</P>
    <P>The slowing down in the pace of inflation must be continued because even the most recent rate of increase of 6 per cent is unacceptably high in the light of experience both at home and abroad and its continuation would lead to a loss of exports and employment. Since the level of unemployment is already high, due to the continuation of the slow economic growth, coupled with the present halt to emigration, there is clearly a need not alone to preserve existing employment but to generate new jobs as rapidly as possible. The Government has acted, and will continue to act, where necessary to increase employment.  I have already referred to the extra spending and budget reliefs introduced in recent <Col N="1553" /> months.  Allied to this there can now, in the light of our EEC entry, be a determined drive to attract new industries into the country.  These steps, in conjunction with the programmes for assisting industry to adapt to free trade, should produce a decided improvement in employment.  But there are limits to the extent to which Government action by itself can lead to success in this area.  Irrespective of any steps the Government might take it is fair to say, for example, that if the 1969-70 pattern of excessive pay increases and protracted industrial disputes had continued, it would have destroyed thousands of jobs and dissuaded any potential foreign investors from establishing factories here.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to say this because we are now in a decisive phase for the course of wage rises during the coming year and it is important that the people, particularly the workers concerned, should understand what is at stake.  All the evidence suggests that the present National Wage Agreement made an important contribution to slowing down inflation during the past year.  Equally important, the data show that this curbing of wage and price rises did not mean any sacrifice in the rate of improvement in real wages and real living standards of workers.  The reason for this is clear. A slower rate of increase in wages means in turn a lesser rise in prices and hence an improvement in real earnings.  It is important to emphasise this point because there are some who believe that moderation in wage rises leads to a reduction in workers' living standards.  This is just not so.  Improvements in living standards are decided by the increases which take place in annual output.  At the present time that means a rise of about 3 per cent to 4 per cent per annum.  There is no method whereby this nation can vote itself a faster rate of increase than this.  Consequently, when wages and salaries rise by more than this amount all that happens is that anything over 3 or 4 per cent is swallowed up in higher prices.  Any one group may be able to gain a temporary advantage for themselves from a large pay rise but other groups will quickly follow and then price rises will <Col N="1554" /> just as quickly swallow this temporary advantage.  The national wage agreement was designed to bring a halt to this pointless chase between higher prices and wages.  Because of the undoubted benefits which it has brought both for workers and other sections of the community attempts are now being made to produce another such agreement to cover the coming year or so.  It is the earnest wish of the Government that these efforts should prove successful.  A reversion to free-for-all bargaining can only be expected to damage and disrupt the economy at this delicate phase in our affairs.  In a free-for-all situation any attempt by some sectors to secure large pay rises would quickly prove self-defeating because other groups would quickly demand the same treatment and ultimately all would be made the poorer by the higher prices and loss of employment which would then follow.  The argument advanced against national pay agreements that they remove the freedom of workers to seek improvements in their living standards and working conditions is not borne out by the fact.  In particular, it should be emphasised that any one section or group of workers cannot successfully improve their pay differentials in comparison with other workers.  Hence the apparent freedom of each group in a free-for-all situation is largely only a freedom to hurt other groups of workers and damage the economy in general.</P>
    <P>This argument that freedom for individual bargaining is largely ineffective is one important reason for wishing to see a continuation of the National Wage Agreement.  There is a second reason.  As I have already indicated, and as is widely accepted, our economy is now at a delecate and decisive stage in its development.  A wrong set of actions now on our part, coming on top of the other stresses to which it has been exposed, could set back the progress of the economy for years to come.  If, on the other hand, we can act responsibly and decisively, there are reasonable prospects that substantial improvements in employment and living standards can take place, despite the various obstacles that lie in our <Col N="1555" /> path.  In such a situation the Government are entitled to ask for, and are entitled to expect, the constructive support of all sections of the community. They are entitled too to point to the consequences of sectional behaviour and to demonstrate that the damage caused by economic strife is no less destructive, even if less dramatic, than that that resulting from other forms of conflict.  The Government for their part can be expected to reciprocate mature and responsible action.  The past year has shown that tackling problems in a constructive manner creates conditions in which progress can be achieved for all parties.  There is in effect a virtuous circle, in which one positive step makes possible a second just as there is also a vicious circle in which one area of conflict engenders another.</P>
    <P>Reference to conflict leads me to my third topic, that of events in the North. The question which faces our communities, North and South, and one which has been posed with increasing brutality and starkness over the past three years is whether the common development of our peoples will be dictated and shaped by violence and antidemocratic factions or whether it can grow peacefully from a mutual recognition of our common interests and a sharing of our common burdens.  The coming months will decisively affect the answer to that question.  It is because we care and care passionately, about the form which that answer may take that we must both voice our concern and our views and work constructively to bring our aims to fruition. The Irish Government have repeatedly over the years declared their abhorrence of violence and their opposition to the use of force as a means of achieving Irish unity.  This is not just the policy of the Government Party.  It is fully shared by the other two parties in Dáil Éireann.  The unity we seek is a free and genuine union of those living in Ireland, based on mutual respect and tolerance, and guaranteed by a form or forms of government authority in Ireland providing for progressive improvements in our social, economic and cultural life in a just and peaceful environment.</P>
    <P>Tragically, the environment in which <Col N="1556" /> the people of Northern Ireland have had to live for the past two years has been anything but just or peaceful. Their agony, indeed, has been beyond endurance.  Killing and maiming, indiscriminate bombing and destruction, brutality, intimidation and humiliation, internment without trial, fear, distress and insecurity have been their lot.  No one with any sense of humanity could want to see this go on.  For the sake of the whole community who are suffering in this cauldron of violence all men and women who can bring any influence to bear in restoring peace and stability and re-creating a civilised and orderly framework must use that influence now.  It is to be regretted that the recent truce should have been so shortlived and should have been marred by so many senseless killings. However, the apparent failure of this initial attempt must not impede the efforts to restore peace and sanity. This requires a generous and magnanimous approach.  Risks must be taken for the sake of peace.  So long as the British army remains, and it is hoped that this period will be as short as possible, its role should be to protect all and to harass none.  All aggressiveness must be held firmly in check and the safety of individuals and property must be defended.</P>
    <P>In this new situation those who resort to violence must be denied support and resources, and no person or section must be the subject of coercion or discrimination.  When a peaceful climate of this nature has been created, the elected representatives of the community must come together to work out a new political framework in which they can act responsibly and effectively for those they represent.  The questions that they will face are in the first instance a concern for the Northern people themselves.  But they are also of major importance to us.  The facts of geography and history demonstrate the strong and inseparable bonds between our communities, North and South.</P>
    <P>There are four possibilities for the future form of political entity in the North.  One of these is total integration with the UK.  That is advocated by <Col N="1557" /> some but it would be unacceptable to a large body of opinion in the Six Counties as it would be unacceptable, too, to the people of the rest of Ireland. It would strengthen and perpetuate the terrifying impulse in some to seek through violence the achievement of the deep aspiration for a united Ireland which is held by the vast majority of Irishmen but which that vast majority want to achieve only by peaceful means and by agreement with their fellow-countrymen.</P>
    <P>Another possibility is that of a complete break with Britain and the setting up of a completely separate State. This is termed the UDI solution.  One can appreciate the sense of independence and enterprise from which this attitude springs, but again the question must be asked: is this desirable or possible?  Again the answer must be &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Such a step would clearly cause major social and economic upheaval. It would bring about a drastic fall in living standards.  These in themselves need not necessarily be adequate arguments against such a move.  We know that there are people and communities who are willing to pay such a price in order to secure the political framework they desire. We know that, unfortunately, this is not the only price that would have to be paid but there is no evidence that within the Northern community there is any widespread support for such an isolationist form of political unit.</P>
    <P>A third possibility is to seek some amended form of Stormont administration which would provide both an adequate role for the minority and would create a realistic prospect of ending one-party rule.  On the face of it such a development might appear to hold out the prospect of providing a stable and permanent solution to the question of Northern Ireland's political future.  But would it?  When the Northern State was created half a century ago neither the British nor the Irish people in general nor the Northern Unionists themselves believed that the arrangement was a permanent one.  Nothing that has happened throughout this 50 years span and nothing in the present or future prospects gives any reason to alter <Col N="1558" /> that belief.  Any amended Stormont administration should therefore be an interim step along the path to a harmonious, secure and lasting basis for the future development of the Northern community.</P>
    <P>It is our conviction that this basis can be found only in a wholly Irish and fully Irish context.  We ask the Northern people to seek their future development in partnership with us. We are not seeking to dominate a community that would be a minority in an over-all Irish context nor are we asking that they should surrender any of their traditions, values or loyalties. What we do ask is that they use their great qualities of courage, enterprise and independence in creating a new Ireland of which both they and we can be truly proud.</P>
    <P>We do not ask them to forget or forgo their past but we ask them to accept that it is the past.  Now is the time for Irish people, North and South, to make history again and not simply to endure it.</P>
    <P>Recently, at the invitation of the quarterly publication <i>Foreign Affairs,</i> I took the opportunity to state in detail the Government's views about the origin of conflict in Ireland, the way to a solution of this vital problem, the means by which the interests involved should proceed and the terms on which the permanent solution can be based.  There is a growing belief in Britain and in the North, as well as internationally, that the situation in the North cannot be solved <i>in vacuo</i>.  That has been the consistent view of this Government. In the meantime I have taken and will continue to take such initiatives as are open to me.  I have welcomed, and continue to welcome, the considered views of all the relevant parties, including those representative of Unionist opinion.  Constitutional, legislative and other issues which might affect in a positive way Northern attitudes and North-South relations in every respect have been discussed and this process is one which I would wish to see continued and extended.  It would be unrealistic to expect that the process of transforming political and social structures throughout the <Col N="1559" /> island could take place overnight, but it is not unrealistic to expect that there could be a speedy beginning to strengthening the many things that we share in common and the removal of those obstacles which separate us.</P>
    <P>The British Government will receive all the help that the Irish Government can give them in measures taken to further these objectives.  For our part we will expect their continuing support in creating a new Ireland free of the divisions and disabilities of the past in which Irishmen, irrespective of creed, class or conviction can live together constructively and at peace.</P>
    <P>In a speech in Kingscourt last month I indicated my welcome to the efforts of Mr. Whitelaw to convene a conference of the people of Northern Ireland as a necessary step towards reconciliation.  I regard this step not only as necessary but immediately necessary.  I would hope that these talks would pave the way for the wider discussion to which I referred in Kingscourt because as I said in my <i>Foreign Affairs</i> article, Northern Ireland cannot be dealt with without reference to the Anglo-Irish relationship as a whole.  I have said before that we cannot allow private armies to use the territory of the Republic to impose their will on the people of Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>Neither will they be permitted to impose their will on the people of the Republic.  It is sickening to hear those people who organise and lead such parades as was witnessed at the Curragh on Sunday last saying that they do so in the name of Republican democracy while using and permitting to be used the most undemocratic methods such as intimidation, stone-throwing, petrol bombing and even arson.  But our democratic Parliament <Col N="1560" /> will not be intimidated by them nor will the defence forces and the police force set up and sustained by that democratic parliament to safeguard the rights and the interests of the people be intimidated by them.</P>
      <P>I should like to pay tribute to the members of the Defence Forces and the Gardaí for the admirable restraint they displayed under considerable provocation not only last Sunday but on the many previous occasions when they had been confronted by factions that are, to say the least, unruly and irresponsible.</P>

      <P>Events in Northern Ireland are now entering a critical phase.  For whatever evil purposes, the men of violence are increasingly resorting to desperate and despicable acts. Such barbarism could rapidly lead to bloodshed on a horrifying scale.  All right-thinking and responsible people must unite their efforts to ensure that this does not happen.  The first and overriding imperative must be the restoration of peace.  It is a sad reflection of the dangerous tensions which now prevail in the North that the 12th July which should be a day of happy celebration for its participants was this year the occasion for some to perpetrate still more killings and for others to preach harted and divisions.  Yet we have been so accustomed to such appalling events that our sense of outrage and sympathy for the victims is allied to relief that even more terrible events did not take place.  The knowledge that we have become so conditioned to violence must surely compel all sane people, especially all who profess to be Christians, to redouble their efforts to achieve peace.</P>

    <P>To achieve this is no easy task as we all know.  It calls for calmness and courage on the part of people subjected to agonising provocation.  It calls for wise and enlightened statesmanship from the leaders of all communities. Above all, it calls for a generous understanding and sincere concern for fellow countrymen and fellow human beings.  We extend our deep and sincere sympathy to the families and friends of those who have died in these <Col N="1561" /> tragic events.  The loss of life, whether it be that of Catholic or Protestant, Irish or British, brings grief and sorrow. When that loss is avoidable and unnecessary the tragedy and suffering are intensified.</P>
    <P>We have repeatedly conveyed, and will continue to convey, our concern about these matters to the British Government.  In order to end this senseless killing, the advocates of violence must be shown that their efforts will not succeed.  All sections of our communities, North and South, can help to produce that result.  For some it requires that they overcome the urge to retaliation which is born of pain and loss; for others it means a refusal to be cowed or intimidated by the fomentors of strife.  For all of us it demands that we speak out clearly and dispel any lingering romanticism or idealism which may surround this violence.</P>
    <P>The crisis in the North is being sustained and aggravated by fear.  In particular, the Northern Protestants fear that they will be forced into a united Ireland willy-nilly in a matter of months.  I have spoken before of a comprehensive Irish society in which we can all share as equals.  I know that this is the wish of every Member of the House; I know that I speak for all Members of the House and for the parties in the House, representative as they are of the great majority of the people of Ireland, when I say that we share an imperishable aspiration for a united Ireland and that we want to achieve this only in peace and by agreement with our fellow countrymen. We therefore declare once again our abhorrence of violence and our opposition to the use of force as a means of achieving political ends whether for or against the principle of a united Ireland.  The unity we seek is a genuine union based on consent and mutual respect and tolerance.  We realise, regrettably and inevitably for many reasons&mdash;including the need to build up trust and reconciliation&mdash; that the aim of a united Ireland, an Ireland united by agreement, may take many years to accomplish but this is the only basis on which it is intended to proceed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1562" /> In the meantime we must accept that there must be in Northern Ireland a form of regional administration which will enable the whole community there to live and work together in peace while leaving the door open to an approach by majority consent to the concept of a new, united Ireland.  The urgent concern of the people of this State and of us, their representatives, is that the catastrophe of civil conflict in Northern Ireland be averted and conditions established which will enable all the people in Northern Ireland to work together in peace and justice for their social and economic progress.</P>

      <P>This end-of-session debate occurs in what we now come to accept as one of these annual crisis situations.  It is right to say that in that situation, as it has existed now for three years, the co-operation of the Opposition with the Government has been unsurpassed in any democracy ancient or modern.  It has won the admiration of our opponents and the Press, if at times it dismayed our friends by its magnanimity.  But having consistently expressed our support for the necessary measures to maintain law and order and vindicate the institutions of State it is, at least, satisfactory to know from the Taoiseach's last announcement on behalf of the Government that they have arrived, after a slow and tortuous journey at the present position which, on that matter, is similar to ours.</P>
      <P>I have on many occasions, going back for years, asserted and repeated our absolute commitment to the maintenance of the democratic rights that have been established in this country and if it is necessary now&mdash;perhaps it is&mdash;to repeat our commitment and our unqualified support for that situation, we do so in the shadow of the appalling position in the North of Ireland and in the aftermath of recent events at the Curragh and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, indeed, obvious in our conditions that freedom can be lost from within a country as well as by attacks by outside forces.  Therefore, it is necessary then to ensure that public opinion is properly and clearly led, and <Col N="1563" /> must come out unequivocally against those who seek to deprive our citizens of their rights.  The sacrifices of previous generations were too great for our people today to surrender to subversive elements within our country what our forebears fought so tenaciously to win from foreign invaders.</P>
    <P>This has to be made absolutely clear and this party have repeated it <i>ad nauseam,</i> indeed, at times to such an extent that the repetition became tedious for those who had to make the statement and tedious for some of those who had to listen as well.  This goes to the very root of our democratic system because involved in it are the very institutions which were established to maintain the rights of the weak rather than the strong, the old and the infirm and the young rather than those who are capable of looking after themselves. I want to say again as emphatically as possible that we have no sympathy for those people.  They will get no sympathy verbal or otherwise from us and they need expect none by calling late at night or early in the morning to the houses of Deputies of this party seeking recognition or sympathy.  It is not here and it will not be given to them.  The behaviour at the Curragh last week was a disgrace to any people who claim or allege that they speak in the name of some form of republicanism.</P>

      <P>The Army of this State is the Army of the Irish people. Our soldiers are the soldiers of the Irish nation supported at considerable sacrifice by the people through the ballot boxes.  The men and women of the Garda are the guardians of the peace, again established by the people and supported through the ballot boxes.  There can be no doubt whatever about our actions in this matter or our rejection of the aims and attempts of those people to usurp authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter was referred to on many occasions recently and was put quite clearly in a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday last. It referred to one speaker who said <Col N="1564" /> that the aim of people like him was to achieve a democratic republic. What form of democracy is it in which intimidation and force and arson are used, and attacks are made on the people who are charged by the nation to defend it on the one hand and to ensure the preservation of peace on the other hand?  I said recently that the referendum decision was more than a decision to join the EEC.  It went further than that.  This is no reflection on the attitude adopted by elected representatives who opposed EEC membership.  The decision in the referendum was an emphatic rejection of those who sought to impose their views on the community through intimidation or other unauthorised or irregular or illegal methods.</P>
    <P>The <i>Irish Independent</i> article concluded that it is customary and certainly proper to acknowledge the sincerity of people with minority views. We can speak with some authority on that because we have been in a minority for a considerable time.  Whether we were in a majority or a minority we accepted the will of the electorate. The leading article asks: &ldquo;Is it not time then that the minority acknowledged the feelings of the majority&mdash; that, as far as systems go they want the <i>status quo</i> maintained?  Of course, they want the democratic system maintained.&rdquo;  Our only anxiety in this party has been at the fact that the Government were so lethargic in taking effective action to deal with this situation.  We have been more than willing to co-operate in every necessary measure and every expression of condemnation of this form of activity, but that did not blind us to the fact that the delay in establishing the special criminal court was inexcusable. The only thing that can be said about its establishment is that it is better late than never.  At present it appears to be working more effectively than some earlier efforts at ensuring that those who flouted the law would not escape through legal or other technicalities.</P>

      <P>I have spoken about <Col N="1565" /> this on many occasions and made our position so clear that it is unnecessary at this stage, when other matters have to be dealt with as well, to dwell unduly long on the matter, but I want to say a few words about the present position in the North and the deterioration in the situation in the past week or so.  It is time for all of us, not only in this House but outside it also&mdash;and those who are endeavouring to foment trouble and cause dissention by their tactics and create disruption in the efforts to achieve peace&mdash;to say what it is we want.  Can those who press on with a campaign of bombing and shooting and murder tell the ordinary Irish people in simple language what their aim is and what they are endeavouring to accomplish?  This discussion must now be carried on, not in the form of abstract theory, but in terms of real problems for millions of men, women and children living in every part of Ireland.</P>
      <P>We are entitled to know, and the people are entitled to know, if we are not to have peace why we are not to have peace.  If war is to be declared, it can only be declared by the established Parliament responsible to and elected by the people.  There can be absolutely no shadow of doubt about this.  No men in this country, no matter what motives of patriotism inspire them, or what spurious mantle of patriotism others adopt, have the right to perpetrate war against any section in this country in the name of the Irish people. Nobody.  There can be no doubt whatever on that issue.  We have repeatedly made our attitude clear on this matter. We seek the reunification of this country by peaceful means.  We seek the reunification of this country on the basis of agreement and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, at great political cost to both individuals and the Party which we represent, suffered the odium of criticism and the odium of epithets of abuse because of our determination and dedication to that concept that there cannot be unity in this country except by agreement but we have said, and it is a fact, that when the Government of Ireland Act was passed by the British in 1920, section 2 of that Act referred specifically to the idea enshrined <Col N="1566" /> in it, accepted by Catholics and Protestants, that it was with a view to the eventual establishment of a parliament for the whole of Ireland.  But, the achievement of that must be by peaceful means and not by force or intimidation or violence from one side or section endeavouring to coerce or intimidate or force the other side.</P>
    <P>We, as I have said, committed ourselves to that at the cost at times of transient political advantage.  The policy that we supported and the objectives which we laid down and have consistently followed are now accepted and recognised as the right ones.</P>
    <P>It has not been easy.  Worthy causes are seldom easy of attainment.  It has not been easy to get that view accepted or easy or at times agreeable to have to push it forward in the manner in which we believed it should have been done. It is at this particular juncture in our affairs necessary to restate that and to indicate again to the Protestants in the Six Counties that so far as the majority of elected public representatives reflecting the vast majority of the people of this State are concerned there would be no attempt to force them into a situation against their wishes or to coerce them into conditions unacceptable to their views.  That, at the same time, does not mean that we will not press for justice for the minority, for the justice that has been denied to them over the last 50 years and that has in recent years, because of their reaction against the injustice, caused so much suffering and bloodshed.</P>
    <P>We must extend our sympathy to all fellow Irishmen and their families in the North of Ireland, both Catholic and Protestant, but we must do more than that; we must urge that the efforts being made by the recent British Government decisions get a chance to work, to work in conditions in which rational discussions are possible between the authorised elected representatives of all sections in the North.  The recent decisions endeavoured to introduce reforms which would lay the foundations for a more democratic administration, which could lead to ultimate reconciliation and the ending of partition but the resumption of bombing and violence <Col N="1567" /> only postpones the peace and reconciliation for which so many strive.</P>
    <P>I think it is an advance that the Government here are now apparently unequivocally committed and have made it clear by recent actions, fortified by the decision in the referendum and with the emphatic and clear support of this party and other elected representatives, that there can be no toleration of any attempt in this State and no support for any efforts in the North of Ireland to use force or violence to achieve the aims of peaceful reconciliation.</P>
    <P>This debate coming at the present juncture in our affairs and in the shadow of the appalling situation in the North at least re-expresses the commitment of this House and the commitment of the Irish people to these aims and objectives.</P>
    <P>This particular discussion at the end of a session and on the Adjournment, as well as dealing with this matter and the Taoiseach's Estimate, covers a number of matters that are broadly concerned with Government policy. Because of the preoccupation with the problem of the North of Ireland and the emphasis on the need to maintain the institutions of State here and to ensure that the law is enforced and upheld, other matters have received less attention than, obviously, is necessary and, as a result, many matters have not been dealt with effectively and efficiently.</P>
    <P>The present discussions that are taking place to secure a national wage agreement are, I believe, important from the point of view of ensuring that the rise in prices and the serious effect of inflation does not worsen the situation for every section of the community but particularly for the weaker sections.  I detected some note of complacency in what the Taoiseach said when he referred to the fact that recent price rises had fallen from the 8 per cent or 10 per cent that had become common in the last couple of years to about 6 per cent.  One is entitled to ask for how long this is going to last.</P>
    <P>During the past few weeks, and particularly yesterday, this House has <Col N="1568" /> been devoting a great deal of time to the problem of the proposed introduction of the value-added tax.  This tax has been debated so fully that it is only necessary to deal with major effects, but we are entitled to consider the effects of the introduction of this tax in the light of what happened when decimalisation occurred.  The introduction of decimalisation meant an extraordinary increase in prices.  I referred to that at the time, and statistics and facts published since confirmed the situation that developed.</P>
    <P>When turnover tax was first introduced some years ago it was stated that it would not be possible to exclude food.  Later when the wholesale tax was introduced certain food items were excluded from it.  now with the proposed introduction of VAT food is again included.  Now is the time, before this tax is introduced and when it is still possible to take action to prevent this, for this House and the country to be aware of the consequences. If VAT is introduced in its present form it will jeopardise any national wage agreement that may be agreed; or, alternatively, any national wage agreement that is entered into now must take cognisance of the proposed introduction of VAT at a later stage.  In either event it cannot be disguised that the introduction of VAT covering food will inevitably mean a substantial increase in costs, at a time when every local authority, every health authority, every individual, is feeling the effect of rising prices.</P>
    <P>It is true that some of the price rises recently have shown a slight drop compared with the earlier increases, but they cannot continue to rise at the same level all the time, and experience shows that the immediate reaction to price increases after a change of system is always more severe than when the levelling off period occurs. However, this is coming at a time when there is a very high level of unemployment not only in the urban areas but in rural areas.  It has become customary in recent times to describe these as redundancies, but whether people are unemployed or redundant they are out of work, and this also <Col N="1569" /> affects the problem of getting people who are redundant in a particular type of employment, or who are unemployed as a result of changes, retrained for new work.  It is important from the point of view of the national economy that the country should be aware of the dangers involved in including food in VAT.</P>
    <P>This year members of the health authorities have found a tremendous problem in meeting the increased rate demand.  Irrespective of which party they belong to members of every local authority are dissatisfied with the effect of the operation of the new health boards, but leaving these administrative or structural matters aside for the moment, this year the rise in rates due to health charges alone amounts to £6 million.  The Minister for Health claimed credit that if it had not been for the introduction of the special subvention of £3 million from the Exchequer, all the £6 million would have fallen on ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The Government have been preoccupied not only with the North but with their own internal problems, and there is no use in disguising it.  This was brought forcibly before me recently, and before others when there were the celebrations to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the Garda Síochána.  Two of the people who entered the church for the service at the same time as I did were Ministers who had been dropped from the present Government; both of them had for a period been Minister for Justice.  At least it was possible for all of us to pray together.  That situation has persisted and has continued up to the present, and there is no use in disguising the fact.  This Government have failed to take a decision in respect of health services and health administration. Throughout this country not merely are health boards and health authorities finding it difficult to get the doctors to provide the services, but because of the conditions laid down it is impossible to attract to these institutions people of the quality and calibre necessary.</P>
    <P>The other major area in which there has been a failure of the Government to act properly and to secure the confidence <Col N="1570" /> of all concerned is in respect of education.  This has been so serious that many of us have expressed our concern about it on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>The question of education has in recent years been in the forefront of discussion here but because, as I said, of the impact of events in the North, it has been overshadowed as regards the amount of meaningful debate that has taken place about the system.  Our educational system is in need of change and reform but these changes and reforms must, and should only be, made after full discussion with all interested parties, parents, religious orders of all denominations, teachers and any other person qualified or directly concerned, such as school committees and vocational committees.  This week the subject has been once more in the forefront of comment by those concerned. It is, I think, appropriate that on this particular topic we should recognise that those who comment have no political or party axe to grind. The educational committee of the bishops after their meeting in Maynooth issued a statement in which they said, as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 10th July, that the time had come for the Department to publish clearly and comprehensively its plans and policies for post-primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same paper carried a letter from the headmaster of Gonzaga College in Dublin.  Recently there were two or three letters or statements made by supporters of both day and boarding schools commenting on the situation.  I need not read the whole letter but some paragraphs are of significance, of particular significance taken in conjuction with the statement issued at the bishops' meeting at Maynooth and with the statements of representatives of the Protestant Churches and of teachers.  The letter refers to the problem that has arisen <Col N="1571" /> over the pupil/teacher ratio.  Every Deputy, certainly every Deputy in constituencies which have increased in size because of new housing, has been approached by teachers, by parents and the supporters of these schools about the problems that have arisen for them.  This, again, is adverted to in this particular letter and in other comments and statements.</P>
    <P>The particular reference in this letter is to a statement issued by the Government Information Bureau on 3rd July on behalf of the Minister for Education in which the Minister &ldquo;trusted that the general public would weigh the facts in the statement against the type of statement and comment to which they had recently been subjected&rdquo;.  This letter deals with each point in that statement and refutes the points made.</P>
    <P>That parents in many areas are now expressing themselves in favour of community schools shows not only are they deeply concerned with the future of their children but that they fully realise that access to post-primary education is one thing but that if educational opportunity means anything it means access to the right type of post-primary education.</P>
    <P>The letter asks:</P>
    <P>What parents?  In what areas? Where are they expressing themselves? They have been strangely silent.  Parents, teachers, managers, as reported in the Press, have given an unqualified &ldquo;No&rdquo; to Community schools.  Witness the reports of meeting after meeting over recent months.</P>
    <P>But what is happening?  The Department has now excluded the press, and to a large extent, the parents, from all such meetings and it is ruthlessly engaged in a massive bullying campaign, behind closed doors, which will result in a bulldozing through of its national blueprint and panacea for all educational ills&mdash;the Community School.  The sudden &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; of the parents and the deep concern of the Department for the students under its care <Col N="1572" /> are really breathtaking and shattering.</P>
    <P>The final paragraph of the letter reads:</P>
    <P>The dishonesty of the statement from the Government Information Bureau needs no further elaboration. It should alert the parents of Ireland as to exactly what to expect from a Department that can furnish such a statement to the Bureau.</P>
    <P>This is, I believe, one of the major issues that has been neglected.  Not merely has it been neglected but the discussions that have taken place have been valueless because of the attitude adopted by the Department.  This week there was a conference, not reported, in Galway at which a representative frm Norway attended.  The meeting was presided over by an official of the Department and that representative from Norway said at that meeting that in Norway they had had to retrace their steps.  They had to re-open schools that had been closed.  Not only that, but decisions taken without consultation with the parents and the teachers in the areas affected had had to be reversed; they had to retrace their steps and re-think their attitudes.</P>
    <P>We are, at least, now alerted to the dangers of the situation and the time has come when neither parents nor teachers will accept diktats from some remote character in the Department of Education, issued without consultation. It must be recognised that every section of the community is concerned to see a system in which it is possible for religious of all denominations to continue running their schools as they have been running them and a system in which the valuable work done by vocational committees and vocational teachers can continue on the basis that, if there are to be changes, then these changes can be made only after full and proper consultation between the various groups concerned.</P>

      <P>One matter I should like to mention is the extraordinary delay in introducing the Planning Appeals Bill.  This has been under discussion here for some years <Col N="1573" /> and we have again put down a Bill because of our concern over the way in which planning appeals are decided behind closed doors, with no right of access in many cases to those who decide; the person who decides in the present situation is, of course, the Minister for Local Government.  We believe the introduction of such a Bill is an urgent matter in order to avoid abuse.</P>
      <P>There is then the question of the national archives.  This matter was raised here by way of Parliamentary question and the Minister for Health, answering for the Taoiseach, said that certain discussions were taking place. Earlier the Minister for Education indicated that some inter-departmental group was working on this.  I was concerned to discover that, although the Ministers and Secretaries Act provides for the national archives being under the control of the Taoiseach, his Department had no representation on this committee.  Now this is an important matter and it was highlighted by the decision of the Benchers in the Kings Inns to sell certain books and papers.  This is a matter that should be discussed between the representatives of the bodies concerned, the representatives of libraries and other institutions of learning as well as the Benchers of the Kings Inns and representatives of the National Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that a committee had been appointed to advise the Markpress Agency.  i should like to know who the members of the committee are and what particular qualifications they have.  The debate on this Estimate has to be curtailed because of the time factor but, so far as this party is concerned, we are concerned at the fact that so many major issues have suffered from inadequate attention in that they have been dealt with by the Government, but we welcome the decision of the Government to ensure that the institutions of the State will be protected.  We are glad that the Government's attitude on this matter is now clear and that it corresponds to the view that we have expressed during the years on the maintenance of law and order and on the vindication of the parliament of the people and the institutions responsible <Col N="1574" /> to that Parliament in the name of the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has singled out, rightly, three different points for the purpose of discussion during this adjournment debate.  I had intended also to deal with these three particular aspects of the economy and of the state of the nation.  The Taoiseach has said that the House will resume on the 25th October but has made the proviso that the House could be recalled in certain circumstances in consultation with the Leaders of the Opposition Parties.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would tell us also when the referendum for the granting of votes at 18 will be held.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach talked about the EEC.  So far as my party are concerned I wish to put it on the record of the House, although I said it elsewhere, that although we campaigned as best we could against the membership of this country of the EEC on the terms negotiated, we accepted the verdict of the people.  This is our position and will continue to be our position for as long as we are members of the EEC.</P>
      <P>I know it has not been intended but it has been said that those who opposed entry under the terms negotiated by the Government, engaged in intimidation.  Our campaign was one of logical argument on radio, television and in the public press.  We did a great service to this country in carrying out that sort of campaign because if the three parties in the House were to have said merely &ldquo;Me too&rdquo;, such attitude would not have done any good to democracy and certainly it would not have done the country any good and it would not have presented to the people the other side of the picture which is a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the campaign and of the claims that were made for full membership of the EEC, there is now less optimism among those who advocated fully our joining the Community. For instance, the Leader of the farmers' organisation and the Taoiseach issued warnings immediately after the result was made known.  So far as the farmers' organisation were concerned there was then not the same optimism <Col N="1575" /> for the future prospects of the small and middle-sized farmers.  In respect of industry, the Taoiseach, about a week later, did not reverse his position completely but warned that many of the existing industries were vulnerable.  It is a pity he was not so direct before the referendum so that the people would have had the full picture.</P>
    <P>We will be concerned within the Community as we expressed concern during the campaign, for the implementation of a regional policy.  We will be concerned, as we have been always, with the future relationship with the Community and the underdeveloped countries of the world.  In particular, in the European Parliament and in this Parliament we will insist that advantage be taken of the protocol in respect of Irish industry, vague though that protocol may be, in order to safeguard Irish industry and Irish jobs.  Finally on the EEC may I repeat that we accept the verdict of the people which was given in a democratic fashion and that we will work so far as we can for the benefit of this country and its people.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I could not share the same degree of optimism as the Taoiseach in regard to the economy because as has been said, the economy has been neglected, not deliberately but by reason of events in the North and by reason also of the internal difficulties of Fianna Fáil.  So far as unemployment is concerned I do not think there should have been the complacency that there was, particularly during last winter when during a long period there was a record for unemployment. Indeed, at present the figure is still high and compares very unfavourably with last year.  Although this is the position there is not the degree of urgency that there should be in so far as the Ministers for Industry and Commerce and Finance and the Taoiseach are concerned.  At the moment there are 68,500 people unemployed and who are depending on the social welfare benefits available to them.  There has been no improvement in respect of the redundancy situation.  Between January and May of this year there were a further 2,698 redundancies.  Prices, to which I <Col N="1576" /> shall refer again, have skyrocketted. This is one of the areas which has been neglected completely by the Government. What can one say about the balance of payments except that it appears that this year again there will be a record in that respect?</P>
    <P>Again the Taoiseach appears to be complacent about our economic growth which he says in this year is estimated to be 3 per cent as against 3 per cent last year and 1.5 per cent in 1970.  This is not a good reflection on the Government or on the First, Second or Third Programmes for Economic Expansion in respect of which the Government were so optimistic.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is facing complete disaster this year.  Anybody who has been in any part of the country will have realised very quickly that there has been a collapse in the industry to the detriment of the economy and, of course, to those unfortunate people who are engaged in the industry.  On occasions like this the Taoiseach is inclined to assure us that the country is in good hands and that we need have no worries.  We have very many worries, the principle one being the situation in the North of Ireland but there are other worries which cannot be enumerated within the limited time at our disposal.</P>
    <P>However, I say to the Government that they should not regard the coming ten weeks or three months as a virtual holiday.  This period is regarded by them as a respite from their internal difficulties and from the difficulties that they have in Dáil Éireann.  I suggest that in so far as the aspects of the economy to which I have referred are concerned, the Government must be alert and must try to ensure that 1972 will not be the disastrous year that it has the appearance of being now. Urgent measures must be taken.</P>
    <P>As a trade unionist I am reluctant to talk in any great detail on the national wage agreement because since negotiations are taking place, we should regard the matter to a large extent as being <i>sub judice</i>.  Nothing should be said here that might disrupt the negotiations that are in progress or that would antagonise one side or the other.  Suffice it for me to say that <Col N="1577" /> so far as the national wage agreement is concerned, it is desirable in principle. I will not say that the current agreement has been ideal but it has worked reasonably well.  So far as the one now being negotiated is concerned there was failure to get agreement by the trade unions who rejected the terms proposed as a result of discussions between the employers and the employees.</P>
    <P>At last week's conference of the ICTU, the trade unions, by a big majority, decided to go back to the conference table.  They should be applauded for making this one last effort to try to ensure that there would be some regularity in the negotiation of wage increases and fringe benefits.  It was the desire of the huge majority there to make another effort to reach agreement.  I do not know what the outcome will be but wages and the national wage agreements are not matters to be left entirely between unions and employers.</P>
    <P>At a function I attended recently &mdash;whether public or private I do not know&mdash;there was no report of it in the newspapers&mdash;I heard a Minister of State describe the three sections of the country as the employers', employees' and the Government, in the context of wages.  He gave the impression that as regards negotiation of a national wage agreement it was a matter entirely between unions and employers. Far from it.  I do not think the Government can lightly dismiss their responsibility in the matter.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest factors operating on the minds of workers at present is instability, not necessarily now, but especially in the future. They are vitally concerned with matters over which the Government have control and for which they have absolute responsibility.  To mention one, we have prices; a second is EEC membership and the effect on pay packets of these two.  The Government have responsibility in both areas.  The Taoiseach or the Tánaiste should not think that I am asking, or even hinting, that a Prices and Incomes Bill should be reintroduced.  This would be vigorously opposed by this party and the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>There are other factors for which <Col N="1578" /> the Government have responsibility in regard to negotiating incomes, salaries or wages.  There is the question of social welfare benefits and the burning question of differential rents.  The Government cannot evade responsibility there because all these are factors. Wages buy food and clothes and pay rent.  It is deplorable that the Minister for Local Government, in a circular of February, 1969, I think, permitted local authorities, meaning county or city managers, to increase rents by up to 25p per week.  People who could not be regarded as agitators or troublemakers, tenants of corporation houses, are deeply concerned about the inequity of the rents being charged at present and there is a countrywide movement of bitter resentment against the increases that have been applied.</P>
    <P>The manner in which differential rents are being operated by county and city managers is resented and if the Government do not come to terms with these people they will find themselves in serious trouble, to the detriment of the economy and local authority finances.  I particularly want to stress in regard to the national wage agreement that the Government cannot stand idly by; they must be concerned in these vital matters of prices, effect of EEC membership, social welfare benefits and the manner in which differential rents are operated.</P>
    <P>The value-added tax in the context of the EEC is and will be uppermost in the minds of those negotiating at present and of those on whose behalf they are negotiating.  The Government could have done well by not applying VAT to food.  I do not want to go into the arguments now; they were certainly made in a very detailed way by my colleagues from these benches last night but, unfortunately, were met with the rejection by the Minister for Finance of the proposal to exempt food from VAT. VAT will mean inevitably an increase in prices and not necessarily by the proposed percentage tax on food, which is to be fixed at the unusual figure of 5.26.  I believe, and there is evidence of this in past experience, that the tax will be more than the statutory level of 5.26 per cent and this will lead to an increase in the price index. <Col N="1579" /> The idea of taxing food, in any case, is repugnant to me as it was when the turnover tax was also applied to food and it is extraordinary that it should be applied in such a way that there will not merely be an increase of 5.26 per cent but in very many cases a greater increase than that.  We saw this in the transfer from the old coinage to decimal currency which was responsible for a large portion of the increase in prices, particularly food prices, in the past 18 months or so.</P>
    <P>Also in the minds of the negotiators of a national wage agreement will be fear of devaluation of the British £ which will be a factor in price increases. All these factors lead to instability and work against the national wage agreement and against any kind of agreement in future.  If there is to be what is described as a free-for-all&mdash; I do not like the phrase, I prefer to say free collective bargaining&mdash;the Government will have to share responsibility.</P>
    <P>Prices have gone entirely mad.  We need only refer to our wives or those who shop to know that this is a fact. Even though we have had a national wage agreement for the past 18 months there is a tremendous variation in food prices, a variation described by the National Prices Commission in their monthly report No. 8 as a difference of 8 per cent between the lowest and highest centres.  We had some Bills which we were told were intended to control prices but the present situation shows there has not been a genuine attempt by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to provide any control.</P>

      <P>The National Prices Commission, in its May Report, recommended that there should be a revised Retail Price Food Display Order, and that this should operate from 1st July, 1972.  I have not been around the shopping centres very much but it would amaze me if I saw outside every shop this display showing what prices should be because, as I have <Col N="1580" /> said, prices seem to have gone mad and have driven the housewives mad also, not alone the increases but the differences in the prices of which we read in the newspapers in the past week.  So far as the Government are concerned in regard to prices I believe the attack must be made on food. There must be a genuine effort to ensure that the people will get food at the proper price and get proper value for what they pay.</P>
      <P>From June, 1971, to June, 1972, the consumer price index rose by 8 per cent but the food element in that index rose by 11 per cent.  Needless to remark the housewife is concerned about this.  She may put off the purchase of a new dress, or a new suit, or a piece of linoleum, but people must eat.  That is why I say that the focus of attention by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his officials must be on the control of food prices. The National Prices Commission are doing a reasonably good job but, if the Government do not act on their recommendations, they may as well be idle and they will be as ineffective as the NIEC were.</P>
      <P>The other item I want to talk about is the North.  Every time we have a debate like this, inevitably we say that the position has completely changed. It has changed since we had the last major debate on the North.  We have had the prorogation of Stormont. When the news came that Stormont was to be prorogued many people thought that was the end and we would have peace.  Many unfortunate people thought it was the end of the Unionist regime and the Unionist Party, and that unity was around the corner.  We did not think so, and we said that at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also had the appointment of the Secretary of State, Mr. William Whitelaw. We had the appointment of the Advisory Commission.  Since the advent of Mr. Whitelaw we had the release of a certain number of internees. We also had the emergence of Vanguard and the emergence of the Ulster Defence Association.  In this we saw the beginning of what we predicted, the beginning of a backlash. Their training activities which we saw on television and in newspapers, and <Col N="1581" /> heard described on radio, were frightening. I wonder did they frighten enough people.  I wonder did they convince enough people that there is the reality of a Protestant backlash against atrocities committed in the province over the past three years.</P>
    <P>The prorogation of Stormont was, I am sure, a bitter blow to the Unionists. We are pleased that it was prorogued, but we cannot minimise the bitter blow it was to those who regarded it as the seat of power for them for such a long time.  The situation has changed. Many things have happened.  We have had the truce by the Provisional IRA. There was the awful experience of the truce being implemented only from the minute after the determined time.  It is tragic and horrible to think that, right up to the minute of the truce, people were killed, there were massive explosions, people were maimed and people lost their limbs.</P>
    <P>I did not believe that the truce was the beginning of the end.  I did not believe that it was the beginning of peace.  During the truce we still had the assassinations by both sides.  We had the movement of two communities into their own areas equalled only by the movement of people in August, 1969.  We had a further alienation of the two communities.  We had Bloody Sunday and the murder of 13 people in Derry.  All those things have made the situation far more serious than it has ever been since 1968.</P>
    <P>I wonder do people realise that this is happening here in our own country. I wonder what were the feelings of people who saw the funeral of the Derry victims.  I wonder what were the feelings of the Protestant father who marched between the hearses carrying his two sons a week or so ago.  I believe that the situation in Ulster is now at its worst point, because no life is safe.  Some people in the South thought that the truce was the beginning of peace, but we did not.  I wonder do the people in the South really appreciate how serious the situation is.  I think many of them are living in a fool's paradise and that they are under the impression that this is not happening in Ireland at all but in Vietnam or in some other country thousands of miles away.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> The politicians in the North and the South who have been elected by the people must be honest as leaders of the people and must speak out clearly and loudly.  The Catholic leaders must be loud in their denunciations of violence and their insistence that violence will not bring unity.  From the other side there must be a declaration that violence will not bring about the restoration of Stormont and Unionist domination there.  Violence can only produce hate and loss of life.  The vast majority of the Catholics and the Protestants in the North want peace. Peace is the prerequisite for justice and equality, but peace does not necessarily mean that unity is around the corner.</P>
    <P>Appeals for the ending of violence, whether by bombing, or sniping or assassination, are of no avail if they are not accompanied by action.  The question which has bedevilled us all on both sides of the House is: what sort of action?  It appears that the two communities are miles apart.  When I look at television and see John Hume in discussion with Paisley, or when I see other members of the SDLP talking to those who are regarded as extreme Unionists, I am hopeful.  The discussion is short and there never seems to be a conclusion, but the one hope is that they talk together even though they may disagree.</P>
    <P>They should get around the conference table without any preconditions. I know and they know that the aspirations of each group will not be fully realised but they must also realise that sacrifices must be made on both sides to stop the madness of killing and to allay the awful fears of the majority who want peace.  Unless this is done, the field is left to the men of violence on both sides, and victory will go to those who have the most guns, and who kill the most, and bomb the most. Unless the political will is there on both sides to achieve peace based on justice, no formula, no gimmick, and no publicity stunt will succeed, and we will be left with the law of the jungle, and the innocent will suffer.</P>
    <P>It was suggested when Mr. Whitelaw was appointed as Secretary of State for the North that there would be <Col N="1583" /> periodic plebiscites on the question of unity.  There is a suggestion now that one will be held soon.  I would not be enthusiastic about it to say the least of it.  I think I know what the result will be.  Any citizen of this State, North or South, if he is honest, knows what the result would be.  It would be meaningless to hold a plebiscite.  I believe there would be intimidation.  I know about the secrecy of the ballot, but I still believe there would be intimidation.</P>
    <P>To our disgrace we have not had enough contact with people from the North, not only in the past three years, but over the past 50 years.  From talking to them I believe what they want most is peace.  Rather than a plebiscite on unity I think Mr. Whitelaw or the British Government would be better employed in having a plebiscite on the ending of violence.  I think I know what the result of that would be.  I believe it would be an overwhelming direction to men of violence on both sides to stop the violence.  It would be a message to them that this violence is not being committed in their name. The Border is not in question now as far as these people are concerned, whether you call them Catholic, Protestant, Nationalist or Unionist.  They appreciate that this thing has gone on for three to five years.  They know that repression in one form or another has gone on for 50 years.  Life is short&mdash; a span of 70 to 80 years.  They want a major portion of that life to be spent in peace.</P>
    <P>I believe, therefore, that the politicians on both sides of the Border should speak up.  There are too many armchair supporters of men of violence in the south and, of course, their support is greater, more fervent, when they are in the public house and the farther they are away from the Border.  I must confess that it saddens me when I hear young people&mdash;and I have heard them &mdash;say, &ldquo;That is the stuff to give them&rdquo;, without any feeling whatsoever for the wife of the man who was killed or the husband of the wife who was killed or for the young child or the aunt or relative who was killed.</P>
    <P>Because approximately 400 have died we do not look at the names any <Col N="1584" /> more, just notice the fact that five were killed yesterday.  We seldom if ever think of the suffering, the sorrow, the sadness in a household because five were killed, whether it is the family of a British soldier or a Derry Catholic or a Belfast Protestant.  All these things are happening because there has been tacit support and on many occasions open support for those people who perpetrate such violence.</P>
    <P>I do not think enough politicians in this House have spoken up.  The Taoiseach speaks on occasions.  Deputy Cosgrave speaks.  I speak on an occasion like this.  I realise that everybody cannot have an opportunity to speak. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien speaks.  Many of my party such as those sitting here today speak.  The Tánaiste has spoken. But, there are other people and I should like to know what their views are.  I do not want to specify any particular persons.  We should all be one in this.  Do not let anybody be under the impression that the EEC vote was one of absolute condemnation of the men of violence.  That may have been part of the message.  We just cannot take it for granted that there are not many people in this country who gave, as I say, tacit approval to what has been done, and done in their name. We have to decide what we should do down here.  I believe I have only five minutes more.</P>

      <P>It is vital.  I do not want to elaborate or go into detail. We should provide, as I have said time and again, for a new Constitution as a gesture of our good faith. There is a sense of urgency about this.  May I say also that this will not necessarily provide for peace or unity. It is an absolute necessity that it should be done but it will not be the absolute solution.  We still have this situation in the North that there are two communities with two different political aspirations, one section of the community that want to be attached to the United Kingdom and the others, or a majority of them, who want to be part of a united Ireland. There must be the elimination of differences <Col N="1585" /> in social security, in education, health, housing.  I could list all the disparities that there are in the various social welfare benefits and health benefits between the North and here.  They are big indeed.</P>
      <P>All of us know from personal experience that if we talk to nationalist Catholics in the North and ask them would they swop places now, they would say immediately &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  You ask them why, particularly the unemployed man in Derry, and he replies, &ldquo;Because we get so many pounds and if we came down here we would get less.&rdquo;  I know there is suffering in between and it may be attractive to some people to come down here and suffer the loss of £2 or £3 and adjust their way of living.  These disparities and others in our Constitution are a barrier to the unity of the country and, to a certain extent, a barrier to peace.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote figures to illustrate these disparities.  In the North of Ireland a married man with two children who is out of work can expect to get £13.25p.  In the Republic he gets only £10.  There are other vast differences.  Somebody will say that this is the result of subsidisation by the British Government.  It does not make any difference where it comes from as far as these people are concerned. They get more and if they came down here they would get less.</P>
      <P>In respect of social welfare, education, health and housing, in particular, we spend far less per head of the population&mdash;far less in total&mdash;than they do in the North.  Even these changes if we were to make them here today would not solve the problem.  We are all Irishmen, North and South.  We are living on the same island.  I do not believe that violence will solve our differences.  It will further alienate the two communities, and now in a situation which is much more bitter than it was before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Northern Protestant or Unionist has much more in common with us than he has with the British.  This is the germ of the solution. We all regard ourselves as Irishmen, perhaps different types of Irishmen, but we are all of the same island <Col N="1586" /> and all of the same nationality.  We would not want unity achieved through violence.  I do not think any man in his right senses would, because it would be an artificial unity, a short-lived unity.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, as far as my party is concerned, it must be made clear that the IRA do not negotiate for the people either North or South and there is no shred of evidence that they do.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I met five courageous women from Derry, five mothers.  One of them was a widow who has seven children.  Between the five, they had 33 children.  Although they showed the usual good humour of the Northern people, one could detect a sadness when they spoke of the environment in which their children were being reared. Having spoken to these five mothers for quite a long while, the message I got was that their society was being ruined.  They made it clear to me and to Deputy Cruise-O'Brien who was with me that they wanted peace; they wanted to stay in Derry; they wanted the unity of Ireland&mdash;they did not want it now.  The vital thing as far as they were concerned was peace, the sort of peace which would allow them to go to the church, to go into a shop without fear of being bombed.  They wanted peace so that they could visit their friends at any time.  They wanted peace in order to ensure that their children would not be brought up as bombers and killers.  They wanted peace in order to ensure that the economy of Derry would be restored and would not be destroyed as it has been in the last three months.  If these five mothers had the opportunity of addressing this House, they would convince those who are on the fringe of support for men of violence and they would change their minds for them very quickly indeed.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my encouragement to the talks now being proposed between Mr. Whitelaw and the Social Democratic and Labour Party.  I do not know whether it was a different situation or a different atmosphere, but last week I was at a Congress in Galway where there were about 450 trade unionists.  Of those 450 <Col N="1587" /> trade unionists I suppose 100 to 150 were from the North of Ireland.  They were from the shipyards; they were from Derry, Portadown, Armagh, Portrush. At Congress they could talk about the North rationally and could agree that the only solution was a peaceful one.  There they could talk about wages, health services and employment and the matters that concern the ordinary people.  If that spirit could be engendered into some of the mad politicians in the North, then there might be some hope.  There is no real hate in the heart of the worker in the North against the man in the South and there should not be that hate between any politicians in the North.</P>
    <P>No matter what the conclusion to violence may be, no matter how many lives are lost, there must be a political solution; otherwise there will be anarchy and that could be repeated down here.  We had an example of that last Sunday in the Curragh.  People North or South do not want anarchy. I believe that this could and must be determined by a general election.  As I said, I do not accept the significance of the interpretation put on the EEC result.  It is obvious that the policy of non-violence which has been adopted by all parties down here is not acceptable to the IRA.  If they think we do not speak for a majority of the people or if they believe they speak for a majority, that can be tested out at a general election, the issue being the bomb versus the ballot.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach agreed to a general election I would welcome it.  Then let these people who call themselves Provos and these people who call themselves Officials put themselves before the Irish people and let judgment be made on them.  Too many things have happened since June, 1969, and if they want to enter a contest there is the by-election in mid-Cork. The people should now have their voice heard and should speak out clearly, as indeed is the responsibility of politicians North and South.  They should make it clear that violence will not succeed and the important thing now is to secure peace in the North of Ireland, justice and eventually unity.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with Deputy Corish when he says the referendum did not demonstrate the complete lack of support for the two Sinn Féin groups in this country. Granted that those who are opposed to our joining the EEC consisted of people with genuine objections, nevertheless, from my observation of the referendum it was absolutely clear, particularly in the areas close to the Border, that the entire propaganda was directed not to the economic problems of the EEC and its advantages or disadvantages, but solely to the question of not joining the EEC for the reasons stated by the two Sinn Féin parties.  In the Border areas of my constituency the vote was somewhere in the region of 90 per cent in favour of joining the EEC.  In the Border areas there had been resentment and frustration created by the cratering of roads, by the conflict that took place at the Border, and by the general feeling of resentment against British Army tactics, but nevertheless the people, when they actually voted, made it absolutely clear to us in Monaghan that they were totally opposed to a policy of violence, and I do not think we need to have a general election in order to establish this fact.</P>
      <P>The IRA, of course, have been inflated in their importance down here by the mass media.  Everything has been done to build up their image, to exaggerate their claims to popularity, and the truth about it is that violence as a method of solving the problem of the North has no measurable support among our people.  Our people recognise that a military solution is not one that will ever bring peace or happiness to the people in the North or an understanding between the people of the North and the South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1925, all parties in the Dáil have continuously decried military action in relation to any internal political objectives and this record has been absolutely unbroken.  I think that for the benefit of the younger generation who know little of our history the allegations by the Sinn Féin groups that the Truce was wrong in 1921 should be refuted.  The Truce came in 1921 because the people wanted peace.  There was the chance for negotiation.  The <Col N="1589" /> Army of the day obeyed the Government, and when I speak of the IRA of those days I speak of an organisation with totally different objectives, with totally different conduct and totally different ideas from any group bearing the same name that operates today.</P>
    <P>We have also had references as though there should be some comparison between the conflict in the North and the events of the tragic Civil War, and let us be honest about that. The Civil War ended because the people wanted peace, as they do now in the North.  It ended because a majority of the people were quite evidently in favour of the Treaty settlement. It started because there was a belief that the people would support the living Republic, and my father, in his last statements, I think, spoke for the Irish people when he said that never again should there be a Civil War in this country for the attainment of any political objectives.</P>
    <P>We now see a terrifying picture in the North and I thought it would be well to reflect back on the events that have taken place since 1968 and relate them to the present situation.  From 1968 to the first half of 1970 we had the Civil Rights movement breaking a sterile nationalist position that had lasted for nearly 50 years.  As a result of the riots in Derry we had the Cameron and Hunt reports.  These were British reports which made it quite clear that the local security forces were not acting in the interests of justice.  We had the civil rights declarations which were in themselves, if inadequate, an advance on anything that has been suggested by the British Government over a period of 50 years, breaking new ground, indicating a new initiative.</P>
    <P>We then had the divisions within the Unionist Party and the rise of the hardline Unionist movement, making the real implementation of these civil rights almost impossible without further steps taken by the British Government. We have to admit that there was a seed bed of violence created in the North through the deprivations of the minority, deprivations which lasted over 50 years.  This is quite evident from a study of the period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> We then had the position that protection of the minority against sectarian violence arrived too late.  But, having said all that, and looking at the last 50 years of our history, it has to be admitted that the progress of the civil rights movement was phenomonal. Everything was in their favour.  There may have been divisions in their midst. They were a new and untried organisation. They appeared at times to be divisive, but here was an organisation which had been in operation for only two years already breaking new ground, already establishing new precedents and already extracting from the British Government declarations in regard to the rights of the minority that had not been bespoken by them for a period of over 50 years.  Everything was in favour of the further progress of this movement.  They had an unlimited capacity to demonstrate to the British Government by every means, short of violence, that only the hardline Unionists stood in the path of a new type of Northern administration in which the minority could play a meaningful part.  It became evident to everybody that in relation to reunification there must be a two stage operation.  First of all, there must be a new form of Northern administration which would be essential to further progress and, when the Unionists had accepted this new way of life, it would then be easier for them and for the minority to consider the possibilities of reunification.  That was evident to everyone in the community at that time.</P>
    <P>Then, in 1970, there came the first IRA shots, coming admittedly from the seed bed of violence that had been created over a long period of years.  At that time they were small in number in the IRA.  The effect of this action diverted the attention of the British at that time from the only potentially violent troublemakers, the hardline Unionists.  It created a new atmosphere of doubt in Britain and it helped to build up the hardline Unionist forces still further.  Then came the fatal British reaction, dictated by Stormont, of over-repressive military activity, leading to interment.  It is true to say that the Security Committee in the Stormont Government sowed the dragon's <Col N="1591" /> teeth themselves which resulted in more and more armed men appearing on the scene and these armed men expanded in their influence and in their domination of the communities in which they lived.</P>
    <P>The influence of the civil rights movement became diminished and that movement had to concentrate their activities largely on persuading the British Government that their military over-kill was having the wrong effect, that it was breeding more violence, that the brutality of the British troops and the internment procedures would not result in the coming of peace.  The civil rights movement went on to speak of the new form of administration that must be brought about.  It is true to say that the initiatives that were demanded of the British Government by the Taoiseach and by Deputies in this House came too late, but the Taoiseach will be remembered in history for his efforts to bring about these initiatives and for his efforts in establishing the right of the Government of the South to participate in major discussions related to the final solution of the problem of re-unification. The initiatives came very late after long periods of violence and counter-violence but the initiatives were quite obviously practicable.  They included all the recommendations made by the Taoiseach and supported in this House.  There was one missing, namely, that the British Government should encourage the Unionists to think of re-unification as a long-term objective on the basis that the majority of them must give their consent before it would be possible to have a republic of the kind we would wish for in this country.</P>
    <P>That is a very brief description of the events.  Then, when the truce came, it was welcomed by the vast majority of the Irish people and Mr. Whitelaw had the support of the vast majority of the Irish people in his efforts to bring about peace as, we hope, he will have their support later in his efforts to establish a new form of administration in the North.  If Mr. Whitelaw made any mistakes in his judgments he should have been given ample time to reconsider his policy because, if he was not given ample time, there was the <Col N="1592" /> danger of a cataclysm.  He should have been given ample time and opportunity to take whatever action seemed necessary in order to ensure that he was acting with impartiality.  He came, too late on the scene, to an explosive situation, with violent men on both sides, and it was criminal on the part of forces on both sides to deny him the opportunity of being able to ensure that peace could be maintained.  We regard the breach of the truce as catastrophic and as merely an incitement to Unionist violence.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment now on what the people in the pubs and elsewhere were saying: in some way or other the IRA in the North were going to contribute towards a more immediate settlement.  There were plenty of people of every political hue who said that, perhaps, the IRA did help to bring about some change in the attitude of the British Government. We know from what happened within the last few days how wrong these people were in their attitude.  The IRA by their bombing campaign, by establishing some 30,000 claims for malicious damage, have hardened the minds of the Unionists and have postponed all possibility of dialogue on the subject of reunification.</P>

      <P>They have immensely stimulated Unionist hostility and made the possibility of a peaceful settlement now more difficult than ever. People are quite entitled to suggest that we should publish some form of an ideal constitution and make a series of political declarations on what might be regarded as the various forms of political structures which together would bring about reunification.  That may be a matter for argument but surely we can all agree here that, whether or not we publish these declarations, unless and until the Unionists and the Nationalists can establish some agreed form of administration, communicate with each other and work with each other, there can be no hope for a final solution of the partition problem.  The only way that re-unification can be achieved is, first, if it can be demonstrated that the people of <Col N="1593" /> the North can live together and work together in a form of administration where the minority play an Executive part.  When they talk, have dialogue and co-operate, it will then be time to consider what form of re-unification might be to their advantage, but to imagine that the mere publication of an ideal Constitution and political structures attached to it would at this moment have an effect in the North in relation to bringing about peace or to fulfilling the initiatives proposed by the British Government is sheer lunacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy of brinkmanship in relation to what is virtually civil war already is horrifying.  In relation to the future of the North, <Col N="1594" /> both the UDA and the IRA should take the initiatives.  They have nothing to lose but everything to gain because there can be no future in the kind of violence and potential violence that dominates the scene in the Six Counties.</P>
      <P>It has been said by commentators in the press that the Taoiseach's position has been weakened because Mr. Whitelaw met the IRA.  I wish to deal with that statement.  I cannot comment in detail on Mr. Whitelaw's decision in regard to this matter.  He arrived too late with his initiatives.  He was supported by all parties in the House of Commons, something very rare in British history in relation to Irish affairs.  The shock to the Unionists of the proroguing of Stormont was tremendously severe.  Obviously it was madness to continue bombings and shootings while the Unionists were asked to accept the fundamental change in their old position, in the position to which they had been accustomed for half a century.  Mr. Whitelaw faced a desperate situation.  He has not received support from the IRA in the North in regard to policy.  They have published their policy and that policy is not acceptable to us.  We have made it clear that while we recognise the historic right to unity we do not want one million embittered Unionists to participate in a hideously sundered Irish Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The IRA have made it clear that they do not accept the policy of the vast majority here.  They have no political mandate.  No doubt, Mr. Whitelaw in his hour of despair, wished to ensure that lack of communication should not be charged against him in trying to avert what could become a ghastly civil war, a civil war without meaning and without any possibility of a fruitful result.  The position here is that we are opposed unanimously to private armies both North and South. There are two guerilla groups who, in their speeches, have declared their total non-recognition of the sovereignty of the people in both parts of the country. They have made this very clear.  Both groups advocate social policies that are not acceptable to the vast majority of the Irish people.  I note that in a recent statement, the Provisionals introduced <Col N="1595" /> Marxian doctrine in a series of vague phrases one of which referred to the control by the people of the means of production, exchange and distribution. The phrase concluded with the words: &ldquo;there will be little place for private enterprise in our system&rdquo;.  I fail to see the differences in their general social policies which has been referred to so often by them.</P>
    <P>However, the main point is that we know that we cannot persuade the IRA, by personal contact, to accept the democratic processes either in this part of the country or in the North. We continue our policy of refusing to accept violence as a method of solving the problems of the North.  We continue also our refusal to accept the right of any illegal organisation to try to alter the pattern of our society by violent means.  We are continuing the policy of trying in the special courts anyone, regardless of his address, who can be convicted of illegal actions in this part of the country.  Therefore, I fail to see that either the influence of the Taoiseach or of this House has been affected by the actions of Mr. Whitelaw who in a moment of despair thought he might be able to avert a desperate civil conflict. We do not have two private armies opposing each other in this part of the country.  We have none of the problems that resulted in Mr. Whitelaw's action.</P>
    <P>I follow Deputy Corish in expressing the hope that the moderates in the North on both sides will speak up; otherwise, there will be disaster.  I hope that the example of the five courageous women will be followed many times over because there is too much silence by the great majority of the people in the North who are seeking peace.  One would imagine that in whole areas of Belfast and Derry almost everyone was supporting the use of violence.  I know from people who have come down here that this is not true.  The vast majority of people in Ballymurphy want peace but they are intimidated by violent methods in expressing their views.  I hope that the Nationalist parties will consolidate to a greater extent.  I have commended the work of the civil rights movement, and I hope that in this hour of danger and of possible <Col N="1596" /> civil war there will be further consolidation among the various groups in the North, led by the SDLP, in favour of a peaceful settlement.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by saying that the unity that is so evident in this House, with the exception of three or four people, on the subject of partition, is something which will be to our great advantage.  There have been many divisions in the past in what should be our relationship with Great Britain.  There have been many divisions on the methods of conducting political campaigns but the unity that has been shown since 1969 on the subject of how to achieve re-unification, on the need for maintaining peaceful methods, on the need for rejecting all concepts of violence, is something which will be commended by historians at a later date.  I hope we will continue to have this unified attitude towards the solution of this problem.  I suppose that peace will only be brought about in the North if people even stop thinking purely in terms of political parties. Unless hundreds of thousands of people decide to communicate with each other, decide that there can be no future in the appalling bitterness now shown in the relationships between the two opposing parties, unless there is an end to this bitterness there can be no future. I do not believe that either the Unionist Party or the SDLP or any other parties can, by waving wands or making speeches, bring about peace.  This is a matter for the individual wills of all the people in the North, who, by now, should realise the hopelessness of mere bitterness, mere hatred, neighbour against neighbour.</P>
    <P>I know from talking to clergy of all denominations that there is a tremendous groundswell of community feeling in the North never published in the newspapers or by the mass media but which is demonstrated every day in whole areas of the North in spite of the appalling tensions that also exist. Admittedly, recent events have perhaps diminished the force of this community feeling, but it still exists and the clergy and all leaders who have been trying to sustain this feeling must be praised for their work.  In the growth of this community feeling lies the possibility <Col N="1597" /> of at least an eventual settlement so that the two communities in the North are to live at peace with each other.</P>

      <P>When Cassius Clay or Muhammed Ali&mdash;he actually gave me a pen as a souvenir&mdash;was here last night he said we were very decent people.  I would hold that view.  We can agree with any type of religious people from anywhere.  I mention this because the Minister has spent all his time speaking of the North as a question between Protestants and Catholics. I do not believe in that.  Religion makes no difference to me&mdash;I suppose because I have so little of it myself. It is absolutely ludicrous that Hindus or people of any other religion can come into the North but Catholics get into trouble.  It makes no sense.  But it would be unfair not to paint the other side of the picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was at a meeting about community schools in Erris recently when a young priest said he could not support this idea of community schools because there was a possibility of religious contamination. I see John Healy up there and he must know how truthful I am. In the whole barony of Erris there were two Protestants, two women over 70 and I do not think even the British Army could succeed in expanding that population.  But that statement was made and the speaker &ldquo;got it from me&rdquo;.  That was only fair; I cannot tolerate religious discrimination or class distinction.  If we could eliminate class distinction we would do a good day's work.  The Ceann Comhairle knows as well as I do that if I have two children, one going to the vocational school and the other to secondary school the secondary school student is a step above the common, and the poor fellow going to the vocational school would be looked down on.  It is time to integrate all schools and time to come down to earth and conform to the practice in the remainder of the world.  This we have failed to do for a long time.  I do not think we have altered very much from the time of the druids.  The debate up to now reminds me of the activities of a certain bird which goes around in ever-diminishing circles.  I do not know <Col N="1598" /> how many Deputies know what happens eventually but if they wish to consult me outside I shall tell them.</P>
    <P>We are a nation of laws and orders but the implementation of the law is a different matter.  We have so many orders now that there can be very little room left in the Statute Book unless it is twice as big as the Bible.  Every Minister who came into the House apparently had the ambition to get his name stamped on some law or order while he was here.  Some of them had such shaky foundations that they had to do it pretty rapidly and it is now obvious that some of these jobs were done pretty rapidly.</P>
    <P>Nobody has more sympathy for the Northern Ireland people than I have but to a great extent they are the cause of their own destruction, if that is the proper word to use.  When we took thousands of them across the Border and offered them sanctuary they wrecked every place they went into. Anybody can go and see Gormanston Camp.  It may have been youngsters who did this and they may not have done it because of any vindictive antitude to us, but it is sad when we must believe that youngsters are reared in that kind of atmosphere in the North. We chastise our children, but it seems that in the North very little is done in that regard.</P>
    <P>My opinion, like that of the Tánaiste, is that nobody wants violence. We are entitled to have this island united and as one.  If there is to be a vote on this issue and if anybody is to heed Willie Whitewash's referendum in the North it would be completely misleading because it would be biased from the beginning.  If we want a decision by the people of Ireland it is essential that if this referendum is held in the North we, whether we be clowns or not, hold a referendum on the very same subject worded in the same way on the same day.  Then Mr. Whitelaw will get his answer.</P>
    <P>If the smart alecks in the North want fun there is no reason in the world why they should not get it.  We beat them down here by two to one.  During the years 1939 to 1945 if we were able to produce the number of troops&mdash;and I was in the Army myself&mdash;we claim we had, many of them must still be <Col N="1599" /> alive like myself and fairly active and we are well able to train others.  If they want fun let them get it.</P>
    <P>Let the British get out of our country. They have been chased out of every other country in the world.  It is time we got rid of them and, no matter what we have to do to get rid of them, we will do it.  While I do not exactly agree with some of the ideas of some Donegal Deputies, I believe that it is time we sent these gentlemen back to where they came from, namely, Scotland. Let them get back to Scotland and let them send back the million of our people who are over there.  Send our people back to the North and let them take over in Scotland.  Let them get back to their own native land. That is about the fairest way of dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>This cannot go on forever.  It is all right to listen to the kind of bunkum and nonsense which go on in the North, but one of these days the people of the South will lose their tempers.  They beat the British before with only stolen Enfield rifles, and they will beat them again today if necessary.  This was the first small country in the world to gain independence and, if we cannot make ourselves completely independent, that will not be the fault of some of us.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons given why we cannot have complete independence is the Constitution.  I do not know how many Deputies ever saw or read the Constitution.  It always reminds me of a whole dose of bits and pieces out of the Bible or the Koran.  Politically, it makes very little sense.  We have to face reality.  If a Muslim or a Hindu comes here, we do not obstruct his activities. An Egyptian can come here with six wives.  It is unfair to us that we are tied to one.  I admit that and I am sure any married man in the House will admit it.  That is the position.  The thing is so absurd and draft&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not see any wives though.  I am sure that every Deputy realises that this is a whole set of absurdities.  An Irishman cannot <Col N="1600" /> commit bigamy but an Egyptian can commit trigamy or quadronomy, if there is such a word, in this country and no action can be taken against him.  We are going around in circles. It is like the question of contraception. We cannot get permission for contraception. I am sure every man has been practising contraception since the time of Adam.  The whole thing is a joke. Very few people have the guts and say this out openly.  I am not worried.  What is contraception?  There are so many ways of dealing with it that is is no wonder the poor Northern Protestants are up the walls.  They do not know what is going on down here.  If they had any sense they would see the joke because, if the men in the South were not practising contraception, the population would have doubled long ago.  It may not have occurred to Deputies that, in the 50 years previous to 1847, the population of this country doubled.  That took a bit of doing but it did happen.  I do not know how many Deputies go back and look up the records.</P>
      <P>One of the other excuses for Northerners not wishing to come in here is that our social welfare benefits are not up to the standards in the North and in England.  They have improved here.  The man who made the biggest attack on our social welfare benefits is the man who in seven years gave an unprecedented increase of 2s 6d a week to the unfortunate pensioners.  Then he comes in here and attacks the Taoiseach and the Parliamentary Secretary. That is more codology.  I do not know how Deputies can stand idly by and tolerate that type of bunkum.  I would not tolerate it for five minutes.  Fine Gael are on the far side of the House since 1931 and trying to get across.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was decent enough to give me the special allowance of 55s for old age pensioners. Originally it covered daughters only, but now it covers sons as well. There is one slight flaw in the scheme. Most Deputies would not even dream of it and I thought of it only recently. In many cases the people who are looking after old people could be regarded as adopted.  They were taken out of homes.  Once a child passes a certain <Col N="1601" /> age the child cannot be adopted.  If a child was taken out of a home and kept for years surely the child should be regarded as adopted for the purposes of social welfare.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that.  It is a rather academic case, I admit.  It is only in recent times that people got used to the adoption laws and began to put them into force.  If the child is over a certain age the child cannot be adopted.</P>

      <P>I know a few of these cases and it is time something was done about them.  It is a rather minor matter and I am sure it would not rob the Department.</P>
      <P>I want to deal now with economics, or the lack of them.  The Taoiseach was talking about economy but I do not know whether it was economy or the lack of economy.  The economy is all on this side of the country.  It is on the Dublin side and the Cork side, but there is not much of it down in my end of the country.  Some steps should be taken to deal with the western areas. Appointing a Gaeltacht county council is only a farce as any sane man must realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely in view of the amount of money being squandered, instead of spent, it should be possible to provide us in the west with the funds to improve our territory.  I am not blaming the Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister, who I must say have been very fair to me.  I know very well that it is very hard to induce an industrialist into an area where the people have not been used to industry and we all know that the people from that territory do not go into factories when they go away.  That is bound to have tremendous effects on the introduction of industry but my friend Deputy Gallagher was able to introduce industry into the area and to succeed. Seeing that it could be done there it can be done elsewhere and he might be inclined to come into my county. A crowd came to me recently who wanted to set up an air strip.  Do you think I could get the land?  Even after spending two days flying around over it.  I do not know yet if I got a place <Col N="1602" /> for a snipe to land.  I know there are difficulties and we have our local problems but I think that instead of leaving matter to officials, Ministers should come in and have a special look at affairs.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission is the greatest fraud of all.  It was set up in 1924 or 1925 to divide land but there is more land undivided now that there was in 1925 and however they were in 1925, they are twice as bad now.  Ministers should go out and take a personal look at affairs.  I suppose the fishing industry would be one of the most important in my territory and in spite of the bad weather, these men are doing all right and I know that Bord Iascaigh Mhara have been reasonably fair to them but they have made mistakes too.  They are being codded by people and, for instance, one man under five different names can have five votes which is not fair to his neighbours and you can be sure that the man with these votes has to be a rich man.</P>
    <P>With regard to hotels, the Government pursued the policy for years of subsidising the erection of hotels and I said years ago that it was the daftest thing ever done, that the day would come when they would be white elephants. How right I was must now be clear.  If the business was lucrative, if there was money in it, why would the Government have to put up huge grants for hotels, but did you ever see the Government putting up grants for a publichouse?  Why should they put them up for hotels?  It was one of the greatest pieces of absurdity ever engaged in because they now have more hotels than tourists.  The North is blamed but blaming the North is a joke.  It has nothing to do with it. The reason for the hotel situation is the absurd prices being charged by hotels in this country.  I reckoned on one occasion that, according to the price I paid for a very small piece of steak, the animal from which it came cost £7,380.  That was how I worked it out and I do not go to dear hotels, although I would very much like to go to one of them.  I weighed that piece of steak and it was not even a quarter of a pound but I was charged 19s 6d for this.  I had nothing else, <Col N="1603" /> and that was two years ago.  They are probably at Dublin prices at that rate.</P>
    <P>It is thrown at the farmer that he is getting a big price for his animals. There are big prices but what is the knacker who is abusing this animal afterwards and selling it to the public getting?  It is time price control came in because food prices have gone absolutely mad and it is time somebody controlled them.  You can go into five different shops in this city and pay five different prices for the same article.</P>
    <P>On the subject of VAT, I had a row with the Minister last night and I am still not sure what answer he gave me, but if the position is that every shopkeeper in this country will have to keep accounts to deal with this VAT 72, how is he going to get on?  We had the VAT 69 which is going off the market because it was a very poor brand of whiskey but under the new VAT 72, how can an ordinary publican like myself keep accounts?  The Minister did tell me last night that we will be in the same position under VAT as we were under TOT and you know the trouble I got into over TOT.  The Minister did not answer me directly here but he told me privately, and I made a bargain with him that I would vote with the Government on the strength of the fact that he told me that the two positions were the same. If they are, I suppose we can get over it, but it is very important that the point should be cleared up because it is going to cause tremendous trouble. It is all right for me to vote here to pass a Bill I never even looked at, but it is a completely different matter when I, my wife and family and all the other people in the town have to keep accounts.  This is an area where I am the only accountant and I do not work at that job any longer.  This is a very important matter for many men.  If what the Minister told me last night is not true there will be thousands of small business people out of business in a very short time.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remind the Taoiseach and the Minister of this matter, if and when they return to the House.  It is not that it makes so much difference to me but <Col N="1604" /> it does make a difference to the small shopkeeper.  You, sir, know the country I am talking about.  The area in which you live is similar to the area that I live in.  I am taking the Minister at his word, that we are back in the same street.  I hope this is true.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Estimate is wide-ranging.  On this occasion, due to the time limit imposed, it is not possible for a Deputy to give a detailed analysis of the performance of the Government and of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>Already, the Leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, has clearly and emphatically outlined the thinking, the attitude and the philosophy of this party in relation to the awful tragedy that is taking place in the North of Ireland.  He spelled out clearly and emphatically the attitude of this party towards the maintenance of law and order in this country and the security of the State.  I do not intend to repeat what Deputy Cosgrave has said.  I wish merely to endorse everything he said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many national problems which could be dealt with in this debate.  The Leader of our party, in the brief time at his disposal, referred to such issues as the VAT tax, the educational policy of the Government, and so forth.  I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without mentioning another major national issue which has been publicly debated both in this House and outside it for the last 12 months.  I refer to, and make no apology for referring to, the landing rights issue.  In the first week of August, 1971, it became apparent that the American Government would intensify their efforts to secure landing rights at Dublin Airport for the American carriers.  The reaction of the Government here was to send a Civil Service mission to Washington in the early days of August, 1971.  That was a fatal blunder.  That decision should never have been taken by the Government because the situation was then quite clearly so serious that much more than a Civil Service delegation to Washington was called for.  That delegation got nowhere.  They had just returned to this country when the American Government <Col N="1605" /> issued an ultimatum that unless the American carries were allowed into Dublin, New York would be closed to our airlines as from 18th August. We have lived with this situation for 12 months.  It has been debated at length.  It has been raised in this House week after week.  It has caused concern to thousands of people, particularly in the western part of Ireland.  There are only five or six weeks to go to the expiry date of this ultimatum, that is, 18th August, and we do not know what the Government are doing about it or what they have been doing about it. There has been only the speculation and forecasting that has appeared in the newspapers day after day.</P>
    <P>This is an appalling state of affairs. I am deliberately raising this matter because I hope that I will provoke the Taoiseach, when he is replying to the debate tomorrow night, into giving some indication of what has happened behind closed doors since last November.  We are entitled to know the position.  Yesterday, the Minister for Transport and Power said that the negotiations were at a very delicate stage.  This is bluff and nonsense.  The people whose livelihood could be seriously affected by any decision reached are entitled to know now the exact position.</P>
    <P>I said here yesterday and I repeat, and I challenge the Taoiseach to deny it, that this whole matter has been signed, sealed and delivered and that the Government are waiting until the Dáil recesses to make the announcement.</P>
    <P>This issue of landing rights, which has caused grave concern, has been bungled, botched and badly messed up by the Government.  The Taoiseach in particular has handled this situation extremely unwisely.  When the ultimatum was presented to the Government last August there was no reaction on the part of the Taoiseach or on the part of any Government Minister.  It was not until November, following continuous demands for action, that the Taoiseach intervened with President Nixon.  I welcomed that intervention at that time but we were not satisfied with the results.  Since last November appeals have been made to the <Col N="1606" /> Taoiseach and to the Government to take action.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Regional Action Committee and everybody connected with this matter have been consistent, as I have been, in the belief that if, when this ultimatum was issued by the American Government last August, the Taoiseach and the Government here had reacted in a courageous and determined manner and had rejected the ultimatum, and had mobilised and informed public opinion here and in the United States, the US Government would have withdrawn the ultimatum. This could have been done by making public opinion here and among the Irish population in the US aware of the implications of the American demand not merely for Shannon, but for the entire west of Ireland, for the tourist industry and for the national airline.</P>
    <P>Some scribes in certain newspapers, particularly in one newspaper, have referred to this as a parish pump issue and said that those who have been deeply concerned about it were merely playing politics and being emotional about it.  This is not a parish pump issue.  This is a very serious national issue and one which can have very serious repercussions on the massive State investment at Shannon and on the livelihood of many thousands of people who are employed down there, for the tourist industry, particularly on the west coast on which the western economy is vitally dependent.</P>
    <P>The dilly dallying, the huggermugger, the talk of negotiations and bargaining that has been going on behind closed doors since last November is an absolute disgrace.  So-called experts can now tell one freely that a deal has already been done, that American airlines are going into Dublin, that the Government are waiting to get some face-saving concessions from the Americans.  I want to warn the Taoiseach, and I make no apology for doing so, that any decision or agreement which he and the Government make with the United States Government in relation to this issue which will permit even one United States carrier into Dublin, even on a restricted basis, will be tantamount to selling out the Shannon region and the tourist industry <Col N="1607" /> in the western part of the country.</P>
    <P>While we do not alway agree with, or take seriously, what Deputy Joe Lenehan says, nevertheless I think he is genuinely concerned about the west of Ireland and its development.  Here we have a situation which threatens the one major asset that the entire western half of the country has, that is, Shannon Airport.  The only way in which the interests of the Shannon region, of the west of Ireland and of the national tourist industry can be safeguarded is by maintaining the existing bilateral air agreement.</P>
    <P>I have done a great deal of research on this matter over the past 12 months, as have the Shannon Regional Action Committee.  The Shannon Regional Action Committee are an outstanding example of men of courage and determination, of people who are committed to the west of Ireland, people who have given up their time voluntarily, who have travelled in the United States at their own expense because they believe that it is vital to the west of Ireland that the <i>status quo</i> of Shannon Airport be maintained.</P>
    <P>If the United States carriers are admitted into Dublin, I forecast that by the end of this decade there will be a loss of a minimum of one thousand jobs in the Shannon region.  The Government have failed to face up in a realistic, aggressive and courageous manner to this outrageous act of aggression by the United States Government. The Government have sat back and done absolutely nothing to fight off this threat and to persuade the American Government to withdraw their ultimatum.  I am convinced that if a proper approach were made to the American Government, if the Taoiseach himself had displayed proper leadership in this matter, if he had seen to it that the two Ministers in his Cabinet who are most concerned in this matter, that is, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery and the Minister for Transport and Power, Deputy Lenihan, had done their jobs properly, the American Government could have been persuaded to withdraw this ultimatum.</P>
    <P>It is significant that we have been <Col N="1608" /> living with this situation for 12 months, a situation which has put fear into the hearts of hundreds of workers in the Shannon area, which is causing serious difficulty to the national airline, and which is upsetting the tourist industry, and yet no real attempt has been made by the Government to resolve the situation.  If some of the Ministers had gone to the United States and mobilised public opinion there, put them into the picture and given them a proper understanding of what their Government were attempting to do to a small country like ours, with a small airline which is going through the most difficult period in its history, surely in view of the very close ties that have view of the very close ties that have always bound the Irish and the American nations, it would have been possible to get the Americans to withdraw this ultimatum and allow the existing bilateral air agreement to stand.</P>
    <P>I regret to have to say that I think the Taoiseach and his Government have badly botched up the situation. It has been badly handled since this time 12 months ago when it became evident that the Americans were going to put on the pressure.  I also deplore the continued persistence of the American Government in this matter. I am not in any way trying to mini-mise or under-estimate the pressure that the American Government mounted in relation to this issue.</P>
    <P>Neither am I trying to convey the idea that it would have been an easy job for the Taoiseach and the Government to withstand the ultimatum or persuade the Americans to withdraw it.  Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Taoiseach and the Government left themselves wide open to an accusation of inactivity in this matter and the worst indication of this lackadaisical attitude was when the Minister for Transport and Power funked travelling with the Civil Service delegation which went to Washington last November to discuss the matter.  Had he gone he could have done a considerable amount of good by mobilising public opinion and explaining to the American people why we were worried.</P>
    <P>Now the Dáil is going into recess <Col N="1609" /> the deadline of the 18th August is almost upon us.  I understand that the Governor of California, Mr. Ronald Regan, is on a goodwill tour of Europe as a personal emissary of President Nixon.  I understand that he will visit this country within the next week or so.  I appeal to the Taoiseach, at this 11th hour, with doomsday upon us, to convey to Governor Regan the deep concern of the Government, the Dáil and the many thousands of people involved, particularly in the western half of the country, at the present situation. If the Taoiseach makes a final effort now I have no doubt but that the situation can be saved, the <i>status quo</i> maintained and the Americans persuaded to lift the ultimatum.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach does not do this he will be selling the western half of the country down the drain and all the talk about decentralisation and the transfer of Government Departments to the West, and elsewhere, and the commitment of the Government to the concept of western development will be made a mockery of.  When the Taoiseach comes to reply I would ask him, on behalf of the thousands of people who are in the dark about this whole issue, the people who have been left in the dark for the last six months or more, to throw some light on the situation, give us some indication of what the attitude of the Government is and what the likely outcome will be.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenehan referred to the tourist industry.  This industry is of vital concern to the west of Ireland.  It is of vital concern to the whole country. Unfortunately, for the last few years, the tourist industry has been confronted with a continuous series of problems. It has been confronted with unprecedented difficulties.  Many of these problems were outside the control of the Government.  The unfortunate troubles in the North have had a very serious impact on tourism, but I reject the idea that the difficulties in the North have been the sole cause of all the difficulties confronting the industry, difficulties leading to a disastrous decline in tourist traffic this year.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport and Power speaks for the Government in relation to the tourist industry.  He has <Col N="1610" /> continuously harped on this one issue. Of course the troubles in the North have affected the industry, but there are other problems.  For far too long the Government have totally ignored the greatest potential tourist market, namely, the 4 million people in Britain of Irish birth and Irish descent.  This year, when all else failed, a determined effort was made to try to encourage our own people in Britain to come home on their holidays.  Like so much else that the Government does, this effort came too late.</P>
    <P>While the troubles in the North have been a serious impediment to the promotion of Irish tourism, particularly in the British market, there are other factors affecting the industry which were within the control of the Government and about which the Government did absolutely nothing.  So far as the British market is concerned the major impediment is the high cost of transport across the Irish Sea.  Despite repeated recommendations and appeals by every sector of the industry to do something about these high transport charges, the Government did practically nothing.  They ignored the recommendation about the introduction of duty free facilities and the granting of special concessions in relation to drink and petrol.</P>
    <P>In this most difficult season for Irish tourism the Government have not taken one new step towards helping the industry. In the budget this year the Minister for Finance mentioned tourism once in 50 or 60 pages of a brief.  There was nothing in the budget designed to help the industry to survive this most difficult year.  I warn the Taoiseach that, unless there is some new thinking by the Government, the tourist industry will head for serious trouble.  It is obvious now that the Government policy in relation to tourism is totally inadequate and unrealistic to enable the industry to overcome its present difficulties.  The major State agency concerned with tourism, Bord Fáilte, are not equipped to meet the colossal challenge that confronts the industry at this time.  There must be a new approach, new policy and much more dynamic and aggressive policy.  I know that at the moment an assessment is <Col N="1611" /> being made of this industry and that a draft development plan is being considered by all sectors of the industry for the years 1972-75.  However, this plan will be no use unless it is acted on by the Government, unless the Government are prepared to provide the industry with the finance and other assistance that will enable it to overcome its difficulties.</P>
    <P>The final point I would like to make comes within the ambit of the Department of Transport and Power.  Now that we are about to join the EEC, our exporters, by reason of our remoteness from the mainland of Europe, will have to bear much higher transport charges than their competitors on the Continent or in Britain.  Therefore it is of vital importance that the Government consider the whole sphere of transport and assess properly our entire transport resources.</P>
    <P>During the past 12 months I have called repeatedly for the formulation of a White Paper on transport.  This White Paper would enable public discussion to take place and would pave the way for the formulation and implementation of a national transport policy.  Transport will play a key role in determining the competitiveness of our exports in the European Communities. No effort must be spared to divide the transport policy which will ensure that our exporters will have available to them the most efficient but lowest-cost transport service that can be devised.</P>
    <P>For some time past, but particularly in recent years, we have been getting a series of un-co-ordinated and patchwork-type transport legislation.  This is not good enough.  I hope that between now and 1st January the Government will perform the very important task of formulating a national transport policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>This must be about the third adjournment debate in which the events in Northern Ireland obtrude on the discussions which, most appropriately, should concern the immediate problems of the economy, problems of employment and of the government of the State in which we live.  However, those of us who wish to <Col N="1612" /> contribute to this debate must devote quite an amount of the time available to the problems of the North of Ireland and to the repercussions of the dreadful events in Northern Ireland on affairs in the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>More appropriately we should be talking of the advisability of presenting the electorate with the choice of alternative government.  There is no doubt that the electorate of the Twenty-six conties must have and are entitled to have the opportunity of a real choice in the next election campaign.  That has been the significance of the speech made by Deputy Corish in June when he declared the readiness of the Labour Party to participate in the provision of an alternative government for the electorate of the Republic.</P>
      <P>We have had government by one group for almost 16 years now. Obviously it is time that the electorate had a choice and the possibility of deciding whether they wished that Government to be returned again or whether they wish to give an opportunity to the Opposition elements in this House to provide a government. The acceptance by the Taoiseach of the Fine Gael motion to move the writ for the Cork by-election gives us that opportunity.  The Taoiseach should follow up that acceptance by him of the Opposition challenge and he should make it clear that the result of the mid-Cork by-election will have an intimate bearing on the calling of an immediate general election.  The logical follow-up of his acceptance of the moving of the writ should be the calling of a general election.  The Taoiseach's predecessor, the late Mr. Lemass, indicated during the mid-Cork by-election of, I think, 1965, that the rejection by the electorate of the Government candidate would result in the calling of a general election.  The Taoiseach should give the same indication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speakers here this morning have said it is important that the various wings of Sinn Féin should put forward candidates in that by-election so that once more the electorate would have the opportunity of deciding whether they wished to support these particular movements, their philosophies and their suggested solutions to the Northern <Col N="1613" /> Ireland problem.  Deputies have said that it would be good for our democracy that such groups should put forward candidates in the by-election.  It is said in one newspaper editorial today that the Taoiseach may have had this in mind in calling the by-election at this time and that he has done so in the hope that this would be an invitation to such groups to field candidates. However, the by-election can serve even a more beneficial result because it is time that this Government decided to test their acceptance by the public.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the referendum was a correct assessment of the Government by the public.  There has been so many interpretations of the result that it is difficult to know what is true.  It certainly proved the people favoured joining EEC, but we are in the dangerous area of surmise if we suggest the result conclusively proves electoral support for this group or that, this policy or the other.  An unambiguous statement by the Taoiseach on the lines of that proposed by his predecessor in mid-Cork that rejection of the Government candidate would mean a general election would be in order.  The country would get a pretty good indication as to whether the electorate wished this Government to continue for the full term or wished to test its support at the polls.</P>
    <P>I share my leader's opinion that the Government itself is in need of renewal of mandate, not simply the Sinn Féiners, but the Government itself.  I accept that the Government have had many problems in the past few years, problems which probably no other Cabinet have faced since the last civil war period in this part of the country and that they have suffered in the competence of their personnel as a result. That party bears the scars of certain mistaken approaches on the Northern policy.  It is time they should test their popularity at the polls.  I hope the Taoiseach will make the Cork by-election the opportunity and that he will indicate clearly to the electorate that this will be no ordinary by-election but a test of whether the Government should continuue through its full term of office.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach need not worry about <Col N="1614" /> not having any substitute or alternative Government in sight.  There is a substitute Government ready to take office and therefore his action could not be seen as irresponsible.  There is a great deal of talent among the present Opposition who have been waiting a long time to get into government and an eagerness to take up that responsibility. I hope in his concluding speech the Taoiseach will more clearly indicate the exact significance he sees in the Cork by-election and what action he would take, depending on the result, so that the electorate in that constituency may fully understand the implications of their votes on election day.</P>
    <P>One must advert to events in Northern Ireland.  The breakdown of the truce was a bitter disappointment to those Irish people north and south who thought it might be possible in conditions of peace to attempt the difficult task of reconciliation and binding up of wounds.</P>
    <P>Nobody really understands whether the truce broke down over the Lenadoon incident alone.  There appears to be a difference of opinion as to whether that incident was sufficiently serious as to necessitate a breakdown.  At any rate the truce apparently has broken down and it seems to be the position that no matter how many condemnations are made&mdash;and I have heard them from priests, Church leaders, and politicians; pledges of peace, community peace groups and so on&mdash;the shootings continue. People call on moderate opinion to condemn the shooting.  It may be a pessimistic interpretation of the situation to say that the men of violence, as they are described, have the whip hand in the situation now and that the remainder of the community, north and south, have the choice of waiting in the abattoir queue for the final slaughter.  That is what is in train now in Northern Ireland&mdash;slaughter.</P>
    <P>I have heard people here and outside question whether, in fact, the Protestant backlash really existed. Obviously, the Provisional IRA wished to test that with the lives of their fellow-citizens in Northern Ireland.  I never doubted that there was sufficient courage on the Protestant side to fight for what they regarded as their heritage <Col N="1615" /> and, unfortunately, that appears to be coming into terrible being at present. There is, in fact, a Protestant guerilla response in the form of the UDA.</P>
    <P>A superficial analysis which produces the arguments behind the Provisionals' armed campaign in the North suggests that British intransigence is the major problem in the area.  It suggests that any problems in the path of unity would disappear with the last British soldier retreating from that part of the country.  I do not suggest that all is angelically white on the British side, but I suggest there is no problem with responsible British opinion at present about getting out of Northern Ireland. That appears to be the majority political view common to both Opposition and Tory Parties.  They have a collective desire to wash their hands of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suggest our problems do not disappear with the disappearance of the British from Northern Ireland.  They have no enthusiasm for incorporating Northern Ireland into the United Kingdom and making the connection even closer.  I believe that majority opinion among British politicians would favour Irish unity.  They can look at the experience of the independent part of Ireland and see that in managing our affairs we have shown little desire to depart from the economic apron strings of Britain.  Therefore, Britain would have little to fear from a United Ireland. We cannot forget&mdash;and this is where the militants, the men of violence, are wrong in their assessment, and terrible the consequence of their error&mdash;that the only resolute opponents of Irish unity, the really dangerous opponents and the ones who have not changed their opposition, are our fellow-Irishmen, the majority in north-east Ulster.</P>
    <P>In assessing the result of the armed campaign of violence people usually say: &ldquo;They succeeded in removing Stormont&rdquo;; in other words, they succeeded in changing opinion in Westminster. As I have suggested, there is no problem in shifting opinion in Westminster; Westminster opinion would be unofficially in favour of Irish unity, but the reality of the problem is that <Col N="1616" /> the people who oppose that unity are in this island.</P>
    <P>If the campaign of violence has contributed&mdash;and I concede that it has contributed to the removal of Stormont&mdash; it has not appreciably altered the terrible reality of opposition on the part of the majority in the North to the unity of the country.  The price of the removal of Stormont is one that we shall have to meet at some stage in the future and it is the total hatred now felt.  Where there was apathy and dislike before on the part of the majority there is now total hatred to the idea of the unity of this country and enmity towards the Republic in particular.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Harte</b> asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will consider giving a subsidy to the ESB to assist in reducing charges for the occupants of mobile homes provided by local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Chomhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 24 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the ESB that, in calculating the terms for supply to any customer, the board take into account not only the revenue which can reasonably be expected from that customer but also the length of time for which that revenue can be expected to continue.  Terms for supply to permanent loads are based on the assumption that the load will remain connected for the same order of time as the life of the network required to supply it.  The minimum network life is in the order of 20 years for overhead lines and is longer in the case of underground cables but in practice, however, loads which can be assumed to have a life of ten years or more <Col N="1633" /> are considered by the board to be permanent for the purpose of calculation of terms for supply.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in recent years it has become quite common for local authorities to provide mobile houses for elderly persons whose houses have deteriorated.  I understand that the basic reason for providing mobile houses rather than permanent structures or even prefabricated houses is that it is foreseen by the local authority that the accommodation will be required for a relatively short period at any location and may be transferred to other locations as the need arises.  In such circumstances the ESB cannot consider that the electricity supply is required on a permanent basis and this is reflected in the terms for supply.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the board's practice in this matter is reasonable and in the interest of electricity consumers generally.  The capital which can be made available for the extension of electricity supply is limited. The ESB must, therefore, make every effort to avoid expenditure which does not show a reasonable prospect of giving an adequate financial return. It is for this reason that the board curtail their capital outlay in the case of temporary supply by seeking capital contributions from the applicants.</P>
    <P>Finally, I might mention that the cost of supplying electricity is to a very large extent governed by the location of the premises to be supplied in relation to the nearest electricity supply point.  It is essential, therefore, where there is a choice of site, that the local authority concerned should consult the ESB regarding terms for electricity supply before the final choice of site is made.</P>
    <P>Subsidisation of rural electrification was examined last year following which the Government approved a programme of expenditure of £18 million on rural electrification during the four years ended 31st March, 1975; towards which the State is making available a subsidy of £10 million.  This is the maximum that can be made available in present circumstances and compares with a subsidy or £17 million paid <Col N="1634" /> towards expenditure of £49 million on rural electrification in the 25 years to 31st March, 1971.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that persons normally housed in these mobile homes are usually persons of the pensioner type with a very low income who are unable to meet the ESB charges for supplying current and that very often as a result of the high charges and the very low income, they do not have current to their homes, which are lighted by paraffin or gas and that there is a danger, because of the age of these people, of fire and that there have, in fact, been fatalities because the homes were lighted by gas or paraffin?  Having regard to the limited number of mobile homes involved, the Minister should indicate to the ESB as a semi-State body that they have a social duty to see that these people have electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest&mdash; and this is why I referred to it in my reply&mdash;that the primary social duty rests on the local authority as the providing authority in this case.  My information is that in far too many cases they do not have the close liaison and consultation with the ESB before they locate the site for such mobile homes. If they did so in the most economic site from the point of view of linking up electricity, matters might be evened out in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The most economic site might be socially undesirable from the point of view of the person to be housed.  That should be the primary consideration and not the convenience of the ESB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>

      <P>Responsibility for the safe custody of his employees' social insurance cards rests with each employer.  There are many obvious precautions which employers should take to safeguard social insurance stamps and cards held by them but I have no power to compel their adoption.</P>
      <P>In the case of the larger employers, at least, a very obvious and sensible precaution against theft is the payment of social insurance contributions by means of impressed stamping.  A great many firms already use this method and in view of the present high value of insurance stamps I would strongly advise all employers who have any substantial number of insurable employees to consider the adoption of this method of payment of social insurance contributions.</P>

The decision is being notified to the claimant who is also being informed of his right of appeal.  The delay in deciding the claim arose because special investigation was necessary to determine whether, for the purpose of unemployment benefit, the claimant satisfied the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts and regulations relevant to his case.

      <P>Is the Minister not aware that I have made repeated representations to have that part of County Cork which is deemed to be part of the 12 western counties included within the terms of the regulations granting unemployment assistance to farmers on a land valuation basis?  Surely the Minister agrees that it is quite unfair that substantial numbers should have been cut off as a result of the Minister's inactivity? Will he not agree that I provided him with maps on two occasions indicating the boundaries as defined by the county development team?  The Minister promised to see to this matter. He has dilly-dallied.  I want something straight from the Minister on this occasion.  I am not implying that he is other than straight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned in my budget statement, the Government decided to accept, on an experimental basis, the major administrative reform recommended by the Public Services Organisation Review Group by initiating, in a number of selected Departments, the separation of policy and execution by re-shaping them into an aireacht and a number of executive agencies.  The Departments of Industry and Commerce, Transport and Power and Health have been selected for the experiment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1644" /> Broadly what is involved is that a Department of State as at present organised should be split into (i) the aireacht, the top level policy-formulation, direction and control area of the Department; and (ii) the executive area comprising executive units which would include non-commercial State-sponsored bodies and executive areas of existing Departments.  Commercial State-sponsored bodies would be more loosely associated with the Department.</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of the operations of the reorganised Departments will be primarily secured through the management functions of planning, finance, organisation and personnel.  I hope to have a full discussion on this aspect of the proposals when the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill is going through its Second and Final Stages next session.</P>
    <P>The full implications of the concept are complex and are set out in the report of the review group.  At this stage, I would stress that the experiment will involve, in its initial stages, a full consideration of the existing functions of the Departments, the review and, if necessary, the strengthening of their managerial skills and the regrouping of functions, if appropriate, on the lines indicated by the review group.  In addition, it will be for consideration, how far the experiment can be carried out within the existing statutory framework and whether, and at what stage, it will be necessary to approach this House for sanction to any legislative changes that may be indicated.</P>

      <P>The transfer of the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, to the Eastern Health Board effectively took place on April 1st, 1972.  As a result the assessments to income tax under schedule E on the employees for the income tax year 1971-72 were required by law to be based on their remuneration for the year ended April 5th, 1972.  However, the tax actually collected during 1971-72 had been, again in accordance with statutory requirements, based on the remuneration for the year ended April 5th, 1971.  In these circumstances additional liability has arisen in most cases because of the increases in remuneration which were awarded during 1971-72.  In order to alleviate any hardship, collection of the additional liability is being spread over the years 1972-73 and 1973-74.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen this statement and am glad of the recognition it shows of the need to reorganise second-level education.  I am also glad of the manner in which it acknowledges the great problems facing my Department as a result of the number of small schools, particularly in the smaller towns and also as a result of the necessity to provide adequate educational facilities in the newly developing areas in the cities and larger towns.</P>
      <P>I want to stress once again that my community school proposals are designed to meet these problems.  I am basically interested in schools providing a curriculum which in breadth and in depth can cater for the aptitudes and ability of the children in the area which they serve.  Such schools may be either secondary schools, vocational schools, comprehensive schools or community schools provided they are able to offer the necessary range of subjects.</P>
      <P>While very few topics have in recent years been subjected to such a degree of debate and discussion as has education, I have felt for some time that parents and others involved in education may be in need of guidance as to the changing requirements of second-level education.  For that reason some months back I commissioned within my Department the preparation of a booklet which would show the present position, highlight the problems and spell out the developments as I see them if we are to provide adequate education for our post-primary pupils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Shanacashel national school is an old building scheduled for replacement by a new school on a new site.  Plans for the new building have been prepared but, because it was not found possible to acquire the site originally proposed for the new building, the further arrangements for the erection of the school had to be deferred. The Commissioners of Public Works have been asked to report on the suitability of an alternative site which has been suggested by the manager. If this site is considered suitable and can be acquired, arrangements for the new building will proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1656" /> In 1969, following complaints by the principal teacher as to the condition of the school, certain improvements were carried out.  These included the installation of flush toilets, heating stoves and electric light, as well as smaller items mainly of a maintenance nature. I am informed that as a result of these works the building has been rendered suitable for continued use until the new building is provided.</P>
    <P>The inspection of the principal teacher's work was carried out by inspectors of my Department in the performance of their normal duties and due consideration was given to the principal teacher's contention that conditions in the school created difficulties for him in the satisfactory performance of his duties.</P>
    <P>Letters addressed to my Department by the principal teacher on 30th April, 1971, and 25th May, 1971, contained allegations against the local inspector of schools which required investigation.  This investigation having concluded, a reply was sent to the principal teacher on 30th July, 1971. Further letters which have been received from the teacher were brought to the notice of the inspectors who visited the school on the 14th December, 1971, and the 25th April, 1972.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1658" /> The question of a grant for a new boys' secondary school is being considered in the context of proposals for the rationalisation of post-primary facilities generally in the centre.

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">

      <P>In view of the representations that have been made to the Department by the Christian Brothers since 1967 in relation to the building of a new school, and since the present building was condemned in 1967 and as there is an ideal site adjacent to the girls' school on which the Christian Brothers wish to build, will the Minister reconsider his proposal to establish a community school in Carrick-on-Suir and, instead, sanction the building of a school for the Christian Brothers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the grants schemes is that they provide specifically that the higher rate of grant shall not be payable in respect of students <Col N="1660" /> who reside in an area adjacent to a university or other institution of higher education.</P>
    <P>If I could be certain that a relaxation of that provision would not result in a situation where all types of claims were being made in relation to courses in different institutions then I might consider taking up with the local authorities the question of making an appropriaate amendment in the schemes.  The case referred to in Question No. 63 is one that would appear to merit consideration in this regard. I shall consider the matter further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister recall that in reply to a question of mine about two years ago when I pressed him on this he was inclined to say that such an arrangement could not be made but he did agree that where the faculty in question was not available at the particular centre he would consider application?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so, but in the light of that it is surprising that in a recent instance his Department should have rejected this proposal out of hand.  I am glad the Minister says now he will look into it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

    <Speaker pid="DanielSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <P>Would the Minister ask the Dairy Disposal Company to reconsider this matter especially in view of Question No. 85 by Deputy McEllistrim about the unemployment position in Tralee town and the Castleisland area where there are two big plants producing these feedingstuffs? There is a danger of unemployment and redundancy and even of complete close-down in these plants if the contracts are to be confined to one company.  Question No. 85 on the Order Paper raises a very serious question about the employment position in the Tralee/Castleisland area where these two plants operate. Would the Minister take the matter up with the company and have it reconsidered?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that those farmers who applied when this scheme was initiated now find that those who did not do so and are current applicants will fare better financially?

      <P>I do not accept the Deputy's first premise that people who entered the scheme at an earlier date were in some way at a loss.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that the main purpose in the payment of this grant is to enable the participant in the scheme to enlarge his herd.  People who entered the scheme at an early stage would naturally be able to buy additional cattle at much lower prices than the same cattle are now commanding. Latecomers to the scheme must contend with that very serious factor.

Has there been an abandonment of the proposed five year plan which should have started in 1970, or is it proceeding?  If so, have we made progress to the extent of 60 per cent of the work outlined then and only 40 per cent yet to be done, or are we doing it piecemeal without any plan or any reference to the plan envisaged and announced in 1969?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, provision was made in the Industrial Development Authority's interim advance factory programme announced last year for the building of four advance factories in County Donegal. Buncrana was not one of the sites included, and I understand that the authority do not propose to extend the interim programme in the immediate future.  The authority have informed me, however, that while, at present, they have no industrial projects for consideration in the area, they are fully conscious of Buncrana's need for industrial development and have certain plans in mind with a view to meeting that need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's two replies and taking the first question first, I understand from the Minister that they have in mind something for Buncrana.  Is this what they had in mind three years ago when a factory, named and described and with an employment content of 350, was positively promised?  Or is it something else they have in mind, and if so, is the Minister in a position to indicate in some positive way in 1972 that the proposal of 1969 will be fulfilled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> In regard to Question No. 89, why should there not be reconsideration of an advance factory for Buncrana when it is known to the IDA and the Government that there is dire need for male employment there?  If there was an effort even to attempt to get the promise of 1969 fulfilled, it would appear to me to be rather obvious that an advance factory should now be put there in an effort to attract into it something which was promised in 1969, but has never come to pass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the first of the Deputy's questions, the project which the IDA have in mind at present is not the project which they had hoped to get ahead with as was announced in 1969.  The promoters of the original industry did an experimental scheme in another area and reached a stage at which they found it was not possible for them to go ahead with the industry which they had hoped to get going in Buncrana, with the result that my information from the IDA, at this stage, is that the possibility of going ahead with that project is just not on.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, I am mindful of the problem which exists in Buncrana, but it would be, I think, wrong of me to make any suggestion to the IDA in relation to the advance factories they have in course of provision at present.  We have just had a question about an advance factory in Granard. It is rather important that an industry be got to occupy these advance factories before the IDA could go ahead with a scheme of further advance factories by using these as attractions for further industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying that there is no possibility of that promised project of 1969 now materialising.  I would ask him to clarify, through the IDA to the development committee and others in Buncrana, how it is that the answer that the people in Buncrana have been getting to their plea for an advance factory has been related to the suggestion that there would be action on the promise of 1969 in the form of another industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1678" /> In other words, a promise which has not been kept is being used as a reason why there should not be an advance factory and while I appreciate that there is not going to be a fulfilment of the promise of 1969 in the terms in which it was put forward, could the Minister undertake to clarify the situation further and not have Buncrana denied an advance factory because of a promise made in 1969 which is not to be kept?</P>

Would the Minister take it as absolutely certain that their present premises are inadequate, that they do want to expand and that the existing site is unsuitable? We have all this traipsing around with advance factories and no industries; here we have an industry and no factory.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, the making of training grants for industrial undertakings is a statutory function of the Industrial Development Authority and the decision in any particular case rests with that body.  For the information of Deputies I would, however, point out that such training grants are intended to assist the establishment of new projects by providing financial assistance towards the cost of training workers in the new skills involved.  They are not intended to apply to the normal training needs of industries developing in their established line of business.</P>

      <P>As I said in the reply, the position is that training grants are grants intended to assist the establishment of new projects.  In the normal course, if an industry is expanding and developing, it is assumed that the existing staff are used, as they are used in all industries.  In relation to fresh employees who are being taken in, the expertise of the existing employees is used for training apprentices. This is quite a normal thing.</P>

      <P>In having films made for them the Industrial Development Authority and other State agencies employ the normal commercial criteria with a view to getting a satisfactory product at the best price they can negotiate. Their actions in this field do not require prior ministerial approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am, however, informed by the Industrial Development Authority that they have commissioned a film which is currently being made by an all-Irish crew on a budget with a maximum of £22,000, of which £3,841 is payable to Mr. Robert Emmet Ginna for his services as writer, director and producer; that Irish film makers and others experienced in the field were consulted by the Industrial Development Authority before they made their decision and that 12 films by Irish film makers were viewed by Industrial Development Authority executives; that they received and considered three script treatments by Irish script writers apart from the treatment submitted by Mr. Ginna; that the magazine article written 17 years ago by Mr. Ginna was not taken into account by them; that the considerations which influenced them in favour of Mr. Ginna were: (a) the film must portray technological aspects of modern industry and it was, therefore, necessary that it should be made by a person with knowledge and expertise in this field.  Mr. Ginna, <Col N="1682" /> who has been involved in the film business for 20 years, has degrees in science and arts and has considerable experience in technical journalism.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority satisfied themselves that Mr. Ginna was a film producer, director and writer of international experience, (b) the film is being made primarily for the American market with which Mr. Ginna is familiar.  Mr. Ginna's association with the film will enhance the prospects of having it shown on American TV.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <P>Is he aware that the IDA stated that their decision was influenced by having seen two films which Mr. Ginna, they say, directed, but that, in fact, these were directed by Mr. J.D. Thompson?  I have the authority of the British Film Institute for that.  They also claimed that the reason for employing him was that he was a director of an NBC television series called &ldquo;Wisdom,&rdquo; and the NBC say that the &ldquo;Wisdom&rdquo; series was directed by Robert D. Graef.  They more recently said that Mr. Ginna actually did direct two films, these ones not having been directed by him at all, despite what they had said.  The two films they now say he directed were &ldquo;Assault on Antarctica&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eleven Against the Ice&rdquo; but, according to the NBC, these films did not have a director, but rather the editing of camera work in the Antarctic.

      <P>I have no statutory power to hold an inquiry of the kind requested by the Deputy or to prevent take-overs or mergers.  I have, however, introduced in the Dáil today by long and short titles a Bill which will empower me to prohibit a proposed take-over or merger, or to require the division of an enterprise formed through a take-over or merger, where the arrangement restricts competition or endangers the continuity of essential supplies or services. I am also considering whether it is feasible to provide for control on grounds other than those I have mentioned.</P>
      <P>I have no information about proposals for the take-over company mentioned by the Deputy to be taken over in turn by a similar major British consortium. As regards the reported agreement between the firm referred to in the Deputy's questions and a fertiliser firm, I note that the announcement of the agreement states that it &ldquo;will place the two companies in a highly advantageous position to undertake major further expansion not only in Ireland but also in the broader European context&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 108 together.</P>
      <P>The annual reports of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on crime set out, in a section dealing with juvenile crime, the principles under which the juvenile liaison officer scheme operates and give a detailed account of how it operates, including the categories of persons and the kind of offences to which it relates, the number of persons who have been dealt with under it, the towns where it is in operation and the number of gardaí involved.  Copies of the reports are available in the library.  In the 1970 report, the details are on pages 4 and 5 of the section dealing with crime prevention activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme has been explained to the House on several occasions since its inception in 1963.  I would refer the Deputy to the speeches of the Minister for Justice when introducing the Estimates for his Department for the years 1963-64 and 1964-65 and, in particular, to the answer given on 19th June, 1963, to a Parliamentary <Col N="1690" /> question on the subject, Official Report, Volume 203, column 1222.</P>
    <P>The commissioner's report for the year ended 30th December, 1971, has not yet been published but I am informed that the number of cautions administered under the scheme during that year was 700.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister if, under the record system, he sharply distinguishes between convictions and cautions?  He may be aware of the views I expressed last week as regards records which had been forwarded to some Government Departments detailing cautions where particular offenders had only been cautioned and cautioned once under the juvenile liaison scheme.  Would the Minister give sympathetic consideration to asking whether the distinction is made in the conveying of criminal records of persons under 17 years of age who have not suffered any convictions but may be refused a job by a Government Department on the grounds that they had been cautioned once during their lifetime under the age of 16?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Part of the principle of this scheme is that the person concerned must admit the offence.  If there was any question of his disputing his guilt or anything of that kind the scheme would not operate and he would go to court.  Therefore, an offence has, in fact, been committed by the person.  I could not say offhand whether it is recorded in the same way as ordinary criminal convictions. I rather doubt that it is recorded as a full conviction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware of difficulties experienced by some witnesses in court cases in having their expenses paid; and if he will indicate (a) <Col N="1694" /> whether there is a specified scale of expenses and, if so, the scale, and (b) who is responsible for payment of expenses to witnesses who have been subpoenaed to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the expenses of lay witnesses for the State in criminal cases.  My Department is responsible for the payment of these expenses, in accordance with a scale prescribed by the Minister for Finance.  In practice, the majority of claims are paid locally by the Garda superintendent out of an imprest with which he is provided for the purpose.  If the court awards expenses to a witness and the expenses awarded are less than those prescribed, the witness is, nevertheless, paid the full amount prescribed in the scale.  If a witness is awarded expenses which are greater than those prescribed, he is paid the prescribed expenses pending collection from the defendant of the full expenses awarded, when the balance is paid to him.</P>
      <P>In a minority of cases, some difficulties do arise in the payment of these expenses.  Such difficulties can stem from a variety of causes, the principal causes being difficulty, in some cases, in collecting from defendants expenses awarded by the court and the necessity in some cases to have claims vouched by the claimant.</P>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to circulate with the Official Report a copy of the prescribed scale of expenses.</P>
      <P>Following is the scale:</P>
      <P>RATES of allowances which may be paid to persons who attend Court on behalf of the State to give evidence as to fact in criminal cases</P>
      <P>I.  Allowances for Loss of Time.</P>

      <P>In civil cases the question of expenses would be one for the taxing master in the High Court and for the county registrar in the Circuit Court.

In this revision the pattern has again been followed of applying to the Army increases based on those granted to Civil Service grades at various levels.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, on the eve of the adjournment all he can tell me is that he is having this case investigated, without giving any indication whatsoever as to what this individual is to do in the meantime, what he is to live on, or anything about the circumstances under which he was appointed to this position and then discharged <Col N="1698" /> in a manner which would indicate to his neighbours that there was something wrong.  The man was fully and properly appointed.  The officers in charge knew exactly from his discharge book from the armed forces of another country that he had been discharged on health grounds.  Yet, he was accepted on his explanation as to what took place on that occasion.  He was taken into the armed forces here and, at the end of a crash course, it was decided that the thing was irregular and he was discharged as not having been properly appointed.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to indicate now what action will be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly a very unfortunate case and those of us who understand the background have great sympathy with the individual involved. It would appear that the Army directed this man to take whatever action was necessary.  It was suggested, for instance, that the Naval Service was responsible for this man selling his house. That is true but that was a decision for the individual concerned.  The information in relation to his discharge from the British Air Force was not indicated on his application form to the Naval Service.  The reason for his discharge was that, apparently when he was stationed at Aden, he contracted a disease called sandfly fever and one effect of this disease is raving.  He was treated with librium and electric shock therapy.  This was not disclosed in his application form.  While one can have every sympathy with the man, the reason for his being inducted into the Naval Service is being investigated and I would like to point out to the Deputy who brought the matter to the attention of the Department, according to my information on 4th July&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary says the information was not given on the application form. There was no such request made on the application form and his discharge book from the RAF was placed before the examining committee of three officers and they examined it and questioned him on the particular circumstances under which he was discharged. He was then sent for a medical examination, which he passed, and following on that, he was then sent on a test for the particular sphere in which he was going to operate in the Naval Service and he was ultimately written to and told he was being accepted.  In view of the completely unsatisfactory nature of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, I propose, with your permission, Sir, to raise this matter on the Adjournment.</P>

What the Deputy will do on the Adjournment is entirely a matter for himself but, as I have said, the circumstances are being investigated and, no matter what the Deputy may say on the Adjournment, the position in relation to the discharge of the individual from another armed force is set out clearly in Defence Force Regulations and I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 12 of Defence Force Regulations 8/10 which provides:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following persons will not be enlisted: a person who for misconduct, inefficiency or on the grounds of his service being no longer required or being medically unfit or below army physical standards has been discharged from the permanent Defence Forces, the reserve Defence <Col N="1700" /> Force or the military, naval, police or air service of another country or state.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances the Deputy will, I think, appreciate that this unfortunate man is not in a position to be re-inducted into the Naval Service.</P>

      <P>Before their recent amendment the statutory conditions which empowered local authorities to make schemes for the sale of their houses to tenants provided that the sale prices of the houses should be a sum equivalent to the market or replacement value of the houses less certain deductions.  The deductions in built-up areas amounted to 2 per cent a year for each year after five during which the tenant had been in continuous occupation of a local authority dwelling, subject to a maximum discount of 30 per cent.  The corresponding figures for non built-up areas were 3 per cent and 45 per cent respectively. Following a review of these conditions I decided, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, to amend the regulations to enable local authorities to grant a discount for every year of continuous tenancy and to increase the rate of discount in built-up areas from 2 per cent to 3 per cent. The maximum deductions allowable remain at 30 per cent for houses in built-up areas and 45 per cent for houses elsewhere.  The revised discount provisions apply to sales schemes approved by me on or after 1st July, 1972.  All local authorities were notified of the revised provisions by circular letter dated 7th July, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>As I stated in reply to a question by the Deputy on 22nd April, 1971, the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts, 1878 to 1964, enable sanitary authorities to take action against a person responsible for dumping matter which is a nuisance or injurious to health and to make by-laws for the prevention of nuisances arising from the deposit of rubbish.</P>
      <P>The provisions of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, enable planning authorities or the Garda to take action against persons creating litter by dumping organic matter or rubbish.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, where an abandoned vehicle causes danger or obstruction or is illegally parked, the Garda Síochána may prosecute the person who left it there.</P>
      <P>These statutes provide a wide range of powers.  The problem appears to be one of difficulty in identifying offenders rather than one of deficiency in the law of staffing.  As to derelict vehicles in particular, I doubt if it would be appropriate to propose legislation making the last registered owner responsible for the abandonment of such a vehicle, since very often the derelict vehicle had either left the ownership of the last registered owners when it was abandoned or was left in such a condition as to be unidentifiable.  A more practical approach is to provide effective powers for the removal of abandoned vehicles, and in this regard the Road Traffic (Removal, Storage and Disposal of Vehicles) Regulations, 1971, enable a road authority to remove, store and dispose of a vehicle, which has been abandoned on a public road or in a public car park or which is illegally parked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the problem referred to in these two questions is becoming increasingly acute in the rural area around the broad area of Dublin city?  Has he any idea as to why it is not possible to detect those responsible and has he any suggestion as to how the procedures could be improved?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no great point in explaining why there is difficulty in detecting people who abandon cars. It is done furtively, in the dark of night and one cannot expect to have gardaí or officials waiting around to see if somebody is going to dump a vehicle somewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the registered owner can be made responsible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The registered owner is not necessarily responsible for dumping it.  These cars are stripped and have gone out of the possession of the owner altogether.  The last legal owner has not got the car registered so that device is not the easiest way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that practically every day cars are left abandoned on main roads and nobody seems to be responsible for removing them until they are taken away piece by piece by vandals?  Is he also aware that some villages are cluttered up with old cars and lorries which have been left there by people, that it is quite easy to find out who owns them, although they may not have been taxed, and that they are a menace to traffic and to children playing around them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not quite so simple.  I agree as to the nuisance they cause and the longer they are left there the more offensive they become.  I would urge local authorities to avail of the powers I gave them last year to remove these vehicles and I suggest that Deputies should bring their complaints in this matter to the notice of each local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that local authorities do not have sufficient staff to enable them to go around the roads doing this work and to pass the buck to them as he proposes is simply not solving the problem?  Will he consider undertaking this matter on a national scale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not, is my answer to that question.  I have been continually asked to give more powers to local authorities and when I do so, I am then asked to interfere with their exercise of them.  You cannot have it <Col N="1723" /> both ways.  I think we did the sensible thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not consider that the simple way of doing it would be for the Garda authorities to charge persons who leave vehicles on the roads untaxed?  Surely the problem will be solved very quickly because the owners will then remove them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy for the view expressed by the Deputy but I think it is a view which most people would have about their own particular area.  Unfortunately, in view of the competing demands of other essential services such as housing, water and sewerage, swimming pools, and so on, on the money available, the amount provided for works of public amenity is necessarily limited.  I must point out, however, that last year's provision of £120,500 for derelict site and amenity grants has been increased this year to £300,000 for the new amenity grants scheme.  Within the confines of these resources I have tried to make allocations to local authorities as equitably as possible.  The money provided for the current year is fully committed and it is not therefore possible for me to increase the allocation to County Galway or to any other planning authority.</P>

      <P>In the past ten years improved equipment and stations have been secured at a cost of over £1 million, for which my Department authorised the necessary capital.</P>
      <P>Since 1968 my Department have organised a series of basic training and specialised courses for station officers and sub-officers which have proved very successful in providing a corps of instructors to undertake the training of firemen at local level.  Fire Brigade authorities were asked to ensure that the services of these instructors are used to the fullest extent in the training of station personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may mention that, while a new code of building regulations, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, incorporating fire protection measures is in course of preparation, my Department have <Col N="1728" /> issued advisory fire protection standards in 1964 and 1967, containing recommendations, not merely on structural requirements, but also on such matters as fire fighting equipment, means of escape, fire drill and evacuation procedure.</P>
    <P>The distribution of fire protection literature is undertaken by the Fire Protection Association of Ireland, who distributed it to their members on request.</P>
    <P>The main structure of the fire services is being reviewed in the context of local government reorganisation generally, and the review covers the position in relation to fire protection and prevention, publicity and education aspects, the need for and the form of new organisational arrangements and a detailed examination of the 1940 Act to determine whether amending legislation is necessary to strengthen the powers of sanitary authorities, particularly in relation to fire prevention.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentions &ldquo;a recent spate of fires&rdquo;.  Reports on recent fires indicate a wide variety of causes but in all cases the fire brigades performed their duties very efficiently.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is evidence to connect many of these fires with subversive elements who are out to bring down the State?  Surely the Minister is aware that the leader of one of these organisations last year stated that it was their aim to use the bomb and fire to attain their objectives?  In view of this, would the Government not take the most serious view and be prepared to meet these elements head-on in the near future?</P>

      <P>In Clare, there was a fire caused by an electrical connection on a TV set which had been left plugged in.  In Mayo there were two serious fires, one in Blacksod where it appears the fire was caused by the fact that gas was left on for a considerable time before being lighted, thereby causing an instant blaze.  The other was in Ballyhaunis caused by a storm lamp left beside the bed, which was tipped over and set the bed alight.  In Limerick, a fire occurred in a thatched farmhouse, caused by a heater.  Two lives were lost.</P>

      <P>Where permission was granted under section 4 and where the development has gone ahead, the <Col N="1733" /> Deputy realises that there is nothing very much the Minister can do unless the local authority want to involve themselves in compensation.  I would agree with the expression of concern here on the part of Deputy Paudge Brennan regarding the excessive use of section 4 by councillors in County Wicklow.  I think future generations certainly shall not thank them for many of the decisions they are making, destroying much of the natural beauty of that lovely county.  It is causing me some concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the recollection that there was a similar situation in Kerry some years ago and that the Department at that time took the matter up with the Kerry County Council. Since then we have had development plans.  We have the situation now that there is a development plan for Wicklow, approved by the council.  The council are constrained because of lack of co-operation from the officials and their complete disregard for the wishes of the council as expressed in the development plan.  I know they are not irrevocable and can be appealed, but far too much time of the council is taken up with these resolutions.  It might be a useful exercise if the Minister were to send officials to Wicklow County Council to have discussions with the council to see if something could be done.</P>

A plan for, say, a garage, or something of that nature is approved by the local authority or planning permission has been granted or, in some cases, approval has been granted by the Minister on appeal and a superstructure is put up but the job is not completed in accordance with the plans.  If plans were submitted for the structure as it now is they would not have been approved.  It is a matter for the local authority to ensure that the job is completed in accordance with the plan within a reasonable time.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will agree, following on what Deputy Paudge Brennan has said, that this is a ridiculous situation.  A firm apply for permission to erect a building. They get it under certain conditions and, following an appeal to the Minister, an additional condition is put in and the firm proceed to carry out their building completely ignoring the Minister's condition.  In this case the matter was brought to the notice of the planning authority on a number of occasions and although the Minister's appeal was earlier in the year, several months ago, on 12th July the planning office notifies the appellant that &ldquo;the recommendation of the Dublin planning officer regarding the course of action to be taken on your complaint is still awaited&rdquo;.  This is from the planning office.  In other words, the planning officer has written to himself and asked himself what he is going to do about this, and since he has not replied nothing has been done about it.  Would the Minister not agree that if this is going to be allowed there is no point in anybody applying for planning permission?  People will go back to what they did before, building their buildings in any way they like under any conditions they like. Why should anybody go to the trouble of appealing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The local authority have the power to ensure that the permission <Col N="1736" /> as granted is carried out.  If the applicant does not complete the building according to the conditions in the permission, they have power, as I have stated, to enforce compliance with those conditions.  The applicant can be brought before the court and it can be decided there.  This particular case is being examined at present to see whether or not building has been carried out according to the permission granted and what steps should be taken subsequent to the examination, and I think we should leave it for the time being.

I do not know who the applicant is, but this is something which has been happening all over the country and I want to pin the Minister down to know what is going to be done in this case.  Somebody does not carry out a regulation which the Minister lays down, and Dublin Corporation, for some reason or other, do nothing about it, although it was brought to their notice half a dozen times.

      <P>Inspectors' reports on planning appeals have always been regarded as confidential documents for the information of the Minister.  The responsibility for deciding appeals is vested by law in the Minister and he is bound to decide appeals on the basis of the proper planning and development of the areas concerned.  The nature of the appeals process is such that I do not consider that any particularly valuable purpose would be achieved by making copies of the inspectors' reports available to parties to an appeal and I do not propose any change in the present system.</P>

On the contrary, there have been substantial improvements in recent years.  If the Deputy will let me have particulars of defects he has experienced I shall be glad to look into them.</P>
      <P>As regards improvements, works are continuously in progress to improve the service and to provide for its extension and development.  In the current year some £13.73 million will be spent on such works, a figure which compares with £11.11 million in 1971-72.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely amazed that the Minister is not aware of the poor service and that he is not aware that it is worsening.  That being the case, I can only commend to him, perhaps, an examination of the general service throughout the country, not only so far as the automatic service is concerned, which in many cases does not seem to work without recourse to the operators, but also in regard to the manual service, which is inadequately staffed, and which is a well-known <Col N="1741" /> reason for the difficulty in getting service in Dublin.  Therefore, because of the delays caused either by the lack of manual operators or the inadequacy or the imperfections of the automatic service, would the Minister not, even at this late stage, in order to give the long-suffering public who pay for it all some redress, at least give the public the opportunity of being called back when they are trying to get trunk calls, particularly from the city?  It is all right in the country where the people oblige by calling back but here they are busy and it is not possible.  I would like the Minister to have a look at the service because it is bad.  I say this not only as a subscriber who suffers a great deal from it but also from the knowledge which has been brought to me by many other people.</P>

In other words, far from being a drawback, the showing of the incidents could do good in letting the people know what is going on.</P>

      <P>The improvement of television reception is primarily a matter for Radio Telefís Éireann.  I understand that, apart from some isolated localities, reception in the Berehaven area from the transposer provided in 1965 is generally good, and that RTE have been unable, because of shortage of resources, to make progress in further improving reception in that area.  As regards Clonakilty I am informed by RTE that they have no plans at present for improving <Col N="1747" /> reception in the area.  With regard to the Rosscarbery district I would refer the Deputy to my reply on 24th February, 1972, Vol. 259 No. 3 col. 504, to his question about reception in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been saying, regarding the analysis which concludes that British power is the major obstacle obstructing the path to unity, that the present generation of British politicians, both Tory and Labour, are only too anxious to close the last chapters of British entanglement in Irish affairs and that the real opponents of unity are the Protestants of <Col N="1784" /> Northern Ireland.  Their political allegiance has lain always in safeguarding the British connection. Whatever happens now or in the future there is little reason to conclude that any radical recasting of their attitude will take place in respect of the British connection.</P>
      <P>We do no service to the idea of eventual unity based on agreement and consent between the two parts of Ireland by pretending that the allegiance of the Protestant Irish to the British connection is an aberration merely of temporary duration.  Any peaceful progress towards unity must accommodate that view of allegiance to the British connection.</P>
      <P>I agree with both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in thinking that the most urgent imperative before us in the Northern situation is that of achieving peace as soon as possible.  I would not be talking of the long march towards eventual unity were it not for a widespread Southern delusion that we are on the threshold of unity.  It is in the interests of the peace that we desire that that delusion should be dispersed. One consequence of the recent campaign of atrocities committed by the IRA is that conditions in which real talks leading towards unity can take place have been postponed indefinitely.</P>
      <P>Any talks on achieving eventual unity and any real progress in that direction have been postponed, in my estimation, until the 21st century.  All commentators agree that hatred and division between Catholic and Protestant have never been worse in Northern Ireland.  It would appear that both the Provisional IRA and the UDA are involved in an escalation of violence to the pitch of reaching general civil war in the Northern area.  Both organisations are involved in this for different reasons but there will be the same bloody result in consequence of their similar actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the automatic consequence of the continued campaign of violence by the IRA and of the response which must come from the UDA.  I criticise the attitude that is prevalent in this House among apologists of violence, that is, that the campaign of violence has been responsible for the disappearsation <Col N="1785" /> ance of Stormont.  I do not contest that it has contributed to the disappearance of Stormont but I believe that the disappearance of Stormont is evidence simply of a shift of opinion on the part of Wesminster politicians.  I am making the point that the root of our problem in this island does not lie in Westminster. It lies on this island.  The dissension on the island is caused mainly by the differences between Catholics and Protestants.  If the cost of removing Stormont was an armed campaign it was a grievous cost but I do not believe that campaign was responsible totally for Stormont's disappearance.  I believe it was too high a cost if the removal of Stormont has been bought at the expense of this total hostility now existing between Catholics and Protestants in the North.</P>
    <P>There was a great deal of wisdom in what the Tánaiste said this morning, and do any of us visualise that we may advance from the present Northern position to full round-table talks on unity in the near future?  Is it not clear &mdash;and there was much sense in what the Tánaiste said&mdash;that an essential intermediate stage in any advance towards eventual unity must be the emergence of a society in Northern Ireland which permits Catholics and Protestants to work together in a just administration.  So, some form of Stormont will more than likely return in a year or two.  It is possible that the continuation of bombings may force a further weakening of Westminster's resolve on the Northern issue but it is clear to me, and I cannot see any circumstances changing this conclusion, that the creation of an acceptable, democratic, united Ireland based on respect for law would be impossible in the wake of general civil war in this island.</P>
    <P>The most likely result of a continuation of the present IRA terror campaign with its response from the UDA, after many hundreds of deaths, after what would be an extension of the incipient sectarian strife now existing, would be a political settlement in which there would be large-scale re-location of population in the Northern areas.  We would not see in the wake of civil war a united Ireland, but a smaller totally Protestant <Col N="1786" /> Northern Ireland and a larger Catholic Republic.  We would arrive at what could be termed a sort of Israeli solution to the problem.  We would not have a united Ireland such as the patriots dreamed of, or their supporters envisaged but two ugly new states.</P>
    <P>The first law of each resultant statelet, in the wake of that civil war, would be general hatred of the inhabitants of the other statelet.  All cultural and social life would be poisoned by that ever-renewing hatred of Orange for Green and Green for Orange.  The first law of the Green state would be hatred of the Orange and <i>vice versa</i>.  While Europe went about its business, Ireland North and South would not be the beacon of light and liberty among the nations imagined by our patriots but a charnel house of rancour and hate, a morgue of memories.  That is what our island would become in the wake of that civil war&mdash;two ugly states animated by supreme hatred for each other.</P>
    <P>We condemn violence every day, but condemnation without political good works is not sufficient.  It has become almost fashionable to say that nobody is on the side of violence and yet violence continues.  We cannot passively join that general queue to the abattoir which appears to be the consequence of the prolongation of the present sectarian strife.  We can passively join this queue to the abattoir which is under the joint management of the IRA and UDA. This is a terrible prospect.  No matter how we analyse the problem, we are called upon to make certain proposals, to act.  More than condemnation of violence is necessary.  The logic of the violence which has engulfed the northern area is this: the IRA violence will provoke UDA retaliation and in this continuing escalation, condemnations of violence will be mere whistling in the wind, without effect.</P>
    <P>In that situation, elected political leaders of the minority will be bypassed and will no longer have any place except to explain the latest atrocity on the minority side, or to blame the majority.  Their only function will be to go to television studios <Col N="1787" /> explaining actions for which they are not responsible.</P>
    <P>I believe they should now negotiate and enter into talks with the Whitelaw administration and so try to arrange for the release of the remaining internees.  They must certainly not stay out of talks because of the taunts of the IRA that they are selling out on the internees.  They must talk with the Whitelaw administration and consider how the withholding of rents and rates campaign can be speedily terminated. They must try to make contact with elected Unionist representatives to see if those elected in the Northern area can come together for the greater good of their own community.  They must not be held back by the campaign of violence from these talks because to condemn violence without doing anything is to permit violence to win and permit the men of violence to feed on the blood of their fellow countrymen. Elected minority leaders must take part in talks immediately and see what settlement can be achieved and must not be held back by criticism coming from men of violence.  If they do hold back, their hour will have passed and that is the real danger at present.</P>
    <P>What must we do here?  I suppose we must first clarify our own inherited attitudes on the Northern question and how it can be settled.  There is talk of changing the Constitution but the most important change in any Constitution we can devise for this part of the country would be a clause setting out the legitimate constitutional ways of achieving the unity of the country, laying down in cold, legal form how this should be done and the peaceful means to be adopted and ruling out all methods of force.  There is a great deal of confusion in our attitude.  In the official attitude in the South there is a great deal of ambiguity regarding the settlement of the problem.  While we mean to achieve it by peace and agreement we are vague about the steps towards that peace and agreement and violent methods are not ruled out.  I have already said the division of the communities in the North is now wider than ever but one consequence of the recent campaign is that the hatred&mdash;I <Col N="1788" /> think that is not too strong&mdash;felt by Northern Protestants for the Republic, because, rightly or wrongly, they blame the Republic for the emergence of the IRA, is now greater than ever.</P>
    <P>We must set down clearly how we propose to gain the unity of the country. The peaceful means by which it is to be gained must be set down.  Nothing dramatic can bring about unity.  A delusion held by some editorial writers is that somehow there is a glorious task before us and that unity may be achieved at any weekend.  A whole series of small steps must be taken if we are to begin to make any progress towards eventual unity.</P>
    <P>As I said, the first imperative is to gain peace.  Without peace the threat of a continuation of civil disorder in Northern Ireland poses a real danger to democracy in the rest of Ireland. People said here today that they support law and order.  How safe will law and order be in this part of the country if a large scale massacre occurs of the minority in a certain situation in the Northern conflict?  That type of happening is quite possible if the shooting continues.  It is quite clear that the involvement of this State in a large scale civil war situation in the North cannot be totally avoided and cannot be totally ruled out.  Such an involvement will spell disaster for democracy here.</P>
    <P>Law and order may command sympathy from many people here at present, but that may not always be the situation if the violence in the North continues to increase.  Our elected leaders must speak out on the proper means that must be adopted to settle the division of the country.  We must not be vague.  We must not permit people to suggest that there is some relationship between our own ideas on unity and the methods and activities of the IRA's and of people who do not respect the democratic will of the majority.  We must dispel any such notion.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Offences Against the State Act prevents known IRA members from appearing on our television screens so that their programmes and policies can be examined.  What we must criticise about the appearance of <Col N="1789" /> these people on television is the reception of their ideas in an uncritical manner.  Very often their opinions are not properly contested with counter arguments.  I regret that we are not in a position to see some of the people controlling the armed campaign facing tough interrogation and proper discussion and questioning on our national television service.</P>
    <P>Since we are the people who say we are looking for this eventual unity based on peace and consent and agreement, we must have a Constitution which does not permit any Unionist to suggest that it reflects the religious bias of the majority of the people on this side of the Border.  I am not saying this would change by one iota the allegiance of Protestant Irish to the British connection, but it would deprive Unionist spokesmen of arguments. Since we are the people who are looking for unity, we must be practically fanatical in excluding any sectarian bias from our legislation.</P>
    <P>We must provide an educational system from which any idea of separate education for Catholics and Protestants must be banished.  We must anticipate the kind of united Ireland which we say we seek.  All around us we can see a lack of interest in the united Ireland which we are all supposed to favour.  The kind of Ireland we have built up in this part of the country gives no sign of anticipating the model of a future united Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must lose no opportunity of meeting the men of violence and countering their arguments.  The politicians must do their best in regard to the Constitution.  We must ensure that our social welfare benefits, and so on, are improved, that our educational system is secular, that our Constitution is secular, and that there are no laws which reflect the bias of one religion.</P>
    <P>Our theologians could have a look at the mixed marriage regulations.  Of all the places in Christendom this country is one area where relations between Catholics and Protestants must be put on a human level of mutual respect.  The fact that a Catholic cannot marry a Protestant or a Protestant cannot marry a Catholic without signing away his or her liberty to decide <Col N="1790" /> the religion of the children is often cited by Protestants in the South as a reason for their disappearance as a major part of the population.  If the united Ireland we seek is one in which the communities can come together, religious laws which say that the religion of one partner in a marriage must swallow the religion of the other must be changed.  I remember reading that at the start of this century religious law on this matter was more lenient than it appears to be in 1972.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that our Hierarchy, our clergymen and our theologians who say they are on the side of reconciliation should go back to their tomes and come up with the requisite authorisation showing that a man can be a Christian in good standing without insisting that his wife should renege on her religious beliefs.  It is very important that such a change should be made.  This is a job the theologians could do, not the politicians.  I hope theologians will take on this task.</P>
    <P>There is a whole series of things we must do, constitutional, political, and so on.  Last September or October the Taoiseach suggested that this was a democratic State in which there could be a change of Government when the electorate felt like it.  The sincerity of our convictions on the kind of Ireland we would like to see created is tested by what we do in the part of Ireland we control, and by the kind of politics we practise.  Many people in this House want to assist in the construction of an alternative Government.  The leader of our party in a speech of June of this year gave ample evidence of our readiness to enter into discussions about participating in a Coalition Government or an inter-Party Government after the next election.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have signified to the public that we will not stand in the way of the legitimate right of the electorate of the Irish Republic to have a choice of Government.  The Taoiseach rose to the challenge about the moving of the writ for mid-Cork. In the same constituency in 1965, I think, his predecessor suggested that the electorate should consider the by-election as no mere ordinary by-election but as the signal for a general <Col N="1791" /> election if the Government candidate was rejected.  The Taoiseach could suggest a similar interpretation in this by-election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The electorate of mid-Cork have the opportunity to give the first sign to the Government that a change is needed here.  We need a change for several reasons: 16 years in office, a tired Administration, an Administration down on their luck, an Administration depending on very meagre talent.  In his address to the Press correspondents at Westminster the Taoiseach suggested that ours was a democracy which permitted of changes of Government in contradistinction to Northern Ireland.  He would not be showing any lack of responsibility by interpreting the result of the mid-Cork by-election as a signal for a general election.</P>
      <P>There is now a realistic alternative to Fianna Fáil.  Between the Opposition parties in the House there is the possibility of creating an Administration which could introduce policies on welfare, economic planning, and so on, and restore the confidence of the people of the State in the institutions of the State.  The defence of the country does not lie simply in withstanding attacks on the Curragh.  We must also demonstrate that our democracy is mature enough to say to one set of politicians: &ldquo;After 16 years it is time you rested.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am confident they will make that choice.  Some of the greatest proponents of the desirability of alternative government in this part of the country are in the Parliamentary Party opposite. I will not name names, but there are members of the present Government Parliamentary Party who will be voting with the Taoiseach tomorrow night who are strident advocates of the necessity now, in the national interest, of an alternative Government coming into power and I would hope that the Taoiseach need have no worry about being irresponsible.  He has risen to the challenge of moving the <Col N="1792" /> writ in mid-Cork and he would be fully responsible in saying to the electorate in mid-Cork: &ldquo;Depending on a certain result or the failure to nominate the Government candidate into Dáil Éireann on that day I will call a general election.&rdquo;  That is the responsible thing that should be done and we need a clean out, top and bottom, in this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We have covered a good deal of ground already in this debate and I do not propose to follow altogether Deputy O'Leary on some of the points he has made.  Indeed, in relation to some of the points he made, especially in regard to the North, I think one could say that there is a fair measure of agreement on the questions he raised.  None of us in this House is blind to the fact that we are living very close to a very serious civil war in the North and, therefore, I feel that while this debate lends itself to matters such as the guerrilla warfare at present going on in the North, I shall leave it to other Members of the House on this side to deal more adequately with this whole question.</P>
      <P>I would refer for a moment to a reference made to the All-Party Committee on Irish Unity.  As a member of this Committee, I hope it will succeed in its objective and I would remind the House of our terms of reference and in this context suggest that people expect far too much from a Committee such as this.  However, this Committee, I suppose, is one of the elements which could bring about, maybe, a better image of our attitude towards our opponents or alleged opponents in the North.  There has been some comment on this in the Press, and indeed in political circles, and as the Committee is now sitting, I would not wish to prejudice the proceedings which are going on at the moment, but I would ask the House to remember our terms of reference.  If I may quote a paragraph from the statement issued by the Taoiseach on the setting up of the Committee and naming its members. it is:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With a view to contributing to a peaceful settlement of the Northern Ireland situation it has been agreed to set up an inter-Party Committee <Col N="1793" /> to establish a common ground between the parties represented on the Committee on the constitutional, legal, economic, cultural, social and other relevant implications of a united Ireland and to make representations as to the steps now required to create conditions conducive to a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Whether the proceedings of the Committee are successful or not, I would hope as one member of the Committee that we would find the common ground suggested whereby we might be shown or be seen to have this common purpose in relation to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>All of us, I think, who believe in constitutionalism and in the institutions of State down the years deplore every assault made on the Border, and I said in this House before that time and again in the course of our history here, whenever we made an approach towards promoting better relations with the North, we had guerrilla warfare breaking out in our back garden.  It is not easy to stem the desire for guerrilla warfare.  Those who think that we can shoot our way into unity may be thinking in this direction because of our history, but whether they do or not or regardless of their motives, we condemn roundly any effort at this shooting match.</P>
    <P>It was often said also in this context that we did not do enough down the years to promote a spirit of better understanding.  I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that every time we moved in that direction, someone shot up our effort.  If one recognises the fact that today in the North there are a large number of British troops on the streets and they are hardly able&mdash;in fact, they are not able&mdash;to contain the damage which is being done there, it is very hard to think that we would be able in our circumstances to watch a Border which stretches right across the country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would say to people that, when speaking on this subject, they should have recognition of this fact, and apart from this, there was always the unfortunate idea abroad in America, amongst certain leaders there, that force would be the ultimate <Col N="1794" /> solution of the Border and time and again when representatives went from this country to America, they found themselves at loggerheads with these people there and we found invariably that money and materials found their way in here to these illegal organisations. We also found that it is very difficult to stem it, by reason of the fact of history, by reason of the fact that such a high proportion of our people are in America.  So that I should like to suggest that when we come to criticise our alleged lack of activity in promoting better relations with the North down the years there should be recognition of those facts.</P>
    <P>I would also please ask that, whilst the proceedings of this committee are in progress, that too much should not be expected ultimately from the committee. If we are able to find common ground and to improve our institutions, so much the better.  I would welcome this move.  I shall not say any more in regard to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to the moving of the writ for the mid-Cork by-election. It is nothing new to me that a writ should be moved in this House for a by-election.  I can recall many an occasion on which we were challenged to move such a writ.  I can recall the famous occasion when Deputy Flanagan challenged the then Taoiseach to move the writ for the by-election in Cork city and it was a Fianna Fáil representative who emerged from the contest.</P>
    <P>There is this aspect to be taken into account: the Labour Party, for reasons best known to themselves, have decided to make a move towards a united front or coalition government and the Fine Gael Party seem very anxious to promote this idea.  It can be said that politics is the art of the possible.  It can be added that its practitioners cannot afford the luxury of anger or certainty.  This is a new move.  Up to now there have been coalitions that came about after the event.  It will be interesting in the extreme to see how this plan works out.  We are not afraid of it.  We would not be mature politicians if we were.  We are willing to take our chance in mid-Cork against the united Opposition.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1795" /> I would remind the Labour Party, who led a very strong campaign, and a very honourable one I may say in passing, against the Referendum, of the naked fact that thousands of Labour supporters voted in favour of entry to Europe.  In this context I would also remind the Labour Party that there is, apparently, an end to the brainwashing which can be done on the members of that organisation.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject, let me compliment in a high degree the members of the labour unions throughout the country who voted for entry into Europe and who are adult enough at this stage of our development to have done so.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some matters which one may deal with in this debate.  This is the debate on the Adjournment; it is also a debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate for the year.  In the course of his opening remarks the Taoiseach dealt with a number of matters, first, the economy, then the EEC and, lastly, the North.  I shall not go over all these matters.  I shall confine myself to making specific remarks on certain aspects of policy.</P>
    <P>Some of our economic progress during the year was attacked.  We had some criticism from Deputy Cosgrave, who spoke here earlier in his usual well-informed and courteous manner, but he did criticise certain matters. Before I go on to that point let me say that he dealt with the role of his party in the Referendum campaign. He and the members of his party are entitled to be complimented on the work put in, the time given, the ground covered, and so on, in the period leading up to the Referendum.</P>
    <P>One of their members, not a Member of this House, the late Mr. Michael Sweetman, played a very active role in that campaign, as did others from various organisations, who died in that fearful fatality less than a month ago. A special word of praise should go to the late Mr. Sweetman and his colleagues for the amount of information they produced, the amount of research they carried out and the time spent in bringing up the standard of education regarding the aims of the European <Col N="1796" /> Community and in regard to the European institutions in general.  That should be said in this House and now is as good a time to say it as any.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave spoke of the price of consumer goods and of the increased charges in relation to health and education. Let me take health for a moment.  I do not want to go into the matter in any great detail.  Two weeks ago we were dealing in the House with the Estimate for Health and the Tánaiste, who is also the Minister for Health, made quite clear on every occasion on which he spoke the danger of increasing costs in his Department. He pointed out, for example, the high labour content involved in his Department. He indicated the rise in costs brought about by any adjustment in pay.  We all subscribe to the view that nurses and doctors attached to hospitals should be paid well.  Yet we hear this criticism of rising costs in health, just as if we could make health immune to rising costs.  This is something beyond the power of any Minister or Member of this House.</P>
    <P>There is no need therefore to go over the ground that has already been covered on the Estimate, but one would need to stress on one point: that the Minister made a decision last spring in relation to the local rates which helped local authorities considerably when, for example, over and above the 50 per cent which he provided from his Department in the health costs to local authorities he got the consent of the Government to give a supplementary grant of 9 per cent to the local authorities in order to ensure that the health rate would not increase over 30 pence in the £ in any area.</P>
    <P>It is often suggested here that we could run a fancy scheme not based on any special financial system, but the health system in this country is based on a system of financing which is not easily replaced.  On the one hand it rests on the Central Exchequer and on the other hand on the local authority. When people talk about rates they forget that we have three or four reports here on the rating system, and I think there were a similar number in England.  The British Government sought a report on the rating system <Col N="1797" /> there and no better plan was advocated in any of those reports.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when we come to speak of increasing costs and where those costs are levelled, one must have at the back of one's mind some alternative. Usually the people who make those sweeping statements about increasing costs in health do not come up with an alternative.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave also spoke of our aim to bring about a more rational plan for progress in education and he quoted criticism from other quarters. Some of those quarters are often circumspect in revealing to the public their own attitude on the question of education.  People have been calling for a White Paper.  The Minister did much better than a White Paper.  He may issue a White Paper&mdash;it is up to the Minister and the Government&mdash;but he did his work fairly well.  He sent off the officers of his Department to the various areas where he proposed to proceed with community schools&mdash;one might call them pilot areas&mdash;to explain to each group of people there the plan which was envisaged.</P>
    <P>Apart from some criticism, some of it extreme enough, I think the plan is generally acceptable.  In our circumstances and on our income, when we embark on any scheme, we must recognise the fact that we should have to raise the amount of money necessary to finance that plan.  I would also ask the House, if we have not made progress in education, what are we doing?  Only today Deputy Corish asked the Minister for Education for the amount of expenditure by the Central Government and local authorities each year since 1960 and, secondly, the total expenditure as a percentage of the GNP per head of the population each year.  The Minister issued a tabular statement from which I am quoting.  It can be seen there that expenditure on education has risen from £17,000,992 in 1960-61 to over £89 million in 1971-72.  I understand that it is approaching £94 million this year.  As a percentage of gross national product, the figure has also risen from 2.8 to 5.1.  Therefore we must be making some headway on the educational front.  I suggest that we are, in <Col N="1798" /> fact; otherwise we would not at this stage be embarking on a scheme to develop and restructure our whole educational system.  This is aimed at providing equal opportunity for all. This may not be in line with some of the aims of those who criticise such a scheme but, nevertheless, I suggest it is a good scheme.  If we look at the hundreds of new and attractive schools, fully serviced, throughout the country we see some progress.  If we look at the free primary school transport system again we see some progress. If we look at the post-primary scheme for secondary and vocational education, we see some progress.  If we go on from there and look at third level education we see some progress. It may not be all the progress we would like to see, but it is still substantial progress.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the referendum. Prior to the referendum&mdash;I should like to remind the House of this lest it may be forgotten&mdash;the Minister for Foreign Affairs about a year ago had additional negotiations, shall we say, with the EEC authorities in which he negotiated special terms, first of all, for the car assembly industry and he did much better than many thought he would do.  Secondly, he won a number of concessions in regard to other important matters.  He won the concession on fishing limits. He won the concession on the retention of the tax relief system in respect of export profits; this is calculated to promote industry and to create job opportunities.</P>
    <P>We are told that there will be a European Community summit in the autumn.  No doubt at that he will point to the difficulties which face developing countries and make, I assume, some reference to our regional plans.  One would hope that the Community would adopt in full the regional planning schemes which, in my opinion, are best calculated to solve some of the problems about which we hear so much today.</P>
    <P>We are all well aware that it is undesirable to have a declining rural population.  This trend is, of course, common to most countries today.  The movement of people from rural to <Col N="1799" /> urban areas is governed by many factors. A person may migrate because he may think that he will have better prospects in the city.  As a rule, urban areas have large pools of labour.  There are many reasons why good workers move from the country to the metropolis. They may desire better services, better communications, better prospects of third level education, and so on.  All these amenities and facilities inevitably exert a pull.  I am rationalising now.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this migration from the country to the town. Power on the land, as on the factory floor, often begets its own problems. It promotes greater output per worker and, in general, I suppose it makes work more congenial.  It sometimes, however, engenders a desire in the worker to acquire a greater skill aimed ultimately towards higher pay.  This type of worker very often migrates from the country to the town.  There are many elements which tend to encourage migration of this kind.  Unfortunately migration causes an imbalance in rural life.  It changes social and economic conditions.  This is apparent in practically every area.  At one time this migration was confined to those parts of the country where the land was poor.  It is not so confined any longer.  The emphasis may vary. There may be different degrees of migration.  There may be different reasons for migration.</P>

      <P>I will conclude by welcoming the Government's action in taking steps to correct this imbalance in the rural community as was evident in their statement regarding the regional plans of the IDA.  It is to be hoped that the smaller towns of Ireland will be able to secure a fair share of industry.  Under the targets set out in the IDA plan, the cities would absorb 52 per cent of the total prosperity resulting from the plan and the remainder would go to the rural areas. It has been said here that the Buchanan Report was being left aside.  If I had <Col N="1800" /> sufficient time, I would develop this point but all I shall say now is that the Government's policy of equal distribution of industrial development is very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I wish to make in the first instance in relation to what Deputy Carter has said.  First I would like to say that the relatives and many friends of the late Michael Sweetman will appreciate greatly the tribute that Deputy Carter was generous enough to pay to him.  Secondly, I do not wish to develop the point in regard to the Buchanan Report but I cannot agree with him on that.  The Buchanan Report is not sacred and I, as well as many others, have criticised it.  Basically what the IDA have done is to move back towards the concept of a disperse development policy of such a character that it does not seem to offer the possibility of sufficient development of any part of the country outside Dublin that would provide a base to attract the kind of large scale industry which this country needs and which should not be located in Dublin. Unless we develop several large centres outside Dublin on a scale that can accept easily large industries employing a couple of thousand male workers with the adequate provision of housing, water supplies, <i>et cetera,</i> and unless we can get centres that are big enough to be self-generating and self-developing without needing permanent assistance, we will not solve our labour surplus problem.</P>
      <P>It has been one of the greatest disappointments in respect of this Government that after ten years of stalling they have gone back to where we started so that all the hopes of all those who supported unanimously the policy of growth centres which alone can give us sufficient growth, have been dashed.  The decision to abandon this policy has been tragic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the economic situation I would say first that the action of the ICTU and the unions in reopening wage and salary negotiations is one on which they must be congratulated. When the original proposals were rejected overwhelmingly it was not easy <Col N="1801" /> for the ICTU to re-open the issue.  Yet, they did so and they put the issue very straight to the unions concerned.  They did not try to mislead them into thinking that any great improvements in the amounts of money could be achieved and the negotiations open now on a realistic basis and in the hope that other improvements can be effected in the package which will not be of an unduly inflationary character but which will provide the possibility of agreement and the avoidance of industrial unrest which at this stage in our development could be particularly damaging.  It is an indication of great responsibility on their part that they have taken this action despite the continued refusal of the Government to grapple with the question of an incomes policy, and despite the fact that almost seven years after the NIEC report had laid down the principles of such a policy, the Government have done nothing even to begin to implement it.</P>
    <P>Nothing has been done to offer the kind of re-assurance that workers need and to which they have a right, the reassurance that any restraint on their part will not lead to greater resources falling into the hands of the well-to-do and that restraints in wages will not mean larger dividends.  The failure of the Government to tackle that problem has made it difficult for the unions to play their part but they have done so responsibly.  The Government have a duty to them now to respond, even seven years later, and try to devise an incomes policy that will offer the necessary reassurance and enable the unions to continue to pursue this policy of responsibility and gradually to abate the level of wage and salary claims and, consequently, of prices so that we can get out of the inflationary spiral in which we have become caught because of past failures of the Government.</P>
    <P>I was concerned this morning to hear the Taoiseach sound a note of complacency&mdash;I am sure he did not intend it to sound that way&mdash;when he talked of a 3 per cent growth rate as being not bad considering our difficulties in the tourist industry, <i>et cetera.</i> A 3 per cent growth rate is not good <Col N="1802" /> enough after two years of stagnation, thereby giving us three years of below normal growth.  Indeed we have not yet got any guarantee or promise from the Government that next year, the fourth year of this cycle of slow growth, we will get out of these difficulties and reach a stage where our growth will return even to normal, that is, to the inadequate level of the 1960s.  All we have is the statement in the EEC document and, taking a long term view and given this Government will not be in office for ever, it could be true that in the latter part of this decade our growth rate would be approaching 5 per cent and that in the 1980s it could be more than that.  For the immediate future the prospect is not encouraging and neither was the Taoiseach able to give us any encouragement.  It is disturbing that we should have to sound such a note and that he could offer us no more than this rather complacent remark about a 3 per cent growth.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of Government policy that concern us on this side of the House but, for the moment, I shall simply list a few because there are many other matters as well as economic policy on which I wish to speak.  In particular we are concerned about the failure to look ahead to the problems that free trade will create in the years immediately ahead.  We are concerned at the persistent failure to identify in advance the areas in which free trade will create problems and where efforts should be made to provide full employment.  It seems so obvious that this needs to be done that it is inconceivable that during a long period the Government have failed to take any action in this respect.  Such action was advocated first by the CIO in 1962.  The suggestion that it is impossible to foresee where the difficulties will arise is one that we cannot accept. It is impossible to foresee anything in this life with certainty but one can foresee many things with sufficient probability to provide a basis for action. If that were not so, all planning would become impossible.  Looking at our industrial structure, it is possible to see which areas are most likely to run into difficulties.  It is possible to make sure that industries in the areas most likely to suffer are given special preference <Col N="1803" /> and encouragement.  That has not been done and in some parts of the country the result has been tragic and will be even more tragic within the next couple of years as the problems of free trade, because of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and in due course from EEC membership, will affect particular areas.</P>
    <P>Regarding the disadvantages of EEC membership, the losses which we have identified all along as being likely to occur will occur within the next couple of years.  Of course, in the aggregate they are tiny by comparison with what will be the gains but it is not much consolation to a man who loses his job to be told that, as against his losses, there are vast gains to accrue to other people in other parts of the country at other times.  Failure to utilise the extra resources that EEC membership will create gradually as we go into the latter part of this decade is something which we cannot accept.  It has been a persistent weakness of this Government that they have not tackled this problem.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that we face now of the taking over of Irish firms and the creation of cartels and monopolies of a kind that are undesirable and which make our country even more vulnerable to foreign takeovers because when small Irish firms are linked together into large combines a situation is created in which objectives for speculators outside the country become worth looking at, big enough and vulnerable enough to be interesting.  The Government do not seem to have any policy on this.  There is no suggestion that the Government are willing to try to ensure that where key industries of vital importance to this country are threatened they will be kept in Irish control.  The policy of this party, as set out in our industrial policy, is that where such key industries are threatened with a foreign take-over they will be taken over by the State and run by the State rather than allowed to fall into foreign, private hands.  I am sure this policy will have the support of the Labour Party <Col N="1804" /> also.  I wish it were also the policy of Fianna Fáil and that they were not prepared, as they appear to be, to allow free industries to fall into the hands of foreign interests simply because of a predisposition in favour of private enterprise, even a foreign private enterprise as against native public enterprise.</P>
    <P>For a policy of this kind I visualise as necessary to be pursued, changes would be required in the existing organisational structure of the Government in industrial matters.  We have set out our policies here and in our policy document, of setting up a holding company to hold the shares in the manufacturing companies that are in State ownership and to use that company constructively to develop State ownership, to act as a buffer between political pressures and the commercial activities of the State bodies and to eliminate some of the criticisms that can be levied at the moment against State enterprises because it is unfairly favoured through its easier access to capital.</P>
    <P>Our policies are designed to eliminate these difficulties and to clear the way for expansion of State enterprise especially where the alternative is a foreign take-over.  This will require a new approach and the initiation of a new body to do this work and to hold the shares in the various companies and to provide the necessary expertise to ensure that we get the maximum return from State enterprises active in the manufacturing field, perhaps the part of State enterprise that has been least successful and where most needs to be done to achieve a better return and make it possible for these areas to expand.</P>
    <P>We need a complete review of tax policy, of which we see no sign from this Government.  I find a growing acceptance of the need for a capital gains tax.  A couple of years ago the old argument was: &ldquo;Do not do anything that would be a disincentive to the initiation of new projects,&rdquo; but that argument is no longer used so loudly. Even conservative people now accept that a capital gains tax is desirable.  I have spoken to some of the wealthiest people in the country, people you <Col N="1805" /> would not think of as people concerned with any form of socialism, I can assure Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, who feel that the failure to have a capital gains tax in this country is indefensible.</P>
    <P>In the last few days I spoke to a stockbroker who, commenting on recent take-overs, felt we needed a more radical policy.  It is interesting to see how rapidly opinion has evolved even among people who would be regarded by some people on the left as props of the capitalist system.  Many of these people now realise that the capitalist system as we operate it has grave defects and that radical changes will be needed if it is to survive and serve our people as an economic system must if it is worthy to survive.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that our taxation is redistributed.  I shall not dwell on this because we spent the whole of yesterday from 10.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. on it and failed to presuade the Government to take the necessary step to achieve a more redistribute operation of our tax system through the value-added tax and the zero-rating of food.  Clearly, the Government are not prepared to do this and we had the extraordinary message given to the House yesterday that so long as Fianna Fáil is in power there can be no reduction in any expenditure taxes because the Government are incapable of ensuring that the benefits are passed on to the consumer.  I thought those words from Deputy Colley sounded the death-knell of the Government because no people would accept that the Government are incapable of running the country's affairs as the people expect them to be run.</P>
    <P>When people hear this message, and I can assure Deputies on the other side of the House that I shall do my best to make sure they do hear the message from Fianna Fáil that there can no longer be tax reduction because the Government cannot ensure that they can be passed on to the public, they will lose such confidence as they have left in the Government.  The Minister rejected any idea of reducing VAT on any item on the grounds that you could not guarantee that the benefit would pass on to the consumer and that nobody could guarantee it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Very broad, I thought, dangerously broad for the survival of the Government.  More widely, there is the need for a negative income tax which would combine our taxation and social welfare systems.  Our present system of taxation and social welfare is inadequate because it makes no provision to help people on low incomes who may need assistance.  It enables us to help people who are sick, who are widowed, or unemployed, but not to help people who, although they have jobs, are by virtue of their inadequate salaries and the inadequacy of social policies in the provision of housing, in a position of poverty.  We need a system whereby the tax system can pay out as well as take in money and in which the system of redistribution of income will no longer be in two separate categories, insulated from each other and incapable even in the aggregate of providing social justice. We need a system to combine the two. These are the sort of reforms that a change of government would secure, reforms which anybody can see will not come from the Government which, at this stage, is too long in office.</P>
      <P>Leaving the internal economic side I regret very much that we have not had the opportunity of a special debate on EEC.  I regret that the concern to get out of this House as quickly as possible has led to such pressure on those of us trying to deal with the Business of the House that it has meant the elimination of this debate. As I said to a colleague yesterday, it was poetic justice that those who were so keen to get everything wound up are going to spend three weeks in Cork when the whole purpose of winding things up in the case of some people was not, I think, to be in Cork&mdash;I am not addressing myself to this side of the House.  I find it hard to believe from the enthusiasm on the Government side for getting everything wound up and getting us out of here, first on the 21st, then back to the 14th&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is off his chest now and I hope he feels more comfortable. It is a pity we have not had an EEC debate because we are approaching the Summit, which, of course, may be postponed.  But it may not be postponed and if it does occur it occurs three or four days, as I understand it, before the Dáil resumes because I was horrified to hear that, despite the arguments given me by people on the other side of the House that the Dáil should adjourn early so as to come back early at the end of September or early in October to deal with the mass of EEC legislation, the Taoiseach announced this morning that we shall not come back until much later in October.</P>
      <P>It now seems possible that the Summit will occur without this Dáil having debated the vitally important issues involved which include, for example, all the problems of the European Parliament; the proposals of the Odell Report for the reform of the European Parliament and extension of its powers; for the creation of a position in which there would be an element of co-decision between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers; proposals for direct elections of vital importance for this country because we shall find it very difficult&mdash; impossible, I think&mdash;to provide the personnel to man the Parliament and the committees of the Parliament so long as they must also be Members of this House, as is the present requirement, until the reform of direct elections is introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote an article on this several weeks ago setting out the facts as I knew them then.  I discovered on the day the article was published, in talking to the Secretary-General of the European Parliament, that I had underestimated the problem because I had assumed, perhaps rather naively, that a Deputy from here would be expected <Col N="1808" /> to be a member of one committee.  I discovered that, as the average committee membership is 29, and as there are 13 committees, and only 136 members of the Parliament, on average for the committees to be properly manned every Deputy from here would have to be on three committees.  I discovered that in the European Parliament many Deputies are members of three committees and others are members of two.</P>
    <P>As, in fact, even to be a member of one committee will involve between 60 and 85 days out of the country, to be members of two or three committees, as will be required of us if we are to protect the interests of this country in the European Parliament which will be of growing importance, would require Deputies from this House to be out of the country for something like 120 days on average.  In view of the distances involved, it will not be possible for us to combine satisfactorily membership of the European Parliament on that scale with membership of this House.</P>
    <P>Under our multi-seat PR system, which is unique in that the electorate has a free personal choice and is not presented with a party list on which the man who goes to the European Parliament is put at the top by the Party to ensure his re-election&mdash;because we have this personal voting in a multi-seat PR system which we have very good reason to retain&mdash;it will be difficult for Deputies who have to spend 120 days out of the country, plus whatever days are required for travelling backwards and forwards, to retain their seats against an assiduous constituency member of his own party in the same constituency.  Therefore we have a unique problem and we should be discussing it in this House so that we could give guidance to the Government as to the line to take at the summit meeting.  Yet we are not having such a debate to discuss it.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of monetary union and agricultural policy and the link between the two, and the vital importance to us of moving to a monetary union to protect the agricultural policy, and the political implications of that, which are not fully realised.  If we wish to protect the agricultural policy <Col N="1809" /> we ought to be aiming for a monetary union.  If that monetary union were to be democratically controlled it would require a vast step forward towards a more federal kind of Europe.  If we maintain the kind of Gaullist attitude which emanates from Ministers and Deputies on the other side of the House, we will sabotage our own vital interest in the matter of agricultural policy and monetary union.  These things should be discussed and debated. Yet they are not to be discussed because of the premature termination of this session.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem of regional policy which we have not begun to discuss except in very crude terms, in terms of Buchanan, but not in European terms at all.  There are other matters we should also be discussing, for example, the problem of the appointments to the Commission. I should just like to throw out the thought that it is very important that the appointments made are of the best possible people.  It seems likely that the Irish Commissioner will be a Minister of this Government.  The Party opposite have an unfortunate tradition of jobbery.  This started in the 1930s.  One can understand why a Party coming to power after the period of the civil war felt it necessary to appoint some of their own supporters who had, equally necessarily, been excluded from jobs in the 1920s.</P>
    <P>It is 40 years later now and the tradition still persists.  It is very important that the Fianna Fáil Minister who becomes the Commissioner will take the proper decisions, because he will be playing a very important role in decision-making on the Irish appointments, that they will be free of any considerations of jobbery and that the best people will be appointed.  I hope this will be the case.  It may be the case.  I am not suggesting that it necessarily will not be, but I emphasise the importance of this, and it is an aspect of the problem which we should be discussing.</P>
    <P>Finally on the EEC, Deputy Carter congratulated the Government on the success of the negotiations.  What I said at the beginning I said badly and I was consequently and rightly misunderstood <Col N="1810" /> by Deputy Cruise-O'Brien. What I was trying to say at the beginning of the great debate on the EEC was that the negotiations taking place about entry were not really difficult or important because, since we were adhering to the Rome Treaty, the terms were set and only minor variations and transitional arrangements could be agreed.  I think I was right in that because we all knew in advance what the terms would be.</P>
    <P>Now that we are in, there is an immensely important and difficult problem of negotiation to be overcome. I do not believe this Government are equipped to do that.  From anything I heard about their efforts so far in the very easy and simple job they had, suggests that they are not protecting adequately the interests of the country.  Reports which come back from Brussels indicate that the people there are puzzled as to why our Government are not standing up for our interests and why they are not doing what other Governments are doing and why they are giving in far too easily.  Even those with whom they are negotiating are puzzled by this.  I can assure the House that when there is a change of Government that will change also.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the issue which is in all our minds at the moment, the issue of Northern Ireland and all that is at stake there.  So much has been lost in the past year.  All the gains of the Civil Rights movement have been lost effectively. The reforms are overshadowed and the possibility of creating in the foreseeable future a viable society in Northern Ireland has been undermined by the violence which has taken place there.  The rampant sectarianism of the Provisional IRA has done lasting damage to the possibility of creating a genuine community within Northern Ireland or bringing the two parts of the country together.</P>
    <P>Where this has led to we can now see.  It has led to such anarchy that it appears that the Provisional IRA were unable to maintain the truce.  During the truce there were endless murders. As far as one can make out from the identity of the people killed, they certainly were not all killed by Protestants. <Col N="1811" /> I am sure that the Provisional IRA tried to maintain discipline but obviously so many anarchic groups have come into being in the situation they created that control proved impossible and, to cover their failure to control the situation, an ending of the truce was necessary apparently.  That is one interpretation of the situation.</P>
    <P>Now in our own part of the country we are disgraced before the world.  The heading in the evening paper, most misleading, is: &ldquo;Gardaí protect Orangemen&rdquo;.  From what appears underneath it should read: &ldquo;Hooligans attack Protestants&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>During the rioting, three people were hit by shotgun pellets, a garda car was burned, the Orange Hall was attacked with petrol bombs...</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It was a wild, hell of a night here,&rdquo; Mr. Fleming said.  &ldquo;Many Protestant businesses are wrecked and in the present mood anything could happen&rdquo;...</P>
      <P>A Garda spokesman said that they had done this peacefully&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Orangement had marched&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;earlier in the day on their way out and had been doing it peacefully for as long as he could remember.</P>
      <P>They did not do it peacefully this year. At about 1 a.m. an attempt was made to set fire to the Orange Hall, using petrol bombs and incendiary devices. The report goes on:</P>
      <P>Crowds of people, many of whom had spent the intervening time in public houses, roamed the town, breaking windows and in some cases looting from broken shop fronts.</P>
      <P>This is what has been going on in the past 24 hours in this part of Ireland. That is how some people think they will re-unite Ireland&mdash;by starting sectarian warfare against innocent Protestants in this part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What action will be taken on that? How will we rally our people, because <Col N="1812" /> we have a duty to do that?  We must insist that the old shibboleths are abandoned and that in this part of the country we shall start a fresh before too much damage is done.  We must abandon the idea that we have a right to Northern Ireland.  It is true that Northern Ireland was artificially created originally, and that it is an artificial area, but its artificiality is irrelevant at this stage.  It has been there for 50 years and any attempt to re-unite Ireland without the consent of the majority there would be fatal and would lead to a civil war twice as bloody as any that could happen now within the area of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Yet there are people in this House who will not accept that, and who continue to assert this claim.  One of the great problems to be overcome, and which I hope the all-Party Committee will overcome, is to get away from that attitude and to get a total acceptance of the concept of re-union by consent, and only by consent.  This will not be easy.  There are people in this part of the country who are not prepared for changes down here, who do not see the need for them, and who are not prepared to give up this claim.  To persuade them we must be persuaded ourselves, all of us in this House.  We must lead the campaign to persuade our people that we need to change our society down here redically.</P>
    <P>I know there are people who find this difficult and who say: &ldquo;Why should we change the tidy, cosy little Catholic State we have set up for those so-and-so Northerners?&rdquo;  It is a point of view, and they are entitled to their point of view.  I believe they should be put to the test and I hope that in Deputy Carter's warning that we should not expect too much from his Committee he is unduly pessimistic.  I hope that from this Committee will come a clear proposal for a new Constitution, devoid of any of the elements in the present Constitution which people, and especially Protestants here and in the North, find objectionable.</P>
    <P>I hope that new Constitution will be put to the Irish people and that they will have a right to say whether or not they want it.  If people decide that they want to keep things as they are, to keep <Col N="1813" /> a cosy, Catholic State in 26 counties, let them vote against the new Constitution and we will know where we stand. Let those people who want to create a new Ireland vote for it.  I believe they will be in the majority if we in this House give the leadership for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves how much do we know about the North, how much do we care about the North? How many people from this House visit the North with any degree of frequency?  How many of us have been trying to make contact with the Protestants of Northern Ireland and trying to offer them the reassurance of personal contact?  How many Members on the other side of the House have done so? When I go to the North, I am constantly asked &ldquo;Why do we never see anybody from Fianna Fáil?&rdquo;  They understand that members of the Government cannot be going up there but why are Fianna Fáil backbenchers not doing what Fine Gael and Labour backbenchers and frontbenchers are doing, going up there and trying to make contact.</P>

      <P>When the three weeks are over, I hope we will see many people from here up in Northern Ireland in August, September and October, because apparently we are to have three and a half months holiday this year.  Let us use these months when the by-election is over, having had whatever rest we want ourselves, to get into contact as much as possible with people in Northern Ireland and try to get across to them that we are not seeking to impose something on them against their will, that indeed many of us down here will stand and fight against any attempt to force them into this country against their will, that we will seek to protect their rights as Irishmen to decide their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But do we care?  Do we care enough to suppress the IRA murderers in this part of the country?  Do we care enough to change our Constitution, to <Col N="1814" /> purge it of those things which are objectionable to a religious minority?  Do we care enough to reject totally the claim to Northern Ireland and the whole idea of an all-Ireland plebiscite which is constantly resurrected to the detriment of any possibility of a union of minds and hearts between north and south?</P>
    <P>Do we care enough to treat the hooligans of St. Johnston as public enemies and sectarian pariahs?  Do we care enough to give the hand of friendship as warmly and as sincerely to Protestants in the North as to Catholics, to show that we care for them, that we understand their disorientation at this time, when all they had been led to believe has suddenly been overturned or undermined, that we understand how they feel and that instead of gloating over the fact that their hopes have turned out not to be well-founded, we can feel for them in their disorientation?</P>
    <P>Are we able to make that effort, because certainly it is not coming across?  Any time one goes to Belfast, one does not find the Protestants there conscious of any feeling that there is any sympathy for them down here.  No message of sympathy is coming through.  Do we care enough to show them Christian love, to turn the other cheek when in their misery and fear and confusion, they berate us, often unfairly, as at the Orange demonstration the other day?  Do we care enough to do that?  Are we finally, and this is the final test, prepared to stand against anyone who suggests that we should accept reunification on any terms except with the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland?  If we do care enough to do these things, there is hope; there is hope for peace in Northern Ireland and hope for a genuine unity in the whole island in time to come; but if we do not we are fooling ourselves, we are hypocrites and we are paving the way for civil war in Northern Ireland and, perhaps, in the whole country and certainly postponing the day of reunification in our lifetime.</P>
    <P>That is the test, and I cannot say that I detect in this House the sense of urgency&mdash;a sense of despair at times <Col N="1815" /> might be the appropriate feeling&mdash; needed to give us the impetus to do the things which need to be done.  I do not detect that.  All that an individual member can do is to try to arouse the conscience of the House as best he can and some Deputies have tried to do this.  I listened to Deputy O'Leary, the last speaker on the Labour benches, and hearing him, I felt there was not much more to be said.  With everything he said I was so totally in agreement and it was so well expressed that for a moment I thought there was not much point in my speaking, but being who I am, I did not allow that to deter me from making a few remarks, as Deputy O'Donovan will readily understand.</P>
    <P>I feel that this is the great issue of our time.  Can we make the effort of imagination, a very difficult thing to do, necessary to meet the situation?  Can we abate the fires of extreme nationalism, which are easily lit in all of us, sufficiently to allow Christian love to take their place and so that to us an Orangeman becomes somebody for whom we genuinely care, whom we want to make happy, whom we want to reassure and whom we want to help, instead of someone whom we want to get the better of?  That is the test.  It is the test by which, I am afraid, at this moment many of us in the Republic fall and all of us, indeed, from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to forgive the prejudices of centuries and it is not easy, because we have all been brought up in different ways in narrow traditions, to break out of them and none of us is free from these prejudices.  I have been trying to write something on the subject recently and when I had written it, I gave it to a distinguished Church of Ireland clergyman in Northern Ireland to get his views to see whether there was anything in it which would be objectionable to the members of the Protestant community.  I was trying to write something that would not contain anything that could in any way be offensive.  He had to suggest many deletions.  The unconscious prejudies of 45 years in my mind were there and however hard I tried to eliminate them <Col N="1816" /> there were still things in the book which from the point of view of a northern Protestant would have grated.</P>
    <P>It is a measure of the task which is facing us, with the difficulty before us that even those of us with the greatest goodwill, concerned above all else to achieve this union of minds and hearts, will not find it easy always to act and to speak in the way necessary to achieve that objective, and for many who have not begun to think in those terms it is a very great task indeed that lies before them, but it is the task facing the nation.  At this moment, above all moments, in this debate at this time in the summer of 1972, this is the matter which should be most present in our minds and I hope that, like Deputy O'Leary's speech Deputy Cruise-O'Brien's speech and those of others from these benches&mdash;Deputy Cooney, Deputy Harte and Deputy O'Higgins will be speaking&mdash;and speeches like that of Deputy Childers will echo through the country and that this debate will be reported in a way and read in a way that will give a lead to public opinion in this country and then this debate may be part of the beginning of the approach to a new Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We share in this debate with the people of Northern Ireland the appalling common tragedy which still prevails there by reason of the current sectarian and political strife in the North.  We certainly share as individual Deputies the personal suffering, bereavement and injury sustained by families in the North and those from Britain who have also suffered during the past four years.  I must confess that, looking around here since this morning, I deplore the cursory interest of Members of this House and particularly of the Government Party in this debate.  Just look at their benches at present&mdash;empty except for a dozing Parliamentary Secretary&mdash;on a key issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On this key issue of Northern Ireland, we must feel that this House has not made a very distinctive <Col N="1817" /> contribution.  I would point out that this morning when the Taoiseach spoke, only 48 members&mdash;one-third of the membership&mdash;even bothered to turn up to hear.  There were about 28 Fianna Fáil Deputies and 20 odd from the Opposition.  This is a measure of the true concern of this House about Northern Ireland and it is an illuminating statistic.  I think therefore the time has come when, at least on the part of those of us who are prepared to talk, there should be some very straight talking about the current situation because we feel that this House seems to be alarmingly unaware, unresponsive and disinterested in the communal havoc being wreaked in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It does not yet seem to have dawned that there is a civil war in progress in Northern Ireland.  I am not interested in whether one wants to count it as four dead or five dead or 400 dead. The fact of the matter is that at present we have smouldering civil war in Northern Ireland and this should be the almost total preoccupation of this House.  What do we do?  We decide to adjourn until the 25th of October next. We should be honest enough to appreciate in this House and in the Republic that the bitter and harsh outcome of the IRA campaign of violence is that the people of this island, North and South, are today more divided, more embittered and more disunited than at any time in our history.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>All the bombings, all the political assassinations, all the hooded murders and the mutilations of bodies that have taken place in recent weeks prior to people being murdered, all the loss of jobs, permanently in many cases, have only served to confirm the bitter belief of the Northern Unionists that we in the Republic overtly, or by force or by <Col N="1818" /> acquiescence, want to coerce them finally into unconditional surrender, into a Catholic, green, republic.</P>
      <P>I do not think this has, as yet, dawned fully on the House and on the electorate.  I think we have failed to appreciate this.  Has it yet dawned on the people in the Republic that the rate of emigration from Northern Ireland is currently five times that of 1971 and that hundreds of skilled workers and their families are literally baling out of the North permanently?  One can imagine the haemorrhage that is to this island.  I do not think it has fully dawned on this House that we are witnessing and have witnessed in the past 12 months the economic demolition of Northern Ireland essentially, provocatively and deliberately by the Provisional IRA aided and abetted by the Official IRA when the thought has struck them and when they felt like turning their ideological strategy into their version of action.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we are witnessing the political, social and economic collapse of part of this island and it has not yet fully dawned on the electorate what is going on.  What do we get in response? A bit of wishy washy PRO stuff from the Taoiseach, a little bit about a regional parliament.  That is the solution he sees to it, thrown in between a little bit of political horseplay about the mid-Cork by-election.  This is the measure of the response from Dáil Éireann and the Republic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry to say that most members of this House are not terribly different from the Taoiseach in that regard.  Most members have held their tongues in their cheeks.  Some of us have held our tongues in our cheeks in the hope that the strenuous efforts of our colleagues in the SDLP towards a ceasefire would bear fruit.  Others have held their tongues in their cheeks for the past four years, since 1968 when the civil rights movement began, because they are scared stiff of losing a few first or second preference votes at the polls in the next general election. It must be said to Northern Ireland and to the country as a whole that the vast majority of Dáil Deputies and Senators have kept their mouths shut on Northern Ireland for the simple reason <Col N="1819" /> that they are afraid to speak on unpopular issues in the Republic and they are afraid they might lose a few votes in an election.</P>

We will stay quiet because we will garner the republican votes from mid-Cork and we will parade the old IRA men through mid-Cork with the pipe bands in the next three weeks and three cheers for the Fianna Fáil candidate.&rdquo;  That is the level of political consciousness of this House in the context of Northern Ireland and that is the kind of by-election campaign we will face in the next three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are not a dozen Deputies in this House who have made their views known and who have spoken with conviction on Northern Ireland.  Leaving aside the Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle there are 142 Deputies.  Only about a dozen have given any sort of leadership in this House including, for the most part, those present here this evening.  Too many Deputies and too many Senators have adopted the usual ambivalence, the usual equivocation.  Take the typical one where we all break down, the question of somebody being shot, somebody being murdered or killed. To many Deputies and Senators the killing of a gunman who would exchange rifle fire with the British Army, is the subject of total, vehement protest. <Col N="1820" /> However, if you kill an aged Unionist Senator on his doorstep in &ldquo;self-defence&rdquo;, or so the Officials classified it, it is different.  Those wonderful ideologists should all have last night looked at the RTE programme, &ldquo;The Common Fascist&rdquo;.  That was a very good programme, an instructive one for politicians, for upcoming candidates for Fuehrer in this country.  If you kill in a cold-blooded manner an aged Unionist Senator on his own doorstep it merits a kind of subconconscious approval.  For example, did we ever hear Deputy Cunningham speak about the Senator who was murdered by the Official IRA or about what happened yesterday in Donegal?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The <i>Irish Press</i> is all right!  These are the kind of things that make me very irate and which make me say to my friends in the trade union movement in Northern Ireland, the few hundred friends I have up there: &ldquo;You would be mad to touch us, you would want to have your heads examined because we are not worthy of a United Ireland or even of your friendship.&rdquo;  To many people here if a Protestant working man is shot by a member of the Provisional IRA in Belfast that is his bad luck, but if a Catholic working man is shot going to work in Belfast in the crossfire between the British Army and the IRA it is an unholy outrage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from about 12 Deputies I have never seen in parliamentary debates of any self-respecting republic more selective sensitivity about the degree of sympathy and the degree of condemnation which should be extended in any given circumstance of any given killing.  That is why there are 400 dead Irishmen and women and that is why 5,000 people are maimed for life in Northern Ireland, because we have all been so beautifully selective. The Taoiseach stands out in that <Col N="1821" /> selectivity.  His speech today was a little bit more on the side of peace, a little bit less on the hard line.  That is about all that is in it.  A little bit of the regional parliament thrown in as if that would mean anything.  It was a speech in which there is still too much of the double talk and the double think, nice things to all men,</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach hopes that by being the most respectable, charismatic politician in the Republic he will solve the problem of Northern Ireland, he will carry the day when he shakes hands with Brian Faulkner in 1985 over the bodies of about 10,000 dead Irishmen.  The only thing I would advise the Taoiseach to do is to count his fingers after he has done so because Mr. Faulkner is quite capable of handling him even if he is now a third rate politician in the setting of Parliamentary action.  To those who have been working for a peaceful solution to the political and sectarian problems of Northern Ireland I would say that in our despair we must not give way to the situation and we must not adopt the typical public reaction in the Republic of saying: &ldquo;Let them fight it out in the North.  Let both sides kill themselves and when there are enough of them dead we in the Republic will say that we were right.  We will then move in with our new Constitution and three cheers for a united Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The first guarantee that we must seek is that the whole population of Northern Ireland need the elementary, very trite, but humane precondition of peace and security in their own homes, on the streets and in their jobs, in an atmosphere in which both communities must be able to get together without threat to their lives.  This is something which we certainly should be striving for to the best of our ability in the Republic.  I do not think we should be under any illusions about the strategy of the Provisionals in Northern Ireland. If they can on any given occasion cast themselves in a defensive role then they will use that fact to their advantage.  If they cannot do so they will officially and offensively indulge in shooting and bombing as they think fit.  It is a very simple double edged strategy.  That is the harsh reality of IRA strategy in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1822" /> The harsh reality is that under the pretext of rescuing the minority from Unionist domination and from the British Army in Northern Ireland, although that has become a little bit tarnished now, they seek to set up both North and South their version of a fanatical military dictatorship in this country.  That is the true ideology of the Mac Stiophains and the O Bradaigs. Let this House be under no illusion about their particular ideological attitudes.  If they were to gain control of the executive functions of our common country I can assure everybody that the taste of military dictatorship that we would get in this country would leave the British Army, Long Kesh and the portraits of the common fascists which we saw on the RTE classic film the other evening, which sent a thrill of horror through many of us, in the shade.</P>
    <P>They have the good propagandistic competence to cloak their deeds and their statements in the usual nationalistic rhetoric, which, when you strip it means that they want political power, North and South, at the threat of a gun barrel.  It is our responsibility as elected public representatives to develop a united public opinion and to represent it effectively.  Only that kind of opinion vehemently opposed to the IRA in the south, to the UDA in Northern Ireland and within the majority can now break the deadlock in Northern Ireland.  The men of violence in the IRA and those they have created in the UDA are now the chief obstacles to a solution to the real prospect of any ending of the current civil war in Northern Ireland.  Let us face up to it; that is what we have.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that in many of the policies of the IRA over the past four years and of the Provisionals in particular they have provoked the emergence of the UDA and the UVF. If they have done so they now see in no uncertain terms that their atrocities, their mutilations, their tortures and their bombings have certainly reared a monster in the midst of this country. One must speak in a very depressing context here.  It is fashionable and politically popular for politicians in the Republic to condemn both the UDA and the UVF.  This is part of southern <Col N="1823" /> politics.  This is the easy way out south of the Border, but is resented when politicians decide to denounce the cold blooded strategy of the IRA in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it is fully appreciated yet by many people in the Republic that the Provisional IRA are now playing once again in the current full-blooded war situation with the lives of the people of Belfast and Derry.  The women from Derry who came to this House during the past two days have told us that in no uncertain terms.  We take their word for it.  There can be no prospect of building up reconciliation and rebuilding the bridges between the two communities in this island without an end to the violence of the IRA in particular.  It is essential that we classify the activities of the IRA for what they really are. They are acting as terrorists in the worst sense of that word in its national and international meaning.  We should have no equivocation on that kind of definition.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of grave national concern that these self-appointed custodians of democracy should have succeeded for the first time and, I hope, for the last time in bombing themselves on to the conference table with the British Government.  We challenge those self-appointed custodians of Irish democracy that if they want to put their policies to the acid test and if Mr. David O'Connell, John Stephenson, Rory Brady or Seán Ó Brádaigh&mdash;it is irrelevant whether one uses the English or Irish versions of their names as far as I am concerned they have defiled the name of Irishmen&mdash;we in Dáil Éireann challenge them to fight the mid-Cork by-election and they can face the 50,000 electors in that constituency. Let them put their deposits where their mouths and revolvers have been in the past few years.  We ask those future candidates for Fuehrerdom in this country to put their money on the table in the mid-Cork by-election.</P>
    <P>Time and again we in the Labour Party have repudiated unequivocally any attempt to achieve a united Ireland by force of arms and, therefore, as far as we are concerned we will never sit <Col N="1824" /> down with those who advance their political views in Irish politics by the bomb and by the bullet.  We deplore the fact that anybody in this island should, in fact, fall into this trap.  Those people owe no allegiance to any Irishmen but themselves and they owe no allegiance to any policy or any constitution in this country except their own provincial paper republics, written by themselves for themselves alone.  It is illuminating to note their recent actions in regard to the truce.  We were all appalled by the manner in which the so-called cease fire was called.  We saw the callous, indiscriminate bombings and shootings that went on right up to the 11th hour of the calling of that truce. We saw the robbery after robbery of citizens in Northern Ireland and of places with financial resources in the North by those who were the peace lovers calling a truce.</P>
    <P>Is that the way to go about a truce? As far as we are concerned it is a mockery of the concept of a ceasefire. We saw the British administration in the North blundering in relation to the Lenadoon incident.  It was an unfortunate affair.  Had Mr. Whitelaw been in Belfast I do not believe it would have happened.  But what happened? One small mistake in an arrangement where an allocation was made by the Northern Ireland Housing Authority an allocation made, incidentally, by an authority whose offices the Provisionals had bombed and burned out in every town in Northern Ireland; it is ironic to hear the Provisionals defending the actions of the Northern Ireland Housing Authority when they do not recognise them and they burned out and bombed out every one of their rent offices and administrative offices in Northern Ireland.  Therefore we saw a contrived situation with Mr. Twomey and his gauleiters deliberately smashing the truce because it suited them at that time to smash it and to resurrect bloodshed in Northern Ireland and keep their names in the paper on that basis.  Even Bernadette Devlin had the wit to say they were playing into the hands of the UDA on that occasion.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, and I am fully conscious of the appalling difficulties facing Mr. Whitelaw&mdash;and I have great <Col N="1825" /> regard for the efforts of that man to try to normalise the situation in Northern Ireland&mdash;that he made a narrow political judgment, a serious political error, last Friday.  It was a blunder of the first magnitude.  It was a serious blunder.  It is something from which he can recover.  It was something from which we can recover, because I do not believe that men who are responsible for murder, assassination, political and sectarian murder, for hoodings, shootings of fellow Irishmen, who mutilate them and torture them before they shoot them in the name of the Irish Republic, I do not believe that those men, simply because they turned off violence for a couple of weeks, will automatically win a place at a conference table.  As far as I am concerned these are men who are inhuman and they will turn a truce on and off only when it suits them.  Therefore, they turned it off when it suited them to turn it off.</P>
    <P>Some people have created a precedent in this regard.  I must confess openly that I was not very pleased when Mr. Harold Wilson accepted, in a very devious manner, in a manner which I personally deplore, an invitation to meet the Provisional IRA leadership.  He did not even have the courtesy to inform the Taoiseach or the Leader of the Labour Party before doing so.  He must bear some responsibility for setting a precedent in that regard; he must have some responsibility for his too-clever-by-half arrangements at the time, because all that has happened from the meetings of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Whitelaw with the Provisional IRA is that the IRA are generally enhanced in their own self-importance and self-esteem.</P>
    <P>It may have, in a transient way, enhanced the self-esteem of Mr. Wilson but certainly I think he, too, will now have some regrets in that regard.  I claim, as a Labour Party representative who has met Mr. Wilson, and as an Irishman, in particular, the right to say, and let there be no illusions about this, that many British politicians would sell out democracy in the Republic and in Northern Ireland to get a settlement of the situation in Northern Ireland.  As far as we are <Col N="1826" /> concerned we say to Mr. Heath, to Mr. Wilson and to Mr. Whitelaw: &ldquo;Democracy will prevail North and South&rdquo; and that is the rule of the law of the island not just using democracy when it suits them to meet certain people in Northern Ireland.  Let us get that quite clear.</P>
    <P>I think it is also true to say that perhaps my colleagues in the SDLP may have sold the idea to the Provisionals that if they called off the truce they might perhaps meet Mr. Whitelaw.  That was a brave effort.  Personally I can say this, because I said it to them directly, because I have the greatest reservations about the exercise and because I have always believed that both the Provisionals and Official IRA have been playing for much higher stakes, stakes which do not include the SDLP, Mr. Whitelaw, Harold Wilson or any elected public representative. Their stakes include their preconditions and the penny has dropped in that regard, over the past few weeks.  I expressed that viewpoint to the SDLP leadership on at least two occasions that this was, shall we say, the name of the game.  I think those of us in the South&mdash;as a Corkman knowing Mr. Daithi Ó Conaill, I can say those of us in the South can claim to have some knowledge of the cultural mentality of those who went to school in the South of Ireland bearing no illusions about some of their mental make-ups in that regard.  Unfortunately successive British Cabinets and public servants do not really understand the culture of the men of physical force and they tend to blunder on again and again.  Because they were able to do it in an Aden or a Palestinian situation, where there was not a real one million left to talk about afterwards, they think they can apply the same solution to Ireland.  I am afraid they will have to put on their thinking caps again.</P>
    <P>Therefore I think we have got to sift the propaganda from the reality of the situation.  I think we have got to sift it very carefully and we have to be very careful about who to believe.  For example, there is Mr. O'Connell.  About seven or eight weeks ago he was reported in <i>The Sunday Press</i> as saying that my colleague here, Deputy Cruise-O'Brien, <Col N="1827" /> was responsible for the graves of Irish soldiers from the Congo in Glasnevin.  Did the Editor of <i>The Sunday Press</i> take it up?  Not a word. There was not a word.  Did anybody write a letter to <i>The Sunday Press</i>? Not a word.  Did anybody even bother to point out that Deputy Cruise-O'Brien was not even in the Congo when the event happened, that it was subsequent to that that he was posted by the United Nations to the Congo? Oh, no.  But if you are a good propagandist the smear or the lie will operate.  This is the kind of hypocrisy that we have in that regard.</P>
    <P>Has anybody dared to challenge the Provisionals in relation to their statements in respect of internment?  Any member of the SDLP or any erstwhile republican, whether North or South, who would dare meet with anybody, even in the seclusion of the Commons in London, and discuss Northern Ireland was assured of a &ldquo;sell-out of the internees&rdquo;.  Yet they had no hesitation in selling out the hostages in Long Kesh, the Provisional IRA hostages in Long Kesh, to get them on their private helicopter from County Derry to Belfast and on to their private planes.  It is necessary that that be pointed out. They perform their duties under the democratic authority of Dáil Éireann and we will repudiate and oppose as a political party, by every means in our power, any attempt to usurp the legitimate authority of the State in that regard.  As far as we are concerned, the security forces of our Republic will have our full support in bringing before the due process of the law those individuals who incite to violence, who rob banks, who carry arms and ammunition with intent to endanger life.</P>
    <P>The members of both Houses of the Oireachtas must never abdicate to the men of violence the function of political leadership which is the function of democratically elected representatives in a free society, in a free country, in a free part of this island. Our democratic institutions are very far from perfect.  They are very inadequate in many respects and they are <Col N="1828" /> in many respects unresponsive.  Three years in this House would drive one to despair in trying to make them a bit more responsive, less imperfect and more adequate.  Bad and all as they are, we on this side of the Border will not allow them to languish simply because of the attitude of those who favour democracy by the gun.  If democracy fails on this side of the Border it will not be the responsibility of the Labour Party; it will be the responsibility, I would think, of the 120 elected Deputies in this House who have shut their minds and their mouths on the national question right through from 1968, and these men who, in my opinion, do not deserve to represent their constituents in this House.</P>
    <P>Our country is not the political private property, either North or South, of any group of politicians either in the Unionist Party, in the Fianna Fáil Party, in the UDA or the IRA.  It is the common property and the common heritage of all the 4½ million people who live and who must work on this island and who, whether they like it or not, must learn to live in a pluralist and in an interdenominational society.</P>
    <P>The late Michael Sweetman, who made a distinctive contribution to this country in recent years, who was a Republican, in the true sense of the term, although he did not speak or sound like one at times, in his calm, rational approach to affairs, stated in his recently published pamphlet, which was published as <i>The Common Name of Irishmen</i>, published by his friends at the request of his wife, said:</P>
    <P>The re-establishment of some kind of self-government in Northern Ireland is the kind of solution on which agreement is most likely to be reached between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  It is the solution that would go closest to meeting the aspirations of each since both communities are now seeking some form of self-determination.</P>
    <P>He went on to say that he considered it possible to construct a system that would give Northern Ireland at least as great a degree of self-determination as it previously had while making a return to the old sectarian type government <Col N="1829" /> impossible and, he suggested additionally, the use of PR.</P>
    <P>I endorse that view of the late Michael Sweetman and I endorse the view expressed by Deputy Corish this morning when he asked the SDLP and the now British resident administration in Northern Ireland and the other elected representatives to get around the table without any preconditions, and to Hell with the IRA.  Let them bomb themselves into subjection in this country.  They should do the work for which they were elected; get around the table and negotiate structures for Northern Ireland which will bring sanity to that community.  The Taoiseach, Mr. Lynch, has a long way to go before he can claim to operate particularly in that regard.</P>

      <P>I would say that the Taoiseach still lives in the partitionist corridors of thought, although he rightly took on Deputy Blaney, Mr. Boland and Deputy Haughey, and dealt with them quite effectively, but he has acted belatedly on every single issue in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have less than three minutes.  I reserve the right to speak. I want to say in conclusion that the Taoiseach talks and talks about changing our laws and practices to make them more adaptable, not only to modern life, but also to a free, united country and a united people.  Frankly, it is all just talk and more talk.  He has unnecessarily and dishonestly dodged almost every single constitutional issue that has come up.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Hillery, apart from his flying gimmick visit to the Falls Road two years ago has contributed only marginally.  He has done precious little indeed in the past three years to seize the opportunity presented to him, above all, the opportunity to cut across the divisions in this country. The Taoiseach has done far too much washing of his hands in public and so have the leaders of the Churches in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1830" /> I ask the Taoiseach, therefore, to spell out in unequivocal terms the price to be paid on this side of the Border for national reunification in economic, political and social terms.  He has not done so yet.  Has he in this House ever attempted to define the rights of the minority, where they would begin and end, in relation to a united Ireland? Has the Taoiseach ever dealt openly with the legitimate questions which the Protestant minority in Ireland raise, whether it is Article 44 or the education system or the question of mixed marriages, the question of adoption, the question of the Irish language, the question of family planning, the question of social services or the question of economic and social development North and South?  All we have had today is a statement about a regional parliament in the distant, misty future.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the questions related to the future relationship of the people of this country have not been teased out by this House and I submit that we have a long way to go before we can claim to have been honest in that regard.  The Fianna Fáil Party have dodged the issues and they have acted dishonestly, without leadership, in this context.  The people of Northern Ireland see the growing gulf in the Republic between the haves and the have-nots.  The Protestant community regard us in the Republic as a reactionary State.  Whether we like it or not&mdash;I do not agree with all they say&mdash; they regard us as a theocratic State in which we will deny them the civil liberties they now enjoy and in which they fear they would have a lower standard of living.  These are their legitimate fears.  I do not think the Taoiseach has done very much to allay those fears in the past two years, apart from the generality of saying that we will be fair, the kind of rubbishy interjection that Deputy Michael O'Kennedy went on with on RTE on two successive programmes, to which he made no contribution but rather equivocated.</P>
    <P>I want to pose one question: how many of the suggested 40 per cent minority in Northern Ireland are really yelling to join the Taoiseach's Republic? I expect he would be very surprised to learn that a substantial proportion <Col N="1831" /> of them at present would not be prepared to join.  The leaders of the Churches in Northern Ireland must also accept their responsibility to recast their rigid social structure within which Catholic and Protestant are given no real incentive to come together. When Catholics and Protestants do not share marriage together. cannot share a pub together, do not even share a song together, cannot share children together because, if they marry one must go one way, the other another, is it any wonder that, in a country where everybody claims to practice Christianity on a Sunday, where there is an inflexible and rigid interpretation of the teaching of Christ, that the separated Irish Catholic and Protestant should crucify one another from the opposite ends of the same street, and more often the same working class street?  The politicians and the spiritual leaders, North and South, have failed miserably.  We in this Dáil over the last four years have also failed.  Apart from about a dozen Deputies who have even bothered to contribute, we have a long way to go before we shall deserve to ask the people of the North of Ireland to join with us in a united Ireland.</P>

      <P>First of all, I wish to have a ruling from the Chair in relation to the order of speakers.  Is it right that two Fine Gael speakers should follow in succession to one Fianna Fáil speaker?

      <P>Speakers have been called in their proper order one, two, three.  Deputy Joe Lenehan, a Fianna Fáil Deputy, spoke after a Fianna Fáil Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>You still have not clarified the situation for me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>I want to quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 8th July last in relation to a member of the Labour Party or the then Labour Party, and the heading is: &ldquo;Coughlan explains his vote for F.F.&rdquo;.  It goes on to say:</P>
      <P>The Labour TD, Alderman Stephen Coughlan, has explained to the leader of Fine Gael, Mr. Cosgrave, why he supported Fianna Fáil in the Limerick Mayoralty elections.</P>
      <P>He visited Mr. Cosgrave following a letter from Senator G.E. Russell to the leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Corish, complaining about his support and the support of three other members of the Labour Party for Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>This clearly indicates to me that they are now one party.  It is on that basis I want to have a ruling as to why the Chair has allowed two Fine Gael speakers in succession.  The Fine Gael Party are here now, but there is no Labour Party.  There are no members of the Labour Party in the benches at the moment.  This statement made by Deputy Coughlan explaining to Deputy Cosgrave why he supported another candidate clearly indicates that the merger is full and absolute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard one of the Labour speakers here criticising the Taoiseach and the social advances and the general policy of the Fianna Fáil Party. He referred to a variety of other matters in relation to members of Fianna Fáil and I shall deal with those later, but this same Deputy spoke about dignity, about his efforts to bring more respect into politics.  At the same time we must examine the situation of the people who have now left the Labour Party and gone to Fine Gael.  Let us take Deputy Desmond, the man who has just spoken.  Deputy Desmond compiled a list here some time ago for the <i>Evening Herald</i><Col N="1833" /> which was published under the pen name of Maurice Hickey.  This was a list giving information of the number of times Deputies voted in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy tell us about the people who left Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that this information is available in the libraries throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Northern Ireland is bleeding to death.  Has the Deputy anything to say about the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak about the responsibilities of Deputies in this House, and I want to protect the Leader of the Fine Gael Party. This is a dirty, scurrilous article designed to show up the Leader of the Fine Gael Party because he voted only seven times between January and June.  It was very unfair of Deputy Desmond to compile this list in order to get at Deputy Cosgrave, who is a representative of the same constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurke" hpid="Mrs. Burke Mrs. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Tell us about the ex-Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe it was unfortunate that Deputy Cosgrave was missing so often from this House but it is hardly fair for another Deputy to devote his time to compiling a list in order to character-assassinate the Leader of the Fine Gael Party.  Now that they are all together it is quite clear that he does not agree with Deputy Cosgrave and that Deputy Cosgrave can only last a certain period of time having undergone this character assassination by one of the Deputies who have now joined the Fine Gael Party, namely, Deputy Desmond.  I want to say how much I felt for Deputy Cosgrave when I read this article indicating that he voted only seven times while the other leaders voted double that number of times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course that is not the end of it. Deputy Desmond, on this trail of character assassination, will go much further as time goes on in order to get <Col N="1834" /> additional information in relation to Deputies.  The private lives of Deputies, the number of times they visit the bar, the number of times they go to the restaurant or other places in this House will be noted down by a man with a mind like that of Deputy Desmond.  I can only hope that Deputy Desmond will in future devote his time more constructively and deal with the problems of his constituency and the country instead of composing articles which are absolute nonsense, when the people have given their answer on so many occasions and will give it in the future to the people who do not attend this House.  It is depressing that this new allegiance is going to be one with so much strife within it, that the present leader, who is not wanted by some of the members of the Labour Party, will go under the knife from time to time through a series of articles passed on to correspondents and published under other names.  I am fairly high on this list.  Maybe I missed two divisions when I was on parliamentary duty else-where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>So were others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There were others and there were other reasons.  These figures do indicate that in regard to that part of the list which refers to those who voted the lesser number of times, 25 per cent of the Labour Party did not vote or voted the minimum number of times, while the other parties have a better record.  Deputy Desmond should check his facts in future and so ensure that even his own party has a clear record.  As the House can see, there are only two parties here at the moment, the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party, and that is the way it will be in the future.  We are glad this merger is taking place.  Fine Gael are welcome to it.  So are the Labour Party. Their attitude in the course of this discussion left much to be desired and Fine Gael are welcome to them.  As to the dignity of the House and the alleged efforts made by Deputy Desmond and other members of his party to bring dignity to the House, let us have a look now at the <i>Irish Times</i> of Friday, 16th June, in which Deputy Thornley criticised the Labour Party for supporting <Col N="1835" /> the Prisons Bill.  He said he believed the Labour Party had gone temporarily berserk.  I think he is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>But the Deputy is not sure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I am absolutely positive he is right.  As a matter of fact, I do not think there is anything temporary about it.  They have all gone over the top.  They must have when they align themselves with the Fine Gael Party.  Deputy Thornley went on to say that, just like another lady, he wished to make use of the platform&mdash;that is, this House&mdash;in order to make trouble.  He said that when people accused him of breaking the rules of &ldquo;that place&rdquo;&mdash;that means Dáil Éireann&mdash;it was just like breaking the rules of a brothel.  This is the statement of a so-called responsible representative of the people, a man who was, at one time, paid out of public funds as an expert on political affairs to tell the people the type of individuals we were, the kind of House this was and what people like him would do if they got in to rectify the situation.  &ldquo;Just like breaking the rules of a brothel&rdquo;.  I wonder could the Labour Party tell us anything about these rules?  I do not know anything about them.  I doubt if there is any similarity.  But Deputy Thornley appears to be an expert on this and, if there is something in what Deputy Thornley says, then the rules should be changed.  Now I have examined the rules and I do not think the rules here would ever offend anyone.  But Deputy Thornley, as a Member of this House, a member of the Labour Party, the party which wants to inject dignity into the House, and dignity and understanding into the political system, which wants to show responsibility, come along and says it is just like breaking the rules of a brothel.  Fine Gael are welcome to Deputy Thornley now and, now that Fine Gael are associated with him, they will equally by associated with this type of mentality.  I hope the Leader of the Labour Party will be able to explain to us about these rules. We have not heard very much about <Col N="1836" /> them.  There was no condemnation of Deputy Thornley so what he said must be accepted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Thornley goes on to tell us that he never thought he would see the day when nine members of his party, including his leader, would walk into a repressive lobby behind the Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch.  Of course, times have changed since the 16th June.  Deputy Thornley goes on further to speak about playing risqué politics.  I do not know what he means by risqué politics and I think Deputy Thornley should explain to the House, in this House, the statements he made some time ago criticising this House, the behaviour of Deputies and the type of policies.  I think he is quite wrong and I want to defend the Deputies here on both sides of the House, including the ex-members of Deputy Thornley's own party, who are now in the Fine Gael party.  Many people in this House are, I am quite sure, at a loss to know what Deputy Thornley means by all this.  I think he should be brought before this House to answer for this kind of nonsense about brothels, about risqué politics, about temporary berserkism, though the latter is about the only correct statement he made about the Labour Party.  Nevertheless, he should be called on to explain.  I doubt if any member of Fine Gael agrees with him or with this scurrilous kind of statement. It is even worse than Deputy Desmond's and his was bad enough.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy wants to defend Deputy Thornley, he can do so.  The statements are on the record and, if the Deputy reads the record, he will know what the statements are.  &ldquo;The Labour Party appear to be following the trend of just keeping the show on the road, no matter who they are hurting&rdquo;&mdash; this was Deputy Thornley's impression of his colleagues in the Labour Party.  They would do anything to remain in, anything for power.  They were just keeping the show on the road.  We all know that.  Again, this is a condemnation of the people who have gone over to Fine Gael.  As I say, Fine Gael are welcome to them. He further criticised the members of his party and he said half of them were in bed during the EEC campaign. We all know that.  Probably a great many of them are in bed now because they are not here.  This was Deputy Thornley, who has now joined the Fine Gael Party, and I am quite sure he will have many colleagues in that party who will support every line of what he said.  We had Deputy Harte trying to stop me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>He tried to interrupt me because he did not want me to project the true image of what Fine Gael has just got over.  On 12th June we had the vice-chairman of the Dublin Regional Council of the Labour Party calling on the Labour TDs to salvage their reputations. They did that, of course, by throwing their weight in with Fine Gael.  By coalescing with Fine Gael they have salvaged their tattered reputations. <Col N="1838" /> This was their solution.  They have met this man's complaint in full and they will certainly rate very highly in the opinion of the vice-chairman of the Dublin Regional Council of the Labour Party now that their tattered reputations have been salvaged because they have aligned themselves with the Fine Gael Party.</P>
      <P>Before I come to the more serious matter of dealing with the Fine Gael Party, I want to call on trade unions now to examine the situation and examine the <i>Irish Times</i> and the morning papers of Friday, 9th June, 1972. That is not so long ago.  Irish Transport and General Workers' Union: Labour move on policy: TD members criticised.  The statement says a warning by Mr. Moore that additional financial support to individual election candidates would be reviewed by the executive committee.  It said that the union contributed £1,500 per year to the Labour Party and £300 to each candidate at election times, but that there was a general view that, if the trade union which helped Deputies were to dictate policy, a real crisis would arise between the unions and the party.  The workers of this country should realise that the political levy they are paying will be helping now to support Fine Gael because of the coalescing of the two parties.  I wonder how many Irish workers will support the political levy from now on.  I would urge all workers who are paying the levy to ensure that they contribute no longer to the furtherance of Fine Gael. Of course, some of the money paid by the union to the Labour Party will be passed to Fine Gael as a result of the merger.  However the £300 given to each candidate is a serious matter and there is much rethinking in respect of it.</P>
      <P>The General Secretary of the Union, the former Labour Deputy, Michael Mullen, warned that the ITGWU must not be taken for granted by the political wing of the trade union movement.  He said that the union might review the financial support to members who were exploiting the labour movement for private glory and self-interest.  These are the individuals who talk of dignity, understanding and responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1839" /> We have had Deputy Thornley's description of the types of places he frequents. We have had also Deputy Desmond's statistics in relation to the attendances of Deputies in the House and now we have the former Deputy Mullen's statement about the movement being exploited by some members of the political wing of their own glory and self-interest.  These people have been told by the vice-chairman of the regional council that they should salvage their tattered reputation.  Before this debate ends they will need to come in here and clear their names and it is my belief that it will be difficult for them to do so.  It was a great relief to us to learn that Fine Gael and Labour intended merging.  In other words, Fine Gael are going socialist and the Labour Party are going conservative.  Perhaps we will have an explanation before the debate concludes.  This merger was not the first effort that was made because the person who got the job of kite-flying, Deputy O'Connell, made an advance to Ian Paisley before making an advance to the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Connell invited Mr. Paisley to offer himself as a candidate in the Dublin South West constituency but of course the Reverend Paisley would have nothing to do with that gang.  He was much cleverer than the Fine Gael Party, At any rate the second fiddles came in and when the bait was nibbled, Deputy Corish made his statement in Inchicore regarding the Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Labour Party who have passed over now to Fine Gael and who might be known more appropriately as the permissive party tried to develop here a sick society.  We do not wish to see any such society develop.  What we desire is a society that is suited to the <Col N="1840" /> needs of the Irish people and we can maintain this without the type of legislation that the Labour Party attempted to introduce.  That party tried to ensure that contraceptives would be available by the boatload.  On the other hand they attempted to introduce a Bill that would prevent people smoking cigarettes.  If they had got their way young married couples could look forward to a future of nothing but the pill and the pipe.  That, then, was the Labour Party's contribution to this Session.  That was the type of society that they wished to see develop and, apparently, that is also the wish of Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>It is important that Fine Gael know what they are getting in joining with the Labour Party.  I would not wish to see Fine Gael walk into this merger with their eyes closed.  Deputy O'Connell has stated that never during his lifetime would Labour form a Government.  That is true but of course it was known to many people before Deputy O'Connell stated it in public. Prior to the last general election they had a policy known as &ldquo;The New Republic Policy.&rdquo;  However, after the election they did not have a party as such because they had lost so many members.  Now that they have joined with Fine Gael, they have neither party nor policy.  The people can see now the type of acrobats that are in the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I hope that as this marriage between the parties matures there will be fun in the coming election campaign because there will be plenty of ammunition for the speakers.  Deputy Coughlan has admitted that if he wishes to leave the House now he must seek Deputy Cosgrave's permission and must account for his actions. Deputy Thornley had much to say about the nine members of his party who supported Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael on the Prisons Bill but that man has no respect for law and order.  It has been reported that the Deputy referred to this Parliament as &ldquo;a madhouse&rdquo;.  While I have certain reservations about some members, I would not consider that description of the House to be justified although when I saw Deputy L'Estrange <Col N="1841" /> making that dreadful mistake yesterday, I thought he had gone mad.</P>

It said that Deputy Coughlan explained to the leader of the Fine Gael Party, Deputy Cosgrave, why he supported the Fianna Fáil candidate for the Limerick mayoralty.  The article said he visited Mr. Cosgrave following a letter from Senator G.W. Russell, Fine Gael, to the leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Corish, complaining about his support and the support of three other members of the Labour Party.  This indicates that they are all one and that there was some mix-up and the whip of the Fine Gael Party down there, Senator Russell, complained to Deputy Corish and then Deputy Coughlan visited Deputy Cosgrave to explain his action.</P>

      <P>I participated in the rude interruptions to Deputy Dowling but I now realise that it is very difficult to turn from that and become very serious on a subject which is foremost in the minds of the Irish people at this time. The only comment I want to make on Deputy Dowling's speech is, God save Ireland if that is the effort made by Government Deputies.  It is very entertaining to listen to him in this House but, while this is happening, there is a terrible human problem in the North of Ireland, a human problem that is at the point of civil war.</P>
      <P>In previous speeches I have always maintained that it was dangerous even to mention civil war.  The Northern State has been at the point of civil war for a variety of reasons since the Civil Rights Movement started, and started justifiably, in that part of the country in the late 1960s.  For a variety of reasons civil war was headed off.  The situation has become more and more serious.  For the first time despair entered my mind in the past fortnight. I always realised that while the Provsional IRA conducted their campaign of violence in the North somehow, somewhere, there were men who could talk commonsense to them and persuade them that theirs was not the right road to re-unification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, when the Ulster Defence Association, having been provoked, in <Col N="1847" /> my humble judgment, into becoming reactionary, started putting up barricades in Shankill, Belfast, the writing was on the wall and unless something was done quickly I knew that violence would erupt which would take lives. Needless to say, when lives are taken in Northern Ireland, they are not always the lives of the man with the gun, the man throwing the bomb, or the man throwing the stone, but an innocent mother going out to take in somebody from the streets.  The brother of Mrs. Margaret Doherty, one of the mothers who came from Derry yesterday, was shot dead in Derry on Bloody Sunday going to comfort a young boy who was dying and shouting that he did not want to die alone.  The late Barney McGuigan was holding a handkerchief in his hand when he was shot dead.  He was an innocent person.  This story can be repeated daily.</P>
    <P>A friend of mine was shot down in Portadown last night, Jack McCabe.  I did not know him very well until I met him accidently not so very long ago. When he discovered who I was, we entered into a conversation and, when he heard my point of view, his parting remark was that I had taken a very responsible stand on this terribly complex issue and that he hoped there were more public representatives South of the Border who believed in the things I said.  He was shot dead last night and he was seeking reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said here today that the rate of emigration from the North is five times greater now than it was in 1970.  It is not the members of the IRA who are emigrating.  It is not the members of the Vanguard or UDA who are emigrating.  It is the honest-to-goodness Catholic and Protestant people who want to live in peace and harmony in the North of Ireland, and who want to create a society North of the Border in which Catholic and Protestant can live together. These are the people who are emigrating.</P>
    <P>It is really not Catholics and Protestants who are fighting.  They are just convenient words we use to group them.  If Catholics and Protestants were fighting they would be fighting <Col N="1848" /> about things like Transubstantiation, or the secrecy of the confessional, or why a Catholic priest cannot marry and a Protestant minister can.  These are the things that caused religious wars in the early ages.  This is not a religious war.  It is a war of power. Power is the name of the game and it is not now confined to the Unionist camp.  This is why the Unionist Party maintained their domineering forces in the North of Ireland for the past 50 years: not because they were pro-British, not because they were anti-Catholic, not because they were in favour of Protestantism, but because they wanted power.  Power is the simple answer.</P>
    <P>A power game is now taking place for a variety of reasons.  The Unionist camp is breaking into pieces and people on the IRA side think they can become men of power, little Napoleons, but none of them with the courage to stand before the electorate. One of the greatest things a public representative has in my judgment is the opportunity to mould public opinion.  I have never failed to say where I stood on this issue.  Perhaps I have criticised at times when it was unfair to criticise.  Perhaps I have refrained from criticising at times where I should have criticised, but I never failed to say where I stood on this issue.  The type of Ireland I want is one in which my family can grow up as ordinary Christians, and in which their families in turn will not have their lives taken away from them by a bullet or a bomb.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry Desmond gave a list of Deputies from his native Cork who have not yet put on record their attitude towards this terrible problem. While the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government is sitting in the Taoiseach's seat I want to say that I have yet to hear what he has to say on this issue. It may be unfair to put him in that position but I accuse Deputy Cunningham of not informing public opinion in County Donegal.  Deputy Blaney has stated where he stands. To a degree Deputy Brennan, Minister for Social Welfare, has stated where he stands.</P>

      <P>Yes, there is something in what the Parliamentary Secretary says.  Sometimes silence is golden and I believe that particularly over the past six months silence would have been golden by people south of the Border who possibly were speaking three feet off the ground, but 60 miles south of the Border.  It is far too easy to make a speech in a city hotel in Dublin, far too easy to call a branch meeting in any part of rural Ireland, and make, in a written statement, some criticism of what is happening north of the Border.  It is far too easy to purchase votes by this method, but any Deputy elected to this House has an obligation on him, in a debate such as this, to make a contribution.  It is here a Deputy should be speaking.  We can stand back and criticise; we can criticise the IRA north of the Border for the terrible deeds they have carried out in the name of Ireland.  They have not carried them out in my name&mdash;I have never given my consent to this type of reunion.</P>

      <P>We can stand back now and criticise the UDA for fighting against it, but I wonder if any of us were brought into the same environment, in what way would we react? On the first occasion when this became a serious debate in September of 1969, immediately after the riots in Derry and Belfast I remember saying in this House that there were people in our society who had the power of drawing battle lines, a small group but they had this power.  They had no other gift, but when battle lines are drawn, there is no opting out&mdash;you go to your own side. I made an earnest appeal to Deputies and to people throughout the country <Col N="1850" /> to stand back and not to be emotionally involved because when a person is emotionally involved, he cannot rationalise the situation.</P>
      <P>There are many things one could talk about in Northern Ireland and when one would have finished talking, one would remember that there were other points that one could and should have made.  What can anyone say at this stage that has not already been said many times?  Very little, but I would like to put in my words, my type of thinking on this issue.  I do not have to declare my allegiance.  I was born into a Catholic family with a nationalist background south of the Border, or rather, on the Republic side of the Border in County Donegal and when the chips were down I would not have to declare which side I am on.</P>
      <P>It is no great boast for anyone to say where he stands, but a very strange thing happened in St. Mary's Church in Creggan on the Tuesday evening of the funerals in that city after Bloody Sunday.  With a couple of friends of mine, I was standing at the front of a very packed chapel when the funerals were arriving in the church.  There were three coffins already there and one coffin was being carried up the aisle, the remains of John Young.  John Young was a boy of 17&mdash;not involved &mdash;but he was shot dead.  He was being carried up the aisle by his three young brothers and his best friend.  As they approached the altar rails to leave the coffin down beside the other three coffins, the reality of the whole thing hit the brother carrying the coffin on his left shoulder in front, and he broke down and there was a very sorrowful scene.  Grown-up men had tears in their eyes; cameramen were unashamedly crying; and I too am not immune from that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought what had happened in a society to allow 13 people to be butchered.  In what way had politicians failed in the past so as to create such a situation and in what way are politicians going to fail in the future to ensure that in ten or 15 years time, this will not be repeated, that it will not be my three young sons carrying their youngest brother up the aisle. People in the south tell us that the British must get out of Northern <Col N="1851" /> Ireland.  The British have nothing to do with this issue just now. They cannot be forgiven completely. They are responsible and they cannot be exonerated completely&mdash;but when you brush away the cobwebs, you are left with the bare reality that there are a million people north of the Border who do not, at this time, wish to join a southern Irish society, and if this is what the exercise is all about, then we have to ask ourselves why have these people taken up this position, why do they hate us so much, why are they prepared to put up barricades, why are they prepared to go out in murder squads and shoot innocent people indiscriminately?</P>
    <P>Why does a human being react like this?  Is it all their fault or are we in some degree to blame?  Have we tried to create a society with which a Protestant in the North could identify? Have we seriously sat down and tried to figure out the phrase used 50 years ago that partition was a stepping stone? Have we tried to understand the Northern Unionists?</P>
    <P>Very recently before the death of the late Dr. Gibson, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church, I had the pleasure of visiting him in his office and he put the position to me in a very simple way. He said: &ldquo;You know, it is very easy for a person to love his wife, his father, his mother, his sons and daughters and all members of his family and his friends, but it is not so easy to love your enemy.&rdquo;  Likewise, it is very easy to understand your father, your mother, the members of your family and your friends and it is not so easy to understand your enemy, but it can be done if we try.</P>
    <P>The Northern Unionists, as I see the situation, will cause civil war if we try to force them into this part of this island.  We move from a position of saying that we will not use physical force, that we will not coerce but will seek peaceful means.  When we say these things, what do we really mean?  We say that we will not coerce and it is a nice phrase, but what does it mean?  Does it not mean that you are not going to force one million Protestants into a southern Irish <Col N="1852" /> State and if it means that, following it to its logical conclusion, it means that you are giving them the right to live there?  If you say that you are not going to use force, then you are saying to them that you are not going to use force to change that position but what is more, you are not going to allow anyone else to use force in our name.  When you say we seek peaceful means, this again is a pious platitude.  How often have we sought peaceful means?  Politicians in the past have refused to acknowledge the <i>de jure</i> recognition of the Northern State and perhaps rightly so because as time went on the Northern State became a sectarian state and our recognition of that state would have been a recognition of a sectarian parliament, something I personally would not subscribe to.</P>
    <P>Whatever happened in the past, we are now left with the problem of how do we play our part in solving the human problem north of the Border. I do not want to live in it and if I do not want to live in it then I should try to do something to solve the problem.  People say: &ldquo;How do you forgive British soldiers for beating up and shooting people and destroying property?&rdquo;  Then you ask: &ldquo;How do Protestants forgive Catholics for allowing the IRA, or others responsible, for carrying out deeds?&rdquo;&mdash;maybe not with their consent but certainly they were tolerated.  How do you overcome this terrible bitterness, the hatred and mistrust? I do not think you can solve it by politics but I do believe that it can be solved by applying basic Christian principles.  If something is wrong it is wrong and it cannot be made right.  If it is wrong for the Protestant Unionist to do it it is equally wrong for the Catholic Republican to do it.  Anything which is right today is right because it was right yesterday.  It will also be right tomorrow.  When the fifth Commandment was given it meant the same thing as it does now.  When life is taken, whether by the forces of the Crown or anyone else, it is murder. But we will have to overcome it.  We will have to learn to forgive. <Col N="1853" /> Strangely most of us are prepared to forgive but there are people who are not prepared to forgive.</P>
    <P>The situation I see now is one not of despair but of reality.  If anything has come out of the Northern troubles it is that they have made people south of the Border and people north of the Border re-think their position.  When I say that there are 1,000,000 Northern Unionists not prepared to join us at this point in time I do not include every Unionist because there are Unionists prepared to consider it if we present a society of which they can be part.  There is a percentage of them who will never consent to it.  When I say that there are a half million Catholics north of the Border who want reunification I do not believe all the Catholics in the North of Ireland would vote for reunification in quiet times.  They would do it now out of spite rather than out of good judgment.</P>
    <P>Reunification at this point of time is not on.  I would like it.  My choice would be reunification but it is not there.  Therefore, we must ask ourselves from what position do we move. Shortly before the death of the late Michael Sweetman, he and I had a conversation and we agreed that there were five possible ways in which the Northern State could move: The Whitelaw administration; UDI; full integration with Britain; the re-setting up of a Northern State; reunification. Let us take them in that order.  The Whitelaw administration is not a final solution.  UDI is not acceptable to the southern Parliament, to the Westminster Parliament or indeed to the Catholic people and many of the Protestant people north of the Border. That is not a solution.  Full integration is possibly more acceptable than the other two and I would not rule it out as an interim measure.  The setting up of a Northern Parliament is another consideration to which I would give my consent in the short term.  The final and most important step is reunification. What type of reunification?  Do we have to force Northern Unionists to give up their heritage, their culture, to either live an artificial life or to change their way of going or do we recognise that their culture and heritage are part and parcel of this island and if we want <Col N="1854" /> reunification we must make room for them?</P>
    <P>Towards reunification there are two ways in which I think the Northern State can move.  One is full integration. I am not personally in favour of this although I would prefer it possibly if the Northern Unionist is not prepared to share power north of the Border.  So the position rests with the Northern Unionist.  If he wants the re-establishment of a Northern Parliament by consensus he must recognise that he cannot have it without the consent of the Northern Catholic in the same way as if we want reunification we can never have it without the full consent of the Northern Unionist.</P>
    <P>People may say we never want to see Stormont back again.  I do not want to see it back again.  While we were fighting a civil war south of the Border 50 years ago on the question of partition the issue was really not partition, the issue was the setting up of a Northern Parliament.  If the British Government at the time had said: &ldquo;There are 26 counties in Ireland which desire independence and we are prepared to give them independence: the other six will continue to be ruled from Westminster&rdquo; and if a Northern Parliament had never existed, would the sectarian politics which have bedevilled that State over the last 50 years have taken place?  Would, in fact, the people North of the Border, Catholic and Protestant, even aspire to reunification now if the sharing of power had been part of the settlement?</P>
    <P>Let us take the word &ldquo;partition&rdquo;, a word which is very confused in the minds of the Irish people and was acceptable to me for a particular meaning until I too tried to study the word and figure out what it means.  We have used the word &ldquo;partition&rdquo; to describe the Border which divides North and South when in fact the Border and partition are two different things.  The Border to me is the dividing line between two political systems.  A line on a map is meaningless if you have a society on both sides which identify with each other and respect each other's laws. Partition is something more real.  We had partition in County Donegal yesterday evening when the Orange band <Col N="1855" /> was attacked by Catholics.  You have partition running between the Falls Road and Shankill, between the Irish Street estate in Derry and the Bogside, you have partition dividing the Tunnel and the rest of Portadown and partition divides Ballymena.  You have partition dividing virtually every townland, farm, street, people, because when people refuse to co-operate with each other socially, when they refuse to acknowledge their being, when they kill, maim and murder each other, that is partition.  You could still have partition by the removal of the Border.  The removal of the Border is no issue.  The issue is the removal of partition in the sense I have described it.  I believe we must rise above our own level because since Parnell no Irishman can truthfully say: &ldquo;I have led an Irish nation.&rdquo;  No Irishman can come out of the hall of fame and say: &ldquo;I have led Catholic and Protestant, Nationalist and Unionist.  I have led the Irish people.&rdquo;  We have had great men but we have had sectional leaders.  We have never had a national leader.  We have had leaders of the Northern State and we have had leaders of the Republican State but we have never had a leader of both States.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech today was criticised from these benches but I can say it is the first time that we have got away from the phased withdrawal of the British troops in the North, the withdrawal of financial aid, a public declaration on the part of Westminster. These phrases are meaningless. They are delightful to read and to hear provided you are living in Southern Ireland and provided you oppose the establishment of Unionism in Northern Ireland.  What does the withdrawal of financial aid mean to the Northern State?  Does it not mean that you are asking the Catholics in Northern Ireland to continue to pay their rates and taxes as if they were living in another part of the United Kingdom but they should accept less benefits and a lower standard of living than other UK subjects?  Is this the type of United Ireland for which we are asking Catholics to make this type of sacrifice so that we could be one?  This is not realistic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> We talk about the phased withdrawal of British troops.  What will we replace them with?  Does anybody think that if a United Nations force came into the Falls Road or the Shankill that they would not be shot?  Does anybody think that if the British Government gave their consent to the Irish Government to patrol the Bogside or patrol the area between the Protestant and Catholic parts of Portadown that they would not be shot at?  Of course they would.  The phased withdrawal of British troops is meaningless. It is dishonest for any Deputy in this House to get up and advocate it, having discussed the matter privately with me and having agreed with my point of view that it was meaningless. However, it is delightful for his constituents to read and possibly grand for the republican-minded people in his constituency to hear.  The net result is more votes but no progress.</P>
    <P>The British Army, in my judgment, came into the North of Ireland as a peace-keeping force and if they get back to that peace-keeping force I will tolerate them until such times as the Catholics and the Protestants find political solutions that can let them live together.  Have we not a part to play in helping them to live together? I believe that the Taoiseach, having got away from this phased withdrawal of the British Army and the withdrawal of financial aid position has made a statesmanlike statement today. I, as an Opposition Deputy, will give 100 per cent support to that type of leadership in the South of Ireland. When he says to the Northern Unionists and the Northern community that he wants some kind of Irish Parliament North of the Border I know what he means.  He means a Northern Irish Parliament to which the Catholics will give consent and the Protestants their free will.  If that is the type of proposal which the Taoiseach has in mind I give it my wholehearted support because I believe that the honourable compromise between the people who refuse to accept the Border, who refuse to accept any other settlement but reunification and the people who are not prepared to join with us at this moment is if we cannot unite this country under one Parliament then let <Col N="1857" /> us try to unite it under two Parliaments which will co-operate economically, politically and socially, that will respect the institutions of each other. If this type of settlement has laws that if anyone commits a crime one side of the Border he will be collected and properly put back to the other side, then we are getting near unity.</P>
    <P>The people North and South of the Border want peace for justice.  We hear certain individuals saying that they want peace with justice.  This phrase was coined by the IRA.  Within weeks we had the loyalist women of the Shankill saying it when they left Mr. Whitelaw's office so abruptly. What does peace with justice mean? How can anyone have peace without justice?  If the Northern Unionists want a Northern Parliament again they better realise that they cannot have the Northern Parliament without the consent of the Catholics North of the Border and they cannot have a Northern Parliament which does not get the respect of the Southern Parliament.  If they are not prepared to do these things then I suggest that we agree that the British Government should have full integration with the Northern State until such time as the majority there realise that their right identification is with us.</P>
    <P>Recently I attended a meeting in Shankill, Belfast.  A group of Catholics and Protestants sat together.  They invited two Conservative Members from London to address them.  A lady from the Vanguard movement was also present.  She was a member of the Unionist Party and the Orange Order.  We also had a gentleman present who was a Republican and a former Provisional.  Before the meeting started the two Conservative Members and the two Belfast people got into conversation and it was very obvious to the rest of us that although the lady from the Vanguard movement and the former member of the Provisionals did not agree they had more in common with each other than they had with the two Conservatives who left the meeting and said they could not make head or tail of it.  They admitted they were strangers <Col N="1858" /> in what they called part of the United Kingdom.  Of course they were because this island is Ireland.  The tragedy of it is that we have two political systems, one refusing to recognise the other and we have never tried to find our own level.  We have never tried, politically speaking, to rise above ourselves to recognise the difference of the other person.</P>

      <P>As I said, the Taoiseach made quite a remarkable speech today and it is one to which I will give my full consent.  I now want some Northern person, be he Unionist or otherwise, to lead the Northern State into a parallel position so that we can arrive at a solution much earlier than will happen if the violence continues.</P>
      <P>There is not really much more I can say in four minutes except that in the week before Bloody Sunday I was in England and I was being entertained by the editor of a newspaper who afterwards took me to his home. This was shortly after the three young Scottish soldiers had been shot in Belfast.  An English Catholic said to me&mdash;she was in favour of reunification, for her own reasons&mdash;that she could not understand why Irishmen shot British soldiers.  She said that the IRA should remember that you do not find a supporter of the Conservative Party a private in the British Army.  He is generally a supporter of the Labour Party whose brothers and sisters had been out campaigning for a Labour government or the Labour Party in the last general election and, because of that campaign and because it was against the Conservative Party and because the Unionist Party had close identification with the Conservative Party, that young boy found himself in the North of Ireland defending something in which he did not believe and he could be shot for doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the thought of an English Catholic who has no connection at all with Ireland other than to say that she believed the British troops should not be there.  I wonder if I could get this message across to the Provision <Col N="1859" /> IRA who also come from the working-class. Are they shooting at members of the working classes when they shoot at British soldiers?  Or are they shooting at a member&mdash;truly believing and fully supporting a capitalist system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies from my own party and Deputies from other parties have spoken very largely about the North of Ireland, but there were other things in the Taoiseach's speech and I want to refer to three of them. I want to talk about the present economic situation in Ireland; I want to talk about the EEC and I want to talk about the national wage agreement and the whole area of wages, prices and profit.  I want to talk first about the economic situation and specifically about inflation.  In the Taoiseach's speech this morning&mdash;and I am quoting from the unrevised transcript&mdash;he said:</P>
      <P>In the case of prices the most recent figure shows that the increase now, at an annual rate of about 6 per cent, compares favourably with a rate of about 9 per cent for 1971. This downward trend is expected to continue...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a rather confident note on which to dissolve the Dáil for three months, to give us a cheerful message going away, that this desperate problem of inflation is, in fact, on the way to solution.  It would be nice if we could believe him but I want to indicate that this is, first, factually inaccurate <Col N="1860" /> and, secondly, misleading.  The situation in regard to inflation is vastly more serious.  I will quote, not my own calculations, but a reasonably neutral source <i>The Economist</i> of 1st July, on pages 84 and 85.  They refer to the great risks that before countries have managed to control cost inflation they will again find themselves confronted by a demand inflation which will endanger future possibilities of growth. That is a considered opinion of the commission looking at the economies of the Six and the Ten.  They go on to consider the six members and the four applicant countries, country by country.  In the section on Ireland&mdash; I am now quoting from page 85&mdash;they say:</P>
    <P>Ireland's biggest obstacle is its rampant inflation which has slowed down only marginally from 10 per cent last year to around 9 per cent now.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist</i>, on 1st July, gives the current figure for inflation at 50 per cent more than the Taoiseach gave us this morning.  Which, in fact, do you believe?</P>
    <P>On the same page of <i>The Economist,</i> on the question of who inflates faster, comparing the ten countries, the answer is Ireland; first, inflating the fastest of the ten but, secondly, the slope of the graph which indicates the rate of inflation has increased in the last quarter of 1971 and the first quarter of 1972.  Is the Taoiseach right to say that the downward trend is expected to continue or is <i>The Economist</i> right to say, in this graph, that, in fact, the rate of inflation even up to now has been increasing?  I believe the Taoiseach is wrong and I believe that <i>The Economist</i> is neutral and right on this issue.  I often find the comments of their Irish correspondent a bit hard to take but factually they are a very reputable magazine and I think that is the way it is.</P>
    <P>That was the way it was until a few weeks ago because these figures reflect the last quarter of 1971 and the first quarter of 1972 but what has happened very recently makes the Taoiseach's statement that the downward trend is expected to continue not just wrong <Col N="1861" /> but ridiculous and irresponsible?  A number of things have happened.  First, we have decided to introduce the value-added tax.  We did not have to, on joining the EEC; we chose to.  The Italians put it off year after year because they knew it was inflationary. We have a headline in today's newspapers that the Minister for Finance tells us that VAT is not inflationary. If it is not inflationary in Ireland, then Ireland's experience will be contrary to the experience of every other country in which it has been introduced.  Telling us that VAT is not inflationary is taking us for fools.  It is saying something which is offensive to our intelligence. However, we have had the introduction of VAT which will, of course, increase the rate of inflation which was already speeding up again at the beginning of this year and which <i>The Economist</i> says is 9 per cent at present.</P>
    <P>In addition we have had a devaluation in Britain and of course with our £ tied to the British £ we have devalued as well.  The Taoiseach does not consider that devaluation is a profoundly serious matter, specifically for prices.  It is prices that it affects.  I am again trying to be neutral and not trying to search all of the availabe sources to dig up hostile quotations and I will quote from last Sunday's <i>The Observer</i> and <i>The Sunday Times</i> and from the two most recent issues of <i>The Economist</i>&mdash;in other words, mainline sources of information which are not prejudiced either way.  In &ldquo;Business News&rdquo; in last Sunday's <i>Times</i> in an article by Malcolm Crawford it was stated and I quote:</P>
    <P>After all, floating down to $2.40 means an extra 2 per cent added to the rising cost of living.</P>
    <P>That is what he says in Britain.  If it means it there it means it here, but the Taoiseach does not think it important enough to mention the floating down, the devaluation.  He says the downward trend in prices is expected to continue so we have got 1 per cent from VAT and we have got 2 per cent from the devaluation of the £ along with the 9 per cent which, according to <i>The Economist,</i> we have already.  That makes 12 per <Col N="1862" /> cent for the year, not 6 per cent.  We are moving into a period in five slices, starting in January, 1973, levelling our food prices with the EEC food prices.  But since EEC food prices are fixed in units of account the devaluation of 8 per cent means an additional rise of those EEC food prices of 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>So, in addition to VAT and to other devaluation effects we have the effects on the unit of account food price of the Community to which we have to adapt but the Taoiseach says the downward trend is expected to continue.  This is not just wrong, it is offensive, because it treats people as idiots.  Of course, he did not think it up himself.  His economic advisers ought to be a little more serious with the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, more than economic advisers.  That is one explanation.</P>
      <P>We do not need to spend a lot of time on the effect of inflation except to say that the people it hits are the people on fixed incomes, be they pensions, or the accrued result of interest on savings.  It hits the poorest, the old, the weak, the ill, the social welfare recipient and the people who have heavy family commitments.  If you have 100 per cent more income than you need, it does not matter very much if it goes down by 10 per cent in a year, which is what 10 per cent inflation means.  It does not matter if it goes from 200 per cent to 180 per cent of your needs.  But, if you have 100 per cent of your needs, which is the situation in most of the country, and it goes down by 10 per cent, you do not have the wherewithal to maintain your standard of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach says it is not going to happen; inflation will get better or else, apparently, bless you, it is not very important, because in the whole of his opening of this adjournment debate there was no suggestion as to what he would do to control inflation.  What was implicit in that <Col N="1863" /> was that it did not matter.  It may not matter to him but to the old, the sick, the weak, the poor and the young&mdash;who are a very significant part of this society&mdash;it matters profoundly.</P>
    <P>Again, I ask you not to take my estimation of the significance of continuing high inflation for a society.  Let me quote again from a recent source, <i>The Economist</i> of 8th July, an article on page 19.  They are talking about the possible political crisis in Great Britain and they are talking about the serious calamity that might be needed to bring to power Mr. Enoch Powell.  I would find that an awful though, but it is relevant.  That is what they are discussing.  They say what is this calamity.  They give an example of the sort of calamity that might bring about the social breakdown in Britain that would result in the triumph of Mr. Enoch Powell.  The example is 10 per cent inflation a year for two more years.  That would end public confidence in the present political parties. These are not my words.  I am not being alarmist in an adjournment debate.  That is <i>The Economist</i> of last weekend talking about something else &mdash;10 per cent a year for two more years.  That is what we have&mdash;10 per cent a year&mdash;with the prospect of its getting worse.  The Taoiseach does not think it is important or pretends that it is going away.</P>
    <P>Perhaps that is enough about inflation, except to say that when we are faced with a crisis in the North and with the possibility of its being exported&mdash;or imported&mdash;down here&mdash;a serious crisis will be a crisis for the whole island&mdash;with a policy which permits this sort of inflation to go on, which is recognised by every book on economics you choose to consult as profoundly destructive of the fabric of society, a Government which allows that to go on at a time of national peril are derelict in their responsibility. I was very shocked by this omission and this inadequacy in what the Taoiseach had to say because in general the tenor of his contribution was, &ldquo;Go home for the summer holidays. Everything is fine&rdquo;.  Is everything fine <Col N="1864" /> economically?  We have the most open economy probably in the world.  We are a part of the sterling area, the only remaining part outside the UK, intimately bound up economically with how the UK does.</P>
    <P>Not looking for a hostile source, in last Sunday's <i>Observer,</i> Alan Day, a very reputed economic commentator, in the <i>Business Observer,</i> page 19, said:</P>
    <P>Our economic problems now appear so intractable that the prospects for political and social stability in Britain in the next few years seem less hopeful than at any time I can remember.</P>
    <P>That is Mr. Alan Day about Britain's economic plight but the Taoiseach says &ldquo;Go home happily.  It is fine&rdquo; and, indeed, the devaluation is so unimportant that it does not even rate a mention.</P>
    <P>One could build up these quotations. In the <i>Sunday Times,</i> Frank Giles, on the leader page, is describing the present situation in Britain.  He sees in Britain a crisis of inflation and a general sense, not so much of floating as of drifting.  The leader page of two major British Sunday newspapers express the same thought.  The <i>Sunday Times</i> and <i>The Observer</i> both said it last weekend and when they sneeze we get influenza but &ldquo;we are fine, bless you, go home happily, my children, because your papa Taoiseach will make all these horrid things go away&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>If you add to that scene the crisis in Northern Ireland and add to that the crisis in our tourism, not of our making, with the spin-off effect of diminishing tourist returns, and if you add to that the effects of devaluation not on our food prices but on the price of things we import from outside the sterling area&mdash;add those things together and you have an economic scene which is not grave at this moment but which surely calls, firstly, for recognition of its seriousness and, <Col N="1865" /> secondly, for some action to prevent the threat to our economic wellbeing becoming a reality.  I will revert to that when I am closing because I want to indicate the things I would wish to have seen in the Taoiseach's speech, the things we have to do economically if we are to avoid the serious peril that responsible commentators are widely declaring to exist in Britain and we have reasons to think that our peril is more acute than Britain's at the present time.</P>

      <P>I recognise that we were defeated heavily on this matter.  I recognise as a democrat the decision of the Irish people.  I accept it.  But because 80 odd per cent of them thought differently, it does not make me change my mind.  I believe they made a wrong decision.  I believe they made it on the basis of misinformation.  I also believe they will live to regret it.  There are times when one has to declare one's opinion regardless of the number of persons who will disagree with it.  My opinion remains that our economy will be profoundly damaged by full membership and that we will rue the day we decided to become a full member. I say that with no pleasure and I know that politically it is impossible to say later on to people: &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;. There is no mileage in that.  I hope to be proved wrong, but, in fact, the decision of the May referendum as far as I am concerned is water under the bridge.  It is a decision taken which I accept, for myself and for the Labour Party.  We are therefore faced with the situation: what do we do?  It is not so different from the situation of a parent who has a child who does something the parent does not wish.  He does not stop loving the child; he does not cut it off; he does not pretend that the thing has not happened.  We were the only people who could see the European <Col N="1866" /> Community, warts and all.  A few tiny warts are now being recognised by the pro-EEC people, but they are still inclined to show it without any blemishes. However, for those of us who saw it warts and all and who have seen the warts grow bigger in the last two months, we have a duty not just to participate but to protect this country with all our strength against those dangers which we were able to predict and which we see growing more threatening, not less, with the passing weeks. We have a duty to participate precisely to prevent our prophecies coming true, to try to stop those results happening to this fragile economy.</P>
      <P>Let me offer some thoughts about the institutions and the democracy and about the way the Community will go. There are a number of separate economies emerging; there are a number of separate Governments making very feeble efforts at merging.  Our only protection now is not the prevention of the growth of the Brussels institutions but the strength of those institutions so that they can protect us against the naked economic might of the fused economies of Germany, France, Benelux and now Britain.  We do not need weaker institutions in the Community now but stronger ones, because only institutions can protect us against the economic processes which will otherwise destroy something as fragile, as peripheral and as weak as our economy.  We do not need less democracy at Community level; we need more, because only strengthened communities with democratic control can possibly produce the reforms which we will need for our protection.  I am always glad to be able to find in a speech the Taoiseach makes one thing with which I agree.  I was able to find one thing in my reading of his speech today that I agreed with, because he says, and I quote from the unedited transcript:</P>
      <P>In our view a comprehensive regional policy for the enlarged Community is an essential part of the measures necessary to deal with these economic imbalances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Noble words.  We all agree surely, but I have to record the opinion that we will not see a real regional policy in time to save us.  I agree about its <Col N="1867" /> necessity and about the economic imbalances.  The Taoiseach believes it will be possible in significant time.  I do not so believe and, watching the clock, I do not have time to indicate why now, but I hope again to be wrong in that.  I think the Taoiseach is right to refer to the significance of a regional policy, but if he thinks he is going to get a real one quickly then, in my view, he is quite wrong.</P>
    <P>The other thing that everyone has been gambling on here is the great agricultural bonanza that is coming to us.  In this respect I said all through the campaign that I believed the common agricultural policy in its present form would not survive. Again, I hope to be wrong, but the signs are the other way.  The most recent <i>Sunday Times</i>, that of 9th July, in a leader page article by Frank Giles discusses the new Premier of France, M. Messmer. M. Messmer is known to think, for example, that the Common Market's common agricultural policy is a disaster for France because its effect is to retain too many people on the land for too long.  But M. Messmer is now the new Prime Minister of France.  The common agricultural policy is under threat from Britain, from France, from the United States outside, from the Third World countries, from the working class and from industrial employers in all of the member states.</P>
    <P>If anybody thinks that the agricultural lobby is going to win against that line-up it seems to me that they are out of their little minds.  The rate of profit on beef is higher now than it is ever going to be again, because beef has been bid up to near the Common Market prices, but we have not got the rise in fertilisers, the rise in feeding stuffs and the rise in other costs.  The transition period of the next five years will see a steady narrowing of the margins, and not a widening, on beef.  We have had our bonanza on beef.  By the time you inflate at 10 per cent per year, if you do that at compound interest for five and a half years you have a 75 per cent increase in prices.  I predicted <Col N="1868" /> that for food prices by the time we got into Europe.  I am happy to read it on to the record because I believe it will happen by 1978.  If you have that sort of inflation in costs and your milk price stays at 26p or 28p a gallon and your costs go up by 75 per cent in five years, what becomes of your margins?  The margins for milk are higher now than they will be in five years time.  People will see a shrinking of those margins.  The people have been sold a pup, in my view.</P>
    <P>We have said we did not believe the economy of Ireland, peripheral, fragile, undercapitalised, lacking in sovereignty, lacking in its own economic institutions could survive free trade conditions.  The business brief of the <i>Economist</i> of 1st July has what it calls the growth league for the member states.  It does not put in Luxembourg but it has the other nine, Ireland included.  It gives the figures for 1970 and 1971 and an estimate for 1972.  Be it said that the estimate, which is made by the British National Institute of Economic and Social Research differs from the Taoiseach's. Maybe the Taoiseach is right; maybe the Taoiseach is neutral; maybe his economic advisers are not tempted to bend the thing a little because it is for the Taoiseach's speech.  Maybe the NIESR are hostile to Ireland and maybe they are wrong.  In fact, their estimate for 1972 is for slower growth in Ireland.  It is just over 2 per cent for 1972 going down from just below 3 per cent for 1971.  Take the three years together.  In 1972, of the nine countries, leaving out Luxembourg, we were second last; Norway was lower.  That is an estimate for this year; we are half way through it.  In 1971 we were joint third last with Germany.  The UK and Italy were behind us.  In 1970 we were last in growth rate of the applicants.  Taking the three years, 1970, 1971 and 1972, if these are added up in respect of the members and the applicants.  Ireland was last by a long way.</P>
    <P>If I may be permitted a little arithmetic, let us say that the <i>per capita</i> GNP for Ireland is £1,000; it is not; I say that to make the arithmetic easy. <Col N="1869" /> The <i>per capita</i> GNP for France is £2,000, twice that for Ireland for 1970. For 1970, 1971 and 1972 the French growth is 16½ per cent, Irish growth, 66½ per cent.  The increase in income for an Irishman in those three years is £65; for a Frenchman it is £330.  The difference is £265 a year by which the Frenchman is richer compared to the Irishman than he was at the beginning of the period.  So the major countries in the Community are, first of all, twice as rich and, secondly, growing maybe twice as fast and that means that, with every passing year, the gap of income between the richest areas and Ireland is widening and not narrowing.  It means that inevitably. If studies of growth mean anything, that is obvious.  But, if you have free movement of labour, will not people go where the pay is higher?  Is not that the experience inside Ireland?  Is not that that the experience inside the UK?  Is not that the experience inside Italy? And where are the forces to prevent this process?  We have these figures now, which we did not have at the time of the referendum&mdash;these figures of estimates for 1972&mdash;and they strengthen the danger of the concentration of capital into the centre and there are absolutely no areas of protection and no protective mechanisms being built.  Dr. Mansholt, for the commission, says we now must go ex-growth. Growth is bad for our environment. He is right, of course.  It is the human and decent thing to say and, if you were a Dutchman, it would be true but, for an Irishman, who is half as rich as a Dutchman, if we all say: &ldquo;Let us go ex-growth; let the Community not grow any more&rdquo;, then we stay half as rich.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us turn from that now to what we do in our present economic <Col N="1870" /> situation.  The Taoiseach's speech indicates we do nothing.  The Taoiseach, in fact, never says anything in his speeches to the Dáil.  He uses words to conceal his thoughts, and with great success.  Then he goes off and does things.  He is good at acting. And now he will get three months, or more, when we are not here to bother him, so he can act as Taoiseach with a good Executive, with no Dáil to bother him, to harass him or criticise him for what he does.  In fact, what was missing from his speech is what you do at the moment with the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>However, let us be fair to him.  He did have one suggestion, if I can find it.  Yes, I have it.  It is a gem of the Taoiseach's political economics.  A beauty.  I quote from the unedited transcript this morning:</P>
    <P>The national wage agreement was designed to bring to a halt this pointless chase between higher prices and wages.</P>
    <P>Endorse the national wage agreement, you nasty trade unionists who are threatening that, perhaps, you will not, and this pointless chase between higher prices and wages will stop if you do that.  Bless you!  The innocence and the simplicity of that statement.  But see the implication. The implication is that, of course, the nasty rise in prices, which we deplore, is because the workers want more money.  No other suggestion.  More wages are the cost of higher prices and you peddle that often enough and simply enough to the poor, unsuspecting public and they begin to believe it and act on it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows it is not true. His economic advisers know even better that it is not true but, if you say it often enough, as Goebbels knew, on all the media maybe the people for whom it is intended, who are already the poorest and the worst off in the community, will believe it. Great stuff!  I am not saying difficult things or things that people do not know.  If they read even the most elementary textbook on economics they will find all this.</P>
    <P>They do not have to be clever, or <Col N="1871" /> clairvoyant, or anything and, as I say, of course the Taoiseach's advisers know that there are many constituents to inflation.  Wages, yes; costs/push, yes; that is a cause of inflation, sure it is, but demand/pull is also a cause of inflation.  Now which comes first?  Is it that prices go up for other reasons and workers have to have more wages or is it that workers have to have more wages and then prices go up?  Which is it? It is a cyclical situation.  It is the hen or the egg.  And there are many determinants to inflation.  I am not suggesting that higher wages are not one, but what I am saying is that anyone who says it is the only one is simply a liar.  He is not just wrong because, it is possible, in good faith, to be wrong, but there is too much evidence of the many causes of inflation and anybody, speaking on the subject with any claim to authority implying that it is the only one, has to be dishonest. It is not just a statement.</P>
    <P>Various sources and Mr. Enoch Powell, to mention him again, have been adamant that the unions have no responsibility whatsoever for inflation. Mr. Powell says that the only culprit is the government's failure to control money supply.  There you have a money source of it.  That is a third one, apart from demand/pull and cost/ push.  The fourth one is the fact that we see, with the tremendous technological revolution in the world, that the big multi-national companies need incredible amounts of capital for their investments.  One British oil company got credit to the tune of £350 million from a group of banks the other week just for the North Sea.  One company for one area of oil got £350 million credit.  Those multi-nationals, having to increase their cash flow to stay in the game, generate the cash flow by manipulating prices.  You do not have a real market place arrangement of prices anymore.  Again, there is nothing clairvoyant about this.  Free market price termination in many areas is over.  This is the truism of the economics of the last 40 years.</P>
    <P>So that is a contribution.  The capital hunger of the high technology multinational is a contribution to inflation. <Col N="1872" /> But the Taoiseach does not say that we have to do something about those multi-nationals or he does not say to the banks we have to do something about money supply; he does not say to industry: &ldquo;You have to do something about your prices and your profits&rdquo;.  We will come to that in a minute.  No, there is none of that. Banks are well-off; industries are well off; multi-nationals are extremely well-off. But they are not causing inflation: it is the workers wanting more money.  And nothing else.  This is a travesty of the truth and it would be a tragedy if it were to be believed because, if we have that sort of inflation, not just the sort I have been predicting but that the economists have been predicting year after year, if you have that sort of inflation year after year, and you do not do anything serious about it, and there is nothing in the Taoiseach's speech about any effort to control inflation except to say to the workers: &ldquo;Please fellows, do not ask for any more money&rdquo;, to give you an example of how ridiculous that is in the open Irish economy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I had a little more.  I thought there was a little drift in time from my taking over from the last speaker.  However, I will try to say what I want to say in four minutes. The effect of permitting that sort of inflation is to generate a sort of fury among ordinary people, men goaded by their wives when they come back from the shops, and they smash up the trade union movement; they smash up the ordinary chain of leadership; they smash up the national wage agreement and you have the sort of free-for-all the Taoiseach deplores, and correctly.  You have the situation where workers use their special position to get special concessions to the disadvantage of all the weakest section of the community.  You have that and, if you permit that sort of inflation, and if you do nothing about it except ask the workers not to want a significant wage increase, then you produce social disruption; you produce disruption of the chains of command and decision-making inside the <Col N="1873" /> trade union movement; and you get chaos, and you get the sort of holding up to ransom of the whole community by a little section who have a special position that gives them immense leeway. We all want orderly gains.  We all want the thing done in a disciplined way but, of course, the exact opposite will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I would like to indicate the total confusion that exists in the different Departments of Government in relation to prices.  The Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1972, came before the House in February and was passed the other day.  In speaking on that Bill on the 15th February, 1972, the Minister for Industry and Commerce said that he was proposing to take power to control the prices of almost all commodities. In other words, he was telling the workers not to worry; there was no need to ask for more money because prices would be controlled. However, the Minister for Finance has not heard about this because in the Dáil last night he said to Deputy FitzGerald that there are a number of the Deputy's colleagues who could tell him why price control at the retail level is next to impossible.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance believes to be impossible what the Minister for Industry and Commerce persuaded the House is possible.  The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing and neither hand knows what the head is doing because the head is doing nothing.  I do not have time now to indicate the areas of defect in the Taoiseach's speech, the areas where in matters of inflation, of protection of employment, of the strengthening of the public sector, of going ahead with regional policy, of preparing farming for the EEC and of protecting the country against the taking over of business by foreign supermarkets as well as a whole series of other areas, action could be taken now to prevent the dangers of which I have spoken. The defect of his speech is the defect of inactivity.  The defect of Fianna Fáil is not so much what they have done but it lies in their terrifying inability to decide and to act.  This results from their lack of talent, of brains and of courage which was never demonstrated <Col N="1874" /> better than in the Taoiseach's Adjournment speech.  People who continue to support that Government can only be accused of having a death wish because the continuation of the Taoiseach's policies will result in the economic death of Ireland.  Under those policies we will continue as individuals but we will not continue at a nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on a debate of this nature one must have regard to the situation in the Northeastern part of this country and, consequently, endeavour to utter words that might bring some glimmer of hope to the people in that area.  One might envy those opposition speakers who have a strange facility for over-simplifying the issue of the North by insisting that there is only one reason for the unrest. Of course there are many reasons for the trouble and there is much to be done before there will be peace.</P>
      <P>First, we must realise that peace being indivisible must be for all the people and that, therefore, to endeavour to have peace by some solution on the Shankill Road while not having it on the Falls Road would be a false ideal.  Unless there is peace throughout the Six Counties there will continue to be outbreaks of violence.  During the past four years the extent of the violence has been greater than ever before so that one cannot be surprised if the hopes of the people seem to be receding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I seek some glimmer of hope in the situation, I think of Gusty Spence, lately of Crumlin Road jail and now said to be a guest, either willingly or unwillingly of the UDA. During the week, Mr. Spence, speaking at a Press Conference, said it must be realised that the people of the Shankill Road had suffered as much from the results of unemployment and bad housing as had the people of the Falls Road.  As I see it, there is hope in that statement because it indicates that at last the majority in the North are beginning to realise that the conflict is not a religious one but that the whole basis of the trouble is economic.  They are beginning to realise that the Catholic on the Falls Road is not the enemy of the Protestant on the Shankill Road <Col N="1875" /> but is merely a competitor for the jobs that are available of which there are not sufficient.  Because of this shortage of jobs certain labels have been put on people in order to deprive them of work and of their civil rights.  In parts of America there is this discrimination because of colour.  In Germany it happened at one time to the Jews.  For 50 years in the North of Ireland, the Unionist junta have succeeded in dividing the lower paid workers by labelling one side Catholic and saying that, therefore, they are not entitled to civil rights.</P>
    <P>Each day one is horrified to hear of the killings and the maimings and one wonders what forces in the name of any religion could commit such atrocities. Of course the situation in the North for the past 50 years has not been normal.  From that situation all this violence has resulted and one must blame the wealthier classes in the North for this, who, in order to maintain their set-up ensured that they had plenty of fall guys whom they could blame for their mistakes.  In that way they held on to power.  On one occasion when Mr. Brian Faulkner was in Dublin he said that for as long as the workers voted Unionist the Unionists were invincible.</P>
    <P>I am not unaware of the efforts being made by people on all sides to bring about peace.  I applaud the efforts of the SDLP and of the trade unions and, indeed, of the overwhelming majority of the people who desire peace and who have paid a high price for their exploitation by the Unionists for so long.</P>
    <P>In pointing out all the causes of division in the North, the opposition speakers never think of telling us what would unite it.  They expound all the clichés <i>ad nauseam</i>.  All the casualties have been among the lower paid workers but of course it may be said that the majority of the people in the North are in the lower-paid category. Therefore, on the law of averages, they suffer more.  I do not want to see any class in the North suffering and would do anything possible to make some contribution towards peace so that the people of Shankill Road and Falls <Col N="1876" /> Road could live in peace, as I am convinced the vast majority want to do.  But if we are to eradicate violence we must spotlight the cause of it.  We know that once violence starts it is hard to stop it.  I agree with Deputy Corish when he stated in Volume 258 of the Official Report that the trouble in the North over the last four years began when the RUC invaded part of the Bogside in Derry and beat a man to death and wrecked many houses. This was the spark which set alight the present conflagration.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is useless to continue recalling these things because where there is an unjust system and people uphold it they are never very squeamish about their methods: their whole aim is to maintain the system.  Surely those RUC men were mere tools of the Stormont Government then just as are the people today who are killing, shooting and maiming people.</P>
    <P>There are many things in regard to which we can find unity.  It should be said in justice to the parties in this House and the people in the south that they have tried over the years to show that we really wanted unification, that we are prepared to make sacrifices for it.  I realise and appreciate that if unity comes we shall have to make sacrifices and so will the majority in the North.  To that majority I say the sacrifices they would have to make would be little compared with the sacrifices they are now making in trying to hold on to the oldest form of colonial government.  Their place is with the remainder of the country so that we can build a nation such as will ensure that the people, irrespective of religion or social class will have the same rights as those at the top.  Therefore, I mentioned Mr. Gusty Spence.  I believe there is new thinking coming in the North and it is bound to succeed in the end as it has succeeded in other countries where there was unjust government until the people began to think and then they swept it away and gained peace.</P>
    <P>I do not hold with those, some of them Members of the House, or those outside who preach about such things as people's democracies.  We know about the people's courts in Russia.  I <Col N="1877" /> believe that the majority in the North believe in democracy as we do and, as Winston Churchill once said, democracy is the worst system apart from all the others that have been tried.  I do not suggest the democratic State we have here is perfect but I believe the basis is there for the building of a society in which all men can live at peace irrespective of their faith.  It is our task to try to build this nation.</P>
    <P>Another school of thought suggests that we must change our ways and scrap the Constitution.  I admit the Constitution is 35 years old and that any document should be re-examined but first we should take stock of what is in the Constitution, of where it bears unfairly on any section of the people and if that is found to be the case and if rights are being infringed&mdash;and I mean real rights&mdash;then we must change it.  But before we do that let us make sure of what we should put in its place.</P>
    <P>I think the Opposition speakers who have chided us tonight for not condemning violence have not listened to us or, perhaps, they are playing politics. I do not know how any man who believes that all men are his brothers could possibly applaud the murders which took place in the North in the last four years no matter who committed them.  We felt just as sad when Trooper Best was murdered as we did when some of the children on the Falls Road were murdered.  Take Trooper Best who had no job and joined the British Army or take some of the children on Falls Road who because they <Col N="1878" /> were second-class citizens were doomed, if not to death, to a life which had not much to offer.  When we examine the Northern situation let us go to the roots of the violence and the killing and realise that the cause was the unjust system and that some people in their stupidity or blindness thought that by shooting people and by bombing they would bring about a better society.</P>
    <P>Perhaps violence does hasten developments but one must remember the scars left behind which can never be removed from the minds of the suffering families whose dear ones were slaughtered.  We then realise that the peaceful approach is the only one.  On this side we have never sought to try any other means.  Fine Gael speakers particularly and some Labour speakers have pontificated too much and adopted a &ldquo;holier-than-thou&rdquo; attitude, lecturing the people, telling them how much better they were than the mere mortals in the North.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour (a) if, in relation to redundancy claim 397/72, it was claimed by his Department, after the death of the husband, that the widow should not be paid 46 weekly payments from the fund on the grounds that her late husband failed or refused to seek or accept suitable gainful employment; (b) the amount involved; (c) the decision; and (d) if he will make the necessary amendment to Schedule I of the Act to cover this case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case referred to in the question the employee concerned was paid a lump sum under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 and 1971 of £1,025.80 on 13th October, 1971.  He also became entitled, subject to satisfaction subsequently of the usual qualifying conditions prescribed in the Acts, to 52 redundancy weekly payments.  The employee died on 30th November, 1971, by which time he had satisfied the necessary qualifying conditions for 5½ weekly payments, of which 4? had been paid.  The remaining ?th weekly payment due at the time of the employee's death was paid to his widow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An application by the widow for payment of the 46½ weekly payments to which her late husband had established a preliminary entitlement but for which he had not finally qualified at the time of his death was considered by a deciding officer under the Redundancy Payments Acts.  The deciding officer decided, in accordance with the provisions of the Acts and specifically having regard to paragraph 5 of Schedule 1 of the 1967 Act as amended by the 1971 Act, the weekly payments in respect of the period after the employee's death were not allowable. This decision was upheld, on appeal by the widow, by the Redundancy Appeals Tribunal.  Under section 39 of the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967, the decision of the tribunal on any question referred to it shall be <Col N="1756" /> final and conclusive, save that any person dissatisfied with the decision may appeal therefrom to the High Court on a question of law.</P>
    <P>The maximum possible amount involved in the 46½ weekly payments would have been £1,192.72.</P>
    <P>I am not contemplating an amendment of the Redundancy Payments Acts so as to provide for additional weekly payments in cases of this kind. Without prejudice to any decisions that may be taken in the future on amendments to the Acts, I would remind the House that the intention of the weekly payments provisions of the Acts is to maintain the incomes of employees in periods of unemployment and sickness following redundancy.</P>
