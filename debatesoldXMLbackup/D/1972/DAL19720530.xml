      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government and the Army will be represented at the annual commemoration at Béal na mBláth this year for the 50th anniversary of the death of Michael Collins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions over the past few years I suggested that an all party committee might be set up to consider how all those who died in the civil war could be appropriately honoured this year but this suggestion was not pursued.</P>
      <P>The practice has been well established of setting aside a special day each year to honour all those who took part in the struggle for independence.  I think that it is a good practice and one that should be continued.  However, in the very special circumstance of this year being the 50th anniversary of the commencement of the Civil War the Government have agreed that the Defence Forces will be represented at the Béal na Bláth ceremonies next August to commemorate the death of Michael Collins 50 years ago.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the Defence Forces will also be represented at another commemorative ceremony of a similar nature during the year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered that before in some detail.  I indicated to the House that this was a very specialised undertaking and needed a lot of expertise, and the firm were selected mainly because of their record in this field and to a large extent because of their location in the heart of Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of any disquiet expressed by several editors of leading foreign newspapers with regard to scheduled interviews with members of the Government being cancelled at the last moment without adequate explanation; and if he will outline the procedures pertaining to the granting of interviews by members of the Government to the press in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.Requests for press interviews with members of the Government originate in various ways.  The arrangements for such interviews are co-ordinated by the Government Information Bureau in close liaison with the office of the Minister involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the editor of <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> had an appointment to have an interview with a Minister and this was cancelled at the last minute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is completely untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>The editor of <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> believes he had an appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately I cannot read the correspondence but I can tell what is contained in it.  The son of the editor of <i>The Christian Science Monitor</i> resides in Dublin.  He wrote to the office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and to my office seeking separate interviews with the Minister and with me for his father and two other people who were due to arrive in Dublin at 3 p.m. on 11th May, leaving Dublin at 12 noon the following day.  He was told because of commitments <Col N="555" /> of the Minister and myself on the day of the count of the referendum that it would not be possible to arrange an interview.  These are the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Seemingly the editor is under a misapprehension about this, but he should be notified of the fact, because he does feel that a cancellation took place at the last moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how he could feel that because the correspondence gave no intimation whatever that would create such an impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no correspondence with the editor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I leave it to the Deputy's own intelligence.  With people coming from abroad, arriving 3 p.m. one day, leaving 12 noon the next day, and the days they happened to be, is it reasonable to assume that an appointment was arranged and then cancelled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>How long in advance was the request made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a letter to an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs dated April 29th and a letter to the Director of the Government Information Bureau dated April 29th.  Seeing that the count in the referendum would be on the 11th May, there would be no question of making an appointment for that day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether it is proposed to transfer maternity and other services from Loughlinstown hospital to Holles Street hospital, Dublin; and, if so, what effect this is likely to have on the standard of services available to people in Bray and Wicklow and on the nursing staff in Loughlinstown hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the considerable increase in the demand for hospital care for maternity patients in the Dublin area consideration is being given to the possiblity of an arrangement involving Holles Street hospital and the maternity unit at Loughlinstown in order to deal more effectively with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The maternity unit at Loughlinstown is appreciably underused, whereas <Col N="557" /> there is very great pressure on the bed accommodation at Holles Street.  Both hospitals draw patients from Dún Laoghaire, South Dublin and Wicklow and joint arrangements for the better use of their facilities would be to the general advantage of the maternity cases in these areas.  The basis on which joint arrangements might be worked is under active consideration but no decisions have so far been taken.  In any proposals for the better use of available resources the interests of the staff at Loughlinstown hospital would, of course, be taken fully into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the maternity unit at Loughlinstown is considerably underused.Would it not be a better proposal to make available added areas for the service of the unit in Loughlinstown rather than to consider closing that unit?  I take it there is no question of closure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of closure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>What is being considered is a question of control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is still being discussed and I can see that difficulties could arise.  There is the question of whether some or all of the beds in Loughlinstown should be used for post-confinement purposes.  The nursing staff at Loughlinstown naturally felt that this would take away from the character of the work they were doing. There is also the question that Holles Street Hospital naturally felt if they were to undertake the management for maternity services they would have to have some definite control.  Between one argument and another the matter is still under consideration and no decision is being taken.  The Deputy can be assured that the services at Loughlinstown will still continue to be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would take into account the fact that Loughlinstown Hospital also serves the Dún Laoghaire and Bray areas and so does St. Michael's Hospital, both of which areas are a considerable distance from Holles Street Hospital.  The <Col N="558" /> patients and their relatives are most anxious that both of these units would remain in operation as maternity centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this particular recommendation is not a recommendation of the Eastern Health Board but rather that of the Department of Health?  Surely he has power other than just to scrap a maternity unit like that, which has served north Wexford, Wicklow, Dún Laoghaire and south County Dublin? The reasons given do not seem to be adequate for the withdrawal of the maternity unit at Loughlinstown.  It is the only such maternity unit in the south Dublin area.</P>

I will be examining the situation with a view to seeing what further improvements might be undertaken.  As I have had the matter under review for only five weeks the Deputy could not expect me to have made any decision.  As I said, there has been a very happy development in blind services over the last ten or 15 years, under the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

There should be no difficulty whatever in getting the information which I am seeking in this question.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 23, 24 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The ESB are required by statute so to fix their charges that, by taking one year with another, revenue balances outgoings.  In pursuance of this statutory requirement, the board sought permission to increase charges from 1st January last by 10 per cent.  This application was referred to the National Prices Commission for examination and recommendation.  The commission deferred a recommendation pending receipt of the Report of the ESB Investigation Committee (the Fletcher Committee).Due mainly to the delay, the ESB found it necessary on 1st April, 1972, to amend their application to one for an increase in charges of 15 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Fletcher Committee recently reported to me and copies of their report were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 24th May.  The report will be published shortly.  The committee recommended an immediate increase of 10 per cent together with a price variation clause to be introduced as soon as possible which would reflect variations in a number of ESB cost elements such as fuel, payroll and capital charges. The report has also made a number of other recommendations related to the financing and operations of the ESB which are being urgently examined by the ESB and the Departments concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> The National Prices Commission have recommended an increase of 9 per cent on charges pending consideration and possible implementation of the recommendations of the Fletcher Committee.</P>
    <P>The Report of the National Prices Commission for the month of May which I understand is due for publication on 1st June will explain fully the basis of the commission's recommendation.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Government approved an interim increase sufficient to bring in an additional 9 per cent in revenue, the situation to be reviewed as soon as possible in the light of the scope for cost reductions arising out of the recommendations of the Fletcher Committee.  The recommendations of both the Fletcher Committee and the National Prices commission envisage alterations in the ESB's statutory obligations and the 9 per cent interim increase will not be sufficient to enable the board to balance revenue against expenditure in the current year or to meet any part of the deficit incurred to date.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission have no doubt taken into account the extent to which increased charges might cause any undue hardship; the ESB have pointed out, in this connection, that the average increase per consumer should be of the order of only 5p per week.  The recommendations of the Fletcher Committee cover a number of complex matters which will require very thorough consideration by the ESB and by the Government.  I do not propose to ask the ESB to postpone the application of the interim increase now approved, which, in fact, is not adequate to meet the board's current level of expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>In order that student charter flights be properly and efficiently organised, I have drawn up conditions for their operation.  These conditions are based on the recommendations of the European Conference of Civil Aviation of which this country is a member.  The organisers of such flights must be approved by me and one of the main criteria which I take into account in deciding whether or not to approve an organisation is the extent to which it is sponsored by educational establishments or student bodies.  Additionally, I endeavour to satisfy myself, as far as practicable, that the organisation will be in a position to mount a successful programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications for approval for the year 1972 were received from three organisations namely, the Irish Student Travel Service&mdash;USIT; the Irish Student Employment and Travel Association&mdash;ISETA and the Irish Student Employment Club&mdash;ISEC. USIT met all requirements and were approved.  ISETA and ISEC did not reach the standard or sponsorship required and, accordingly, were not approved.  My decision was conveyed to the organisations concerned some months ago in sufficient time to avoid soliciting students to make bookings for the 1972 summer programme. Deputies will recall that in February, 1972, I announced in the Dáil that only one association was authorised and would be operated for 1972.  Nevertheless, <Col N="578" /> certain bookings were made by the two unapproved organisations.  I have been informed, however, that these bookings were accepted by the organisations subject to their obtaining my approval and in the case of ISEC I was advised that it was proposed to carry the booked students on scheduled services if my approval for the charter flights were not forthcoming.</P>
    <P>I have today been advised that a merger has been effected between ISETA and ISEC.  This had been achieved by a reconstitution of the executive board of ISETA involving the co-option of the executive members of ISEC; and the combined bodies will thus operate under ISETA.  On this basis, I am prepared to accept the sponsorship for the combined operation as being adequate and as I have been advised that the combined organisation is assured of an adequate number of student exchange visas entitling the students to work in the USA during the summer vacation, I have decided to approve the combined organisation and to authorise the necessary charter flights.</P>
    <P>New legislation is not necessary in this matter as adequate control is assured by the necessity to secure my approval for charter flights.  I will, nevertheless, look again at the present conditions to see if they can be made more effective for the future particularly in respect of the booking of students by unapproved organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 29, is the Minister aware that last year he undertook to rationalise the situation in regard to student charter flights?  Despite his best intentions we have been confronted with a situation over the past week or so exactly similar to that of last year.  The big problem that arose was that two organisations which did not comply with the Minister's regulations were neverthless allowed to operate freely in the colleges and institutions.  Can the Minister do anything to prevent this happening next year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, I cannot prevent student organisations from soliciting students. What I have done is that by reason of <Col N="579" /> the approach adopted, a merger has been forced between these two organisations which now comply with the requirements and the situation now looks like developing properly.  There was a rift between these two bodies, as the Deputy knows, and all sorts of student personalities and politics were involved into which I do not propose to go now but at least they have now merged and this should rectify the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of the Turf Development Act, 1953, the initiative for submitting amendments to the Bord na Móna Superannuation schemes rests with the board of Bord na Móna. The information requested by the Deputy is as follows:-</P>
      <P>(a) the number of pensions at present payable under the Bord na Móna Regular Employees Works Superannuation Scheme is 188;</P>
      <P>(b) (c) Section 24 (3) (a) of the draft Bord na Móna Regular Works Employees Superannuation Scheme provides that, in addition to the normal pensions, supplementary pensions may be paid to certain pensioners at the discretion of the superannuation committee.  The main purpose of the supplementary pension is to bring the level of the social welfare retirement pension&mdash; 65-70 years&mdash;up to the level of the old age pension&mdash;over 70 years. Supplementary pensions have not yet been calculated by the Bord na Móna superannuation committee for the 157 pensioners who would be eligible to receive them;</P>
      <P>(d) (e) The sanction of my Department is not necessary since I approved the implementation of the draft scheme with effect from 4th June, 1970.  Bord na Móna have however sought clarification of a number of points arising in connection with the calculation and payment of supplementary pensions and these matters are under consideration in my Department in consultation with the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>As supplementary pensions have not yet been paid, most of the details requested in the Deputy's second question are not available.  Supplementary pensions will, I understand, be paid to eligible pensioners in due course with effect from 4th June, 1970.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble is that it has been complicated by the fact that the unions themselves want amendments to what Bord na Móna submitted.  Bord na Móna submitted their draft on 10th March and, on 31st March, the unions informed me that they wanted further amendments to the amending scheme.  That is where it lies at the moment, but I can certainly assure the Deputy that this matter will be expedited very quickly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has given a reply but the reply to the supplementary seems to contradict portion of that reply.  Is it correct that Bord na Móna asked for further clarification and that that is holding it up, or is it that there is another complication?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that certain claims to unemployment benefit by women registered at the Galway employment exchange have been disallowed.The question of whether a claimant satisfies the statutory conditions for title to unemployment benefit is a matter for decision by deciding officers or, on appeal, by appeals officers and I have no function in the matter.  A fundamental requirement of the statutory conditions is that the claimant must be available for employment.It will be clear that the extent of the employment opportunities open to a claimant is not, and cannot be, a determinant of the question of whether the person is in fact available for work.</P>
      <P>I may add that most of the claims by the women in question have been or are the subject of appeal and that in some cases appeals have been successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The dredging works at Dingle Harbour are proceeding in accordance with the designed scheme. The contract has run beyond its stipulated completion date but the Commissioners of Public Works are pressing the contractors to complete the works as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this dredging is a dead loss and that the money expended represents money gone with the tide? Will he take steps immediately to see that proper dredging is carried out, because this thing is a fraud?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that the contract was placed last September and the work was to be finished about mid-March.  There have been three reasons for the delay.  One is that the contractors are at present working on an approach channel and progress has been necessarily slower than it will be when they get into the dredging of the berths where the main accumulation of silt is.  They did hire additional dredging plant to expedite progress but this unfortunately broke down en route from England and, in addition, as the Deputy is aware, the weather conditions have not been favourable.  We have extended the period for completion to 15th June, but I am afraid it seems now that it will be necessary to extend this still further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that over £140,000 of State money has gone into the dredging <Col N="588" /> of this harbour and is it not the duty of the Department to see that the work is carried out properly?  This is not happening at present and the position is a source of great dissatisfaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, in his reply, is dealing with the directive on the modernisation of farms I confine my reply to the directive on the encouragement to leave farming.  Officials of my Department together with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Irish Mission met representatives of the EEC Commission on 9th and 10th February last with a view to discussing certain items in the draft directives.  Two problems were raised with the Council:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" /> (1) The draft directive provides that the bonus authorised thereunder be calculated on the basis of the lease value of the land.  Since longterm leasing is virtually non-existent in Ireland, it was proposed that the draft directive should also provide for calculation of the bonus by reference to the purchase money of the land.</P>
    <P>(2) The draft directive provides for payment of a pension (called in the directive an indemnity) to eligible farmers between the ages of 55 and 65.  As the old age pension does not come into operation in Ireland until the age of 70, eligible farmers would have no assured income in the intervening five years.</P>
    <P>The provision regarding the bonus in the final text of the directive fits our requirements.  Consultations were held on the other question on the 28th-29th March and in the result the Council decided that contacts should be established between the Commission and the four applicant countries to examine the technicalities of the operation of the directive in each of the applicant countries.  We await proposals of the Commission in this matter.</P>

      <P>Scholarships to regional technical colleges are awarded by vocational education committees.  A small number of committees confine the scholarships to students of vocational schools and I have indicated to these committees my wish that the scholarship schemes should be opened to all post-primary students.  The grant schemes framed under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, are in respect of students following degree courses or courses which are equivalent to degree courses. I do not propose amending the Act to extend the scheme to courses which are not of degree level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably appreciate that these scholarship schemes are organised by the vocational education committees themselves and there is nothing new in their confining the scholarships to students who come through their own schools. The Minister has clearly indicated his wish that they should be extended to all post-primary pupils.  To allay any fears the Deputy might have, about 30 committees had such schemes last year; in six cases only were the schemes confined to vocational school pupils. As a result of the Minister's consultations with them two of the six have now opened their scheme.  In other words, there are 26 schemes open to all post-primary pupils and only the other four have a limited form of restriction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised by CIE that Fish Pond Cross was selected as the most suitable central pick-up point for pupils from the Woodfield and Kiltivna areas attending the schools in Dunmore.  It would not be possible to extend the service to Gortnaleam old national school because there is inadequate turning space for a large bus at that point.  Neither is it possible to operate a round trip to Dunmore via Peak Hill as this hill is frequently frostbound in winter and is considered unsuitable for bus operation.The present pick-up point at Fish Pond Cross is reasonably convenient and is no less unsuitable than numerous other similar points throughout the country.</P>

      <P>Tairgim go léafar an Bille den Dara Uair.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcúigiú déag de Mhárta d'eisigh mé ráiteas thar cheann an Rialtais á rá go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas Bille a thabhairt isteach chun na toghcháin áitiúla a chur ar athló ar feadh bliana.  Bhí dhá chúis leis an mbeartas seo.  Ar ag gcéad dul síos, tá reachtaíocht á ullmhú chun athruithe sa chóras rialtais áitiúil a chur i bhfeidhm agus ní fheadfaí na hathruithe seo a chur i gcríoch roimh Mheitheamh.  Bhí an Rialtas den tuairim freisin nár chóir na toghcháin áitiúla a thionóil ar dháta a bheadh ró-ghar do dháta an reifrinn i dtaobh na gComhphobal Eorpacha.  Ar an hábhair sin chinntigh an Rialtas na toghcháin áitiúla a chur siar go dtí 1973 agus deintear foráil dá réir sa Bhille seo.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to postpone for a period of one year the local elections which under existing law are due to be held in June of this year. If the Bill is enacted the elections will be held in June, 1973, and every fifth year thereafter.  The Bill extends the terms of office of existing members of local authorities accordingly and makes minor consequential arrangements in relation to appointment of school attendance committees and to meetings of vocational education committees.  In this respect the provisions of the Bill are identical with those contained in the Local Elections Act, 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The opportunity of this Bill is being taken to remove the property qualification for the local government vote.  In future an elector may be registered only in respect of his residence and nobody may be registered more than once as a local government elector.  The Government announced its decision to amend the law in this respect some time ago and it is clearly desirable that the law in the matter should be changed before the local elections.  The change, of course, will not affect the <Col N="604" /> arrangement whereby an elector resident in an urban district is entitled to vote at the election of the urban district council as well as at the county council election.</P>
    <P>In regard to the minimum age for registration as an elector, as announced previously, the Government propose to hold a referendum on the voting age for Dáil and Presidential elections and referenda in the autumn.  If the people at this referendum approve of the reduction of the voting age for national elections to 18 years it is the Government's intention to introduce legislation to make a similar reduction in the voting age for local elections.</P>

      <P>The opportunity of this Bill is also being taken to remove the disqualifications for membership of local authorities on the grounds of being a bankrupt or of having received general assistance during the preceding 12 months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> The immediate object of the Bill is to postpone the holding of local government elections, which are due to take place next month, for one year, to June, 1973.  It has become too fashionable to give local elected representatives the &ldquo;run-round&rdquo; and to treat the holding of local elections as unimportant and to avail of any opportunity to postpone them.  Local elections were due to be held in 1965 and <Col N="606" /> they were postponed then for one year to 1966, presumably because a general election was held in that year.  In 1966 another Bill was introduced further to postpone them to 1967, presumably because the Presidential election was being held in 1966 and the Government wanted a small poll in order to protect the Fianna Fáil candidate.</P>
      <P>As things turned out they were right, although there was not such a small poll.  But the Fianna Fáil candidate had a very narrow shave and if all the electorate had been encouraged to come out, particularly Labour electors, he would definitely have been defeated.  That is not a very good or honourable reason for postponing local elections.  The frequent postponement of them tends to downgrade local authorities and to take away their status and standing.  That is a mistake. Local government, as we understand it and purport to operate it here, can only work smoothly and efficiently and command respect if you have the three arms pulling together and commanding equal respect&mdash;the Minister and the Department, the executive, in the person of the manager, and the elected representatives.  It is not good for the status of local elected representatives to have these frequent postponements.</P>
      <P>I think it is correct to say that local elections were once held every three years.  The period was then extended to five years and now it is six or seven. There is another reason why electors should be given an opportunity of expressing an opinion on local government policy as operated by the Minister through the Department and the local representatives.  No Department's action and inaction have given rise to more complaints and dissatisfaction than have the Department of Local Government.  That is why people should get an opportunity of expressing their views on it.  There is widespread dissatisfaction throughout the country with the decisions given on planning applications and certainly, when it comes to planning appeals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I have not gone into detail.  I was stopped.  I shall deal with three matters very briefly, in passing only.  As far as planning applications are concerned, there is widespread dissatisfaction at the decisions of planning authorities through the local managers who are supposed to be subject to local authorities.When it comes to planning appeals, there is nothing short of corruption.There is a Bill which has been on the Order Paper since 1969 to implement a Fine Gael Bill which the former Minister for Local Government, the former Deputy Boland, said he would accept.  That Bill has been sitting on the Order Paper since 1969 and has not been pushed forward by the Government.It has been withheld by the Government.  Therefore, I say that in order to give the people an opportunity of expressing their dissatisfaction <Col N="608" /> with the present operation of the Planning and Development Act, 1963, these elections should be held this year instead of next year.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not given any reason as far as I can see and he should give a reason when he is replying to the debate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Maybe, but one would have thought that in introducing the Bill the Parliamentary Secretary would have done the House the courtesy of giving the reasons.  I will come back to that again.</P>
      <P>Another reason why the elections should be held this year and why it is desirable that they should be held this year instead of next year is that there is complete and utter dissatisfaction about the rating system which is regarded as inequitable and unjustifiable.The people should be given an opportunity at the earliest possible moment of expressing their view on that.  The Government have fallen down completely in the matter of providing housing for the people.  Again, the local electors should be given an opportunity of expressing their view on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, there is no corporation in the city of Dublin because the corporation was abolished by the Minister's <Col N="610" /> predecessor.  There is no local authority in the urban area of Bray because the local authority was likewise abolished.  If these elections were to be held next month I assume the opportunity would be taken to restore the Corporation of Dublin and to provide Dublin with a first citizen and to restore the Urban Council of Bray.  If the Minister did not intend to proceed with local elections for the entire country he should at least have held an election for the Corporation of Dublin and for the Bray Urban Council so that these areas would not be left any longer than is necessary without representatives.I refer particularly to the city of Dublin.  It is not good enough that the capital city should be left without a first citizen, that the ratepayers of the city of Dublin should be left without elected representatives any longer than is necessary.  The Minister's action in postponing the elections is really an attempt to deprive them of representatives for a further year.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has stated that it is proposed to have a referendum to change the age for voting laid down in the Constitution in respect of general elections from 21 years to 18 years.  The Parliamentary Secretary concedes that such a referendum is not necessary to confer the right to vote at 18 in local elections. Candidly, I cannot understand why this Bill was not availed of to amend the law in respect of local elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

        <i>(Cavan):</i> If the only proposal is votes at 18, that should have been included in the EEC referendum because it is a foregone conclusion that that will be carried <Col N="611" /> and it is waste of public money having two referendums.  I quite agree that if it were a controversial matter it would not have been proper to include it in the Common Market referendum but if it is simply a proposal to give people the right to vote at 18 it certainly should have been included in the EEC referendum in order to save money and to avoid the trouble and annoyance that another referendum will involve.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary makes the case that it would not be right to change the law in regard to voting in local elections without asking the Irish people.  That argument simply does not stand up.</P>
      <P>The only matters about which it is required to get the decision of the people in a referendum are matters that are dealt with or provided for in the Constitution.  It was never the intention of anybody that the people should be consulted on the question of giving votes at 18 in local elections.  That simply was never intended.  Both Constitutions that were drafted, the one of 1922 and the one of 1937, specifically excluded from their provisions the question of votes in local elections. Therefore, I find it very difficult to understand the attitude of the Government in not amending now the law in relation to voting in local elections and in not giving the vote at 18.</P>

I think the Minister for Local Government is moving too slowly in regard to this proposed reorganisation of local government.  He introduced a White Paper to give his proposals.  I hardly think the White Paper introduced here was the White Paper as originally drafted because it gave no information. <Col N="612" /> It failed to convey what the Minister's proposals were.  So vague and inadequate was that White Paper that a supplement to it was published a short time after the White Paper came out but it, too, was vague.  I believe the Minister cannot make up his mind or has not made up his mind what he will do in regard to local government reform.He should bring his proposals before this House at once so that the people can see where they are going and what it is intended to do in local government.  I certainly am not in favour of abolishing local authorities wholesale but I believe that a change in the system of financing local authorities is long overdue and we cannot have an intelligent discussion on the White Paper on local government reform until we have a White Paper on finance.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> We will gladly avail of that.  There is a proposal in this Bill to remove the disqualification of a person who has received general assistance from a public assistance authority from serving on that local authority.  I respectfully agree with that.  I think there is no <Col N="613" /> reason why a man, just because he has fallen on lean times through ill-health or something else, and has had to call on the local authority for assistance, should be disqualified from sitting on the local authority.  I accept that.  There is another amendment in the Bill, the one to confer on a bankrupt the right to sit on a local authority.  I do not agree with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I want to say that clearly and loudly. Is it proposed to follow that to its logical conclusion and confer on a bankrupt the right to sit in this House?  I concede that you could have a case in which bankruptcy could be brought about through no fault, or no serious fault, of the bankrupt but in most cases a person becomes bankrupt because he is not fit to run his own business, because he has made a mess of his own business.  I do not think that such a person is a fit or proper person to come to serious decisions on behalf of the ratepayers of a local area in regard to the spending of money, in regard to the striking of rates, in regard to the buying and selling of land, which are reserved functions.  I simply do not.  The Parliamentary Secretary made the argument that the people should have the widest possible choice.  I believe that if a known bankrupt stood before the people he would hardly get elected but a person could get elected and become bankrupt the following year.  His state of affairs might not have been known to the people when he was offering himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the law stands if he became bankrupt he would cease to be entitled to sit on the council.  I have strong views on that.  It is not right that a man could be elected in 1973, go bankrupt at the end of that year, or early in 1974, and remain there managing the people's affairs for the next four years. I am against that.  I think it is a move in the wrong direction.  A man who becomes bankrupt is usually not fit to manage his own business or is a reckless individual.  I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should <Col N="614" /> put down an amendment on Committee Stage to continue that disqualification. I do not propose to oppose the Second Reading notwithstanding what I have said but I thought it right to avail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people should be given the opportunity of expressing their opinion on the policies pursued by local authorities and the Department of Local Government.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is essentially a legislative device to postpone the local elections until June, 1973.  There are other matters referred to in the Bill but I think they are rather innocuous and unimportant.  Certainly, there is nothing in the Bill that will give hope to the homeless, to those who are affected by the scourge of maladministration of the differential rent system, to those who must bear the heavy burden of rates, or to the whole matter of local democracy which is activating the minds of members of local authorities for the past number of years.</P>
      <P>We regret the necessity for postponement of the local elections because it was something to which we were looking forward.  In particular, we regret the manner in which the Government made the announcement.  We were given reason to believe up to a few weeks before the referendum that the local elections would take place this year, but suddenly there was an announcement by the Minister that they were being postponed.  This was at a time when many of the local authorities had included in their Estimates for the coming financial year the required amount of money for carrying out the elections.  The Minister was less than courteous to the local authorities in the rather brash and offhand manner in which he postponed the elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="615" /> I am beginning to doubt if the local elections will take place in June, 1973. If the important matter of the restructuring of local government is to be carried out in accordance with the Green Paper and in accordance with the sentiments expressed from time to time by the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary, it seems to me that the elections cannot take place in 12 months time.  There is a vast amount of work which must be done and this cannot be done within the next year.</P>
    <P>Before the rationalisation of local government takes place we must inform the people about all the ramifications and implications involved.The Parliamentary Secretary will be aware of the widespread resentment among members of local authorities, especially the smaller bodies such as town commissioners and urban councils whose future is seriously threatened in the proposed restructuring.  This is a matter that cannot be rushed; it will necessitate explanation and reconsideration. If the Government are sincere in their determination to carry out the restructuring which has been outlined to us&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not discussing that matter on this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be an impossibility to carry out the restructuring outlined in the Green Paper before the next local elections and I am sure that privately the Parliamentary Secretary will agree with me that this is not on. We are being dishonest once again with those people on local authorities who devote their lives to public service.Once again we are misleading them into thinking the elections will take place positively in 12 months time when all of us know that with the radical changes which the Government propose to carry out many of the local authorities will not be in existence when the next elections take place. This applies in particular to town commissioners and urban councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are doing today has no relevance for many of our colleagues on the local authorities.  I appreciate that this is not the time to delve into <Col N="616" /> matters concerning housing, differential rents, programmes regarding roads, planning and so on but the Bill could be much more comprehensive in dealing with matters which affect the lives of the people.</P>
    <P>The Bill refers to the necessity to continue to appoint members to school attendance committees and to vocational education committees.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain in greater detail why it is necessary to continue with membership of these committees.  I admit I am not <i>au fait</i> with these committees&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>It only applies to three or four local authorities, mostly in the Dublin borough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could explain this matter in greater detail in his reply. I am a member of a vocational education committee and I understand the need for such a stipulation in this case.</P>
      <P>It is right that the property qualification for the local government vote has been removed.  The principle of one man, one vote, is something we need to demonstrate clearly in this part of the country.  The property qualification was a hangover from the British regime and is something that has been continued in another part of this country.  All of us know that it is a discriminatory practice.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Fitzpatrick I am surprised that we need a referendum to allow votes at 18 years.  This will transpire to be a non-contentious issue with the people.  I am sure the vast majority, with the exception of some cranks, will support the view that our young people should be allowed to vote at 18 years.  My party have been advocating this practice for many years.  It is in operation in most other progressive countries in Europe and we see no necessity for all the furore about it by the Government.  We do not understand, for instance, why we could not have had this matter included in the referendum in connection with the Common Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We shall have to wait until the autumn before the granting of votes at 18 is implemented and thereby put the <Col N="617" /> nation to the trouble of voting in a referendum.  I note that the referendum will be taken in conjunction with the Presidential election but there ought to be an easier, more effective and speedier means of implementing this principle than the way in which the Government are dealing with it.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the penal clause relating to disqualification for membership of a local authority as contained in the British Act of 1898 is now being repeated.  All of us know people who have been affected by the invoking of this antiquated legislation. There have been unfortunate men who, because they had bad times at some stage, have been disqualified from membership of local authorities because they or their families were compelled to seek public assistance. That is a deplorable situation.  I would not go along with Deputy Fitzpatrick in the trenchant attack he made on those people who are declared bankrupt and who, as a result, lose their positions in public life.  Perhaps in some cases the circumstances are due to their own fault.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps they are due to their being in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps in some cases the circumstances of these people were brought about by adversity, or by accepting the advice of others, but I would not agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that in all cases bankruptcy is due to recklessness or to the lack of ability to manage one's business.  One of the finest public representatives I have ever known and one who graced this Chamber for many years was put out of this House on grounds of bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite that, that man sought election again and he was honoured by his people who voted for him so that he was returned to this House on many occasions afterwards.  In many instances a company goes bankrupt and it is wrong that all men in that company should be branded equally.  I know of other people who gave long and devoted service to public life but who, because the companies in which <Col N="618" /> they were engaged were declared bankrupt, were compelled to leave public life.  In those cases their departure was regretted deeply by their people.  In time they redeemed themselves and reentered public life.  In saying this, I am not condoning the man who would squander his own property and that of others.  I would deem such a man to be unfit to be charged with the responsibility of deciding how the services of his community should be administered. Likewise, I should not wish to see a man of that kind in this House.  However, the people decide these matters and they are able to differentiate between the reckless man and the one who is declared bankrupt through no fault of his own.</P>
    <P>My sentiments are with the Parliamentary Secretary in this matter.  I am judging this Bill on the basis of personal knowledge of people who have been involved in bankruptcy.  Some of these people were of the finest calibre that one could meet, men who were regarded as giants in the political arena and who spent themselves in the service of their people.  They were men of honour and integrity and these qualities were reflected in the massive support that was accorded them at election time on so many occasions.</P>
    <P>One would need to know the personality involved before being able to judge for oneself whether a man should have the right to go forward for election to public life but in respect of the people I have known who were involved in bankruptcy I can only say that they were of the highest calibre.</P>
    <P>This measure relates merely to a few features.  These are the postponement of the local elections, making possible the continuation of membership of the school attendance committees and the vocational education committees, the tidying up of the matter of the property vote, with which I concur fully, the matter of votes at 18 and, also, of course, it deals with the disqualification for holding public office on grounds of bankruptcy or the acceptance of public assistance.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Minister for Labour and Social Welfare has in mind a radical change in respect of the <Col N="619" /> administration of home assistance.  If this amendment had not been introduced, I wonder how this change might have affected people who would be obliged to accept the new type of social welfare benefit that the Minister has in mind.  In any event, I have a horror of home assistance and all that it means and on any occasion available to me I take the opportunity of saying that it is a system which should be abolished as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>My main doubt about the proposal is that I believe the Government are treating with a certain amount of disdain all of us in public life in the offhand manner in which they postpone elections without due regard to the implications involved.  We believe there was an urgent necessity for the restoration of the Dublin City Council to the people of Dublin.  Even if it necessitates a special piece of legislation the Parliamentary Secretary should consider this matter very seriously.  Through this democratic process the people have an effective say in the affairs of the capital city.  It must be a source of great disappointment to Dublin people and to all those men and women who served this city voluntarily over a long number of years that the city council remains abolished by the reckless, arrogant act of the then Minister.</P>

      <P>I wish to avail of the opportunity on this measure dealing with the postponement of elections to say that while most of our local authorities will survive another 12 months Dublin creates a serious problem in that the people are not being afforded an opportunity this coming June to re-elect their city council.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider whether he could make an exception in respect of Dublin city and area and permit them to proceed as quickly as possible with the re-election of their representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to give a categorical assurance to the House and to the country that the local elections will, in fact, take place in June, 1973.  Many of us have doubts that this is possible having regard to what the Government have in store for local authorities by way of interference with the democratic system.  The Government should be honest and say, if it is so, that there <Col N="621" /> will be no local elections until the restructuring of local government, as laid down in the Green Paper, is carried through to its ultimate conclusion, which implies the abolition of a large number of the small local authorities. The Government should be honest and not pretend once again that elections will take place 12 months hence when they know that the Minister.  Deputy Molloy is carrying through with all speed restructuring which involves radical changes in the system of local government as we have enjoyed it.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can assure me that all this can be done between now and June, 1973, I shall give him full credit for it.</P>

      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on allowing a bankrupt to sit on these councils.  As far as I know this House recommended that a bankrupt should be permitted to sit in this House.  Very often nowadays a person could have his money invested in a company and he would have no great resources of his own.  This company could go broke and he would find himself bankrupt through no fault of his own.  If one looks at the Rolls Royce Company, which up to recently was a gilt edge security, one can see that if a person had shares in that he would have been declared bankrupt.  It is about time this matter was put in order.  Deputy Treacy accused Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan of being against this legislation.  In fact, Deputy Fitzpatrick welcomed the measure.  Indeed, he said that some of those bankrupts could be complete &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>How often have we seen this Government calling an election deliberately on an old register rather than a new one?  I do not see how the <i>status quo</i> would affect anything.If the elections were held now, the members of councils would be more up-to-date.  If they are postponed, a large percentage of the members will be co-opted and many of them will be local businessmen, local Gaelic foot-ballers, or others of that type who have allegiance locally to political parties.  If elections were held now the councils would be manned by young people who might not be interested in being Members of this House but of local politics.</P>
      <P>It is particularly important for Dublin that the local elections should be held this year.  Dublin has been left without elected representatives for far too long.  The city is being administered by an individual and there are many things happening of which the citizens are not aware and which they would almost certainly become acquainted with if they had their representatives in the city council.  As well as that, malpractices have grown up.  For instance in the matter of planning, a speculator might lodge as many as three plans in the hope that if the first was refused he could pursue the second and then the third.  As well, the city has been left without a first citizen and this not only does Dublin harm but, from the point of view of visitors from outside, it harms the entire country.  At the moment the greater city is estimated to have a population of 700,000, a floating population of 750,000 and, possibly at any given time, as many as one million people live here.  Therefore, whatever happens about the rest of the country I strongly urge that local elections be held in Dublin this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister's reasons for postponing the elections this year are not valid.  Another point is that next year we will have several elections.  There will be the Presidential election, there will possibly be two referenda to change the Constitution to suit the people in Northern <Col N="627" /> Ireland and I am sure there will be a general election.  Why does the Minister not come out straight and tell us that the reason he is not holding the local elections this year is that he is afraid that if he were defeated in them defeat would also follow in the general election that is coming?</P>

      <P>This piece of legislation is a typical piece of Fianna Fáil make-believe, a pretence.  What is the most important provision in it?  It is the fixing of the vote at the age of 21.  I do not know why this was brought into the Bill in view of the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary said it was going to be a matter that would be determined in relation to Parliamentary elections by a referendum next year. The Constitution of this country sets out:</P>
      <P>Every citizen without distinction of sex who has reached the age of twenty-one years who is not disqualified by law and complies with the provisions of the law relating to the election of members of Dáil Éireann, shall have the right to vote at an election for members of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>This Bill has nothing to do with the Members of Dáil Éireann.  The Parliamentary Secretary had the temerity, the cheek and the impudence to talk about the &ldquo;reduction of the voting age for local elections&rdquo;.  The Parliamentary Secretary said:</P>
      <P>Reduction of the voting age for local elections does not require amendment of the Constitution: it can be done by simple legislation.</P>
      <P>Why was this not done?  Can the Government not make up their minds? Are they pretending that they are going to reduce the voting age to 18?  Why was it not done here?  Was it that it would be an indication in relation to what would happen in connection with Dáil Éireann elections?  Are they afraid of the young people?  Is that what we are to understand?  We have been &ldquo;hauled&rdquo; into the Common Market at immense expenditure.  In most countries in the Common Market, and in the countries which are supposed to go into the Common Market with us, there are votes at 18 years.  Why is there not a vote here at 18 years?</P>

      <P>Local elections have very close connections with Dáil elections.  Section 1 (a) reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  A person shall be entitled to be registered as a local government elector in a local electoral area if he has reached the age of twenty-one years and he was, on the qualifying date, ordinarily resident in that area.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I intend to put down an amendment to insert the words &ldquo;eighteen years&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;twenty-one years&rdquo;.  Since there was no necessity at all for this section in the Bill, I do not know why it was put in, except that the Government may have wished to have a debate to see what opinions there would be in the House in favour of the vote at 18, instead of 21.

In this Bill they are destroying absolutely the value of local representation by extending <Col N="630" /> the life of certain local authorities from five years to seven years and keeping the Dublin City Council abolished.  Many members of the Government, in answer to Parliamentary Questions, talk about Dublin Corporation.  There is no such body as the Corporation of Dublin at present.

      <P>I have said enough about it.  It is very wrong that we should get this pretence of a Bill.  Local elections used be held every five years. They were held in 1950, 1955 and 1960 but when Fianna Fáil were in office <Col N="631" /> they would not hold them and they extended the life of local authorities at one stage.  The real reason was that the people were fed up with the expense incurred in connection with the elections and they joined the local elections with the election of the President.  This does not fool anybody.  The Fianna Fáil Party may feel that they are smart about politics, but they have not got that degree of smartness that can make a five into a seven or a seven into a five.  The fact is that it would not be reasonable.  In this city the strongest exception is being taken at present to the fact that there is no local authority.</P>

There are countries for whose methods I have not got much respect but let us take the Constitution of the United States of America.  After 200 years, they are still on their umpteenth amendment. What is the purpose of all this business of having a new Bill brought in every time local elections are coming up?  What is it supposed to do?  The Fianna Fáil Party pretend that they are all in favour of votes at 18 and they are going to have a referendum on the matter.  Here they had an opportunity to provide votes at 18 in connection with local authorities without any referendum.  Why was it not done here?  I am going to see how they vote because I propose to table an amendment providing for votes at 18 and then we will see what they are worth.  They will not be able to make any argument about its not being possible because they can do what they like.  I will have a bet that every possible research was done on this to see if they could get out of it and avoid putting it into the Bill.</P>

If I understand this Government, they will do nothing whatever about anything except spend money, which they do all right, and destroy the value of money, but so far as making worthwhile improvements in public affairs is concerned, they do absolutely nothing.  The fact is that fundamentally the Government have not yet learned to honour the institutions of the State in real terms, because if you mess around with elections in this fashion, you are not honouring the institutions of the State.  If you mess around and have a law which sets out that elections shall be held every five years for local authorities and then you mess around and you have them sometimes every six years&mdash;they were held in 1950, in 1955&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has more interest than I in the minutiae of politics and he dribbles his words when he speaks in this House.  There is only one other Deputy who talks as he does. If we are going to have democracy it has to be seen to be democracy and here I am coming to a point about the part of the Bill which removes the disqualification on people who have received general assistance or who have been declared bankrupt.  I certainly think that there is no reason why a man who has received general assistance should be cut out of public life but I do agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that a man who has been declared bankrupt should not become a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>Having been declared bankrupt a man is seen to be unfit to manage his own affairs.  A man is not declared bankrupt because he owes somebody £5.  A long process has to be gone through and he has to owe more than one person £50.  The Government have taken care to ensure that £50 is not what it used to be.  Any time they want to make that figure £200 I will agree with them.  It would be more realistic nowadays.  Subject to that, there is no question but that any man who has mismanaged his own affairs to the extent of being declared bankrupt is unfit to be a member of a local authority.</P>
      <P>This is typical.  Who were the Government and the Fianna Fáil Party thinking of when they put this section into the Bill?  I do not think it would have been put into the Bill unless they had certain people in mind.  I do not think that this conservative Government have sufficient regard for public affairs to allow people who have received public assistance, or who have been declared bankrupt, to be members of local authorities just for the sake of being liberal.  If that is the reason, it is a pretence of being liberal. The White Paper says that the section will remove the Schedule to the Local Government (Application of Enactments) Order, 1898.  This kind of thing is of no significance.  I do not know why we give time to it in the House. I do not know why the Minister should bring this kind of thing into the House.</P>

    <P>That is not the real reason at all.  I do not know why the local elections are put back for a year.  We will have a plethora of elections from now on. We will have a referendum on votes at 18 in the autumn, a general election next spring for a certainty, the local elections in the middle of the year, and then a Presidential election.  Yet the Government cannot make up their minds to have the local elections this year.  We could have the old stunt of having the local elections and the Presidential election together and we would have three more elections inside 12 months inevitably.</P>

They were the only people present.  There was no representative of the city of Dublin because there is no corporation.  It would be easy to put down an amendment to the effect that the elections for the corporation of the city of Dublin should be held before this period.  I will think about it.

      <P>When that issue was raised it was not easy to answer it when the law was as it is.  It is no harm to change it now.  It is very reasonable to give the people an opportunity in a referendum to have their say on the very important step of giving the vote at 18 years.  If the people decide at a referendum to give the vote at 18 years in general elections, people can vote in local elections at 18 years as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of discussion on the question of a bankrupt or a person in receipt of public assistance being allowed to be a member of a local authority.  Why should we not go a little further?  A member of a local authority who fails to pay his or her rates by 31st March is automatically disqualified from membership.Ordinary people are allowed some extra time if they are in arrear. I think these councillors should be given some days of grace.  Even if only a portion of the rates is due <Col N="638" /> the councillor is automatically disqualified.There could be several reasons why this could happen; the councillor might genuinely forget or the rate collector might forget to call on him.  There should be a more sympathetic approach in these cases because these councillors work for the good of the community and without any financial reward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one of the greatest pieces of eyewash ever brought before this House.  The Minister gave two reasons for the Bill, one in Irish and one in English.  In Irish, he said:</P>
      <P>Ar an gcúigiú lá de Mhárta d'eisigh mé ráiteas thar cheann an Rialtais á rá go raibh sé beartaithe ag an Rialtas Bille a thabhairt isteach chun na toghcháin áitiúla a chur ar athló ar feadh bliana.  Bhí dhá chúis leis an mbeartas seo.  Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá reachtaíocht á ullmhú chun athruithe sa chóras rialtais áitiúil a chur i bhfeidhm agus ní fheadfaí na hathruithe seo a chur i gcríoch roimh Meitheamh...</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why he wants the Bill is because of the proposed local government reorganisation.  Perhaps he hopes that those who understand Irish would not be here for that particular part of his speech and, therefore, would miss the main reason for the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary should come clean now and tell us about this reorganisation.When the Minister toured the country he got a very mixed reception, even from some of his own. They had seen the White Paper and it was implied in it that local authorities would never again be the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was this Bill not deferred for another month?  That would give us an opportunity of debating at greater length the future of local government. The people in the Custom House do not like local authorities.  The vast majority of these bodies are not controlled by the Government; they are controlled by either Fine Gael or Labour and these people have a habit <Col N="639" /> of looking for schemes of all kinds and possibly some of the requests put forward are a bit embarrassing.  Will local authorities be deprived of even the few powers they have left?  Already they have no control over main roads or secondary roads.  Health has been removed from the scope of their operations.In the proposed reorganisation the possibility is that the agricultural and the vocational education committees will also be removed.</P>
    <P>I am suspicious because recently Fianna Fáil councillors in Kerry had in their possession a sort of draft proposal, wherever they got it, with regard to a new definition of electoral areas in the different counties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only right and proper that these things should be said here.  Electoral areas are being redrawn.Obviously what is wrong is that the message is not coming back as to what way certain people would like the divisions to be made.  When the message does come back there will be a new structure of local government.It is wrong that draft proposals should circulate like this.  This sort of thing should not happen.</P>
      <P>As Deputy MacSharry said, bankrupts and those in receipt of public assistance will henceforth be able to become members of councils.  I do not see anything wrong with that.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have widened the scope to cater for part-time members of fire brigades and caretakers of water supply schemes. These should be allowed to go forward in local elections and I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to include these categories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see this election taking place next year because, as previous speakers pointed out, especially Deputy O'Donovan, we shall have a number of elections next year, probably a general election and a Presidential election and is it intended to sandwich local elections in between?  It does not seem to be &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  I think the whole purpose of the Bill is to mark time and let the people think that the elections <Col N="640" /> will take place next year.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would give us a date for the local elections next year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a very shrewd forecast.  I forecast that the electoral divisions and local government will be changed and until this is done we shall not have local elections.  The Parliamentary Secretary had a golden opportunity in this Bill to present the draft proposals for the reorganisation of local government and it is a pity he has let the opportunity pass.  If we had the opportunity of discussing them we might not be as suspicious as we are. Members of his own party might not be satisfied with the new structure of local government envisaged by the Custom House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local representatives feel they are looked on as glorified servant boys by Custom House officials.  People who write letters to the Custom House must wait weeks for a reply.  This is not good enough.  The same applies to planning appeals which go for 12 <Col N="641" /> months or 18 months without a decision.This is also wrong.  The same thing is now happening in the regional health boards: when one writes in one gets a letter saying the matter is under consideration.  One must then wait months and will probably have to write once or twice again to find out what decision is reached in regard to the person about whom you are inquiring. This waffling should be completely cut out.</P>
    <P>I again appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary when the Committee Stage is being dealt with to cover people in part-time employment of local authorities, those who volunteer for fire brigades particularly.  Such a person gives voluntary service to the community and should not be penalised by not being allowed to stand for a local authority election.  He is prepared to leave his bed at 4 a.m. or 5 a.m. to help somebody in distress and it is penal to debar him from standing for election to the local authority.  The same may be said in regard to people receiving some allowance for being in civil defence since they are also under the local authority.  The type of person who volunteers service to the community should not be penalised.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will note these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make one comment on the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary: I regret that he should have made a statement which is somewhat insulting to the intelligence of the House, first of all, and to that of the electorate.  The suggestion that it was inadvisable and undesirable that there should be a simple introduction of votes at 18 in this Bill because the people had not yet given their decision on it in relation to Dáil and Presidential elections is at least fanciful.  It is strange that this should form the basis of the Government's decision. It must be remembered that between next October and next February another local elections Bill will have to be introduced reducing the voting age to 18.  If anybody suggests that that is not an abuse of the work of the House I should like to know of a better example.  I do not think anybody imagines that the referendum in <Col N="642" /> October on the amendment of the Constitution is likely to result in votes at 21 being retained.  That issue is even more of a foregone conclusion than was the EEC referendum.</P>
      <P>There is every good reason to believe the people are in favour of votes at 18 and there is no reason why the Government could not have set a good example by introducing votes at 18 for local elections now in this legislation. The reason given in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement that the Government consider that the voting age at local elections should not be reduced until the people have given their decision in relation to Dáil and Presidential elections is not justified.  To my mind the reason given is not only spurious but hypocritical.  On this basis he went on to say, it may be expected that the new voting age will be in operation for the local elections in 1973.</P>
      <P>There is a great deal of very urgent work to be done in this House in respect of local government reform&mdash; particularly in regard to the greater Dublin area&mdash;and to have us saddled again in the autumn with another piece of legislation immediately following the referendum is not good enough and I want to protest against it.  We in the Labour Party will again test the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government who in principle are totally in agreement as is every Deputy to my knowledge, that the franchise should be given at 18. I know of no Deputy or Senator who intends to oppose the proposition.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we will have the spectacle that, on Committee Stage of this Bill, the Labour Party will put down an amendment to introduce votes at 18 and the Parliamentary Secretary and his colleagues will once again vote against that proposition.  One would imagine that the fact that votes at 18 are in operation in Northern Ireland, in Great Britain and in Europe would help the Government to make up their mind and to amend this legislation, thus getting the question out of the way in regard to local elections.  This would not prejudice any decision which might be taken subsequently in the autumn in regard to Presidential or Dáil elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make the point that it is <Col N="643" /> politically unfair, snide, sly and typical of the approach of the Government for the Government not to give the people now a general indication of the elections that they will face within the next 12 months.  The recent information bulletin issued by the Department of the Taoiseach stated quite clearly that a Presidential election will take place between April and June, 1973, and that the Presidential election campaign will start in April, 1973.  Simultaneously, we were informed by the Parliamentary Secretary that local government elections will take place in June, 1973.  Therefore, may we assume that the Presidential election and the local government elections will be held on the same day in 1973?  The Government should come clean and give us that information.  This is a natural assumption.  The Government's arrangements are a matter for speculation.</P>
    <P>Now that it would not seem to be opportune for the Government to have a general election before the end of the summer, the referendum and the general election might well be held next autumn and the Presidential and local elections in June, 1973.  I have always noticed the reluctance of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet to have a general election immediately following local elections.  If one checks the dates one finds that invariably Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries like to have the general election immediately before the local elections, thus effectively circumscribing the operations of any newly aspiring Dáil Deputies.  This has been obvious over the years.  The people should be forewarned of the intentions of the Government.  The precise information should be given as to the Government's intentions in regard to local elections.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other reforms proposed.They are long overdue.  I would share Deputy Begley's concern that &ldquo;Mr. Jerrymander&rdquo; of Fianna Fáil will now be in cahoots with the various Deputies in the various counties realigning local electoral boundaries. Certainly, this is in the air in Dublin for the Greater Dublin Council.  It would be most improper that we should have a Bill suddenly foisted on us next February or March, immediately prior <Col N="644" /> to the local government elections, proposing new electoral areas that have been carved out.  I do not think the Government would succeed that easily in that regard because, while the Government had particularly good architects for that purpose in the former Deputy Kevin Boland and Deputy Neil Blaney, I doubt very much that the Government have the capacity to do it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It was interesting to listen to the various forecasts of elections.We have been used to these over the years.  The political correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> forecast 52 general elections in one year for 52 different reasons.  Tonight there have been other forecasts of elections in the next 12 months.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Every effort by the Minister for Local Government to ensure that there will be better local authority organisation to ensure better services must be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on reorganisation has been widely read.  Many excellent suggestions have been made particularly by public representatives who have served on local authorities.  As one of the members of the abolished Dublin City Council, may I say something in relation to an improvement of local authority organisation?  This is desirable and absolutely necessary, so as to ensure that the public will have a council that will give the service they deserve and that we will not have councils that are concerned mainly with their own problems, in particular, their own personal problems, as was the case not so long ago.</P>
      <P>The mention of a wider field in relation to Dublin city is welcome.  Every effort that the Minister makes to ensure better organisation, whether by postponement of the elections or otherwise, is desirable, so that the people of this city will have an organisation of which they can be proud and which will do justice to the expanding city and county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in some agreement with other suggestions that have been mentioned. There is the question of people being debarred from holding office, for instance, people who received general <Col N="645" /> assistance during the past 12 months. This is a penal clause.  It is time it was abolished.  I had hoped that the Government would take a wide view of the whole question of the politically free in relation to local and general elections.  People have been debarred and are being debarred from holding office who should not be so debarred. In one case a postman was elected to the Dublin City Council and was debarred because he was a postman.  The situation should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>There are various other groups who should have the opportunity of being elected to the council.  There are many excellent persons who are debarred because of the type of employment they are in.  I worked for a concern where the rule operated that one had to resign when nominated to Dáil Éireann.  That happened to me and I am well aware of the problems of the politically free and the politically unfree, in the matter of contesting local elections.  I have sympathy with those people who want to contest local elections.  There are regulations that debar persons from being elected.  For instance, part-time employment with a local authority is a disqualification.  This is an appalling situation.  This question of disqualification should be examined and those at present debarred should have an opportunity to contest local elections, and to make their views known.  Who better than these people to make their views known?  I know that certain people in the services cannot be allowed to contest elections but there are many people in menial jobs in the local authorities who should be allowed to take an active part in politics, if they so desire.</P>
    <P>The abolition of Dublin City Council has been mentioned.  I was a member of that council when it was abolished. It was not abolished because the Minister wanted it abolished; it was abolished because the public representatives failed to do their duty, they failed to strike a rate which, in effect, would have meant a reduction in the health estimate and that would have meant that the weaker sections of the community would have been unable to obtain assistance in many forms such as home assistance.</P>

      <P>I am glad to welcome this Bill.  I hope the Minister will be able to ensure that the local government organisation will be a far better one than it was in the past, that it will be capable of dealing with community problems which are developing.  The general organisation is outmoded.  New thinking is required in our approach to local authority organisation.  If this is one of the reasons why the Bill has been introduced everyone should welcome it.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that the people will have an opportunity in a referendum to make their voices heard on the question of votes at 18.  The Government will again accept the decision of the community.  This is a most democratic procedure.  In the past people have been telling the Government to consult the people.  The people are now being consulted but again the Government are wrong.  On the other hand, people are asking for a general election and, if the Government do not agree, they are wrong. The Government are never right.  The people will have an opportunity to decide this very important issue in the near future.  Some Deputies seem to be amazed that this matter has been included in the Bill.  I am glad it has been.  It shows clearly the desire of the Government to ensure that the democratic process of allowing the people to decide is followed.  I welcome the Bill.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of my views in relation to people in part-time employment in local authorities and to the politically free and unfree in general.  I should like him to examine further this general question and to bring within the orbit of local affairs many people who are at present debarred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help feeling that this Bill is a piece of <Col N="647" /> futile legislation.  I quite understand that the Government want to postpone the local elections for many reasons, but it seems to me that we will have three Local Government Bills inside 12 months.  We now have this Bill which puts back the date of the local elections.  It does very little else beyond that.  There are one or two sections which are a little piece of baloney and nothing else.  If we are to have a referendum we must have a Bill for the setting up of the referendum.As well as that, there have been proposals relating to local authorities before the country for the last eight or nine months.  The Minister has been seeking the advice of local authorities and the opinions of people in general.  I was not here to hear the Parliamentary Secretary's opening speech but I gather that he said that in a month's time they will be in a position to make a more definite statement with regard to local authorities.That is another reason for a Bill.  That will be three Bills.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary tell us, when he is replying, what the introduction of a Bill like this actually costs the country?  I understand that legislation passed here accounts for a good deal of expense to the national Exchequer?  It would be no harm for us to know what this piece of futile legislation will cost us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gather that in a month's time the Minister or his Parliamentary Secretary will be in a position to tell us what will happen with regard to local authorities, what local authorities will disappear, what amendments will be carried out to particular constituencies and so forth.  Why could we not have that in this Bill?  Is there any reason why it has not been included?  We have been waiting for a White Paper for seven or eight months now.  Whenever anybody asks the Department of Local Government what they are going to do with regard to local authorities the answer is always the same, that the Financial Resolution has not been introduced and therefore they cannot proceed.  We will obviously have a referendum.  We will obviously have another Bill in the autumn.  We will obviously have another Bill some <Col N="648" /> months later, possibly in the spring. What is the point in this?  We are all here for nothing this evening.  The Minister could have introduced a single line Bill extending the period between local elections to six years or whatever it is.  It was done in this House in my time.  Originally the period for local elections was three years which was much too short.  There was an amending single line Bill introduced which extended this to five years.  Before the last local elections we had a further delay and I think we had a single line amending Bill then, which went through the House in a few minutes, extending it to seven years.  Now we are here with all sorts of promises of electoral reform and no information given to the House.  This is a futile Bill.  I do not think anybody can congratulate the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary or his advisers on the effort they produced here this evening.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond said it is accepted that all the Deputies of this House are in favour of giving votes to people at 18.  In my considered opinion, knowing the inherent conservatism in the Irish race and the lack of desire for change, it is by no means certain that this would go through in a referendum.I suppose it really all depends on whether Fine Gael back the Government or not.  They have only won one referendum in their long and chequered history that I can recollect and that was the last one in which we backed them.  Unless we back them on this issue, which we may very well do, I do not really know, they have not got a hope of getting this through either.  I hope that when the Minister for Local Government or the Parliamentary Secretary comes back again with legislation it will be something in which there is a particle of sense and not a futile effort such as we have here this evening.</P>

      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to postpone for a period of one year the local elections which under existing law are due to be held in June of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By virtue of the Bill being passed, the <Col N="649" /> capital city of this country for at least another year will be without any democratically elected representation.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Dowling was speaking a short while ago he stated what in his opinion led to the dissolution of the Dublin City Council.  I can only say that he views it from a different point of view to the one I would adopt.  In fact, there was no need for the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Boland, to dissolve the Dublin City Council&mdash;there were many alternatives open to him.  The only reason I could see that motivated him to take the action he took was that the Government party had lost control of the Dublin City Council.  They were not in a position to manipulate the council; their membership on the council was in the minority.  Dublin City Council had become a source of tremendous political embarrassment to the Government because of the land speculation that was going on with the consent of the Minister and which was being exposed by the council.</P>
    <P>Time and again before the council was dissolved on the advice of the corporation's technical staff the council had refused applications for planning permission.  They had stated in definite terms the grounds on which permission was refused.  Many of the cases were referred on appeal to the Minister for Local Government and the appeals were upheld.  No explanations were given and people were allowed to speculate in land and in development. I am convinced that was one of the main reasons the city council was dissolved.I am also convinced that because of political reasons the council have not been restored.  This Bill is being introduced to deprive Dublin and Bray of democratically elected local representatives.  What led to the dissolution of Dublin City Council started in 1966&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Parliamentary Secretary's statement the main purpose of the Bill is to postpone the local elections for a period of one year.  I submit I am speaking directly <Col N="650" /> to this Bill because if and when it is passed it will deprive the people of this capital city for at least another year of the opportunity of electing their representatives at local level. I submit that to go into the details regarding the manner in which the people on Dublin City Council took their decision and my interpretation of the further delay in restoring the council is pertinent to this Bill.</P>
      <P>In 1966, the then Minister for Health, the late Deputy O'Malley, made a public promise that no further increases in health charges would be borne by the people of this country and, in particular, by the people of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is on public record.  The Dublin City Council made every effort during a period of three years to see that that promise would be kept.  We saw the Ministers for Health, Local Government, and Finance during that period.  Eventually, before we took action we had a joint meeting with the present Taoiseach, and with the Ministers for Finance, Health and Local Government.  We could not get any assurance that the promise given in 1966 by a Minister on behalf of the Government would be honoured in 1969 or 1970.  Therefore, the majority on the city council took the only action open to them.  We were mindful of the fact that we had gone before the people in 1967 and had given them an undertaking that we would not be the instruments by which this totally unjust an unjustifiable charge and burden would be placed on them.</P>

      <P>With respect, I should like to know how when a Bill whose main purpose is to delay or postpone giving to the people of this city an opportunity of re-electing a city council is before us my argument is outside the scope of this Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary's statement states:</P>

      <P>This led to the people of the city being deprived of their democratic rights by a gentleman who has since shown that he has very little regard for democracy.  The opinion taken at the time by the Minister was that which was most expedient politically for him.  I have no wish to come into conflict with the Chair but there are a number of matters that I could go into, all of which centre around the one subject.  I considered it my responsibility <Col N="653" /> to correct the distortions of the facts as Deputy Dowling tried to give them to the country through this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because, apart from its other merits, it removes disabilities from certain people in the community, people who have been in receipt of public assistance at some stage and who, consequently, could not offer themselves for election to public office.  No such disability should be applied to any citizen.</P>
      <P>I welcome the deferring of the local elections, not because of any doubt on my part as to their outcome but because the Minister has put before the country a White Paper on local government which should be examined closely.  I am sure Deputy Cluskey will agree with me when I say that the time between now and the local elections could be used usefully for the purpose of considering the whole question of local government here.  In other words, we are being afforded a breathing space in which the many changes that are necessary can be considered. I hope that the suggestions and proposals that will be put forward will have the effect of giving us a local government structure that would be fully representative of the people.</P>
      <P>We know that any system of government, whether it be central or local, cannot be perfect.  Therefore, during this extra time that will be available to us, we should apply ourselves to examining the shortcomings of the present system so that when the elections take place next year the people can support the candidates of their choice in the knowledge that those who are returned will have available to them the type of legislation that makes for good government on the local scene.  In deference to the Chair I do not propose to indulge in the reasons for the abolition of Dublin City Council.</P>

      <P>Certainly, we could look at the managerial Act.  If the Deputy reads the White Paper on Local Government he will find there not rules and regulations but much food for thought regarding a re-examination of the whole system.  This White Paper could very well be the basis for a really good system of local government.  It will serve no useful purpose to criticise the Minister's predecessor for what happened in the past.  If any other Minister of this party had been in charge of local government at the time he would have acted in the same way as did the Minister of the day.</P>

      <P>Let us not dwell on the past.  There are many problems relating to local government but we are now being given the opportunity of putting forward suggestions and proposals for improvement.  While I would not be so optimistic as to believe that we can devise a perfect system, we can put forward constructive suggestions that would lead to a better system.  Not only must we consider local government in the context of this city but we must go outside the boundaries of the city and consider <Col N="655" /> what would be the best type of council to ensure that the people of the entire area will have the best possible local government.</P>
      <P>I regret that there is no city council in existence now, but at the same time we must remember that local government in this city did not cease when city councils were abolished.  The existing laws provided for the machinery necessary for local government to be continued.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  The Bill got its Second Reading in the House on 10th November, 1971, and, in view of the length of time which has elapsed, I feel that it might be helpful to Deputies if I recalled very briefly the main outline of the proposals and summarised the principal changes which I propose to recommend in Committee.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for a value-added tax to replace the existing turnover and wholesale taxes at rates which correspond as closely as possible to the rates of the present sales taxes, so that there should be little or no disturbance of the level of prices generally.  The value-added tax differs from a single stage tax, such as the turnover tax or the wholesale tax, in that each stage in the chain of production and distribution, from the manufacturing stage to the retail stage, will be liable to value-added tax at the appropriate rate but, at each step, the tax paid at previous stages is allowed as a deduction against the tax due at that stage, thus ensuring that there is no cumulative effect on final prices.  The rates of value-added tax proposed in the Bill are&mdash;</P>
      <P>5.26 per cent for items such as food, clothing, fuel, medicines, newspapers and periodicals, transport, drink, tobacco and petrol and for most services.</P>
      <P>30.26 per cent for motor cars, television and radio sets, gramophones and records and the other goods at present liable to the higher (20 per cent) rate of wholesale tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>11.11 per cent for dances only, and 16.37 per cent for the balance of <Col N="657" /> goods and services apart from those being zero-rated or exempted.</P>
    <P>In the course of my speech on Second Reading of the Bill I said that a number of minor changes, principally of a drafting nature, had been found to be necessary and that I proposed to introduce amendments for these on Committee Stage.  Since then consultations with the various trading interests concerned have continued.  I have considered carefully all the representations received and have decided on several important changes in the proposals as contained in the Bill.  Official amendments in relation to these changes have already been circulated and I shall move these amendments in connection with the relevant sections, but since certain individual changes will require amendments in more than one section it will, I hope, be of assistance to the House if I give a brief outline of the significant alterations proposed.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it is intended that the tax should commence on 1st November next.  As I have promised trading interests that a preparatory period of three months will be allowed between the enactment of the Bill and the introduction of the tax, it is essential that the Bill should be enacted by the end of July at the latest if the 1st November date is to stand.  It is necessary to delete the commencement date of 1st March, 1972, from the Bill and I have thought it better not to substitute any other date but to provide that the commencement date be fixed by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>In the course of consultations, particularly with manufacturing interests, it has been strongly represented to me that the proposals in the Bill under which the taxable period would be a calendar month and the tax would be payable by the 19th of the following month would cause serious problems in regard to liquidity for some firms. It was suggested that either the taxable period should be increased substantially or that a longer period should be allowed for payment.  In considering what changes should be made I was very conscious of the fact that the yield from VAT will be approximately the same as the yield from the present turnover and wholesale taxes and that, therefore, changes <Col N="658" /> in liquidity should be very much a matter for adjustment between traders themselves.  Any worsening of liquidity at the manufacturing stage is likely to be counterbalanced by an improvement at the wholesale or retail stage.  In those circumstances, since it was not considered feasible to have different taxable periods or different due dates of payment for different classes of persons, I have thought it proper to strike a balance between the position of manufacturers who are requesting total relief for their liquidity problems and the position of many wholesalers and retailers on whom a substantial benefit will be conferred by the change to the VAT system.  I am proposing, therefore, that the taxable period should be increased from one month to two, but that the latest due date for payment, that is the 19th day of the month following the end of the taxable period, should remain unaltered.  This amendment should go a long way towards meeting the problems of manufacturers, and since it will at the same time improve the liquid position of most wholesalers and retailers it should make a considerable contribution towards the stabilising of retail prices.</P>
    <P>The concession in regard to the lengthening of the taxable period will slow down the flow of revenue to the Exchequer and there will also be a once-for-all reduction in yield in the first financial year.  In order to minimise these losses it is essential that tax be paid promptly and I am proposing that there should be a minimum interest charge of £5 for arrears of tax.  The present interest charge of 1 per cent per month has been found in practice to be too small to induce certain traders to keep up to date with their payments. These traders will, in general, have their liquid position substantially improved through the lengthening of the taxable period and it is reasonable that if they default in payment, the interest charge should be sufficiently high to go some way towards meeting the costs of collection.</P>
    <P>There have been further discussions in relation to the effect of VAT on agriculture and I accept that a case has been made for simplifying the provisions relating to unregistered farmers and fishermen.  In this connection, <Col N="659" /> I am proposing two major changes. First, I am proposing amendments to the Second Schedule under which a zero rate of tax will apply to processed animal feeding stuffs, to fertilisers and to fishing nets.  Secondly, I am taking power by order to enable repayment to be made to unregistered farmers of tax suffered in relation to their farm buildings and to fishermen of tax suffered on purchase of their fishing boats. These two concessions will allow reduction to 1 per cent of the flat rates referred to in section 13 of the Bill which unregistered farmers and fishermen may pass on as tax qualifying for credit on their sales to registered customers.This rate will be sufficient to compensate the farmers and fishermen for the tax suffered on the balance of their input costs.</P>
    <P>The zero rating for feeding stuffs and fertilisers will be restricted to sales in units of not less than 10 kilograms which is the equivalent of some 22 lbs.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that I am taking power to enable repayment of tax to persons who fulfil certain conditions and I shall exercise this in circumstances in which it would not be feasible to exempt or zero rate the goods or services on which the tax was charged but in which, nevertheless, it would be right and proper to give relief to the individual to whom the goods or services were supplied.  Examples of the type of case which might merit consideration for treatment under this provision are&mdash;television sets for the deaf, and guide dogs for the blind.</P>
    <P>Apart from this, and to give greater flexibility in the operation of the tax, I propose to take power to reduce by order the rate of tax chargeable on the supply of any particular class of goods or services.</P>
    <P>It has been strongly represented to me that the present rate of sales taxation on caravans and mobile homes and also on yachts, cabin cruisers and other pleasure craft has hampered the development of businesses concerned with the manufacture of these goods, and has had an adverse effect on firms which hire them to tourists during the tourist season.  It has also been argued that the high rate tends to make this <Col N="660" /> aspect of the Irish tourist business uncompetitive.I am satisfied that there is substance in these representations and, consequently, I am proposing that the rate of value-added tax applicable to the sale of these goods should be reduced from 30.26 per cent to 16.37 per cent.  This will also have the effect of eliminating any element of tax which will not qualify for credit in regard to these goods.  Short-term hiring of goods of the type mentioned will, however, continue to be liable at the rate of 5.26 per cent only.  Thus, in the case, say, of a firm engaged in the short-term hiring of cabin cruisers on the Shannon, tax will be charged at the rate of 16.37 per cent on purchase, but this will be allowed in full against the liability of 5.26 per cent on the hire charges of the boats.  The result will be that the only tax effectively suffered will be tax at the rate of 5.26 per cent on the hire charges.</P>
    <P>In introducing a new tax such as VAT, certain transitional problems will inevitably arise and in this connection I have announced that I was considering setting up a consultative council, on lines suggested to me by the Confederation of Irish Industry, to advise me in regard to these problems. I have decided to set up such a body. They will be known as the Advisory Council on the Transition to Value-Added Tax and will be representative of industry, trade, commerce and agriculture as well as of consumers.  The council will operate for a period of three months before and three months after the commencement date of the tax.</P>

      <P>May I say, first of all, that it is useful to have this summary of the changes introduced during this interval but I do not accept one statement of the Minister that through the tax rates being kept as closely as possible to the present sales taxes there will be little or no disturbance in the level of prices generally.  In fact, as I understand it, the Bill has the effect of extending tax to transactions at present not liable to tax.  Finally, I hope in this debate the Minister will have regard to the fact that it is a very complex Bill and it is not at all easy for the layman to understand it.</P>

      <P>This is a most unusual procedure.  I think the Minister has in fact made a number of changes and we are now in the extraordinary position that the Minister has made a Second Reading speech, which we agreed to, on Committee Stage setting out not what is in the Bill but the way he proposes to amend it.  This is a rather extraordinary situation when we are considering the speech made by the Minister in relation to the amendments.  The right thing would be to do what another Minister did before, that is withdraw the Bill and put in something which will contain all the things the Minister considers should be in it.

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 17, after &ldquo;1967&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, and includes a partnership&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="662" /> This is a drafting amendment which is designed to remove any doubt that the term &ldquo;body of persons&rdquo; may not include a partnership.  The main definition is contained in section 1, subsection (1), of the Income Tax Act, 1967, but when the term is used in sections 100 (3), 291 (1) and 371 (7) of that Act it is specifically provided that it includes a partnership.  In these circumstances it is considered that the amendment is necessary to ensure that any reference to &ldquo;body of persons&rdquo; will include a reference to a partnership.It is thought that it is covered but this is primarily to remove any doubt about the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear where the doubt arises.  It is an extremely untidy form of drafting to say that word or words have the same meaning as in another Act and then to go on to state something which casts doubt on that immediately.  If in fact they have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act then it is unnecessary.If, in fact, these words are necessary then it raises the question as to whether they have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act.</P>
      <P>Would it not be much better to state what the meaning of the words is without reference back to another Act? In stating the meaning in clear terms one could then make this point clear. Indeed, if the Minister wishes to leave it in this very untidy form the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; seems to be inappropriate.  The word &ldquo;but&rdquo; would be more to the point.  This purports to be in a sense a variation of the definition in the Income Tax Act.  Unless it is a variation there is no point.  I recognise it is a question of clarifying a doubt but it is not the right way to clarify a doubt.  I would prefer to see &ldquo;either body of persons&rdquo; defined here in whatever meaning the Minister wants to give to it, which is apparently the meaning in the Income Tax Act, but specifically including a partnership rather than in this form.  If he wants to do it in this form, which I am not very happy about, I suggest that the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; is very inappropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <P>I believe this amendment makes confusion more confounded. <Col N="663" /> I am not objecting to it. If the Minister insists on putting it in this way I would not be prepared to vote against it.  I honestly believe it would be much better if the Minister did not proceed with this amendment but put in for the next Stage an amendment which would, as has been suggested, quote the terms in the Income Tax Act, 1967, and add to it: &ldquo;including a partnership&rdquo;.  This would be a far tidier way of dealing with it. Perhaps the Minister might consider this.</P>

      <P>It is a long time since I did any partnership law.  In fact, I never learned a good deal about it but I would say that automatically a body of persons is a partnership.  However, as usual the people who want to be quite certain of what they are doing are the Revenue Commissioners.  I never can understand why it is that so many people can cheat the Revenue Commissioners.  I am told this is brought about quite simply.  They study what is done in England to tidy up things, and then they say: &ldquo;Those fellows have not done it.  Provided we do what they have been doing in England, which has now been tidied up, we can get away with it here.&rdquo;  I do not mind the Minister defining a body of persons as including a partnership.I say that any partnership is a body of persons.  Therefore, it does not follow that any body of persons is a partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point.  I do not think it could be taken that any body of persons is a partnership having regard to the definition of partnership, which, speaking from recollection is the Partnership Act of, I think, 1890.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the basic one. We repealed that and we passed another one here some years ago but it is the same definition basically of a partnership.  The basic difficulty here is that the problem arises in the Income Tax Act of 1967 where it has, as I said, the main definition, in section 1 (1) of that Act.  In the other sections to which I referred it specifically provides that it includes a partnership, not in the main <Col N="664" /> definition.  This is why we have this difficulty here.  I would think we are making the matter clearer by this amendment.  If the House accepts it now, I will undertake between now and the next Stage to look at it again and see if it can be made still clearer on the basis of Deputy Tully's argument.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 27, after &ldquo;development&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;in relation to any land&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments are designed to correct typographical errors.  The amended definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; would be the same as that contained in section 16 (1) of the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, in relation to the charging of income tax on profits from developing land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that it is a necessary clarification.  I am not quite convinced it is a typographical error and my amendment arises out of lines 28 and 29 being so worded as to bring within the ambit of &ldquo;development&rdquo; very small acts such as putting a nail in a wall.  Anything which involves any change of any kind involves an alteration.  Through an error in my case of a semi-typographical nature, I have put the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; in the wrong place.  It should come <Col N="665" /> before &ldquo;alteration&rdquo;.  I am trying to ensure that if somebody makes small changes in a building, of no consequence externally or internally, it should not apply unless there is some substantial change made.</P>
      <P>I do not know how valid or valuable the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; is.  I want to raise with the Minister, however, whether his definition of &ldquo;development&rdquo; is extraordinarily broad.  The section refers to any act which alters the character of the building.  Anything that is attached to it or detached from it is surely an alteration and therefore do we not want to define &ldquo;development&rdquo; as something that has some substantial effect on a building.  Of course, &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; may not be the right word to use and I should like to hear the Minister on it.  I am convinced that &ldquo;alteration&rdquo; unqualified could bring within the ambit of the Bill acts which would be unreasonably small because they would not make any substantial change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel the entire section is too loosely worded for a Finance Bill.  Perhaps if I were to do the job myself I would not do a better one but we must be precise and I do not think either the Minister's or Deputy FitzGerald's amendment tidies the section up sufficiently.  I think that what we need is a new Bill.  Certainly I should not like to try to operate this one and I certainly should not like to be on the receiving end of it, endeavouring to defend somebody who had tried to evade its provisions, because almost anything can be included in the section.  If the Minister has another look at it he may appreciate how terribly loosely worded it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the meaning of the word, without the amendment proposed by Deputy FitzGerald, were as he fears I would agree with him.  It would seem to me that if one were to use the word &ldquo;substantial&rdquo; it would give a more restricted meaning than we have here, and possibly a less definite meaning. The fact that we are using a definition which is used in the Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1968, which is operating at the moment under the <Col N="666" /> income tax code, and because VAT and income tax are to be administered together, there is a great deal to be said for keeping the two together under the one definition.  At least we can then go on the basis that as it is interpreted in relation to income tax so it will be in relation to VAT.  If we depart from that we are going into new territory.</P>
      <P>There is no evidence that I am aware of that under the income tax code this definition as we have it has led to the kind of situations Deputy FitzGerald fears, where the smallest little thing becomes the concern of the Revenue Commissioners.  It does not operate in that way.  Because it does not so operate, I think wisdom lies in sticking with what we know to work in a certain way.</P>

      <P>When one looks at the words immediately underneath, one finds the alternative form of development:</P>
      <P>The carrying out of any engineering or other operation in, or, over, or under the land to adapt it for materially altered use.</P>
      <P>That suggests that the concept of unqualified alteration gives rise to difficulties and that it is necessary to qualify it by the word &ldquo;materially&rdquo;. Where the verb is concerned in paragraph (b) and the noun is concerned in paragraph (a) it seems a similar word should be used.  I may say I should be glad to amend my amendment to include &ldquo;material alteration&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Development&rdquo; in relation to any land involves the land itself.  A great number of other words are put into legislation, buildings and so on.  I am well aware that in legislation &ldquo;land&rdquo; and &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; are interchangeable terms almost, but that is not good legislation because buildings are not the same as land and this is where this kind of thing walks one up the garden path.  Quite frankly I see nothing wrong with:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;development&rdquo; means&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the construction, demolition, extension, alteration or reconstruction of any building on any land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us accept that as being correct, but if you take the Minister's amendment <Col N="667" /> the difficulty is that it suggests that people's minds are attuned to a certain approach.  This approach is not correct, in fact, from a real point of view.  My view of it is that development in relation to land means development of the land.  That means drainage or the cutting out of scrub as happened when men were developing land in the Western Hemisphere or more recently in Australia.  It is not correct to say that development of land is, in fact, building.</P>
    <P>I admit that in this country today it looks like that, but this is not so in relation to any land.  I do not believe that this is an improvement at all. This amendment is not necessary.  I do not agree that, as the Bill is at present, it is really correct, but at least it has not this verbiage in it, which does not add anything to it.</P>

    <P>This amendment ensures that the exemptions for services rendered by <Col N="668" /> local authorities will extend to services rendered by the health boards.

      <P>&ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; means a person who carries on in the State a business of making or assembling goods;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment was necessary to ensure that the provisions of section 15(2) (b) under which goods specified in the Fourth Schedule, motor cars, radios, television sets, <i>et cetera</i>, may be imported tax-free by registered manufacturers, will be confined to persons who manufacture or assemble such goods within the State.  Thus, fully-assembled <Col N="669" /> goods of the kind referred to, imported by an Irish branch of a foreign manufacturer, will be charged tax at the 30.26 per cent rate on importation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me tidier to define &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; in the definition section, rather than to leave it a bit uncertain later on.  I am in agreement with the introduction of the amendment.  I am not happy that there is adequate definition.  It may be that the word &ldquo;making&rdquo;, which is the word the Minister has used&mdash;not the word &ldquo;manufacturing&rdquo; which he used in his statement just now&mdash;has a legal meaning running beyond its common-sense meaning, which would include the concept of &ldquo;processing&rdquo;.  A lot of activity in what is called &ldquo;manufacturing industry&rdquo; consists not just of making things, which involves creative activity, but in processing something, which is not quite the same thing in ordinary language.  It may be that the word &ldquo;making&rdquo; has a legal meaning which includes processing.  I thought it might be desirable to include &ldquo;processing&rdquo; in order to clarify the point, in case at some stage it should be claimed that somebody who is engaged in the processing industry is not a manufacturer, on the grounds that he is neither &ldquo;making&rdquo; nor &ldquo;assembling&rdquo; but &ldquo;processing&rdquo;.  From the point of view of clarification, it may be necessary to include the word, unless the Minister can tell me that it is legally established that &ldquo;making&rdquo; has this sense also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am extending it. I will explain.  The VAT will apply in a special way to manufacturers or assemblers in relation to the goods specified in the Fourth Schedule&mdash; motor cars, television sets, radios. Deputies will remember that there are special arrangements provided for these items, whereby although the 30.26 rate applies to them, 25 per cent of that is trapped and only 5.26 per cent passes on from there.  I do not want to have that special arrangement open to abuse by people who would not in the normal way be envisaged as coming within the categories we have in mind for these goods in the Fourth Schedule.</P>
      <P>If we were to include the word &ldquo;processing&rdquo; it could cause some confusion by bringing within the definition certain wholesalers or retailers who merely perform some service in relation to the goods, as distinct from manufacturing or assembling.  For the particular purposes of this Bill and the special arrangements in relation to the goods at the high rate, I am not anxious to extend the meaning, because some confusion could arise.  We might have to come back again to amend the Bill in order to prevent evasion. That is why I think Deputy FitzGerald's amendment should not be accepted.</P>

There is obviously some technical point which I am missing, and which the Minister has in mind in <Col N="671" /> connection with vehicle assembly. Given that the Bill is intended to cover all forms of adding value, the adding value consists of either manufacturing industrial activity, which involves making, processing or assembling or involves the provision of services.  I am fearful lest there might be some confusion here and lest the Bill might make it possible for somebody engaged in the processing of foodstuffs to argue that he is not making them but processing them and therefore would be exempt from added-value tax or should not have to pay it.  I do not quite understand the Minister's reply, through some defect on my part I am sure because I assume he intended &ldquo;making&rdquo; to cover processing.  Why would one want to exclude food processing, but if you do intend to include it, how is it you are not agreeing to have the word?  Could the Minister explain more fully what he has in mind?  I think he is working on some technical point about vehicle assembly but I was not thinking of that at all but of the broader concept of manufacturing and we are just not <i>ad idem</i> on this.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister help us in this discussion by referring <Col N="672" /> us to where in the Bill the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; is used?  I discovered it when going through the Bill but I seem to have lost it.  The Minister keeps referring to the Fourth Schedule, but in the Fourth Schedule, the word does not appear at all so far as I can see, nor does it appear in the two subsections to which the marginal note refers us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy took up the reference to motor assembly but missed the other references I made. The main items that are concerned in the Fourth Schedule are motor cars, radios and television sets.  There are envisaged in the Bill special arrangements in relation to these items which can be described as the items subject to the highest rate of tax, the 30.26 rate, and these arrangements, broadly speaking, are that the kinds of goods specified in the Fourth Schedule become liable to the 30.26 at the manufacturing or assembly stage, but at the next stage, all that is passed on is the 5.26, the lowest rate, which is the rate on these goods thereafter up the line, so that when they come to the consumer at retail level, they are being dealt with in the same way as all the other main bulk of goods, 5.26.  The balance of 25 per cent has been trapped after the first imposition of the tax at the high rate.  This is a special arrangement which applies to these goods and does not apply to other goods or services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason because this is a special arrangement and brought in mainly for the convenience of the people who will be involved in the trade of these goods, I do not wish to make it easier for people to get in on the benefit, if you like, of this special arrangement, unless in fact they are the people who are concerned with the kind of goods mentioned in the Fourth Schedule.  I believe that the words we use, which are &ldquo;make or assemble&rdquo;, will cover all the kinds of people we envisage in relation to this special arrangement.  That is not to say&mdash;and I appreciate the apparent contradiction which Deputy FitzGerald has touched on&mdash;that the definition excludes processors, but it does mean that it will be more difficult for people to get in on the special arrangement <Col N="673" /> relating to Fourth Schedule goods, unless they are making or assembling. The kinds of goods we are mainly concerned with are motor vehicles, radios and television sets.</P>

      <P>What the Minister is saying&mdash;he has not said it and it would be helpful if he did&mdash;is that the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; occurs in the Bill only in the particular context of the Fourth Schedule.  I think that is what he is trying to say.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  It is true that this is its real relevance.A manufacturer who is a manufacturer of goods other than those in the Fourth Schedule is also involved but on the delivery of the goods and not just because he is a manufacturer. The Deputy is right in saying that the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; has relevance really only in relation to the Fourth Schedule.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I sum up the position?  The word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; only appears once in the Bill and once in the amendment which <Col N="674" /> the Minister wants to incorporate in the Bill.  It is used only in relation to goods contained in the Fourth Schedule and the Minister wishes to define it in relation to those goods.  As those goods are not processed&mdash;as far as one can judge they are either assembled or made&mdash;he wishes to narrow down the meaning of the Bill.  I am not very happy about introducing into any Bill a definition of a word in common use, and in use in other legislation, which is different from the common use and the use in other legislation.  The word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; has a meaning.  It means somebody who makes, processes or assembles.  It is bad drafting to re-define it in this legislation in a narrower sense when it arises only in two sections.</P>
      <P>Contrary to what I have said at the outset, now that I understand what the Minister is trying to do, I think it would be better not to include it in the definition section but simply in the two sections where it will occur when the Minister's amendment No. 69 is adopted, to put in the words &ldquo;make or assemble&rdquo;.  I do not see any advantage in introducing the word &ldquo;manufacturer&rdquo; into the Bill at all.  If it had to be used frequently throughout the Bill, that would be another question. Since it occurs only in two places, to define it in the definition section giving it a special and restrictive meaning which it has not got anywhere else, and an unnatural meaning, rather than simply saying in the two places concerned &ldquo;to make or assemble&rdquo; seems to be the wrong way around.  I withdraw my initial suggestion that it is a good thing to put in the definition section.I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider this and avoid using the word in this very narrow and restrictive sense.</P>

      <P>When I start to discuss anything when Deputy FitzGerald is here, one of my difficulties is that the totality of verbiage which he produces always sinks me.  It is well known in legal matters that if you have a good point you stand on it.  &ldquo;To manufacture&rdquo; means to make by hand. If the Minister sticks to his definition in the definition section.  I see no reason why he should not put in <Col N="675" />&ldquo;manufacturing means making by hand or machinery&rdquo;.  I stand over that. I do not mind what the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners say about it.  It is the right way to do the job.

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), after line 38, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;the specified day&rsquo; means the day appointed by the Minister by order to be the specified day for the purposes of this Act;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, although we are dealing with quite a number of amendments, the matter is quite simple.  What we are suggesting is that, instead of putting in the date which was in the original draft, we should use the expression &ldquo;the specified day&rdquo; and provide that the Minister may by order appoint the specified day for the <Col N="677" /> commencement of the tax.  The only other matter at issue in this discussion is the alternative in the name of Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
    <P>On the question of having a specified day rather than a specific date, as I mentioned earlier, I have undertaken to the trading interests that there will be an interval of three months at least between the enactment of the legislation and the commencement of the tax.  While I know that we can expect full co-operation from all sides of the House, nevertheless, as Deputy FitzGerald said at the beginning, it is a very complex and difficult Bill.  Since previous dates were announced that could not be adhered to, I think it is preferable that we should operate on the basis of a day specified by order after the legislation has been enacted.</P>
    <P>I may say that some people were, and maybe are, of the opinion that this Bill is necessary only because of our impending entry into the EEC.  I have said before, and I want to say again, that if we were never going into the EEC we would be introducing a value-added tax.  The existing turnover and wholesale taxes, which the value-added tax is designed to replace, were introduced on lower rates and on a lower level of operation altogether, and the machinery we used to operate them is being strained very much at present.  The value-added tax would be inevitable even if we were not going into the EEC.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am anxious that it should be enacted and be in operation as soon as possible.  The proposed date for operation is 1st November next but, for the reasons I have mentioned, I think we should do it by way of a specified day appointed by the Minister after the enactment of the legislation.  I would not at all favour any unnecessary postponement of the operation of the value-added tax system which we need urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not made a cogent case for rushing it into effect in November of this year.  I do not advocate in every respect the close harmonisation of our legislation with that of Britain.  Indeed, in a number of instances I have complained about the extent to which we feel an obligation to do this, to a degree which seems to me to be somewhat incompatible with our claim to a cultural identity.  If two countries which have such close economic and trading and social ties are introducing a new tax system at about the same time, for reasons to do with the EEC or otherwise, there seems to be some sense in introducing them on the same day. Because of the disturbance involved here and the extreme complexity of this legislation I have doubts as to whether a period of three months from its enactment is sufficient to prepare people for it.  It has been remarked to me that, considering all the fuss made about decimalisation and the preparations that were made for it to get people to understand it, this is a far more complex measure and there does not seem to be a comparable recognition of the needs to prepare for it.  There are very good reasons for postponing the implementation of this legislation until, first of all, the date round about when it will be necessary from the EEC point of view and, secondly, the date on which it will be brought in in Britain.  I am not very happy with the Minister's suggestion of a specified day combined with the stated intention to bring it in in December next.  Would the Minister, I wonder, reconsider his position in this?  Mark you, we have a great deal of Parliamentary business ahead of us &mdash;the EEC legislation and the Finance Bill, <i>inter alia</i>, and I hope, 15 months or so after its first announcement, the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, plus the Estimates and I am not by any means certain it will get through by then but, even if it is through by then, the longest possible period is required to prepare people for it.  On all these grounds I suggest the Minister should be willing to reconsider his position and be willing to postpone the implementation <Col N="679" /> of this legislation until March of next year.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier, I am by no means convinced the Bill merely provides the same taxes as at present.  In some instances there are differences in the amounts, for various technical reasons. Rather, I should say, there are, for various technical reasons, differences in the amounts.  I must not claim to understand too much about this Bill. In other cases the Bill extends to a range of activities which are not at present covered by turnover and wholesale taxes.  I do not see any particular merit in these circumstances in implementing it in November next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the reasoning behind this.  I can understand the Minister's proposal to bring in a date later on, without mentioning a particular day.  I am in favour of that.  I told the Minister&mdash; he may remember this&mdash;when he mentioned two earlier dates that he had not a hope of getting them.  I was right on both occasions.  He has no hope of being able to introduce this on 1st November.  That is my opinion. I was right twice.  There is no reason why I should not be right a third time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald is, I think, confused.There is no reason why this has to be introduced because Ireland is going into the EEC.  You cannot just change from one foot to the other.  The position simply is that this is being introduced as a device because the Government feel they will be able to screw some extra money under a different guise out of the taxpayers.  I was in the House when the original turnover and wholesale taxes were introduced. We heard all the wonderful promises and we were told the reason why they were introduced; in no case was any attempt made to raise extra taxation but each time, quite accidentally, extra taxation poured in.  It was not the Government's intention at all.  It just came and they could not turn it away. When decimalisation came along it was suggested it was a simple routine matter and it would not have any effect on prices or anything else.  Again, it increased prices and it increased taxation. <Col N="680" /> It increased the revenue to the Government.  Quite honestly, I believe this is just another way of shuffling the cards in the hope that they will come up with a few extra millions.  I believe they will.</P>
    <P>Personally, I do not care what the Minister does about this because I believe, by putting it in this way, he will have the right to designate a day and that day will not be 1st November; therefore, it will have to be further back than 1st November and we will be able to breathe freely a little longer. As far as the date is concerned the Minister will decide on a date.  Why, in the name of all that is good and holy, does he not decide to do it at the end of the financial year because of the chaos which will be created by changing the taxation system?  If, as he says, the effort is to try to balance off&mdash;it will represent the same amount as the other taxes&mdash;why does he not allow it to run to the end of the financial year when he will at least be able to decide what it should take in and work on that basis?  I do not believe it matters two hoots.  The amendment is a sensible one but the reasons the Minister gave were nearly as logical as the ones Deputy FitzGerald gave and both were contradictory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify the EEC position?  I am confused about this.  My understanding is that the obligation of the existing member countries is to introduce this value-added tax by 1st January next, this date having been several times postponed because the introduction of the tax was expected to create problems during a period of rapid inflation&mdash;a very good reason, incidentally, for not introducing it in this country for some time.  In the Treaty of Accession, is it the case that there is some postponement and for how long?  What compulsion are we under to introduce this tax by a certain date?  It may be that I am wrong in thinking there must be legislation here for that purpose and I would be glad to have that clarified.</P>

Of the other nine countries all but Britain and Italy have value-added tax in force. Britain will introduce it on 1st April, 1973.  Italy was due to introduce it on 1st July, 1972, but asked for a postponement to 1st January, 1973, and I understand this has been granted.

I have tried to explain that the machinery designed to do the job with regard to turnover and wholesale taxes was not designed to do the job it is now doing.  On Second Reading I expressed the view that there are many people paying turnover and wholesale taxes who want value-added tax introduced and many people who, if they understood what is involved, would certainly want to see it introduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in order to ensure that people who are managing to evade these taxes would find it far more difficult to do so.  If that were the only reason it would be a good reason for introducing value-added tax.  But there are other good reasons.  From the point of view of a taxation system, it is far more satisfactory than our existing system.What they are doing in Britain is really of no relevance to us.  It is all very well to say that, if they are introducing value-added tax, we should introduce it at the same time.  The fact <Col N="682" /> of the matter is we have had turnover and wholesale taxes in operation here for a number of years and the system we operate is quite different from the British system and is far nearer to value-added tax than their system is. We have operated these two different systems and, when they introduce their value-added tax system, as planned, on 1st April, 1973, it will still, although the value-added tax basic structural system will be the same, be quite different from ours.  There will be a transitional period for all countries before we get together but the question of operating on the same wavelength as Britain in regard to this is much more apparent than real.  It is not really relevant to our purposes.  I think we need this from the point of view of a better tax structure, from the point of view of fairness to those who are paying the existing sales taxes and from the point of view that further postponement would be likely to lead to confusion in the trade.</P>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald thinks that because this Bill is so complex&mdash;and I freely acknowledge that it is&mdash;it will present a great deal of difficulty.  I do not think it will be like that: the actual operation of it is not nearly as difficult as some people think and the fact that the Bill is complex does not mean that the operation of the system is complex.  A great deal of discussions have taken place with various groups and many of them are now much clearer on what is involved and see that the actual system of operation will not be enormously difficult.</P>

      <P>I think we are departing from the subject.  I want to repeat that there is no good reason why we should delay the introduction of the value-added tax further than 1st November next, as has been announced, but in order to take account of the possibility, as Deputy FitzGerald said, of having a heavy parliamentary programme and anything going wrong I think it would be wiser to have an appointed day.  I think Deputy Tully agrees with that.  I feel it is in the country's interest to have this tax rather than put it off.  We shall have certain difficulties I admit, but we shall have them in any case because we are obliged to introduce it.  I think we should try to get these difficulties out of the way and get the tax operating as smoothly as possible for everybody concerned as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we were obliged to introduce this system of taxation at all.  We already had in our turnover tax the equivalent of the value-added tax system.  I was coerced by the reasoning in the first White Paper produced into thinking that this is a superior system to the cascade system, but when I thought it over afterwards I did not find that was so.  It is all right to say you do not add on percentages to the tax under the VAT system but, in fact, you do.  The logic may be all right but the practice is entirely different.  I think the Minister will agree that in quantity as we operate it, that is with taxation on food&mdash;unlike in Britain where they will not tax food; they are 100 per cent right&mdash;our turnover tax has all the merits of this system.  When the Minister says that we are obliged to do this I am not clear whether he was thinking that he was coerced by logic or by the fact that we are going into EEC&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can have it both ways but I want to make this clear, that there is no obligation whatever on us on going into EEC to change our present system.  People may say I am always objecting to new things but on occasions I have been accused, as the Carthaginians were by the Romans, <i>semper desiderant aliquid novae</i>, of always desiring new things. This might seem strange but I have been accused of this.  I believe that in our turnover tax we have everything that is in the other system.</P>
      <P>My objection to it is quite simple. It took years for people, especially those in big business, to become accustomed to operating turnover tax.  When I talk of big business I mean complicated businesses.  They were concerned about it but another group of people were concerned consisting of the ordinary man who conducts his own business and has to do all the work in connection with the turnover tax.  It greatly increased his work for the benefit of the tax-collector and nobody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I put this seriously to the Minister: when I was in the Civil Service I did many jobs and put in a great deal of work that was futile, nugatory; it had no result.  It might well be that the Revenue Commissioners, being lords of the manor controlling their own destiny, so to speak, would object to the amount of work they had put into this.  They have put a great deal of work into it, but I believe and, as Deputy Tully says, we have been told that there are people who are seriously concerned about this change.  They have now got a grip on the wholesale tax and the turnover tax; they understand them and know how to work <Col N="685" /> them.  They have just got control of them and put them into operation and now they must change the whole thing and begin all over again.</P>
    <P>I do not mind what the present Government party think of themselves in regard to being able to modernise the community.  This is not modernising the community; this is just taxcollectors making a damn nuisance of themselves so far as the ordinary taxpayer is concerned.  I do not believe that this change makes any difference. I agree with Deputy Tully that perhaps by changing it around and having different percentages the Government may get a few million pounds more into the Exchequer.  That may be so, but personally, I believe it would have been very much better if we had stood on our own feet and said: we have here the equivalent of your value-added tax and we shall not move away from it.  I do not believe the EEC Commissioners in Brussels would have said &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to us because in fact they have not said &ldquo;boo&rdquo; to the Italians for years.  If we had said that, we would not be disturbing everybody by changing our taxation system when, as the Minister knows, we are getting a great deal of money out of the turnover and wholesale taxes.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in continual changing and making life difficult for people who must earn a living.  It is all right for the Revenue officials who are paid to do this kind of thing, but there are all kinds of other people on whom it is a great burden and particularly small businessmen who do their own work.  They are the people it will affect really seriously.  The big businesses can employ officials as the Revenue Commissioners do and do not have to worry.  They can work any system.  They just get a few people to learn how to operate it and that is that.</P>
    <P>Now that this Bill has been resurrected, I think this is a fair point; I remember saying before Christmas, which is quite a while ago, that it would take the Minister quite some time to get this Bill through the House. I was quite genuine in that; I was not obstructionist&mdash;that was not in my <Col N="686" /> mind at all.  I believe you cannot continually change things.  The turnover tax came in in 1963, wholesale tax in 1966 and now we are jettisoning both in 1972.  This is not a good way to transact the business of the State.  The State should be firm in its purpose and should keep on a straight track.</P>
    <P>A one time leader of the Fianna Fáil Party said: &ldquo;Keep to the straight road&rdquo;.  I believe the State should keep to the straight road.  This business of changing the taxation system in this fashion, unnecessarily&mdash;and I repeat unnecessarily&mdash;may be good from the official point of view, of doing everything in the right way as it appears, but in fact, it is extremely bad from a practical point of view because it upsets all kinds of people.  They cannot conduct their business in the way they would like; they feel pushed around by the State.  In any case they do not feel friendly to the tax-collector but they feel twice as unfriendly when they are pushed around.  They do not know what their obligations are.  They do not know how to carry on their business.  Perhaps it is that I am getting old but I do not feel that this is the correct way to do the thing, especially when there is no need to do it.</P>

I notice he is now talking of 1st November.Was it the case that the 1st March date was fixed because of a relationship to the financial year and a problem of a lag of a month in payments?

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are two factors that come into this.  One is the convenience of business.  At certain times of the year the introduction of this would be more inconvenient than at other times.  It would be inconvenient <Col N="687" /> of course, at any time to change a system but it is more inconvenient at some times than at others. That is one factor.  The other factor is that there is a very substantial revenue significance in which month it commences, whether it is an odd or an even one.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says there are certain times of the year at which it will create less difficulties than at others.  He is most inexplicit as to what the seasonal factors are. The only one that occurs to me is that business is slacker at some periods than at others and, being slacker, people have more time to sit around and consider a new tax system.  If that is what the Minister means he might be more explicit about it.  The slack period of the year is, of course, after Christmas.  This fits in with the fact that he did, in fact, fix 1st March, 1972, originally. November, on the other hand, is coming into one of the busiest periods of the year for business.  Therefore, on his own argument, if it means what it appears to mean, if he is referring to the seasonal ebb and flow, November is a very bad time to introduce it. It means that there is a strong case for leaving it until after Christmas.  I can see that there may be something to do with odd and even months that would enable him to introduce it on 1st March, which is as odd a month as November, if I may put it that way.  All the indications are that it should be on 1st March, which was his own choice in a previous year, as the best time of the year.  He had more or less free choice in choosing a month at that time.  He chose March, for reasons which must have seemed good and sufficient to him, and those reasons must still apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, I have spoken with undue brevity if I have not explained that.  I am arguing for 1st March, the amendment put down by Deputy Tom O'Higgins some time ago.  The more I argue the more convinced I am becoming that I am right on this point.  I would also point out to the Minister that as regards preparing people for this, although he says that it will not be as bad for the average person dealing with this as the Bill might lead one to think, because the Bill is extremely complex, it is, nonetheless, quite a complex change and it will involve businesses in a certain amount of upset.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has admitted this himself.  If, in fact, the Bill does go through in July, I do not think that many businesses will be in a position to start absorbing the Bill and doing anything about it in July and August. That is a period when most people take holidays.  Any educational campaign designed to get the Bill understood cannot really get under way until September.  The Minister is allowing himself only six weeks to two months for preparation.  Again, this is too short from every point of view.  Both in terms of the time needed to prepare people, given that the legislation gets through in July, and in relation to the fact that the Minister himself chose March at the time, for, no doubt, very good and sufficient reasons to do with the slackness of business at that time, for both these reasons, it seems to me the date fixed should be 1st March and therefore our amendment <Col N="689" /> is a wise one.  I would ask the Minister to answer these points.  He has been very vague in talking about some times of the year being better than others.  He should tell us what he means by that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot answer us all at once.  May I just say that it is quite obvious that Deputy Tom O'Higgins in putting down this amendment was doing the rational thing?  He realised the Bill could not come into operation on 1st March, 1972 and said: &ldquo;OK I will put down 1st March, 1973&rdquo;.  I take it that he accepted the Minister's argument that 1st March was put in for some rational reason.  I want in all seriousness to push the point that Deputy Tully made&mdash;why not the beginning of the financial year, 1st April? As near as might be, it is the beginning of the income tax year.  I cannot understand this kind of thing.  The truth is that bureaucrats are all the same.  Untold time spent on the work they are interested in does not bother them at all.  I am afraid that Ministers when they get into the hands of bureaucrats are like putty; they are malleable.  In all seriousness I want to put it to the Minister&mdash;I do not believe it will make a difference&mdash; why not put in 1st April, 1973, instead of 1st March?  The Minister, I suspect, will end up by fixing that date.</P>

      <P>It could quite easily be.  I want to put the question, why not put 1st April, 1973, into the Bill and have done with the thing?  I put it seriously to the Minister that anything that coincides with something else is desirable, especially in relation to a thing like taxation.  Let me explain.I have nothing against the Minister putting in the specified day providing we understand from the Minister that, if this Bill ever comes into operation at all, he will, of course, give plenty of time to people to absorb these extremely complicated matters.</P>

The question of 1st April is affected by an amendment which is coming up which extends the taxable period to two months from one month and the consequence of this and of taking 1st April would be a very substantial loss in revenue.

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), to delete lines 42 and 43, and to substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;taxable period&rsquo; means a period of two months beginning on the first day of January, March, May, July, September or November;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="692" /> This amendment proposes that the taxable period shall be a period of two months instead of the one month originally provided in the Bill.  From the many representations which have been made it is clear that a taxable period of one month would substantially worsen the liquidity position of most manufacturers.  The problem would be most serious for those who traditionally afford credit to their customers for two months or more and who are unable to shorten the credit period without disrupting their trade arrangements.  Such persons would be forced to raise additional working capital in order to finance the operation of value-added tax.</P>
    <P>The problem of liquidity arising on the introduction of value-added tax is one which arises between traders themselves, that is to say, a worsening of liquidity at the manufacturing stage is counterbalanced by an improvement in liquidity at the wholesale or retail stage.  While this is so, I do not think it would be realistic to take the stand that traders should make their own adjustments because a particular manufacturer might find himself in a weak position and unable to resist the demand of his customers that existing credit arrangements should be maintained.On the other hand, since any extension in the taxable period will substantially benefit most retailers and many wholesalers, there is a case for striking a balance in regard to the demands of manufacturers for total relief for their liquidity problems and, on the other hand, the benefits that would be conferred on retailers and many wholesalers.</P>
    <P>A taxable period of three months would meet the manufacturers' problems almost in full but this would, in effect, provide a subsidy of about £15 million for the retail trade at the expense of the State.  In all the circumstances a taxable period of two months represents a reasonable compromise which will, to a large extent, meet the problem of the manufacturers without causing insurmountable problems in regard to State finance and tax yields. For this reason I believe that this amendment goes a long way to meet the difficulty of manufacturers but also <Col N="693" /> has some regard to the requirements of the Exchequer and is, I believe, a fair compromise in face of the problem that looms up in regard to liquidity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what is meant by &ldquo;compromise&rdquo; here because we are not talking about a compromise between two different forces operating on the same person.  The simple fact is that unless this is extended to a period of three months it will create liquidity problems for manufacturers.  It is very little consolation to the manufacturer, already faced with considerable problems of liquidity, possibly, as many manufacturers are in the face of the pressure that is on them at present, to be told that his problems are balanced by benefits accruing to other people who are in quite a different position, to retailers and wholesalers.  We must have regard to the pressures manufacturing industry is under at present, pressures of a kind that do not affect the other sectors in quite the same way.  I know that in every aspect of our economy individual entrepreneurs face difficulties but in industry, where the pressure of wages and costs often bears more hardly than it does in the distribution sector, where increased costs can be more readily passed on, dealing as it is with the domestic market rather than exports which many manufacturers are concerned with, I think there is a special problem.  To add to these problems by imposing a significant and critical burden on industry at this stage seems to me to be a mistake.</P>
      <P>I was given some figures, which I have not got to hand, indicating what the impact would be and I was somewhat alarmed by the scale of the effect, even with the benefit of the Minister's amendment.  I would press that a period of three months should be allowed rather than the two months proposed by the Minister.</P>

      <P>I do not think I can lay my hands on it but I have seen it. If we are speaking of the same document my recollection is that there is one particular firm on it which normally gives credit in excess of six months.  You just cannot deal with the problem like this.  This amendment, which will result in an annual loss to the revenue of about £250,000 goes a long way in meeting the bulk of manufacturers and their problems in this regard.  I do not think it would be reasonable or possible to go any further without creating very considerable revenue problems.  I admit there will be some manufacturers who, while they will be relieved by this, will not be fully relieved of their liquidity problems.  However, most of them will be relieved of most of their problems. It is as far as I can reasonably go, having regard to the various factors involved, not least the question of the yield to the revenue which is involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a slight difference here.  Since the tax is payable at each stage, people who buy goods will be paying to the Minister tax on goods for which they will not be paid for a considerable period afterwards.  The Minister has been making the argument that each stage of tax involved only covers the increase in the value of goods.  However, the person who manufactures and who sells the goods will pay tax.  The person who buys first from him will pay tax on the difference in the value even though the person may have the goods in his store or on his shelves for a considerable period afterwards.</P>
      <P>Unless there can be some type of arrangement made by which goods are not accounted for for a certain period. I can see dreadful difficulties arising with regard to the operation suggested by the Minister.  Some of the people who came to see us&mdash;I think they also saw the Minister and indeed the other political parties&mdash;were perturbed about the effect this might have on them. While bigger firms with substantial overdraft facilities may be able to carry this, it will be difficult for the smaller firm to carry this particular operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taxation is payable on the purchase <Col N="695" /> of the goods.  In addition to the price of the goods they must pay the tax to the person who had the goods previously.This seems to have been overlooked by everyone.  The purchaser is paying the tax on each occasion and he cannot recover that until after he sells the goods.  He carries the price of the goods plus the tax.  He cannot even do what some people are doing at the present time and say he is not putting on the tax&mdash;he will be obliged to put on the tax.  I should like the Minister to clarify what he thinks can be done to avoid this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points I should like to make about this matter. First, so far as retailers are concerned they can opt to pay on a cash basis; that is, they only pay on the basis of receipts.  However, there is an important point here.  Unlike the turnover tax which operates as the Deputy has described, VAT operates on the basis that each two months as the trader is paying tax he is also claiming credit for all tax he pays on his purchases. He is deducting what he has claimed from what he has to pay the revenue. The effect is that he is getting back the tax he has paid in a way he could not do under the turnover tax where he was obliged to wait until he sold the goods.  Now he will get credit from the Revenue Commissioners even though he has not sold the goods. There is a substantial difference in the VAT system as against turnover tax. The case made in representations to Deputy Tully is true in connection with turnover tax but it is not so in connection with VAT.  It is one of the advantages of VAT.</P>

It is only at that stage that he can recover the wholesale tax he has paid.  Under VAT which encompasses both wholesale and turnover tax, he gets back, either by way of refund from the Revenue Commissioners or by deduction from the tax he owes the <Col N="697" /> Revenue Commissioners, all the tax he has paid, irrespective of whether he has sold the goods.</P>

      <P>I have made many representations on this matter to the Minister on behalf of various firms. This is a burning question and may I say to the Minister that he has given me a clear reply?  So far as I can see there is a misunderstanding about this point raised by the three Deputies opposite.  A firm at Clondalkin made the point that they would need more money, that they would have to go to the bank, in order to pay for VAT. I received a letter from the Minister this morning and I am grateful to him for the explanation he has given. There seems to be more misunderstanding about this point than about any other matter in relation to VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  I am still not clear on the Minister's argument.  I think it is a defect in understanding on my part but I have difficulty in following exactly how the retailer is so significantly better off under this arrangement.I can see there is a change in the balance.  The great majority of retailers who are handling foodstuffs which are not covered by wholesale tax are in the position, as are the small retailers, whereby they collect the money at the time of the sale of goods and have the benefit of it until such time as they pay the tax.  Surely the Minister cannot suggest that they will be better off now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The majority of retailers are dealing in foodstuffs that are not subject to wholesale tax.  Surely, then, the majority of them are not involved at all in wholesale tax.  Those people have the benefit of having the tax collected at the time of sale as a source of liquidity for whatever length of time elapses before they pass it on. I cannot see why these people should <Col N="698" /> be better off as a result of this Bill. I can see that there may be some balance of advantage to people who are now paying wholesale tax.  The minority of retailers in that position may be somewhat better off; but when one relates the bulk of retailers not paying wholesale tax to the minority who are paying wholesale tax and the manufacturers, I cannot see how there would be any net balance of advantage as a result of this Bill to the private sector.  It seems to me that the Minister is imposing a very heavy burden on manufacturers, even with the amendment, and that he is imposing a disadvantage on the majority of retailers and may be leaving, no worse off but in some cases marginally better off, a minority of retailers.</P>
      <P>I do not see that this justifies the imposition on manufacturers of the burden proposed because the average credit period in practice for Irish manufacturers is about three months. Of course, there are exceptional cases as suggested by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce in their submissions, for instance, traders dealing with farmers or licensed premises where credit may be required for a much longer period than three months.  Therefore, to the extent that the period being allowed by the Minister is only two months, this will create liquidity problems for manufacturers and they are the sector who, already, are facing great difficulties. It does not seem desirable to put them under further pressure and to do so on the spurious grounds that this is offset by benefits to the retail trade which is of no possible interest to the manufacturer when, in fact, the majority of retailers will be worse off rather than better off, seems to me to be a rather curious argument and one I find very unconvincing.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position a little in case I have misunderstood it.</P>

      <P>On the whole I am in agreement with Deputy FitzGerald on this.  Turnover tax is paid after it has been collected and, as the Deputy has pointed out, there is a delay.  For the ordinary retailer&mdash;I have in mind the man retailing food because food constitutes 40 per cent of total retail sales&mdash;the new system will mean <Col N="699" /> that he will be parting with his money. No matter what is said about the logic of the cascade system, if a man parts with money which has been paid already to the State he has to charge his percentage on it.</P>

      <P>My senior was very kind to me.  Fundamentally, this is a very serious matter because, originally, when value-added tax was referred to in the White Paper, there appeared to be a coercive case, logically, that it was a more rational and fair system than the turnover and wholesale tax system.  However, when one examines this new system, one finds that is not the case.  The Minister is right in so far as are concerned transactions which at present bear wholesale tax but, relatively speaking, they are only a small proportion of the total transactions.</P>

He must part with cash which he only recovers after he has sold the goods.  Deputy Burke may say to me that this puts him in a better position if he had been paying wholesale tax already.  My answer to that is that the bulk of transactions do not bear wholesale tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking of the great bulk of retailers who, according to the Minister, may be handling some goods subject to wholesale tax, but the proportion in the case of the majority of retailers is presumably very small, much smaller than 20 per cent, because in the case of the retailers who are handling a wide range of goods in hardware and so on, it is a very wide proportion of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The overall proportion is aproximately 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="702" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that.  That is not quite the issue.  If at present, over the country as a whole, only 20 per cent of all turnover of the retail sector consists of goods carrying wholesale tax, then for the great bulk of retailers who are, in fact, handling foodstuffs primarily and in some instances foodstuffs and clothing, the proportion in their case must be quite small, because there are a lot of shops obviously dealing in goods all or most of which are covered by wholesale tax.  If you are to have an average of 20 per cent, they must be balanced at the other end by the majority of shops for whom, in fact, only a small proportion, 10 per cent, 5 per cent or even less of turnover is related to wholesale tax.  For these shops the advantage they have at present of getting three to six weeks credit on the turnover tax must outweigh many times over any losses they may have on the very small proportion, 3, 5, 10 or even 20 per cent, of the turnover which relates to wholesale tax.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the great majority of retail concerns, as I was trying to suggest before the Minister tried to take me off on a different track, at present have a benefit which they will no longer have in the same way and to the same extent with this new tax.  Therefore, they will be worse off.  The manufacturers will be worse off and worse off to a considerable extent.  The number of people who will be better off will presumably be confined to that small proportion of retailers, a high percentage of whose turnover consists of goods now carrying wholesale tax and who may secure some net benefit or at any rate not be worse off.  We have narrowed this down to the conclusion the Minister's proposals are ones that will be to the disadvantage of the great majority of retailers and to the disadvantage of all manufacturers.  Proposals of that character which bear so harshly on the vast majority of people in both sectors are ones which this House should examine with great care and be very slow to accept or endorse. Therefore, we should deal with this problem by extending the period by three months rather than two months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> In a sense one can argue that this is all irrelevant, because, as I said at the outset, it does not help the manufacturer much to be told that the retailer is better or worse off.  That is not relevant to him, but in so far as the Minister made the point as an irrelevant argument, that is, irrelevant to the manufacturer, it was a wrong argument anyway, because the vast majority of retailers will be worse off, not better off.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill the Minister is introducing a new tax and abolishing all other taxes.  In the countries in which this tax has been operating, especially Germany and Holland, it has been reasonably satisfactory.If Deputy FitzGerald were Minister for Finance and had to abolish the turnover tax and wholesale tax, what would he put in their place? There has been a misunderstanding about this tax and I was delighted to be here in time to hear this discussion and the Minister's explanation.  If it has succeeded in Germany, where they have had wonderful financiers over the years, even in the days of Hitler, there is no reason why it should not succeed here. The Minister is faced with a very difficult position of trying to meet the requirements of membership of the EEC, and he cannot please everyone. There is difficulty in the fact that some people will be exempted and that the small manufacturers argue that they must have working capital.  This legislation is needed especially when the Minister for Finance is asked to do so much at budget time for our people, to help our industries, and to deal with the capital budget and all the other matters that require attention.</P>

      <P>May I say the same to the Minister?  From the comments of some of his colleagues today it would appear he may be needing a little extra support before very long. Perhaps my comments before this were a little bit uncharitable because this is one of those Bills which I feel is not really a political Bill.  The Government have brought it in and are going to bulldoze it through.  All of us are responsible for trying to have it improved if we possibly can. Possibly it should have been dealt with in the same way as the Income Tax Consolidation Bill was dealt with a few years ago.  It was discussed by a committee outside the House before it was brought in here.  It could have saved us a lot of trouble if this Bill were dealt with in the same way.  Perhaps Deputy Burke might be interested in this.  The Minister has decided to introduce one tax to replace two. The only difference is that the one tax he proposes to introduce is a tax which applies all round.  He is replacing two taxes, one of which applies fairly generally and the other is a fairly specific tax.  How anybody can claim that it is all right to introduce one tax, which will cover everything, to replace two which are not the same at all, is hard to understand.  Might I go back to my original comment to the Minister?  Perhaps he might reconsider this again.  I believe that the taxpayer, <Col N="705" /> the retailer who buys goods and must of necessity pay tax on them, whether he recovers it or not, before he retails them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>He must pay the tax which has been paid by the person who sells the goods to him.  The Minister must admit that that is so.  If somebody buys something at £10 and sells it to somebody else for £12 and there is tax on that, the person who buys the article must pay the tax which has been paid beforehand.  Of course, he can recover that at a later stage, but he is still out of pocket.  If we want to know how many people who are not paying tax now will be caught by this, may I bore the House for a few minutes with a very brief comment on those who are exempt from turnover tax?  Deputy O'Donovan said that those articles exempt from the turnover tax include agriculture plant, machinery equipment, basic building materials, commercial fishing gear, certain heavy plant machinery used in buildings, machinery plant used in transport, seeds, fertilisers, animal feeding stuffs, similar agricultural goods, tractors, lorries and so on and a lot of building materials, food, drink, medicines, other articles of a medical and spiritual nature, clothing, cloth and yarn, sole and upper leather, fuel, hydrocarbon oils, spare parts and accessories for all sorts of motor vehicles, accounting machines and equipment, books, tobacco and motor cars.  With an exemption list such as that, how anybody can claim that it does not make any difference that these people will now be included for tax purposes is something I cannot understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave certain figures to the House of the number of people paying tax, the number of people collecting tax.  Surely the volume is what is important here, the amount of goods that carries tax, the percentage of the total which carries tax at the <Col N="706" /> present time and which will in the future carry tax.  The Minister says that it is estimated it will bring in the same amount, but I do not think that is so.  I believe the Minister's own argument proves that it will bring in very much more and in the process of bringing it in I can see a number of reasonably small retailers being squeezed out of existence.  Not enough attention has been given to this by those who frame the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I might give an example of what I was referring to earlier, the McKenna duties.  These duties were imposed by Mr. Reginald McKenna in 1916, during the first World War.  That is a long time ago but we still collect them here&mdash;that is subject to correction&mdash;on parts of motor cars which are imported.  In fact we collect on parts which go into the manufacture of motor cars.  This is a cause of complaint by manufacturers.The rate is 22 2/9 per cent.  That has been the position for 56 years.</P>
      <P>The turnover tax came into operation in this country, and did not come into operation in either Northern Ireland or Great Britain, at the beginning of 1964.  The legislation was passed at the end of 1963.  The legislation covering the wholesale tax was passed in 1966 and the tax came into operation at the beginning of 1967.  I would feel sore if I was a businessman that a few years after changing this whole system another very complicated system is introduced.  A value-added system of taxation is extremely complicated.I am not saying that, give it five or six years, it will not resolve itself, that we will get used to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of adverse comment on this tax when it was first introduced into the EEC.  Since we had the turnover tax system, why are we changing it now?  In Britain they might as well introduce the value-added tax because they have no turnover tax system, but we are not in that position. We have already what I presume the Minister and his officials would call a sophisticated tax system.  I do not understand why we should push everybody around to comply with a very complex EEC system of taxation.  I do <Col N="707" /> not believe the EEC people would object to us continuing our present system and therefore I cannot understand why we should have this new system of tax.</P>
    <P>I know a great deal of hard work has gone into all this, but the people who did all this work have been paid for it.  They got as good a remuneration for it, whether it goes into operation or not, although they may get more satisfaction out of their work if it goes into operation.  I can see no advantage in introducing this new system of taxation and changing from our present system of turnover tax and wholesale tax which our business people and our manufacturers have only just absorbed.  I could quote instances of manufacturers who have got themselves just right at the end of last year and now they are faced with a completely new system of taxation.  These are the people the Minister is talking about who are subject to wholesale tax and retail tax.</P>
    <P>The turnover tax system was ideal, as the Minister for Finance said in the House at that time.  All that was really needed was a bank statement.  You showed what you had paid into the bank and you paid tax on that.  This was easy from the point of view of the retailer, assuming he did not draw any money out and lodged all he had taken in.  It was very complicated for certain other people.  When you have got people used to doing something one way it is a very bad business for no good reason to change the system.  My colleague, Deputy Tully, pointed out that it does not matter what veneer the Minister puts on it: he expects to get more money out of this new system than he gets from the present system of tax.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to this debate for the last 20 minutes on this particular subject.  Deputy Burke has suggested that there may be <Col N="708" /> some misunderstanding between one side of the House and the other.  Any small trader who has read the Bill will not have any misunderstanding about it.  He will be in difficulties if this Bill comes into operation in its present form.  In the last ten minutes the Minister admitted that while there is some advantage in that for many traders, for 80 per cent of the turnover trade there is disadvantage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We had some peculiar arguments from Ministers who did not know what they were talking about.  We made it clear that the obligation was binding on us&mdash;that there is a specific obligation on us in regard to VAT because our present system is incompatible with EEC requirements.This should be said lest Deputy O'Donovan should try to convince people that the EEC is less onerous than it is.  Of course Deputy Burke's warm human sympathy overflowed for the Minister because he felt there would be very little revenue flowing in the early days of the operation <Col N="709" /> of VAT.  The effect of this Bill, whatever its immediate impact will be, will be to increase tax revenue because it extends taxation to transactions not now covered.  The Revenue Commissioners, in submitting material to the Parliamentary draftsmen, ensured that nobody now taxed would escape and that tax would be extended to many not now taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. There would be less tax in some areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to be so enlightened but the Minister might tell us who will be less heavily taxed in the future.  My impression is that quite a significant number of things not now taxed will be taxed. There will be a tightening up in regard to evasion, which is a good thing, but the Bill extends tax to areas not now covered.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke, in expressing sympathy with the Minister because he might lose in the first month, ignored the long term result to the Exchequer.  The Minister should accept this three month proposal because in not doing so he is creating a real problem for the manufacturing sector and possibly other sectors of the community.  This has been fully realised in Britain in the White Paper attached to the Bill there because the standard period is three months, with a month's grace.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 10, which I hope I will be allowed to discuss at this point, I should like to say there is a further aspect of the British system which from the Minister's point of view should be introduced here.  There, the accounting periods will be so allocated that onethird of the three month period would be returnable once a month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here the Minister proposes to collect tax every two months and everybody is due to pay it at the one period of the two months.  This will lead to an uneven flow of work in the Department and it will lead to an uneven flow of revenue.  My amendment is designed in part to assist the Minister by defining the taxable period as three months, commencing at such times as may be determined under regulations by the Minister.  The Minister's wording is a period of two months beginning <Col N="710" /> on the first day of January, March, May, July, September or November, thereby tying himself to this timetable and to a fluctuating pattern which could mean an overburdening of work at one period and too little at another period, whereas a three month period as in Britain, which has a much stronger industrial structure than our fragile one, would mean a more even flow of work with consequent advantages.  The Minister has not done that and although the problem is somewhat less acute in a two-month cycle than a three month one, nevertheless there is much to be said for having the latter, which would allow the Minister to determine that certain taxpayers would pay the tax in one month and others in another.</P>
    <P>The Minister's original proposal was for a period of a month.  If such a period operated he could have envisaged a system of operation in which staff would be able to get the job done within the month and get ready for the next month.  Without making pro-vision to stagger the two months, it seems to me entirely correct to say that an uneven flow of work will ensue.We have argued cogently on this side for a three month period and I cannot see why the Minister will not accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I considered the question of splitting the payments but found that although there were certain advantages, the disadvantages outweighed them.  Deputy FitzGerald has spoken three times since I last spoke and he seems to have convinced himself that there are no advantages under VAT to the bulk of retailers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>He is mistaken for a number of reasons.  When he tells us that even the two monthly taxable period I am proposing will mean that a great many manufacturers will be in difficulties, what he is saying in effect is that a great many manufacturers will have to extend credit to wholesalers or to retailers over and above two months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is true it means a great many wholesalers and retailers will be in the position that as soon as they have been invoiced for the goods supplied to them, they get credit for the tax they have paid, but they will not actually have to pay for the goods or for the tax which they collect for at least two months.  I wonder if Deputy FitzGerald follows the point I am making?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy FitzGerald will see that to the extent that his argument is true about difficulties for manufacturers, he is establishing that correspondingly there are advantages to wholesalers and retailers, which is a point I was making earlier.  I do not think Deputy FitzGerald has realised that one of the features of a VAT system is that so far as retailers are concerned they are, under that system, going to be in a position to claim credit against their tax liability for items for which they cannot claim credit at the moment.  For instance, on such things as wrapping paper, scales, or new fitments they pay tax at present and they do not recover it. Under the VAT system, they can recover the tax element in any of these things on which they pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that apply to cash registers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It applies on all items necessary for their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>How often do they pay for them?  They will all be buying new ones now because although they have just changed over to decimals they will have to change again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether on fixed or current outgoings, they will be able to recover in full the tax which they have paid on these items, which they cannot do at the moment.  Furthermore, as I pointed out, to the extent that they get credit over and above the time they have to pay the tax, they have that much use of the money concerned. <Col N="712" /> Under the VAT system, as soon as the trader gets an invoice he gets credit immediately for the tax which he has paid, and thereafter the goods which he has, he has them at tax-free cost. If they remain unsold he has them at tax-free cost.  Although we have been arguing about the percentage of goods in which wholesale tax is involved, the fact is that for the vast majority of retailers&mdash;some to a great extent, some to a small extent, but almost all to some extent&mdash;there is at the moment involved for them the question of having to pay wholesale tax in the price which they pay for their goods, on such items as are subject to wholesale tax.  Until they have sold those goods they do not recover the wholesale tax which they have paid out.  Under the VAT system this will not be so.  They will recover in full, on receipt of an invoice for the goods, credit for all the tax they have paid, whether it is the equivalent of the wholesale tax or the turnover tax.  They will get that, irrespective of whether they have sold the goods themselves or not.  It is quite clear, if one examines this situation, that there are considerable advantages which can accrue to wholesalers and retailers under the VAT system.  If one takes into account especially the fact that it is now proposed to increase the taxable period from one month to two months, one can see that there is a considerable amount in additional liquidity, to put it no higher than that, for wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it seems to me that the argument which I have made for this amendment which is primarily designed to relieve manufacturers but, in fact, has the effect of being a bonus for wholesalers and most retailers certainly&mdash;this is the effect of it&mdash;has another affect which is to affect the income of the Exchequer.  I believe, as I said earlier, having regard to all these factors that the two-monthly period is a reasonable approach to this problem.  If it is said that it is not an answer to the manufacturers' problem, I think this is not true.  It is the answer to most of the problem of most of the manufacturers.To the extent that it is not, then whatever about the situation of the manufacturers who do not benefit, <Col N="713" /> the extent to which a problem remains is a measure of the benefit accruing to wholesalers and retailers.</P>
    <P>That, as Deputy FitzGerald says, may not be much consolation to the manufacturers concerned, but at least let it be recognised that this is so.  We should not imagine that what we are doing is of no benefit, or very little benefit, to wholesalers and retailers and of considerable difficulty to manufacturers, which is more or less how Deputy FitzGerald presented it. This, in fact, is not so.</P>

      <P>From a long-term point of view and in this sense I use the words &ldquo;a year or two&rdquo;, because I am not talking about ten years, it makes no difference whatever to the Exchequer whether it be every two or three months.  I would admit that if you fix any system, for the first short period it makes a difference to you. We have had a good example of this in this country.  We pay ESB bills every two months, gas bills every three months and telephone bills every three months.  I seem to get bills that I pay every three months as frequently as the ones I pay every two months.</P>

To use an expression I do not like, the cash flow will be even, through time.  It will make no difference.  I will admit that it will make a difference in the initial period, sbut once you are in it it will not do so. This is one of the difficulties I see about all modern, trendy thinking.  We are always involved in this kind of thing.  What is the immediate effect? I am quite prepared to admit that the revenue will be out of money for a month in the first instance, but after that it is going to be an even flow and it does not matter whether it comes in every two months or every three months, once you are over the initial period.</P>

      <P>If it be a serious point, and I assume that people engaged in business do regard it as a serious matter, I cannot see why the Revenue Commissioners cannot accept this once for all loss, as the Minister calls it.  Frankly, it is not worth talking about.

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I accept that a Bill like this is very complicated and there are many other sections of it on which I will have something different to say, but this is a section which I welcome from the point of view of the wholesale and the retail trade.  We have an extension from one month to two months.  At the moment turnover tax is accountable every month and I believe that this additional month will be an advantage to the retail and the wholesale trade.  I am not altogether sure that too lengthy a period would be a good thing for any trade and I doubt if I would welcome it myself&mdash;having turnover tax over four or five months and being faced then with an enormous bill for which one might not have the money.  This period of two months is reasonable and I welcome it. It gives wholesalers and retailers an advantage as against the present system.  It may not be to the same advantage of the manufacturers but I doubt if they will be very much out of pocket in their liquid cash.  The whole system of the Bill in this regard will give an advantage in that we can claim back on fittings and other expenses incurred in the day-to-day running of a business, whether they be bottles, corks or glasses.  It was not possible to claim wholesale tax back on these but now it will be an advantage to the retail and wholesale trade.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that where wholesale tax is charged it will be possible to claim the credit back, and I know this is so but how long will this take&mdash;from the time we get the invoice, which I presume is 15th of the following month, and this must be submitted then to the Revenue Commissioners for a refund.  Will there be a long delay here?  How is this credit operated?  When wholesale tax is charged to the retailer, it will be charged in the invoice, I presume.</P>

A retailer buys £100 worth of goods in month one and sells those goods a month or so later for £120, but because of the tax element he sells them for £126, turnover tax at 5 per cent having to be paid, so that he receives £126 in month two for what he bought but did not pay for in month one.  He then has to pay his turnover tax and I take it he will pay it about a month later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but if I am wrong in my timing because of lack of experience of the practical working of it, I shall be glad to be put right. About a month after he sells the goods, he has to pay the tax.  It looks to me about three weeks in the typical case, looking at the cyclical pattern of the figures paid to the Exchequer week by week.  He has to pay £6 in month three and with three months credit, has to pay for the goods originally bought in month four and he pays £100.  That seems to be the typical present pattern. Think in terms now of the new tax&mdash; buying the goods in one month and selling them the next month.  At that stage he recovers what he paid for them with his profit margin of about 20 per cent, and he will have to recover another £5 at that point&mdash;will he?  I am afraid I am in difficulty in working it out.  He must charge the same amount if he is going to pay the same amount of tax and he has to charge £126 to whomever he sells to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Recovering from the Revenue Commissioners that portion of tax that was on the goods before he bought them.  I am sorry I have got this wrong.  Let us start again. He pays £105 for the goods now&mdash;is that the position&mdash;including the tax which was borne at previous stages. Then he sells them a month later for £126 and recovers around the same time the £5 tax which had previously been paid.  Then he has to pay his own tax on the Minister's scheme two months later.  He has to pay £6 tax and he has to pay, at that stage, in month four, to the person from whom he <Col N="718" /> bought the goods, the wholesaler or manufacturer, the £100 due.  Is that roughly the position?  Have I got it right?</P>
      <P>Let us recapitulate.  In month one he pays £105 whereas at the moment he pays £100.  He is out of £5 at that stage compared with his present position.The next month he gets £126 by selling the goods and he gets back the £5 tax he paid, so that restores his position.  He has been out of £5 for one month which he would not have been out but for this system.  At the end of that month he is back in the position he was in before.  He then has two months in which to pay the tax whereas, under the present system, he might have got one month in which to pay it, so he has the benefit of £6 for one month longer but he has been out £5 for one month previously.</P>
      <P>The benefit to me seems to be extraordinarly marginal.  The net benefit to him is to have available to him £1 which he would not otherwise have had for a period of one extra month.  This does not seem to me to be an enormous benefit, if I understand the system correctly.  I wonder is the Minister not exaggerating the benefits to retailers involved in a typical case?  It may be that I have misunderstood it or got it wrong.  I am open to correction but that is the position as I see it: the net benefit in a typical case of £100 worth of goods is that the retailer might have £1 extra for one month extra in credit.  That will not get him very far. Compare that with the problem of the manufacturer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking of a typical case of credit for three months.  We are told by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, in their submission, that the typical credit period is about three months.  It is on that basis that this amendment is put down and it is on that basis that the British have allowed three months.  What I am trying to establish factually at this point is what exactly is the kind of benefit the average retailer will get by comparison with his present situation as a result of this Bill because the Minister has been extolling this benefit and telling us the difference it will make.</P>
      <P>I may be quite wrong but my impression is that on a £100 transaction with three months credit the net benefit to a retailer is that he is out of £5 that he would not have been out of for a month during the first month, and he has the benefit of £6 for two months instead of one month once he has sold the goods and is waiting to pay for them.  Therefore he has a net £1 for one month longer, if I have got it right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>He has it for two months but he would have had it for one month anyway.  He has £1 extra for one month longer.  By comparison with that the manufacturer surely is out of £5 for an extra month.  Again I am open to correction.  The Minister is giving him two months to pay but, in fact, it is a three months period and he will be out of that £5 for one month.  If I am right in that, and I may not be, it seems that any benefit to the retailer is tiny compared with the loss to the manufacturer.  If I am right I do not think the Minister is giving a very fair picture of the equation between the loss in one case and the gain in the other.  As I say, I may have misunderstood it.  I should like to give the Minister a chance of clarifying the point and of putting me right if I am wrong in my notional example, or if there is any basic fallacy in my thinking.</P>

I would have thought that having bought the goods but paid nothing for them he would recover £5 tax a month later by sending in invoices.  In the second month, which I call month two, that is one month after the transaction started, in month two as against month one, he would get £5 back.  In that same month he sells the goods for £126.  He then has to pay the supplier and pay his tax.  Am I right in thinking he pays the tax?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to compare them. I said that under the present system in month two he would pay £6 tax.  Under the value-added tax system in month two he would pay £1 tax.  He would be due to pay £6 but he would be claiming a credit of £5, not having paid it but having been invoiced for it but, having been invoiced for it, he would claim it as a credit and then in month three on the assumption of three months credit he would pay £5 to the supplier.  This would have been the credit he would have claimed in month two although, in fact, he did not have to pay it until month three.  Does Deputy FitzGerald follow that?

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not tally at all.  The Dublin Chamber of Commerce says the general average and normal credit period would be about three months.  The Deputy says that goods purchased and received between 1st and 31st January&mdash;therefore, on average mid-January&mdash;would actually have to be paid for between the end of February and mid-March&mdash;say, a quarter of the way through March. That is a credit period of one and three quarter months, not three months. I defer to the Deputy's experience.  I have none.  But I am puzzled by the divergence in his picture and that of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>So we are, and amendment No. 10 and many others. The problem we are discussing is primarily that of the Irish manufacturer faced with a situation of a three months' credit period in which he will have to pay his tax in two months.  The situation may be different for wholesalers.We can discuss that later.  The case we have been discussing is the problem of Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was also discussing whether there was any benefit for wholesalers in this.  He is, I think, beginning to see that there is something in what I was saying.  I was reassuring him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In effect, you are not paying the 5 per cent passed on until two months later when you are submitting your turnover tax, which will now be value-added tax.  There is an advantage there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is taking a more realistic case, which is that of the wholesaler who is the collector.I was taking a somewhat simpler case, a case I would have some hope of understanding, but I am still not entirely clear why there is such an advantage to the retailer.  The Minister has given me some indications of some possible advantages, but I am by no <Col N="725" /> means entirely clear about this and I would like some further clarification before conceding the point.  The problem we are concerned with is the adverse effect on the Irish manufacturer.Unless, in some peculiar way, the retailer will finance the manufacturer by extending credit backwards to him, I do not see what advantage it will be to the manufacturer to be told that the retailer is going to be more liquid.  I do not see how the benefits of that liquidity will accrue to the manufacturer except by a shortening of the period extended by the manufacturer to the retailer.  Perhaps that will be one of the benefits, but I am not sure that it is what we want to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did refer to this.  It would be unrealistic to expect the manufacturer would simply shorten the period, whether it was the wholesaler or retailer he was supplying, because he was getting a better liquid position. This will, I think, happen in some areas, but there will be some areas in which the manufacturer will not be in a position to do this because the competition will be too great and a customer who is told: &ldquo;We are cutting down your credit period&rdquo; will simply say: &ldquo;We will deal with someone else who is not cutting it down.&rdquo;  I recognise this; I said so at the outset.  The point is I do not think we should take it that the average credit period extended by manufacturers is three months.  If that was the case they made to Deputy FitzGerald&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, as I said earlier, there are some cases in which it is six months.  In one case it is nine months. But these are exceptional cases and cannot be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  Might I say there is a certain confirmation of that in the Act that the British have; they allowed three months?  I doubt if the British are allowing more than is necessary to ensure liquidity and if they <Col N="726" /> have, with a much stronger industrial sector, allowed three months, I cannot see the wisdom of our making it two months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of delay in getting cash in.  If he has to wait three months for it, does that mean an extra month's shortage of revenue? Surely, so long as you establish a pattern, then if you get the money within the financial year, deciding how to expend it is simply a question of book-keeping.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one.  The other aspect is that you have a continuing loss which depends on the extent, whether it is one month, two months or three months.  On the present basis of two-monthly periods as against the present monthly period, this will give us an annual loss of about £250,000 because of the slower flow of tax revenue.  In effect, it is the interest on the money.  That is a continuing loss and, of course, it is bigger if the period is three months.  You have this permanent loss all the time and you have a once for all loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that once the Minister has the system going, he is paid for every month but his problem is that there is an initial loss because of the postponement of the additional month for receiving money.  He is changing the system and in the beginning he is out of revenue for one month.  He has to borrow as a result of that and that borrowing would have to be remunerated over the continuing period thereafter.  But we must not double-count this.</P>

Therefore, the conclusion from the hypothesis does not seem to me to follow.  In fact, the Minister himself mentioned a figure of £250,000.  If the figure of interest cost is £250,000, at a reasonable rate of interest at the present time, that suggests being out of about £3 million, which is a great deal less than one month's proceeds of wholesale and turnover tax. It is only about half the proceeds.  This suggests that the Minister thinks he will be out of a fortnight's tax, not a month's tax.

It must occur the first time.  It is once for all.  It does not occur again.  It cannot occur again.  If it were three monthly periods, which I thought at first we were talking about, instead of two monthly, it would mean that there would be a break of one <Col N="732" /> month in each series but once it starts it is being paid every month.  There must be a return every month, even though it is three months behind.  There is only one loss and that is the first one. At least, that is as I see it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I believe it will be continuous.  Let us take a round figure of £6 million.  At the moment we pay it monthly.  Now it will be two monthly.  Deputy FitzGerald has an amendment suggesting three months.  In February there is £6 million due, assuming £6 million is owed for January.  Deputy FitzGerald wants it extended to February and March.  There is £6 million for February, £6 million for March.  Will that ever be recovered?  It will be recovered, but three months later.  That is continuing all the time.  It will be always three months later.  There is bound to be interest accruing.</P>

      <P>Perhaps what we have forgotten is this: Deputies may be thinking as though there was a trader who was one month late with his cheques but he pays it up one month late and that is the end of it.  That is <Col N="733" /> the way they are thinking.  That is not, in fact, what is happening.  Remember, at the moment the tax is paid at the end of every month.  If we make this at the end of a two-monthly period it means that in every two monthly period there is a month's tax late.  If it is a two-monthly accounting period, you have, in fact, got six months revenue one month late and if it is a three monthly accounting period you have a year's revenue one month late, because it continues in each taxable period.  If the Deputies go home and put it down on paper they will see it.</P>
