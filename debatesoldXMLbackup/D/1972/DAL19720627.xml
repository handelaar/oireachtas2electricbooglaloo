    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation at present but, as the Deputy is probably aware, the Commission operate in GATT matters on behalf of the Community under directives of the Council of Ministers.  At present the four acceding countries are in consultation with the existing member countries about the positions of the <Col N="2" /> four acceding countries in relation to GATT when they join.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The best way we can mark the accession of Ireland to the EEC is to provide some of the additional employment that was promised during the campaign.  Providing jobs in the Taoiseach's county of Cork and in my own little district would be the best way of marking our accession into the EEC.  That would be the best way of opening up something down in south-west Cork and we would have a big day.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Population of Connacht.</Title>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara  Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. O'Hara</b> asked the Taoiseach if he will state in respect of the province of Connacht (a) the population in 1956, (b) the population at the latest available date, (c) the decrease in population during those years, (d) the percentage decrease, (e) the number of jobs created in industry since 1956 and (f) the action the Government propose taking to provide work for people in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The population of Connacht according to the 1956 census of population was 446,221 and the corresponding population in 1971 was 389,763, representing a decrease of 56,458 or 12.7 per cent.  As I indicated in reply to questions on the 27th October, 1971, the decrease in population in the five years to 1971 was the smallest percentage decline in any inter-censal period since the beginning of the present century.</P>
      <P>The number of jobs created in industry in the province since 1956 is approximately 7,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="4" /> Continued operation of the special measures for western development contained in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development is being ensured by the Government so far as the province of Connacht is concerned.  In pursuance of that policy, county development teams were established in the 13 western counties&mdash;including the five Connacht counties.  To assist the teams in this work, the Government established the Special Development Fund in 1967. Commitments from the fund to date exceed £2 million of which £897,000 relates to the five Connacht counties. Help has been provided for small farmers and handcraft co-operatives, local airports, miscellaneous tourist projects, <i>et cetera.</i> In addition, assistance has been given to firms which were in danger of closing down but which had a reasonable prospect of survival if given immediate aid.  The fund is used in circumstances of distress or opportunity and is proving to be an effective instrument in promoting and maintaining the economic well-being of Connacht.</P>
    <P>In the industrial grants scheme of the Industrial Development Authority, there is a substantial differential&mdash;60 per cent as against 45 per cent of fixed assets elsewhere&mdash;in the industrial grants scheme in favour of the designated areas, which include the province of Connacht.  The authority's programme of promoting regional industrial development involved the setting up, last year, of regional offices in Galway and Sligo to promote industrial development in the Galway/ Mayo and Sligo/Leitrim regions, respectively, and in Athlone to cater for the Midlands region which includes Roscommon.  The authority, as part of their interim advance factory programme, propose to construct 11 advance factories in Connacht.  In this connection, the authority have set a target of 7,550 extra jobs for the province.</P>
    <P>A number of resorts and resort areas selected by Bord Fáilte for development under the major resort development scheme are either in or adjoin Connacht counties.  So far, out of a total expenditure of £3.2 million by <Col N="5" /> Bord Fáilte on major resort development over £1 million has been spent in Connacht.  In addition cash grants amounting to £1.6 million have been promoted by Bord Fáilte for the development of hotels, guesthouses <i>et cetera</i> in the province.  Among the projects assisted by these grants, were 42 new hotels with 1,300 bedrooms and extensions to existing hotels involving a total of 2,000 bedrooms.  Over 3,300 persons are employed in hotels in Connacht in the peak season and half of this employment is attributable to the foregoing grants.</P>
    <P>Since 1956, the expansion of the ESB generation, transmission and distributive schemes have resulted in about 300 additional jobs, with anticipated increases in future&mdash;including about 150 additional jobs resulting from the development of milled peat for electricity generation in Galway.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasOHara" hpid="Mr. O'Hara Mr. O'Hara">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach not agree that the figures he has given to the House reveal an alarming situation in the whole province of Connacht? Is it not true that on numerous occasions I have brought these facts to the notice of the Taoiseach?  Even at this 11th hour, will the Taoiseach not wake up and realise that it is absolutely necessary to tackle this problem, to regard it as a state of emergency, so that the decline in population will not continue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no illusions about the seriousness of the problem but as I indicated to the Deputy on previous occasions, the best solution is a planned one and not a panic or crash programme.  The planned solution is now beginning to show results because, as I have indicated in my reply, the percentage decline in the population of Connacht is now much less than what it was, for example, during the term of the last Coalition Government.  In fact, it is now only one quarter of the decline experienced then.  I acknowledge the Deputy's interest in this problem.  He has raised it here on many occasions but he will appreciate that every time he raises it, there is progress to be reported.</P>

I intend to end this restriction for appointments as public health nurse and for other appointments under health boards as soon as I am satisfied, as the result of these inquiries, that to do so in advance of those other sectors, for some of which legislation for the change would be required, will not give rise to any serious anomalies.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power whether Bord Fáilte have carried out any recent survey into the causes of the present serious situation in the tourist industry; and, if so, what the findings are; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte publish, on a monthly basis, a tourism intelligence report which gives the results of a survey covering business in hotels and guesthouses in the previous month and the state of advance bookings for the next two months, together with reactions in each overseas market area.  The latest report available covers actual business in May, 1972, and advance bookings for June and July.  The report indicates a decrease in business and bookings in approximately 66 per cent of hotels and guesthouses compared with the corresponding months last year; the remaining 34 per cent have shown an increase or have maintained last year's level of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="11" /> As part of this survey, hoteliers and guesthouse proprietors who reported a decrease in business or bookings were asked to comment on what, in their opinion, were the adverse factors which occasioned this.  The fall-off in British and Northern Ireland business due to the Northern Ireland troubles was the adverse factor most frequently referred to by hoteliers and guesthouse proprietors.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the weekend Bord Fáilte carried out a very desirable experiment by bringing to this country members of a prestigious London tourism travel club and that, judging from the reports of the reactions of these people, they were agreeably surprised to find that many of the fears which their potential customers in Britain held regarding holidays in Ireland were groundless?  Would the Minister consider bringing over a group of the top level travel writers from the British newspapers and people from selected groups of travel agents?  This would be a great help at this stage.</P>

      <P>I discussed the contents of the submission with representatives of the federation on 27th March, 1972, and subsequently conveyed the submission to Bord Fáilte.  It has already been decided to provide an additional amount of £500,000 in the current year, as an exceptional measure, to meet the cost of special amenity works at tourist resorts throughout the country. Bord Fáilte have substantially increased their promotional budget in those markets likely to prove most responsive at the present time, particularly the European market and the ethnic markets in Britain and North America.  The board have had discussions with the federation about hotels in financial difficulties and are keeping the situation under constant review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Due to the increasingly high number of casual bookings, hoteliers and guesthouse proprietors are finding it very difficult to give an accurate assessment of their advance bookings.  Bord Fáilte's intelligence report for May shows that 66 per cent of the hotel and guesthouse proprietors surveyed reported a decrease in bookings for June and July compared with the same period last year.  This report does not indicate the extent of the decrease, however.</P>
      <P>The latest market data in the Bord Fáilte report indicates that combined sea and air traffic from Britain in the five months ended 31st May, 1972, decreased by 4 per cent; accompanied cars inwards for this period decreased by 22 per cent.  Northern Ireland traffic is expected to show a very substantial decrease.  Returns for the first five months show a growth of 7.5 per cent in numbers of visitors from North America but the outlook for the remainder of the season is not good.  Reports of bookings in France and Germany are encouraging and are likely to show an increase on last year's figures.</P>

      <P>The claim to unemployment benefit made in March last by this person was disallowed by <Col N="15" /> a deciding officer on the ground that the statutory condition which requires that at least 26 employment contributions be paid or credited in respect of the claimant in the governing contribution year, in this instance 1970, was not satisfied.  According to Departmental records the claimant has no contributions for that year, during most of which he stated he was self-employed. While the insured person had a good insurance record up to very recent years, the claim of March last is statutorily governed by the contribution record for the year 1970 and the claim had to fail because of the deficient record for that year.  His record for 1971 is also materially deficient.</P>
      <P>The person also made an application for a qualification certificate for unemployment assistance.  The application has been refused by a deciding officer on the ground that the applicant's means calculated in accordance with the Unemployment Assistance Acts exceed the means limit in his case for obtaining a qualification certificate.

      <P>I am not aware that any hardship is caused by delay in time between the submission of medical certificates and the payment of benefit.  If the Deputy is aware of any individual case of hardship I will be glad to look into it if he will let me have particulars.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, in general, the time lapse between the receipt of medical certificates and the payment of benefit is minimal.</P>
      <P>I would point out that the first medical certificate submitted in support of a claim for disability benefit is a notice of incapacity showing that the claimant was first examined on a particular date and was then incapable of work.  It is not until a further certificate is received that a period of continuing incapacity for work is established for which benefit can be paid.  When the second and subsequent medical certificates are received payments are issued promptly, normally on the next working day after the receipt of these certificates.  Delay or irregularity in submitting medical certificates by claimants may, however, involve delay or irregularity in the payment of benefit in individual cases.  It may also happen that a medical certificate, or other document, is lost in transit, or it may not be possible to identify a certificate or other relevant document because of inadequate or incorrect particulars, such as, for example, the omission of the insurance number or the giving of an incorrect insurance number.  The Deputy may take it, however, that every effort is made in my Department to ensure that benefit is paid promptly and so avoid any possible hardship to claimants.</P>

      <P>The State already gives substantial aid for dramatic art through subsidies to the Abbey and Gate Theatres in Dublin.  Assistance is also given at national and local level through bodies such as An Chomhairle Ealaíon and Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further financial support for the theatre will be provided mainly in two ways.  Firstly by the setting up of a new Irish Theatre Company whose main purpose will be to provide a professional acting group which will spend most of its time touring the provinces.  This will bring high-quality theatrical performances to these areas <Col N="22" /> and stimulate interest in local amateur groups.  Negotiations with representatives of theatre managements and Actors Equity are proceeding and it is hoped that the new company can commence work in the near future.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the restructuring of An Chomhairle Ealaíon which was mooted some time ago has been proceeding. So far as dramatic art is concerned, the intention would be that as regards organisation and finance, An Chomhairle will be in a much better position to play a more positive role in encouraging dramatic art generally.  The necessary amending legislation to give effect to the proposed changes is at present being prepared.</P>

      <P>With regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, every effort has been and is being made to minimise redundancy in Donegal, but despite these efforts a total of 12 men have had to be laid off in the county since 1st January, 1972.  There is no immediate prospect of re-employing these men but the matter will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>The provision in the Estimates for 1972-73 for recoupment of losses arising from the purchase and resale of native wheat is £225,350, which is £73,650 less than the amount spent in 1971-72.  The major portion of the difference of £73,650 represents a payment to An Bord Gráin of the balance of the loss involved in disposing, as feed, of surplus millable wheat of the 1968 crop.</P>

The cereals section deal with the breeding of cereals, whereas research into environmental conditions, fertilisers and things of that nature are handled by the institute.

The overall effect was that the combined allowances totalled £5,490,128 and met 44 per cent of the rates on land in 1957-58 while in 1971-72 the allowances totalled £24,386,669 and met 68 per cent of the rates on land.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains the provisions required to give effect to the taxation concessions proposed in my budget statement as well as provisions on a number of matters, notice of which was not given in the budget statement or in the Financial Resolutions passed on budget day.  I shall draw attention to these in the course of the review I propose to give of the contents of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Part I of the Bill deals with measures relating to income tax, including sur-tax. It is divided into two chapters: Chapter I contains a number of general income tax provisions and Chapter II deals exclusively with the treatment of occupational pension schemes for income tax purposes.</P>
      <P>Section 1 imposes, as is customary, income tax and sur-tax at percentage rates corresponding to those for last year, but provides, as I announced in the budget, for the charging of both taxes on a permanent basis.  One beneficial effect of this change will be that, in a year in which no variation in the rates of tax is proposed, it will not be necessary either to introduce a Financial Resolution or to include a provision in the Finance Bill for the charging of these taxes.  Section 12 effects certain amendments set out in the Third Schedule to the Bill consequent on the charging of income tax and sur-tax on a permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of the provisions in Chapter I is, however, to give effect to the increased income tax allowances announced in the budget.  Section 4 increases the single allowance and widowed allowance by £50 and the <Col N="50" /> married allowance by £70, and the income tax child allowances are increased, under section 5, by £20.  These measures provide significant relief for all taxpayers and, in addition, remove some 50,000 from the tax net.  Section 5 also provides an additional increase of £50, or £70 in all, in the case of a child permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity.  Section 3 secures the equivalent of minimum earned income relief of £175 in the case of single and widowed persons aged 65 or over and £300 in the case of married persons.</P>
    <P>Section 10 restores full deductibility of corporation profits tax payable by companies in determining profits for income tax purposes.  Further relief for industry in computing both income and corporation profits tax is provided in section 42 of the Bill which will remove a difficulty at present in the way of industrialists purchasing machinery or plant outside the designated areas which would not qualify for free depreciation under the two-year concession provided for in the Finance Act, 1971 because it could not be brought into use by 31st March, 1973. This is being done by increasing from 60 per cent to 100 per cent the initial allowance that may be claimed in respect of capital expenditure incurred between 1st April, 1971, and 31st March, 1973 on new plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>Apart from section 9, which abolishes the maximum deduction of £500 health expenses that a taxpayer may claim in respect of each qualified person, the remaining sections in Chapter I of Part I of the Bill were not specifically mentioned in the budget.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 2 is to ensure that, when calculating the income tax deductible from an employee's emoluments under PAYE, an employer will, before subtracting any tax-free allowances from the gross emoluments, first take off the amount of the employee's superannuation contributions.  In this way, any increases in an employee's allowable superannuation contributions, which in many instances vary with income, will be automatically allowed for at the time he is being paid.  At present, some employers do not effect deductions of employees' <Col N="51" /> superannuation contributions in this way, with the result that subsequent adjustments of tax-free allowances must be made annually in some 70,000 cases. Section 2 empowers the Revenue Commissnoners to make regulations, which are intended to operate for 1973-74 onwards, for the purpose of requiring employers to make deductions for superannuation contributions in the manner that I have described.</P>
    <P>The income limit for the purposes of the dependent relative allowance is raised by section 6 to £295 which is the annual equivalent of the maximum non-contributory old age pension following the pension increases announced in the budget.  Section 11 enables the Central Bank to pay interest on Reserve Bonds without deduction of tax, a facility enjoyed already by several other state-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>Finally, both sections 7 and 8 are consequential on the raising of the limits of jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts by the Courts Act, 1971. The limits specified in section 485 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which deals with the recovery of tax by a sheriff or county registrar and in section 486 of the Act which empowers authorised officials of the Revenue Commissioners to sue in the courts for the recovery of tax due, are being raised in sections 7 and 8 respectively, in line with the new court limits.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Chapter II of Part I, together with the First Schedule, is to provide a new code of tax which deals with superannuation schemes for employed persons.  Under existing law, the tax treatment of occupational pension schemes is contained in three separate codes enacted in 1921, 1922 and 1958. A single code is now proposed which will be more liberal and will remove existing anomalies.</P>
    <P>The existing tax law governing occupational pension schemes is being repealed as from 6th April, 1980, and, on that date, the new code will be of universal application.  In the interim, new schemes established after 6th April, 1974, or existing schemes materially altered after that date, will be required to comply with the new code. On the other hand, an existing scheme and a new scheme established before <Col N="52" /> 6th April, 1974, will have the option of adopting the new code as from 6th April, 1972.</P>
    <P>Section 13 is concerned with the interpretation of terms used in Chapter II.  In particular, the attention of Deputies is drawn to the fact that the definition of &ldquo;relevant benefits&rdquo; ensures that the new code will apply to all schemes with benefits for widows and other dependants.  The section in addition gives effect to the First Schedule which contains administrative, transitional and consequential provisions, and also widens the scope of the tax exemption under existing law in favour of life assurance companies in respect of that part of their investment income which is referable to pension schemes approved for tax purposes. Section 14 deals with questions of definition and interpretation in relation to &ldquo;retirement benefit schemes&rdquo; which it is not convenient to include in section 13.</P>
    <P>Section 15 sets out, first, the general basic conditions, namely, the &ldquo;prescribed conditions&rdquo;, which, if a scheme complies with them, will entitle the scheme, as a matter of right, to approval and, second, confers discretionary power on the Revenue Commissioners to approve schemes even though they may not comply with one or more of the prescribed conditions.</P>
    <P>The various tax reliefs being provided in respect of private schemes approved under the new code and statutory schemes are set out in sections 16 and 17 respectively.  Section 16 secures that investment income of a fully approved private scheme will be exempt from tax and that employers' and employees' annual contributions to the scheme will be deductible for tax purposes.  Relief for employees' contributions to a statutory scheme is provided under section 17.  There is no reason why tax relief should not also be allowed where a commuted payment in lump sum form falls to be made in respect of superannuation contributions to either a private scheme or a statutory scheme.  Relief for such lump sums which may be apportioned over a number of years is accordingly provided in sections 16 and 17.  Relief will apply, under section 16, from the date of approval of a scheme under the new <Col N="53" /> code and, under section 17, from 6th April, 1973.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me that lump sum contributions paid under widows' and orphans' pension schemes that have operated since 1968 in the public sector should qualify for relief corresponding to that under section 17 for statutory schemes.  Under existing law, relief for lump sum contributions is restricted to certain private schemes and to statutory schemes providing benefits for an employee but not for a widow or dependants.  A similar restriction has applied up to the present for the purposes of giving relief in respect of the ordinary annual contributions under statutory schemes but relief for such contributions has been allowed, since 1968, on a provisional basis pending the enactment of appropriate legislation.  This arrangement is being put on a proper legal footing in section 25 of the Bill in which relief corresponding to that under sections 16 and 17 is, in equity, also being extended to lump sum contributions made since 1968 under both private and statutory schemes.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of giving relief generally for lump sum contributions and for allowing them to be apportioned over a period of years is of the order of £75,000 to £100,000 a year, declining as the years go by.  For 1972-73, however, the cost would be about £250,000 mainly because of the fact that lump sum contributions paid since 1968 by employees in the public service under the new widows' and orphans' schemes would qualify for relief.</P>
    <P>Section 18 is basically a re-enactment of a provision in existing law, the object of which is broadly to charge to tax the amounts paid by an employer to secure a retirement benefit for an employee as if the amounts so paid were income of the employee.  Exclusions from the charge imposed in section 18 are however made in section 19, namely, in the case of an approved scheme, a statutory scheme or a scheme set up by a foreign government for the benefit of their employees.</P>
    <P>Under present law, tax at the standard rate must be deducted from some <Col N="54" /> pensions and the pensioners have to make repayment claims to recover balances of tax due to them.  The application of PAYE under section 20 to pensions paid under any scheme approved under the new code will remove these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Sections 21 and 22 impose a uniform charge of 10 per cent on superannuation contributions refunded to employees and on the excess of lump sums paid to employees in commutation of pensions over the maximum amount to which the employee would be entitled under the ordinary rules of a scheme.  The Minister for Finance is given power under both sections to vary by order the rate of tax charged, subject to the order being laid before Dáil Éireann.  Repayments made to an employer from a fully approved scheme are to be treated, under section 23, as a receipt of the employer's trade or profession and charged to tax accordingly, but only to the extent that relief was allowed in respect of his contributions to the scheme.  The rules of existing retirement benefit schemes may need to be amended, in connection with an application for approval, by the Revenue Commissioners, of the schemes to enable them to come within the ambit of the new code.  Section 24 enables this to be done.</P>
    <P>I announced in the budget a number of reliefs in the death duty field and these are provided for in Part II of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 26 imposes a new scale of estate duty rates, as set out in the Second Schedule, which provides that no duty is being charged on estates up to £7,500, while the rates of duty on estates in excess of that amount and up to £11,000 are being reduced.  The general exemption limit for legacy and succession duties is also raised, in section 27, from £5,000 to £7,500.  As a consequence of the increases that I have mentioned, I have also made provision, in section 28, to raise from £5,000 to £7,500 the special exemption limit for estate duty purposes in respect of death benefits payable under superannuation schemes.  This measure was not mentioned in my budget statement. Section 29 increases the widow's and <Col N="55" /> dependent child's abatements to £2,000 and £1,000 respectively from the existing figures of £1,500 and £750.  Section 31 increases form £500 to £50,000 the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court in cases of appeal against decisions of the property arbitrator in relation to the value of lands or house property for estate duty purposes.  If the value of any other property is in dispute, there is already a right of appeal to the Circuit Court up to £50,000 in value. Deputies will recall, however, that I undertook in the budget to make provision in the Finance Bill for a right of appeal, in the first instance, to the appeal commissioners in relation to the value, for estate duty purposes, of non-quoted securities.  This is being done in section 33 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 30 provides that all foreign debts must be deducted, for the purposes of estate duty, from all foreign property and not merely from foreign personal estate only, before any balance is deducted from the Irish estate.  Section 32 replaces section 21 of the Finance Act, 1965, which is being repealed under Part III of the Fourth Schedule to the Bill, with a new section to deal as comprehensively as possible with avoidance of estate duty through the medium of discretionary trusts.  Neither of these last two provisions was mentioned in the budget.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the stamp duty provisions contained in Part III of the Bill, none of which was referred to in the budget.  Section 34 exempts from stamp duty loan stock issued by a state-sponsored body where payment of interest on the loan is guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  So that the recent ESB loan will come within the scope of the proposed relief the section will be effective from 1st April, 1972.  Section 35 provides for the extension to group pension policies of the arrangements for the payment of stamp duty by way of composition, thereby obviating the necessity to stamp each policy physically.  Following the provision, in section 33 of the Bill, for the right of appeal to the appeal commissioners in regard to the valuation of non-quoted securities for estate duty purposes, it is desirable that the same appeal procedure should <Col N="56" /> operate in the stamp duty field and provision is made accordingly in section 36.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with corporation profits tax.  The exemption from corporation profits tax of certain public utility companies, building societies and the Agricultural Credit Corporation is extended under section 37 for a further year, pending completion and consideration of the report of the inter-departmental working group which is examining the position of building societies.</P>
    <P>Section 38, which is an anti-avoidance provision, abolishes with effect from 19th April, 1972, which was of course budget day, the exemption from corporation profits tax in respect of companies precluded by their constitutions from distributing profits amongst their members and a new exemption in favour of companies permanently precluded from distributing profits to members is provided for in section 39.  This is being done by adding to section 43 of the Finance Act, 1922&mdash;which already exempts from corporation profits tax companies prohibited from distributing profits to members and which are either licensed under section 24 of the Companies Act, 1963, or established solely for the advancement of religion or education&mdash;two new classes of company.  The first class is a registered company that by their constitution are prohibited from distributing profits to members and are required, in a winding-up, to dispose of their surplus property to the Minister for Finance, a charity or another company with similar provisions in their constitution and, finally, are prevented from altering these provisions without the consent of the appropriate Minister of State.  If a company were, before budget day, exempt from corporation profits tax under the old exemption they will be allowed a period of grace, up to 19th April, 1973, to amend their constitution in order to comply with the additional requirements that I have just mentioned.  The second class of company covered by the new exemption provision are statutory companies.  As it is the intention that all of these should continue to enjoy exemption from corporation profits <Col N="57" /> tax, the new provision is so worded that the necessity to amend their constitutions for the purposes of the exemption will not arise.</P>
    <P>Finally, I come to Part V of the Bill.  It contains two provisions not referred to in the budget.</P>
    <P>Section 40, which is an annual provision, fixes the annuity for the redemption of the debt incurred on voted capital services in 1971-72 and fixes provisionally a new annuity to redeem the estimated debt in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The Capital Fund was set up in 1956 to receive the equivalent of the proceeds of the special import levy and to apply them for development purposes of a capital nature.  The levy was abolished as from 1st April, 1959, and the amounts available for advancing from the fund are now so small that its continuance serves no useful purpose. It is accordingly being wound up under section 41 which authorises the transfer of the fund's assets to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have referred earlier to the increased initial allowance of 100 per cent provided in section 42.  Section 43 exempts a credit union, with effect from the date of their registration, from income and corporation profits tax on all their profits.  Section 44 provides relief from death duties, stamp duty and customs duty for illegitimate children inheriting property from their mother as if they were legitimate and section 45 provides similar relief in respect of children adopted abroad if the adoption laws in the foreign country have substantially the same effect in relation to property rights as our Adoption Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 46 effects the repeals of enactments in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill which are consequential on the charging of income tax and sur-tax on a permanent basis under section 1, the new provisions governing occupational pension schemes under Chapter II of Part I and the prevention of estate duty avoidance through the medium of discretionary trusts by a new provision in section 32.</P>
    <P>Sections 47 and 48 are self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="58" /> I commend the Bill to the House for a second reading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, as is usual for this Bill, a difficult and complex Bill, one that does not lend itself readily to a general discussion, one which we term a Committee Stage Bill. However, there are a number of comments I think I can make relevantly on the content of the Bill and which, I hope, will prepare the way for Committee Stage.  I know that in this debate one has to walk a tortuous path.  If one errs on the side of generality, one is told that one is out of order because one should confine oneself to the Bill. If one errs on the side of particularity, one is told one should keep that for Committee Stage.  And I sometimes feel it is quite difficult to be relevant at all in these circumstances.  But I intend to remain relevant, and I hope, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will find me so.</P>
      <P>The changes in the tax allowance in the earlier part of the Bill are, of course, generally welcome.  The section on occupational pension schemes is a very complex section and I cannot claim to have absorbed or understood it at this stage and I shall have to reserve most of my comments for the Committee Stage if, indeed, even then I have sufficiently absorbed it to make useful and relevant comments.  I was puzzled by one feature of it.  I had understood this was intended to bring into effect a more liberal pension code, although I do not think the Tánaiste, in introducing the Bill, said that.  I think it was said earlier, perhaps by the Minister in his budget speech.  But if it is to be more liberal&mdash;and I am not saying it is not, because I have not studied it sufficiently to make a judgment&mdash;one is a little puzzled as to the need for that part of subsection (4) of section 15 which says:</P>
      <P>In applying this subsection to an existing scheme the Commissioners shall exercise their discretion, in such cases as appear to them appropriate, so as&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  to preserve benefits or rights arising out of service before approval under this Chapter or before the commencement of section 18, whichever is the earlier, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> (ii)  to preserve any rights to death-in-service benefits conferred by rules of the scheme in force on the 19th day of April, 1972.</P>
    <P>If it is a more liberal system why then do people's rights have to be preserved against this new scheme?  There is perhaps some technical reason for this.</P>
    <P>With regard to the next section on estate duty and death duties, I have a number of comments to make.  First of all, in so far as that part of the Bill dealing with death duties makes provision to vary the rates in a favourable manner, raising the lower limit and lowering the rate of tax at the lower level, it is welcome and useful.  However, the fact remains that, although our death duties are supposed to be, and are sometimes presented as being at a lower level than those in Britain, and although a strong case can be made for keeping them so, in that, because of our state of development it would be undesirable for us to have heavier estate duties or heavier duties on capital than in Britain, nevertheless owing to the different method of computation, our rates are now, following the increase from 40 to 55 per cent some time ago, comparable with and close to and perhaps even arguably in some cases above the British level, and this is a matter about which we should be concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has quite rightly mitigated the effect of estate duty at the lower level but has not done anything to overcome the difficulty created by the increase in the rate which owing to the different method of calculation, does involve higher levels of tax at certain points.  The fact that our rate is a rate on the total sum, whereas the British rate is expressed in marginal terms&mdash;the British marginal rate of 65 per cent yields on £200,000 an average rate of tax of 50 per cent, means that the British rate while seeming to be higher is, in fact, in that instance lower than our 55 per cent. It is that which concerns us to a degree.</P>
    <P>More generally, the whole estate duty code is unsatisfactory, and the fact that repeatedly in Finance Bills we have to have further legislation to get around the problem of avoidance <Col N="60" /> suggests that as a method of taxation it is seriously defective.  It should not be necessary to have such constant revision of legislation.  No legislation should be so open to avoidance, open to so many schemes to get round it, and this is particularly unfortunate, because, in the nature of things, the benefits of avoidance tend to accrue to the very rich.  The man who has a limited amount of property, because he has an insurance policy and a house, is brought within the range of estate duty&mdash;as indeed are many people of not great wealth today&mdash;and does not have the opportunity of avoidance.  It is only the people who have very great wealth who not only have the wealth to afford the necessary legal advice to solve a crucial problem but who also can afford to set aside part of their wealth in a manner that will prevent it from incurring estate duty but will inevitably prevent them from making use of it during their lifetime.  The result is that, as one company lawyer put it crudely some time ago, anybody with over £100,000 would be a fool to pay tax on anything over that sum; anyone with less than that sum would find difficulty in avoidance without locking up money which he might at some time need.</P>
    <P>It is that kind of situation which is inherently unsatisfactory.  It really is not an answer to keep on year after year amending the provisions to catch up with the latest dodge of the people skilled in getting around this legislation. It is clear there is a fundamental defect there.  The system of taxation which is designed to fall so rarely and so haphazardly over time is one which is bound to create pressures for avoidance, is bound to create the kind of situation we should be trying to prevent. The fact that this tax falls due, on an average, every 29 years, means that the amount of tax payable has to be very great, because if you are going to take enough capital from people every 29 years to prevent capital accumulating in too few hands &mdash;and we do not tax heavily enough for that&mdash;then you will have to take such large sums that it puts a great premium on avoidance.  Moreover, when the period of 29 years is merely an average of periods which can <Col N="61" /> range from a week or two, through deaths which occur in short succession, to 80 or 90 years, if they do not occur for the whole lifetime of a person, anything which is prone to such variations as that is obviously an unsatisfactory basis for taxation.</P>
    <P>I have always been persuaded that this is something which would best be tackled by having some kind of tax on capital which would be levied more frequently.  I am aware of difficulties about this, but it is a pity that so much of the energies of the Revenue Commissioners have to be dedicated to trying to stop up the holes in the existing legislation that there does not seem to have been time for them to think out a method of taxation on a more frequent basis which would involve payments small enough for avoidance not to be practicable, desirable or worthwhile and one which would be more equitable in its incidence. The estate duty code is unsatisfactory from every point of view. From the point of view of the person who has to pay it, the fact that so many people can avoid it is very frustrating.</P>
    <P>In an article in <i>The Economist</i> about nine years ago it was estimated that avoidance in Britain amounted to as much as two-thirds of the total sum. I have no reason to believe that lawyers and accountants in Ireland are any less skilled than those in Britain. If the proportion avoided here is less, it would only be because there might be a lesser number of very wealthy people and perhaps a lesser proportion of very large estates.  Certainly there is avoidance on a large scale. For those who have to bear the tax this is frustrating.  It means that, in order to raise a given amount, the level of the tax has to be much higher than would be necessary if everybody had to pay it.  It is, I think, higher than in Britain at certain points and to that extent it is a bit too high. If we had a different system of taxation I think it would be possible, on the one hand, to avoid taxing people at a higher rate than in Britain at certain levels and, at the same time, to take much more taxation.  I would hope that, with relatively small reductions in <Col N="62" /> the average rate in terms of annual rather than occasional payments arising from debts, it would be possible to make some reductions in rates, so that overall, taking one 100 years with another, the rate would be somewhat lower and yet yield a much higher return.  There is need for more imagination to be applied to this problem and to get away from this niggling approach every year in trying to stuff up loopholes.</P>
    <P>The extent to which legislation has to keep on being amended has been very evident in recent times.  We have had the 1965 Act substantially altered. Section 20 has now been heavily amended.  Section 21 is repealed here and replaced by a new section.  Section 22 has been amended, and indeed an error in the amendment has been corrected in this Bill.  We are correcting a drafting error in section 24 of this Bill.  Part 7 was repealed.  The 1965 Finance Act, brought in by the present Taoiseach as Minister for Finance, was one of the most unfortunate pieces of legislation to come before this House.  I do not recall any legislation which has had to go on being amended so often.  Its flaws become more and more evident as time passes.  It was a very ill-thought out piece of legislation. It is unfortunate that legislation so badly drafted should have come before the House at a time when inadequate publicity was directed towards it and when some of the defects therefore escaped the Members of this House.  In legislation of this kind we are dependent necessarily in this House on the representations of expert people outside this House to draw our attention to defects in legislation.  No matter how much attention a legislator may pay to his work he is not going to be able, unless he happens to have a most extraordinary range of skills, to detect flaws and defects in legislation as technical as this.</P>
    <P>This raises the whole question as to whether our method of legislation takes sufficient account of this problem. This Bill, for example, was published last week.  There is very little time for people to consider it.  We have no procedure by which legislation of this kind is sent out for comments <Col N="63" /> to various bodies that might have useful comments to offer.  We are dependent entirely on the extent to which individual Members of the House can get advice or assistance and the extent to which people outside this House may feel an obligation to examine legislation and to come forward with suggestions to legislators in order to improve it.  It is a very haphazard system and the extent to which it is haphazard is being highlighted at the moment by the Value-Added Tax Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a bit disturbing to find that the process of legislation in that instance has taken such a form and that negotiations between the Revenue Commissioners and interested groups have gone on so long and to such a late stage, up to the point of the Committee Stage of the Bill.  I was approached even yesterday by three different groups of people in respect of different problems which they have found in the Value-Added Tax Bill and it is only in the very recent past they have discovered that these have not been dealt with in the way they had hoped they would be dealt with as a result of their discussions with the Revenue Commissioners. Even in that instance, a Bill where considerable trouble was gone to to ensure that various interests had an opportunity of putting forward their views and where time was given for it, there are still problems arising and people are still finding that they have not had sufficient time to put forward their views on particular problems.</P>
    <P>We got this legislation last week and have to stand up in the House and comment on it this week.  It is no wonder, with a time scale like that, that legislation sometimes goes through this House in a defective form and presumably it is not practicable for Members of the Opposition, who inevitably lack expert knowledge on particular aspects of legislation, such as estate duty, to do the necessary home work or even to find relevant experts and consult them and get their views in time as short as this.  I hope the fact that legislation has to be rushed through will not this year give rise to as many difficulties as has been the case with earlier Finance Acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> In this Bill we have section 28, which is remedying defects in section 24 of the 1965 Act.  It is conferring a benefit in terms of raising an exemption limit but it is also remedying a defect in drafting in that Act which has now come to light.  In section 32 there is something similar, provisions which are designed, in part at least, to remedy defects in the 1965 Act.  Section 30 is remedying a flaw in a Finance Act of last year.  One can see how many mistakes have been made which have to be recovered at this stage.  Section 32 hinges on the word &ldquo;payment&rdquo; which is defined at the beginning of subsection (1).  Last year there was a similar provision in which the words &ldquo;income and benefits&rdquo; were used.  I am not clear as to why a different formula has been used in coping with the problem in another aspect.  Perhaps I could be enlightened on this later on.  The effect of section 32, as I understand it, is to repeal section 21, which is repealed in part 3 of the Fourth Schedule.</P>
    <P>This repeal seems to me to give rise to some problems because section 20 (4) (b) (i) of the 1965 Act seems to depend on section 21 (5) of that Act. Its operation is expressed to be dependent on section 21 (5).  That being the case the elimination of section 21 as a whole and its replacement by this section raises a question as to whether section 20 (4) (b) (i) of the 1965 Act is now operable, as there does not seem to be anything in this Bill to replace this provision.  It is true that section 32 contains a section, 32 (6), which, in part, is similar in wording to section 21 (5) of the 1965 Act.  I suppose an argument could be made that this is intended to replace it that in some way one is meant to read section 32 (6) of this Act with section 21 (5) of the 1965 Act.  But when one is attempting to apply section 20 (4) (b) (i) of the 1965 Act, it does not seem to me good drafting to leave the matter so vague.</P>
    <P>It is not at all clear that section 32 (6) of this Bill can be interpreted in a way that makes sense of section 20 (4) (b) (i) of the 1965 Act because there are references in subsection (6), in the last few words, to payment of income at an annual rate of six divided by the <Col N="65" /> number of objects of the trust of full age, including the deceased.  It is not at all clear how, when you come to shareholders of a company, references to people being of full age have any relevance. On grounds of the inapplicability of the wording to the case to which it would have to apply and because of the absence of any specific reference to the fact that section 32 (6) now substitutes for section 21 (5) in the interpretation of section 20 (4) (b) (i), there is a defect here that would need to be looked at on Committee Stage.  I am simply giving notice at this stage of intention to raise the matter at that point.  It may facilitate the debate if I mention these things as I go along without dwelling on them.</P>
    <P>In sections 33 and 36 there is a right of appeal in respect of non-quoted shares.  This, of course, is welcome but it should be widened.  Indeed, this Bill itself contains, in section 32 (1), lines 33 to 36, a reference to market value in relation to property and market value is defined as the price which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the property would fetch if sold on the open market at the time of the death of the deceased but there is no provision in this Bill for any appeal on this point.  If we are going to introduce an appeal&mdash;and it is long overdue&mdash;on the question of the value of non-quoted shares, it seems to me that that appeal ought to apply more generally and ought to apply immediately to this concept of market value which is defined in this very Bill.  In regard to any question of value which is open to dispute and where the view of the Revenue Commissioners and the view of the people being taxed may be at issue with each other and where each of the two parties has an interest in fixing the figure at a level appropriate to their particular concern, the provision should be the subject of an appeal.  It is unsatisfactory that the final determination of something of this kind should be left to the Revenue Commissioners and the recognition of this by the Minister in respect of non-quoted shares raises the question immediately of why he does not recognise a similar need in relation to other forms of property.  I would urge that <Col N="66" /> this appeal procedure be widened now and extended to other cases where genuine dispute about the value of the property can arise.</P>
    <P>Section 38 seems to be a very desirable tightening up of the charitable provision which has been abused.  We would all support this.  The provision in respect of charities that is affected by this is one which is inherently desirable but that it should be abused, that people should be able to set up a commercial company earning profits but not paying dividends and then to liquidate the company and take their profits in that way, having expressed the company to be non-profit making, seems to be inherently undesirable and in so far as I understand this section here to be designed to eliminate this abuse, it is a very welcome amendment and I think we would strongly support it.</P>
    <P>Section 43 refers to credit unions.  It does not, however, define a credit union and I wonder whether, in fact, in the absence of a definition in this Bill, &ldquo;credit union&rdquo; can necessarily be taken to mean credit union as defined in the Credit Union Act.  I would like clarification on that and, if there is any doubt about that, &ldquo;credit union&rdquo; should be defined in this Bill or reference should be made to the definition in the Credit Union Act.  I have not checked that Act.  I assume it does contain a definition.  It is important that we should be clear on the definition of credit unions for the purposes of section 43.</P>
    <P>Sections 44 and 45 are very welcome indeed, dealing with the problems arising in relation to illegitimate children and adoption.  It is important that in any case that has not been settled here these provisions should apply.  This morning I received representations on this very point from somebody who has been adversely affected and who has, in fact, taken the matter up with the Revenue Commissioners and, I think, with the Minister and has got a negative reply.  It is something very unsatisfactory that we should be legislating here to deal with a very understandable grievance, that foreign adoption is not recognised for estate duty purposes, and that, at the <Col N="67" /> very moment we are amending the law, somebody should be put in a disadvantageous position because of a mere defect in the time, that the Bill was not introduced in time.</P>
    <P>I would hope that the provision in respect of children's adoption would be so amended as to apply to any case where the liability has not been determined and the amount has not been paid and that we should not be in the position of seeking at this stage to remedy a defect which has arisen, perhaps, because of a particular case, remedying it for people in future and doing nothing about the particular case which has arisen.  I hope it will be possible to make some retrospective provision.  Retrospective legislation which involves extra taxation is objectionable but in respect of a provision which involves applying a law being introduced to cases which have arisen and which have drawn attention to the need to amend the law it is entirely acceptable and we should do that at this stage.</P>
    <P>On the Third Schedule of the Bill, I am just interested to know what we are doing now amending the 1942 Act.  This, as I recall, is the Act which authorised the Taoiseach in time of war, if the Dáil could not meet, to impose taxation.  I was not aware that such legislation was still in force.  I am not sure what kind of war we are envisaging which requires this.  I wonder why we are at this stage amending that Act or why that Act is still necessary. Perhaps we could be told something about that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Fourth Schedule, Part II, I am not satisfied that the repeal there is expressed in terms that are adequate.  It seems to me that the reference to paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 63 as being repealed is inadequate and that, in fact, some words immediately preceding (a) will also have to be repealed if we are to make sense of the relevant section. That is something that we will have to look at on Committee Stage.  It is a small point.</P>
    <P>These are the points of detail which seem to me to come up on this Bill. As I have said, the lack of time to examine the Bill has made it difficult <Col N="68" /> for me to deal adequately with it and I am sure that, especially in the operation of a pension scheme, there is more to be said.  It seemed worth while, in dealing with the Bill itself, to be specific and to indicate the points on which difficulty seems to arise and where further attention may be needed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>If I may speak more generally about this Bill and its economic effects, this Bill is designed to give effect to a budget which was introduced several months ago.  There is always a certain time-lag between the date of the budget and the date of the Bill.  In this instance it is nine or ten weeks.  This Bill is designed to give effect to a budget which itself was designed to achieve a specific and particular economic effect in the light of the situation of the economy as it was then seen to be. There was very general agreement on the shape of the budget.  Indeed, the Minister must have been gratified by the extent to which on the Opposition side the overall shape of the budget was endorsed, especially as the budget involved the very revolutionary innovation of an open and, indeed, in this instance, very large budget deficit.  But, at the time, I remember remarking and the Minister also remarked that the particular shape of the budget would need to be kept under review and that the changing economic circumstances might at some stage require further action to be taken.</P>
    <P>A budget of this kind is one which can only be drawn up on the basis of the facts as they are known to be at the time that it is introduced.  Our system of annual budgeting does not take any account of the rapidity with which the economic situation can change, both domestically and externally. The Minister said, quite rightly, and we endorsed it on this side of the House, that we would need to keep an eye on the economic situation thereafter.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there are three things that have happened since then which make the Minister's warning all the more appropriate and which show that the budget to which this Bill gives effect is one which will need to be kept under review from the point of view <Col N="69" /> of the economic situation.  These three factors, which I shall deal with briefly, suggest that the budget could turn out to be more reflationary than is appropriate. I am not being critical because Members on both sides of the House agreed that at the time the budget seemed appropriate but several things have happened and this means that the Minister will want to keep a close eye on the situation.</P>
    <P>First, some of the economic indicators as I interpret them suggest that the growth of the economy in the first quarter of the year may have been more rapid than the Minister thought when he prepared the budget.  It may be that the tax provisions in this Bill would have been somewhat different had the Minister known as much as we know now.  When we look at the indicators we have&mdash;they are very out-of-date here&mdash;we cannot but think that the first quarter of the year saw a revival of the economy greater than the Minister or any of us thought when the budget was drawn up.  I do not want to overstress this, but it is a point we must bear in mind.</P>
    <P>More important are two developments which occurred recently and which are relevant.  One is the economic situation in Britain which casts doubts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair does not wish to interfere with the Deputy's train of thought but this Bill deals with taxation and with the effect of such taxation on the Government's proposals.  It is not the same kind of economic debate as there would be on a budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason I intended to confine myself to a few brief remarks on this point.  In so far as we are talking about a Bill imposing and remitting taxation, the extent of the Bill as it is at present may seem a little less appropriate to the economic needs than it did when the budget was introduced.  Therefore, one is entitled to refer to the reasons as a general comment and reflection on the Bill. I shall not speak at length on the subject; I merely wish to list these points as I think the Minister should bear them in mind, as the country will have to bear them in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> The second point is in relation to the economic situation in Britain which has had such remarkable results in the last few days.  It raises a doubt about the growth rate it will be possible for the British economy to achieve this year.  This Bill is based on a budget which assumed a certain growth in the British economy which would help us to get out of difficulties here which would help our exports and help the budget and this Bill from leading to too large an external trade deficit and too large an external payments deficit.  The rapid change in the British situation is a reason for watching carefully and perhaps looking later this year at our budgetary situation and the provisions in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, the breakdown of the negotiations for the next wage and salary round raises a serious domestic issue.  When introducing his budget the Minister said that it was based on certain assumptions about the way in which wages and salaries would develop. We do not yet know what will be the outcome of the breakdown in negotiations but if it should lead to a significantly larger increase in wages and salaries than would have come from the wage round itself&mdash;already high by comparison with what would be appropriate to our economy&mdash;it would raise the question of the appropriateness of the budget.  Those three points would need to be borne in mind in the coming year.</P>
    <P>In retrospect, the shape of the capital budget seems to have been unfortunate in that it has involved a substantial growth of investment in equipment and machinery but not in construction activity.  It has led to a sudden dampening down of activity in the construction industry and to a serious aggravation of the already unfortunate unemployment trends in that industry.  To that extent that aspect of the budget seems to have been ill-conceived; perhaps none of us appreciated how out of line it was with the general needs of the situation when it was presented to us last April.</P>
    <P>Those are the main remarks I wanted to make on the background to this legislation.  I had hoped, but I think my hopes will not be fulfilled, <Col N="71" /> that the debate could be wide enough to enable the Minister to tell us something about the situation we face with regard to our currency&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be equally confined&mdash;he will have to stay with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a pity but I hope there will be another opportunity for the Minister to explain what is happening.  One would need to be an initiate in financial affairs to understand precisely the effects of the last few days so far as our currency is concerned.  However, I am not in a position to develop that theme any further.  In the light of the Chair's ruling I must leave the matter there but I hope on Committee Stage to develop some of the points I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask how necessary is legislation of this type, presented in this way?  Is it the only way in which the budget proposals can be put through the House?  The late Deputy Seán Dunne used an expression about these matters which comes to mind every time I see this kind of legislation&mdash;the expression was &ldquo;gobbledegook&rdquo;.  If anyone wants to know what I mean let him refer to section 2 of the Bill which has the following gem:</P>
      <P>2.  &mdash;(1) Section 127 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the insertion, after paragraph (e), of the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(ee) for requiring any employer making any payment of emoluments to which this Chapter applies, when making a deduction or repayment of tax in accordance with this Chapter and the regulations thereunder, to make such deduction or repayment as would require to be made if the amount of the emoluments were the emoluments reduced by the amount of any contributions payable by the employee and deductible by the employer from the emoluments being paid and which, by virtue of Chapters I <Col N="72" /> and II of Part XII of the Income Tax Act, 1967, or Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1972, are for the purposes of assessment under Schedule E allowed as a deduction from the emoluments;&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost as long as a sentence of mine and even less comprehensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>As incomprehensible, yes, if not quite so long.  Until all of us start speaking the native tongue, would it not be possible to frame legislation in plain English?  This kind of phrasing is repeated again and again; referring backwards and forwards to sections of other Acts which are not presently before the House. One would have to bring in an armful of books in order to follow the various Acts which are either being amended or being added to in this legislation. Possibly this system has been built up during the years but something must be done about it.  If we are so good at appointing committees, I do not understand why we do not appoint a committee to ensure that legislation is framed in language that can be understood by the ordinary people.</P>
      <P>We welcome some of the provisions in the Bill, for instance, the extension of allowances and some other provisions. However, it cannot be suggested that in 1972 this type of income tax legislation, particularly with regard to the lower paid workers, should be in operation.  Many people who are earning modest wages and salaries are required to pay out, or have deducted from their wages, one-sixth of the amount they are earning.  There is something wrong when this happens</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a man who was earning, on paper, £24 per week proved to me that when he had paid £6 per week for his house, when he had paid for a car which was necessary to take him to work, and had paid other expenses, he and his wife had less than £8 per week to spend on themselves.  Taxation and the various other charges he had to pay had taken the remainder. It is very unfair that any Minister should come into this House and attempt to put across to us, and <Col N="73" /> through us to the general public, that legislation which we are being asked to enact is fair when that sort of thing can happen.  Surely it is terribly unfair that out of 1972 wages, we should take a tax rate which refers back to the early sixties?  Surely some effort should have been made to bring the rate of allowances up to 1972 levels?</P>
    <P>It can be said that, because of inflation, the value of wages has dropped and the answer to that is that the value of the tax being collected has dropped also.  To charge tax to a single person on all money earned from about £7 a week up, when it is agreed that a single person even in a country district requires more than double that to live, means that he is in fact being asked to pay tax on money which he requires to exist.  That is wrong and something has to be done about it and if this Minister will not do it, if this Government cannot face up to it, there is a very good reason why this Government cannot continue very much longer in office. It is ridiculous to suggest that, with all the talent they have available in the Civil Service, they are unable to produce a scheme which will give the necessary relief to taxpayers.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, was the man who in this House gave the explanation as to why it was not being done when he said it would cost too much.  In other words, the lower paid workers in this country are the people who are paying the vast amount of income tax being collected under PAYE and in an effort to keep that system going, while there is fiddling around with the tax system, no Minister for Finance has come along with a worthwhile change in the system.  We talk about giving an extra allowance of £50 per year.  That is £50 at 7s in the £ and how little can be bought with around one-third of £50 over a 12 months period.  Something has to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald referred to the difficulties in the value-added tax, which I believe is going to make matters far more complicated and cost the ordinary person a lot more in his efforts to live, and we have on top of it this penal taxation system which <Col N="74" /> is being operated through income tax. At present&mdash;this is, I believe, relevant because it has a big effect on the people who are paying the tax&mdash;it appears as if our income taxation offices must be in complete chaos. We are told that computers are preparing and sending out the tax free allowance certificates.  If every other public representative has as many representations as I have from people who claim and are able to prove that the tax free certificates they are getting are incorrect, very much incorrect, there must be something dreadfully wrong with the whole system of preparing for the deduction of tax and when somebody who should be paying tax from 5th April last in a small amount finds that in fact he gets a tax free allowance and then four or five months afterwards an amended certificate showing that he was under-deducted for four, five or six months and must hand out half his wages in an effort to level up, there is surely something wrong with the whole system.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the conditions in which these people work are not ideal and that many of the people there are being asked to do far more than they should reasonably be asked to do, but in spite of all that, if we are going legally to rob the workers of this country, at least we should do it in a way which will allow them a little certainty as to how much they have to pay and when they have to pay it. Last night I met a man with six children, out of whose wage packet of £18 last week a deduction of £5 was made.  I asked what his tax free allowance was and it was £22.50, and yet somebody decided, as between the income tax authorities and his employer, the Board of Works, that he should pay £5 out of his wage packet for that week.  After he had gone away, three others came along and told me that they were in exactly the same position.  The whole system of income taxation here is wrong and fiddling around with £50 more here and £25 less there in respect of the allowances is not the answer.  Somebody must eventually get down to re-writing our income tax code because the present one is entirely unacceptable.  Nobody <Col N="75" /> wants to pay tax but practically everybody has to pay it, and at least people should be asked to pay only what they can afford and what they are legally liable to pay and no more.</P>
    <P>I am glad that a decision has been made with regard to increasing the allowance for sickness to over the £500 limit.  It was rather stupid to include the £500 originally and I am glad it has been changed.  I am also glad that it is proposed to guarantee by law that credit unions will not be subject to tax.  Unlike Deputy FitzGerald, I think there is a legal definition of credit unions and there should not be much difficulty in proving who the credit unions are.  I am also pleased with the decision taken with regard to children legally adopted. This is a very great improvement in the code but taking the Bill all together, it is absolutely impossible, in my opinion, to offer a balanced judgment on it as it has been presented to us.  We have the Bill itself and we have the explanatory memorandum which deals with certain sections and does not deal at all with others, even though apparently the person preparing it thought the others self-explanatory&mdash;I do not think they are; maybe I have not been able to understand as well as I should what they refer to&mdash; and then we have the Minister's brief.</P>
    <P>Apart from the fact that the Minister is not here&mdash;and we understand why he cannot be here&mdash;to deal with the Bill, it was not a good idea to have the matter dealt with in his absence because there is not much point in making a case here when the Minister, who I assume will be replying, is not here to hear that case.  The speech which has been given to the Tánaiste for this Bill is simply a repeat of what is in the explanatory memorandum, with a little added here and there.  I have come to the conclusion that a number of these Bills&mdash;and this had to be done with a very elaborate Income Tax Bill some time ago&mdash;will have to be referred, as the Value-Added Tax Bill had to be referred, to a Special Committee of the House. That may mean a lot of hard work for a very small number of people, but <Col N="76" /> the attendance in the House for this Bill now and I predict that there will be very few comments made by Members on the Bill as it goes through, is proof of the fact that it is so complicated that people do not want to try to take part in a debate which they do not fully understand.</P>
    <P>I would say with Deputy FitzGerald that whatever chance there is of attempting to have something done with the Bill on Committee Stage&mdash; there is not very much one can do with it, because the charge-on-the-Exchequer regulation will prevent numerous amendments being tabled&mdash; it is almost impossible to have a reasonable discussion on the Bill at this stage.  It is one of the most complicated Bills that I have seen since coming to this House.  There must be a more simple way of stating what is contained in Bills.  The present Bill indicates a falling back on the clichés that we have now become used to.  In describing sections of Bills difficult words are used in cases where simple ones would suffice.  Perhaps I am being somewhat unfair to the Parliamentary draftsmen because the phraseology they use has been handed down to them.  However, we should be able to update our thinking and introduce proposed legislation which it is possible for everyone to understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point I should like to make is that although there was no significant increase in taxation in the last budget, the percentage rate of taxation in this country was extremely high even before the budget was introduced.  Despite certain alleviations such as those in respect of people who are 65 years and over and in respect of dependent relatives in regard to death duties, the general rate of taxation remains extremely high. In addition, there is the fact that a person who pays tax under the PAYE system begins paying at a very low level.  I am aware, of course, that any move upwards in this respect would cost the Exchequer a huge sum but, at the same time, it must be borne in mind that turnover tax at 5 per cent and selective wholesale tax at 20 per cent are percentage taxes and that as the value of money decreases and as <Col N="77" /> the State needs more money for the services that it must provide, the amount of money collected by way of selective wholesale and turnover tax comes up automatically to meet that need.</P>
      <P>The introduction of turnover and wholesale taxes marked a big change in the method of taxation used in this country during the previous 30 years. Never before had there been such a windfall to the State as was provided by these taxes, yet the rate of taxation that bears most on the poorer sections of the community remains very high, both as a percentage and as a tax which is applied at an extremely low level of income.</P>
      <P>The adjustments that are made every two or three years in respect of death duties are not keeping pace with the fall in the value of money and with the increase in the value of property. Property may be a house in which resides a widow and her family.  A person charged with the duty of valuing such a house must, because of its appreciation, assess the widow at a higher rate for death duties.  However, that property is not providing income with which the widow can feed and clothe her children.  Therefore, the increases that have been given in the rates of exemption for widows and dependent children have not kept pace with the decrease in the value of money.  In any case, death duties are an unfair tax but equally unfair is the imposition of income tax on a person who begins work in a factory at £7 or £8 per week.  Revenue must be derived from some source but there should not be these unfair elements in taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The many measures that can be introduced at budget time do not seem to have been considered this year. The Minister's predecessor.  Deputy Haughey, was a past master at producing what might seem like gimmicks but which were sometimes very fair approaches which helped in particular the old and the poor.  One can recall in particular the provision whereby free travel facilities were granted to old age pensioners and also the one allowing for free broadcasting licences to such persons.  Such concessions did not cost very much but they meant a lot to the <Col N="78" /> people concerned.  There were many measures that could have been considered by the Government in introducing the last budget.</P>
    <P>As we enter Europe our selective wholesale tax and turnover tax will be replaced by the value-added tax system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that but I hope that when these changes occur, selective wholesale tax and turnover tax should be considered to see whether it would be possible to exclude from taxation certain parts of the food or clothes bill in a household.  Such exclusion would be a great step forward. It is difficult to speak on the Finance Bill this year because there is very little in it.  We had a stay-as-you-were budget this year.  I wonder whether that was a good approach but irrespective of whether there is wisdom in this Finance Bill I do not think it will help us very much as we move towards Europe.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the allowances given in respect of death duties. I am disappointed with certain other parts of the Bill.  I am pleased that the Government have at last seen fit to remove the iniquitous increase in corporation profits tax and company taxation which they imposed between 12 and 18 months ago.  That is all I wish to say at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will intervene briefly at this stage, not having had a chance to examine all aspects of the Finance Bill, which is a very complicated measure at all times and a Bill which touches most aspects of our mode of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Donegan I feel that, even though there may be some clauses in this Bill with which I would disagree, on the whole the Bill shows an advance in so far as it relieves certain sections of the community from the imposition of taxation.  A Bill which has such provisions is not wholly bad. During the past few years we have gone through a difficult time and if <Col N="79" /> there is one Minister in the House with whom I had a certain amount of sympathy in the past few years it was the Minister for Finance.  The Minister was faced with a number of difficult propositions.  We know that it is unpleasant at any time to have to impose taxation, especially if it is imposed on the marginal element in the community who could be said to be hardly able to bear it.  In this respect I would refer to certain sections of the Bill which allow a number of people out of the taxation net.</P>
    <P>There are sections here which do certain things.  At this stage we must agree with the Minister that he is called upon to provide funds for ever-increasing services, and that those ever-increasing services, strangely enough, seem to beget a desire for the spread of such services.  As Members of this House and of local authorities, we know that, far from being able to contract any services, in recent years the call is usually for their expansion.  If we proposed to reduce or decrease such services we would be subject to fierce criticism.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reliefs provided by way of increased allowances to those in the lower income group.  I welcome the proposals which provide that employers may make PAYE calculations deducting the employee's superannuation from the sum, and that this releases this part of his money from taxation.  I also welcome section 3, where the increases in respect of minimum age allowances are adjusted. This Bill mentions a number of persons with whom we, as Deputies, come in contact daily.  For example, single and widowed persons are mentioned in that their allowances are adjusted upwards. This Bill also ensures that persons aged 65 years will enjoy certain relief.  In this context and in this age group people who are entitled to those age allowances will, where their income is wholly earned, obtain the same relief as they would get if their income was wholly unearned.  This is a step which will enable people in this category not to be dependent on the public service.  It will create a desire on the part of those people to do a little better for themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Section 4 of the Bill provides that the married allowances shall go up by £70. A sum of £100 is allowed in the case of a marriage.  This is a good provision because when newly-weds are setting up house they have items of expenditure which they have not foreseen. Deputy Donegan said that there is nothing in this Bill to commend it to him or the House.  I disagree with him in this regard.  No extra taxation has been imposed this year.  This is the first of what we hope may be many steps in this direction.  This would be the right direction in which to go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>We often hear of ambitions here to provide services.  We often talk like people who live on a champagne income rather than a soda water income.  If one takes the matter in this context, we see the extent of our vote and the extent of the budgetary sum here in this House.  We see the many Departments of State which make calls on the budgetary sum.  We meet thousands of people in our everyday dealings during the week, and at functions as Deputies, who have to have resort to the Exchequer resources on the social side.  Therefore, any relief in taxation is good.  Even if we are able to achieve it in only a small way we are proceeding in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other aspects of the Bill could be commended, for example, the increase of £52 in the income limit of a dependent relative in respect of whom the maximum deduction of £60 may be given.  This is a step forward because frequently we find our economic aims clashing with our social aims and it is not easy to reconcile the two.  One meets areas of policy where this clash occurs.  If one has only a certain amount of money one must strike a nice balance in order to distribute it where it will do most good.  We live in <Col N="81" /> a social age and we realise people are living longer.  Last week the Minister for Health told us we had a better chance in life even at the beginning of it and that there was a much higher expectation of life now at the age of 50.  Inevitably, this results in a greater number of dependants especially as most of the public service employees are now called on to retire at 65.</P>
    <P>Last night when reading some articles in this connection I came across some prognostications about what we might expect in the year 2,000 but, to round off the point, the fact that this relief is given for dependent relatives is good.  We are anxious in dealing with social welfare that as people grow older they should be provided for at home, socially, if possible rather than institutionalised. Workers responsible for dependent relatives will find some consolation in this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not too much.  It was £25 in 1939 and it is now £60.  In real terms it is about half what it was in 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is to take it out of its context.  If one looks at budgetary expenditure in that year it has increased since and so have the services accordingly and, therefore, calls on the budget are much greater.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  My point is that any relief in respect of a dependant's allowance is a good one.  It is a social aid and I stand by it.  If one is to compare like with like one must take into account that we are a growing concern.  You cannot compare conditions obtaining in 1939 and those obtaining now.  If you take the growth factor into account, the growth of service, you see that it is much more difficult now to find money for a purpose for which one would like to provide it.  Most of us believe we should have at least reasonably good social conditions.  This is my point, that this Finance Bill strives towards this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="82" /> This is the first time that I have had a sort of friendly feeling towards the Revenue Commissioners.  I cannot say I am an advocate of Revenue but they have bent their activities in a social direction.  Possibly the Minister for Finance had something to do with it but it is for this reason that I think there are many provisions in the Bill which are welcome.  Taking only the first part of the Bill, every section down to section 12, has provisions most of which are calculated either to relieve some taxpayer or allow somebody out of the tax net or relieve the taxpayer by increasing the allowance in respect of a dependant.  In that context I could refer to widows and others who must also earn a living.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am not disposed to agree with Deputy O'Donovan when he said that the Bill makes no appreciable difference.  I think it does.  All else being equal, if we can continue to reduce taxation rather than impose it in any year it is a step forward.  On the other hand, there is growing concern with the growth of taxation because every service provided means that more money will be needed on the capital side or the housekeeping expenditure side.  If you increase social services you must make budgetary provision for it.  If, on the other side, you want to build schools or a hospital you must have recourse to capital funds.  It requires a fine balance in any year to be able to give relief where it is most needed and at the same time be able to develop the public capital programme and expand it with budgetary measures calculated to ease the hardships of the social side of life.</P>
    <P>That is all I propose to say on the Bill.  I think it is a step forward.  I hope we will have an even more socially orientated Bill next year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the last speaker explained to us who are the people who will get relief from the income tax burden and who the people are who are being let out of the tax net as a result of this Bill.  I believe that more and more people are being taken into the income tax net as a result of the very meagre increases <Col N="83" /> given in the income tax allowances to all sections of the community.  Since I came into this House a number of pensioners approached me and asked me about income tax on their pensions. Many of them were ignorant of the fact that they had to pay income tax on their pensions.  They thought it was only paid on wages earned.  Recently the widow of a garda had her full pension stopped for the month of April because of income tax she owed.</P>
      <P>As a result of the system of wage rounds, workers are getting increases more or less on an annual basis.  As a result of the 25p increase in the allowance given to a single person a worker who received £2 under the national wage agreement gets an increase in his tax allowance of 12p but on the other hand he has to pay an extra 50p a week.  The net result of getting an increase of £2 a week is that he has to pay an extra 38p income tax in the week.  If there is a further increase under the second phase of the 13th round, this man will pay more income tax.</P>
      <P>I agree that income tax is a more preferable way of getting money into the Exchequer than getting it under indirect taxation.  Under direct taxation the person who earns money pays according to his ability rather than according to the necessities he has to buy.  Because allowances have been allowed to remain reasonably static during the last few years wage increases are viewed under net value after deduction of taxation.  The Government policy of increasing personal allowances by such small amounts was one of the main factors why so many general workers refused to accept the 14th round national pay agreement. People who have to wait another year before they felt the effect of that agreement saw the possibility of having to pay more and more taxation as a result of this year's budget and, taking into account the increase in the cost of living of from 8 per cent to 10 per cent, the real increase they would get would be very meagre indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer to see people paying their taxes through income tax rather than through turnover tax or VAT but <Col N="84" /> if decent personal allowances are not given to workers and pensioners then the demands by the working sections of the community for further wage increases will continue.  We will then have a continuation of the turmoil we had in the past.  If the Minister felt the budget would have relieved this problem and would have encouraged the working section of the community to accept the terms of the 14th round wage agreement, then he should have looked at the personal allowances and should have gauged the increases in the personal allowances to allow for the increases which workers are likely to receive as a result of the national wage agreement. He should have ensured that the allowances given were net figures and that a worker would know whatever was offered to him was a net figure and not liable for further taxation.</P>
    <P>As long as the present trend in income tax allowances continues, we will not find any great desire by the wage and salary earners to agree to national wage agreements.  The Minister should have known that this was a likely result of his budget policy. He should have gauged the increases to ensure that any wage increases given over the next few years would be net increases and not gross increases which are liable to income tax over and above any relief given in personal allowances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): Deputy Carter hails the budget and this Bill as a step forward socially speaking.  I am afraid, having regard to the reduction in the value of money and the steep increase in the cost of living, it is a very short step forward. Since the introduction of PAYE the Government should have made sure that the application of the income tax code was equitable.  Under the PAYE method of collection there are certain classes who cannot escape the net of the inspector of taxes.  Broadly speaking, they are the people in the lower income group, people who are not earning large sums of money.  They cannot escape the net because their tax is collected from them at source by their employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be conceded that there are <Col N="85" /> certain categories of income tax payers who find it easier than others do to evade their full liability and do, in fact, evade their full liability.  So long as we operate a system of taxation of this type we have a moral duty to do our best, at any rate, to see that justice is done between one type of taxpayer and another.  The income tax code is unjust for the reasons I have given.  While it is possible to enforce it rigidly against one section of the community it is not possible to enforce it rigidly against others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The increase in the single allowance of £50 and in the married allowance of £70 is worthless.  It does not make up for the fall in the value of money.  I do not think there was any increase in the personal allowance last year or in the past few years.  When the personal allowance and the married allowance were introduced into the code I suppose the intention was that the allowance for a single man would at least enable him to keep body and soul together and that the same would apply in the case of a married couple.  Everybody knows that allowances of £299 for a single man and £594 for a married couple do not measure up to present day requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told from time to time by Ministers for Finance that if the personal allowances were to be increased by anything worthwhile it would cost millions.  I suppose that is one of the shortcomings of having a system like this built into our method of financing the State and of collecting our taxes.  Once it becomes built into the system it is impossible to get rid of it without upsetting the whole tax structure.  We have nothing to be proud of in regard to these allowances.  People on smaller incomes are taxed from the very beginning and there is no use in the Minister saying that 50,000 people have been taken out of the tax net. Some just escape it by the skin of their teeth, I suppose.  It would be interesting to know out of those 50,000 how many saved what and how many were relieved from what percentage in <Col N="86" /> pounds and pence.  It sounds well to say that 50,000 have got out of the net but I wonder how much were they paying, or how much were the great majority of them paying?</P>
    <P>Income tax is charged on all sorts of incomes.  It is charged on bank interest once it exceeds £75 per person.  On the question of bank interest, the banks have modernised their methods of doing business.  There have been mergers.  They now believe in running their business on a businesslike basis and charging for services which they rendered free in the past.  They will charge the full cost of keeping customers' accounts and different rates of interest are charged in various cases. If they are to do that they should also allow reasonable interest to customers.</P>
    <P>There are many simple people of the farming type with deposits in banks earning only 3 per cent.  If, instead of having that money on straight deposit, as I shall call it, they had it invested in the finance houses attached to these banks they would get more than double the amount of interest.  If they had it invested in the Agricultural Credit Corporation they would also get more than double the amount of interest. There should be an obligation on the banks to put up a notice in every office drawing the attention of customers to the fact that they could earn more money by putting the money they have on deposit into certain finance houses which are owned by the banks.  They do not do that.  Not only do they not do it, but many bank managers, under instructions I am sure from their directors, conceal this knowledge from the customers and encourage them to leave large sums of money on deposit.  It is amazing to find, as a solicitor, when a deceased person's estate is brought in to you, that thousands of pounds have been lying on deposit for several years resulting in a fantastic loss of interest to the depositor.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter by way of supplementary question and I said that the Minister for Justice should take some steps to make it incumbent on the banks to bring this information to the knowledge of the depositors or himself cause notices to be published in the papers to that effect.  This would <Col N="87" /> be equitable.  Simple people who have inherited the idea that money in the bank is safe and it is not safe any place else are the type of people who are being &ldquo;done&rdquo;.  In recent times all the banks have got control of hire purchase companies of one sort or another, or finance houses, and they lend out money at high rates.  Money is just as safe in those institutions as it it in the banks and it would earn 7 or 8 per cent instead of 3 per cent.  I wanted to get that off my chest.  I hope I have made it clear.</P>
    <P>I should also like to draw attention to the death duties section of the Bill. This is becoming another serious matter for people of comparatively small wealth.  The Bill proposes to increase the exemption from £5,000 to £7,500. With the change in the value of money, with money becoming less and less valuable every day, I do not think this exemption is sufficient.  A house or a farm, certainly a house in the country, that could be bought for £2,000 in 1960 now costs more than £6,000, and a farm which a few years ago could be bought for £1,000 will go to £4,000 or £5,000 nowadays.  The value of property has gone up by leaps and bounds and the value of money has gone down. Therefore, this imposition of death duties at the rates outlined in the Bill &mdash;8 per cent on £15,000 and 10 per cent on £17,500&mdash;is unfair.  At first sight an estate of £17,500 may look very big but a comparatively small farm, fairly well stocked, would be worth that.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, if there is a widow left behind there is an allowance in respect of the duty of £2,000, and there is £1,000 in respect of each dependent child.  If the children are grown up and if it is a case of a grown up married son inheriting the farm which had not been transferred to him more than five years, there is not allowance at all.  He becomes immediately liable for full death duties and this can have a crippling effect.</P>
    <P>I believe there should be a distinction drawn not alone in the case of a widow and dependent children but relief should be given where the farm <Col N="88" /> or business is going to a son.  I know there is no succession duty charged in such cases but I think there should be exemption from death duties.  I do not think it was ever the intention of the people who introduced death duties that they should invade the family farm or business.  That is what they are doing at the present time.</P>
    <P>They are some of the points I wanted to deal with, particularly income tax, bank interest and death duties.  I submit that in future years the Minister for Finance must have a look at death duties because in recent years the period necessary to gain exemption on a gift was increased from three to five years and either last year or the year before, for the first time in the history of this form of taxation, the marriage settlement was abolished for all practical purposes. Until then, a gift by way of marriage settlement was deemed to be a gift for valuable consideration and escaped death duties.  That was abolished and I think it was an anti-social step of the greatest gravity.  Until then the idea was to encourage parents and others to transfer farms and property generally to sons, daughters or other relatives on getting married, and the law recognised that as socially desirable and gave exemption in respect of death duties.  But the Minister for Finance seems to be anxious as far as death duties are concerned to grab and to extract all he can by means of that form of taxation.  I do not think it is socially desirable or socially sound and I ask the Minister to direct his attention to it at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, the key to the merit of this Bill is to be found in the approach of the Opposition speakers.  Deputy Donegan said, and I agree with him readily, in reference to this year's budget that it was very hard to say anything about it.  Coming from a leading member of the Opposition that can be interpreted as his indication that this year's budget was a very good one.  I am quite sure that if it were not Deputy Donegan and others in the Opposition would have had quite an amount to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> Listening to Deputy Fitzpatrick, I was at a loss as to the genuineness of the point with which he started in regard to his concern for the person who might be described as a payer of income tax.  The Deputy seemed to have little regard to the fact that this year 50,000 people were released from payment of income tax.  That is no myth: it is a fact that 50,000 people, having regard to the allowances granted, single, widowed, married and with extra allowances for children, have been relieved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick, having played that section down and reduced it to insignificance, went on to express his concern for the many thousands of people &mdash;I am not sure whether he said they were in his own constituency&mdash;who have bank deposits.  Personally, I try to be concerned for all sections but I must admit, and make no apology about it, that my first concern is for the fellow who has no deposit.  My first concern is for the married man living in Dublin, going out to do his work from 9 to 5 or 9 to 6, endeavouring to pay his rent and other immediate commitments, and who is extremely fortunate if at the end of the week he is able to balance his budget.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the number of that type of person we have in the country we must all if we are sincere welcome the reliefs which have been granted in that area.  To me, that man takes priority over the many thousands whom Deputy Fitzpatrick knows who have deposits in banks and elsewhere and whose only complaint apparently is that the interest which they are getting is not more substantial.  If we pursue that and have regard to the fact that all moneys there should be available for use within the country, the case Deputy Fitzpatrick made is that money should be more expensive to the Government, to the local authorities and to all those bodies who are concerned in the task of improving our economy and the lot of the rest of the community.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick's next priority was death duties&mdash;property. This is the indication we have of the priorities on the benches opposite.  They consider insignificant and immaterial the considerable allowances given to those most deserving of them and they concentrate instead on the pretended plight of the moneyed people, the people of property.</P>
      <P>There is one particular allowance here to which I wish to refer.  It is the allowance of £50 in respect of any child permanently incapacitated.  I am, perhaps, a little critical of the regulations which prevent the Revenue Commissioners looking at a worthwhile case made to them and I welcome this allowance because of an experience I had last year.  I had occasion to plead the case of parents who found themselves with a permanently incapacitated child of ten or 11 years of age.  The father worked overtime and he borrowed in order to get sufficient money to invest in a small car, solely for the purpose of providing that child with some of the amenities that were not available to her otherwise because of her physical condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must, of course, ensure that allowances are not abused.  On the other hand, we should be able at any time to look at a particular case.  I made representations&mdash;I am sure other Deputies also made representations&mdash; and the officials with whom I dealt were most sympathetic.  They agreed that allowance should be made but they told me that, because of the regulations, they could not act as they would wish.  It might be advisable to give the Revenue Commissioners discretionary powers.  Other bodies have these powers.  When we are dealing with <Col N="91" /> human problems there should be no fixed regulations.  Every regulation should be subject to alteration or modification if a case can be made that by so altering or modifying justice is done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision not to make credit unions subject to tax. There is no need for me to elaborate on the excellent work being done by these credit unions.  They are not to be compared with other organisations or institutions in the financial field.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allowance for medical expenses, what I am now about to say arises from circumstances which affected me personally but which are, I think, of general application. That is why I mention the matter.  I pay to the Voluntary Health Insurance something in the region of £45 a year. I am thankful that I have never had to avail of any of the entitlements accruing to me.  However, during the year, as a result of some physical exercise in which I indulged I was not entirely happy about my physical well-being. As a contributor to the VHI I was entitled to enter hospital and occupy a bed for a week or perhaps two weeks. I was not anxious to do that, not because I wanted to save the VHI people money but because I preferred to go about things in another way.  I visited my local doctor.  He sent me to a specialist.  I had X-rays.  There was nothing wrong and my discovery that there was nothing wrong with me cost me something like £22.</P>
    <P>We are advised to have periodic medical checks.  Presumably, if my wife felt like having a periodic check it would cost her a similar amount. The point is, there is no allowance at all for this kind of medical expense. Most people do not like parting with money and if the same circumstances arose next year, and my considerations were purely financial I might take another course and deprive someone more in need of a bed in a hospital. If income allowances are available on the production of certified medical expenses, it is possible that a considerable number of people who are at the moment moving into hospital would be happy to have private consultation.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is going to be let down relatively easy on this Bill in that Deputies are not speaking for very long on it.  I think he has earned it and I do not begrudge it to him.  To begin with, I have great sympathy with Deputy Tunney's point about medical expenses.  In regard to the allowance for £50, it is only the excess over £50 medical expenses that is allowed for.  I see that in the Bill there is now no upper limit and, I suppose, where it really hurts the Minister has made a concession and the public should be grateful.  What I want to talk about is the disgrace of income tax as at present levied.  First of all, there is the legal exemption from income tax of immensely wealthy people. A man who owns 1,000 acres of fertile land pays no income tax.  They can yell all they like about the rates they pay on their land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know well.  You should have heard the horror with which a good lady said to me: &ldquo;We pay £1 a day.&rdquo;  I did not make any remark at all on the subject, but I could have told her what people with very moderate incomes pay in income tax.  I do not believe in levying people on the basis of wealth, although it has been many times suggested.  There have been occasions in England&mdash;I think twice since the war&mdash;when they have had measures like a once-for-all wealth Act, but I do believe that a man who is an efficient farmer and who makes a very big income out of a large area of land should pay income tax the same as a man who has a large public house or who has a large business or has a big salary as a public official, if any public officials <Col N="93" /> any longer have big salaries, relatively speaking; I am not quite sure about this matter, and I am open to conviction.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier when Deputy Fitzpatrick was speaking, the level at which income tax is now levied is savagery.  Let me get back to arithmetical economics for once, although I am extremely suspicious of it normally. There was a time when 1s used to bring in £1 million in income tax.  That was pre-war, and then the day came when 6d used to bring in £1 million. I was just looking at the figures for this year's Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure, and 35p will bring in £175 million, that is to say, that 1p now brings in £5 million.  If it were required from me to demonstrate my point arithmetically there is no simpler and more conclusive method of demonstrating it than that.  It is no answer for the Minister to say: &ldquo;If I make this concession I will lost £20 million.  If I make that concession I will lose £25 million.&rdquo;  Let us look at the figures. The original figure of the yield from income tax in the Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for this year is £183 million, very nearly as much as from customs and excise put together and five times the wholesale tax, the tax on the purchase of luxuries.  I do not think anyone objects to a purchase tax on luxury goods or to such tax being pretty severe, except perhaps the manufacturers of these goods.  However, there is no doubt when one compares, in this social age, as Deputy Carter described it a while ago&mdash;social age in words but not in deeds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Significant relief&rdquo;, my foot.  Literally speaking, it is next to nothing, and the fact that the Minister can quote how many millions it is costing him is a proof of how savage this system is. Let us compare with pre-war years. The relief for a single person at that time was equivalent to £800 a year today.  The Minister is very proud, according to his brief, that he is now increasing the figure for the single person from £240 a year to, I think, £290, that is, by £50; and he is putting up the married relief from £420 to £490, that is, by £70.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is being discussed with amendment No. 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): The object of the amendment which I moved when this Bill was last before the House is to make it mandatory on the Minister for Local Government to hold local elections for the election of Dublin Corporation and Bray UDC in July, 1972.  I moved this amendment in order to force the hand of the Minister to restore Dublin Corporation and Bray UDC.  I fully appreciate that my amendment is not necessary.  I fully appreciate that the Minister for Local Government at any time since he dissolved these councils could have held elections to elect new councils. It is only because the Minister has, to date, shown a complete and utter contempt not for the 45 members of the dissolved City Council or for the nine members of Bray UDC but for the electors of the city of Dublin and the urban district of Bray that I have put down this amendment in order to force his hand to hold elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone has the Minister failed to restore the dissolved councils but he comes in here with this Bill and he postpones the holding of local elections, which were due to take place this month, for a further 12 months and he expects the Dáil to believe that these elections will be held in June, 1973, if this Bill is passed, although he tells us that before the local elections are held the entire system of local administration will be reorganised by a Bill which he will introduce here and hopes to put through the Dáil and Seanad.  He knows perfectly well, if he has given the matter any thought, that what he promises is simply not practicable and that it will just not be possible for him to have these measures through before June, 1973.  It is on that account that I am seeking to compel him to hold elections next month for Dublin Corporation and Bray UDC.  I believe that it is not right that the capital city should be left without a city council and a first citizen.  If what the Minister for Local Government says is correct, that the outgoing councillors behaved in an irresponsible manner, which I do not <Col N="96" /> admit for one moment, that they failed to discharge their statutory duties, then he should have enough confidence to rely on the good sense of the citizens of this city that they will bear that in mind when coming to elect a new council. The important thing is that the citizens of this city should be given an opportunity to elect a city council, that a city council should be elected and that there should be a civic head and a ceremonial head of this city in the person of a lord mayor.</P>
    <P>I have not heard any convincing argument or any argument from the Parliamentary Secretary or from any of the Fianna Fáil TDs for the city of Dublin against my proposition.  I do not think it is necessary, for the purposes of my amendment, that I should defend the action of the outgoing city council.  That is not a relevant consideration for the purposes of this amendment.  What is relevant is whether the citizens of Dublin are to have a city council and a lord mayor at the earliest opportunity.  I believe it is a reflection on this city to be left for any further time without a city council and a lord mayor.  It creates a bad image for the city.  The only argument the Minister can put up, to wit, that he could not rely on the citizens of this capital city to elect a good, suitable and responsible council, is a reflection not alone on the city of Dublin and the citizens of Dublin but is a reflection on the nation.  At a time when we are going into Europe we should not be the odd man out, we should not be the only capital city without a city council and a lord mayor.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stand between the House and any members of the Fianna Fáil Party here who think that they can put up a convincing case against the proposal to elect a city council.  The proposal is not to restore the outgoing council, it is to give the citizens of this city an opportunity of electing a brand new city council of their own choice from whose members a lord mayor would be elected. I want to know what is wrong with that and I want to know what is against it; what is the virtue of continuing the present position with no city council, no lord mayor, with a city commissioner who has a bias <Col N="97" /> from the establishment point of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Cavan</i>): &mdash;&mdash;who has served as secretary of the Department of Local Government for many years, whose whole professional career has been spent in the Custom House?  There is no balance with a commissioner of that sort, a city manager and the Minister for Local Government.  That is the setup at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not attend many political meetings in this city but since I spoke here before I had an opportunity of attending one.  They were talking about amenities and planning and where houses should be built.  One person who did not know about this amendment at all said: &ldquo;There is no communication between the citizens and the corporation; there is no communication between the citizens and the Department of Local Government.&rdquo; How could there be when there was no elected city council in being?  That is one of the things the amendment is about.  It is an effort to establish immediately communication between the citizens of Dublin and the establishment, to give the citizens a right to put their case to a city council who in turn will present it to the city manager and to the Minister for Local Government and whose deliberations will be held in public and be reported in the mass media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I again invite anybody here to make any sound argument against the election of a city council because, if there is such an argument, it means that there is no virtue in having elected councils in any part of Ireland.  That is what it means.  I should like to hear that argument, if it exists.  I have not heard it to date.  I have heard inquests and post-mortems on the former city council, on how and why that city council was dissolved and abolished. I repeat, those inquests and post-mortems are not relevant to this amendment.  What is relevant is whether a city council, composed of responsible persons who would act reasonably, presided over by a lord mayor who would act as the ceremonial <Col N="98" /> head on behalf of the citizens when the occasion arose, is desirable or not.  If it is desirable, it is desirable now.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts the amendment or gives an undertaking that, if the amendment is withdrawn, he will exercise the statutory powers which he has already to hold an election for Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District Council at the earliest possible opportunity, I will be happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean no reflection on the Parliamentary Secretary when I say that the Minister should be in the House to deal with this amendment because of the importance of the amendment and because of the possibility of a decision being taken which will interfere with the rights of the citizens of Dublin and of Bray Urban District.</P>
      <P>Local representatives act in a voluntary capacity.  In rural areas local representatives receive travelling expenses. There is no salary attaching to membership of a local authority.  Local representation is a voluntary form of community effort.  It would be a good thing if Dublin Corporation were restored. In that case there would be 45 representatives of the citizens of Dublin giving their views and helping in the formulation of plans for the city.  There are many urgent problems in regard to Dublin city.  There is an urgent housing problem.  It is of the utmost importance that suitable plans be prepared, that policy be formulated and necessary research carried out.  If there were 45 persons elected to Dublin Corporation, irrespective of their political persuasion, they could contribute a great deal towards the capital city.  It is a tragedy that they are not allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>At present there is one man discharging the duties formerly carried out by the city council.  I have never met this man.  I do not know him.  He is, I am sure, a very dedicated person. However 45 elected representatives would have more to contribute than any individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Democracy is a wonderful thing.  It should be interfered with only when it is not working properly.  The section of the Bill which it is proposed to <Col N="99" /> amend interferes with the democratic rights of the citizens of Dublin.

One might say that the Bill would have some effect on the membership of this House by reason of the fact that one of the avenues to membership of the House is membership of a local authority.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I was indicating that membership of a local authority is one <Col N="100" /> of the ways of entering into politics. This is true of the country in general but to a greater degree of Dublin.  If the local elections were held now, there would be quite a few changes in the membership of Dublin Corporation. Perhaps ten or 15 people might lose their seats and be replaced by others and this could lead to a change in the personnel of this House. There should be a changeover in the personnel engaged in politics.  The worst thing that can happen a democracy is stagnation, where the same people represent parties, the same people represent constituencies and the same people represent county councils and corporations.  If this amendment is not accepted the people of Dublin will be prevented from having this change, and this is wrong. None of us has the right to be here permanently; we were elected at a particular time for a particular period and it would be just as wrong for the Taoiseach to try to extend our period in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is wrong that the Dublin Corporation are not allowed to have new representatives who will have new ideas.  One of the reasons the Government will not accept this amendment is that they are afraid to face the electorate in Dublin city.  They were hammered here in the presidential election, in the last general election and in the last local government election and they do not want to face the electorate.  The second reason may be that they want to hold on to party funds for any general election that might arise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am convinced that it is a combination of all these factors that has led them to refuse to accept this amendment.  It is important that elections for Dublin Corporation should be held.  Anyone who votes against this amendment is doing an injustice to the citizens of Dublin.  We should treat our democracy with care but we will not do this if we refuse <Col N="101" /> to give the people of Dublin a chance to elect a corporation.</P>
      <P>Politicians do not like elections but they are necessary.  There is a grave obligation on the Government to see that these elections are held.  It is one thing not to want elections but the obligation to hold them rests squarely on the Government.  Deputy Moore may say that the members of the corporation voted themselves out of office because they did not strike a rate.  That is history.  We are in a different period and we should look forward to the future.  Anyone who votes against this amendment is thinking only of the past.</P>
      <P>I could go into the reasons the 45 members of the corporation voted against striking a rate but I am not allowed to do that according to the rules of this House.  If I had been a member of Dublin Corporation, as a protest to show where the corporation stood on the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Enright mentioned a matter I should like to refer to, namely, that the Minister should be here to take these amendments and, presumably, the entire Bill. I should like to explain the circumstances. The Minister has been ill and in hospital.

      <P>This is the very purpose for which these amendments were put down.  I want to put on the <Col N="104" /> record again the reasons for having local elections postponed, and the same reasons apply to Dublin.  It was agreed generally by all parties that there should not be any other matter under consideration for decision by vote at the time of the referendum, that it would not be right to have local elections so close to the referendum, and secondly, that as legislation is being drafted to reorganise local authorities and is to be introduced at an early stage such elections should be postponed. This includes any local elections which might be held in Dublin because Dublin is one place where proposals for wide reorganisation are being considered and even suggested by various groups.  Deputy Byrne complained that the city is spilling into the county, with people resident in the county living in corporation houses and that there are all sorts of problems.  Deputy Clinton has said the same with regard to some of the problems his constituents pose to him.  In view of the fact that the Bill postpones local elections throughout the country until June of next year and that this is the end of June 1972&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If this Bill passes legally we must hold them next year. I am surprised at a solicitor asking such a question.  It is provided for in the Bill.  It would be unrealistic to have elections some time within the next two months for Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban Council and have elections again in June, having in the meantime a reorganisation of local government. I want to get those points on the record again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment that elections to Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban Council be held in July of this year.  I think that the people of this city and of Bray do not fully realise exactly what they have been deprived of.  I do not think they will know fully the consequences of their loss of local representatives until Dublin City Council is restored and the questions that should have been asked and the matters that should have been examined since 1969 are asked and examined, but, unfortunately, at that point it will be far too late.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick said that why Dublin Corporation was dissolved is of no real importance now.  I think it is of considerable importance now because what happened in relation to the abolition of Dublin Corporation has been distorted, and to some extent successfully distorted, by the Government Party since 1969.  I say that because very briefly the facts are that a public commitment was made by a Fianna Fáil Minister, the late Deputy Donogh O'Malley, who was at that time Minister for Health.  He made a public commitment that no additional increases in health charges would be levied on the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was in 1966 and the members of Dublin Corporation and I might say&mdash;there are two former lords mayor of Dublin city who are members of Fianna Fáil here&mdash;including Fianna Fáil members, did everything possible to have that commitment honoured.  They sought meetings with the Ministers for Health, Local Government and Finance of the day.  Eventually, a meeting took place between representatives of Dublin Corporation, including Fianna Fáil members, and the Taoiseach together with the then Ministers for Local Government, Finance and Health but because there was an absolute refusal to honour the commitment, the majority of the elected councillors of Dublin Corporation decided that they could not strike a rate that would include the additional charges for the year 1969.  Despite the distortion of the facts by Fianna Fáil there never was any question of Dublin Corporation not striking a rate.  They did strike a rate and all they excluded from that rate were the current increases of 1969 for health charges.  They did that in an effort to honour a public commitment which was made on their behalf by a Fianna Fáil Minister.</P>

      <P>As a member of that corporation at the time I have no regrets for voting as I did then.  However, I would have regrets if I had failed to honour my commitment to the people who had elected me.  Should the same sort of situation arise tomorrow I would have no hesitation whatever in putting the interests of my constituents before the interests of the Fianna Fáil Party or of any party that happened to be in government even if that party happened to be my own party.  The only reason why Dublin Corporation were abolished was because Fianna Fáil, having enjoyed a monopoly on Dublin Corporation for many years, had lost control of that corporation.  After the elections of 1967 the Fianna Fáil representatives were in the minority on the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard certain members of the <Col N="107" /> dissolved corporation stating that the Minister at the time had no alternative. Of course, there were several alternatives available to the Minister.  For example, whatever money was not struck in relation to the increase in the health charges could have been secured from the city treasurer by way of a court order.  Another way that the matter could have been dealt with was that Dublin City Council could have been left in existence and left to figure out how they would pare their losses with regard to health charges.  Former members of Dublin Corporation, particularly Deputy Dowling, have stood up here and elsewhere and stated that the corporation would not strike a rate to pay the workers of Dublin City Council, that they would not strike a rate to provide such services as street cleaning.  Of course, that is a falsehood. It was the loss of control of the council on the part of Fianna Fáil that led them to abolish the council and the only reason why the council has not been restored is because Fianna Fáil know now, as they have known since 1969, that the citizens of Dublin are not prepared to give them a majority at local government level.</P>

Even if there was a valid reason for postponing local elections throughout the country, what valid reason have we been given for continuing to deprive the people of Dublin and of <Col N="108" /> Bray from proper democratic local representation?  We were told that the elections could not he held at the time of the referendum because we should not confuse the two issues.  A child would not accept that excuse.  The referendum was held on 10th May and we are told now that it could confuse the issue to hold the elections in July. We are told also that the elections will be held in 1973 when there could be no confusion.  Are the Government not aware that there must be a Presidential election in 1973?  That is one they cannot postpone, although they might find it desirable to do so.  Are they not aware also of the probability of a general election in 1973?</P>

      <P>There were 45 elected representatives with six committees which met regularly and questioned, examined, queried and made suggestions and put forward the view of the people they represented.  At least once a month there was a public meeting at which the appropriate officials were present.  The 45 elected representatives were present and any aspect of local government which affected the living conditions of the people, such as housing, was publicly debated.  Decisions taken had to be publicly justified.  What is the situation now?  It is that there is one man&mdash;and I have nothing personal against him because I never met him and have never spoken to him&mdash; who goes in and is handed reports by officials and who rubber-stamps those reports.  No questions are asked.  I want to be fair and clear about this.</P>

Although they were all of those things, very often there was a clash between them and the elected representatives because what was expedient for them was not, in the opinion of the elected representatives, the best method of doing something.

      <P>We fail to understand why Fianna Fáil intend to vote against this amendment to restore Dublin City Council.  Tenants associations and other people in Dublin find this inexplicable. The Fianna Fáil Party pretend that the people are represented, but we know they are not.  Recently we had the situation in Coolock where members of the Garda Síochána and tenants in that area came to blows and many of them were injured.  If Dublin had a city council some of this steam could have been let off in the council chamber and it need not have come to the situation we had in Coolock. When a situation has arisen where people in this city feel so strongly deprived of their rights that they are willing to stand up and fight against the law, the Government should be prepared to accept this amendment. Tenants associations in my constituency have expressed surprise that Dublin TDs in the Fianna Fáil Party will vote against the amendment to immediately restore the city council.</P>

      <P>If it were possible for any Deputy representing a city consituency who is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, to give an adequate explanation as to why they will vote against amendment No. 3, then I would think that all things are possible.  The Fianna Fáil Deputies have my greatest sympathy because they are forced into <Col N="119" /> doing something which will cause many of them to lose their Dáil seats in the next year or so.  Every person is so conscious of the acts of representatives of this country that for many people in the Fianna Fáil Party who got in here by the skin of their teeth it means they will not come back in here.  It means they will find it very difficult to get back on to the corporation. Last August I was in Santry Stadium when Deputy Frank Cluskey's trophy was presented.  He was the last lord mayor and this was the lord mayor's trophy.  We had no lord mayor or council representatives there.</P>

I am in favour of the immediate return of Dublin Corporation so that people like the members of ACRA can discuss their alternatives with people who are representing them.  They cannot do that at present. It was a year before they received any communication from the Department of Local Government.  There was nobody to represent the city of Dublin recently when the 12 German naval ships came into the port.  We had nobody to greet them officially.  We had nobody to greet the victorious Irish amateur boxing team when they came back from the Golden Gloves Trophy recently.  There was no lord mayor to give them a reception.  There were no members of the council available to meet them at the airport and welcome them back.  What will happen after Munich if we happen to have a winner over there?  Will there be a lord mayor in Dublin then?  Now is an opportune time to restore the corporation.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems quite a while since I was last speaking on this matter.  We had quite an interesting session in between; I do not think certain contributions added anything to the matter under discussion, but we had a most interesting hour and a half. Let me try now to get back on an even keel.  Deputy Carter talked about this being a social age and about the Minister having increased the income a dependent relative might have while the person supporting that dependent relative could still get credit for income tax on £60.  The way Deputy Carter was talking one would think this would <Col N="127" /> make a millionaire out of that person. One would think it was worth about £1,000 a year.  The fact is it is income tax on £60 and, before the war, it would have been the equivalent of income tax on £125 at the very least, perhaps on £150, and, therefore, this income tax relief on £60 which is supposed to be so valuable is really, relatively speaking, worth little or nothing. Before the year is out it will be worth still less.</P>
      <P>Earlier today, when the Minister was not here, there were references to the £ floating.  I am afraid it is floating downwards or, as I said myself, it is sinking; the £ will be allowed to sink rather than float.  Strangely enough, that is a word with a peculiar meaning in the financial world.  Speaking for myself, I am all in favour of floating the £.  I assume it will float, though I am doubtful that it will.  So long as it floats I am all in favour of free exchange rates.  Rigidity in exchange rates is like the Fianna Fáil Party's monolithic attitude.  A few weeks ago here I was pulling the Minister's leg about something that had happened at a meeting in Europe and I asked him what had happened to the agreement made before last Christmas.  The Minister said that this was all past.  What happened to the agreement in which he took part a month or five weeks ago?  How is it doing?  I think the Minister knows how it is doing.  The Minister is having a tough time.  He is doing a great deal of hard work. Actually, I have a soft heart though I throw out an occasional barb.  I do not like punching holes in a man who has been working as hard as the Minister has been recently.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney talked about reliefs being granted.  The one relief that should have come&mdash;it should have been give years ago&mdash;is the raising of the level at which income tax is imposed. That is the one relief which would be worth something to the ordinary worker.  It is outrageous that a man with £1,200 a year is still paying income tax, even if he has two children.  This is a disgrace.  The same man pre-war, with no children, was free of income tax.  This is the real disgrace in our income tax code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> The other disgrace is the exemption about which I was speaking before business was interrupted.  Those who own the only real wealth in this country are the people who own the land. People may talk about mines, real or imaginary, about factories and everything else, but the only real wealth is the land.  The idea that people who work the land and make large incomes out of it should be free of income tax is one of the greatest absurdities in modern times.  It is proof that we as a people are conservative in the extreme.  It is the right foot of what I was talking about a while ago, on which there is little pressure.</P>
    <P>If we had a generally progressive social outlook we would insist on wealthy farmers paying their income tax.  I come from a farming background and I also did some farming myself for about five years when it was neither profitable nor popular.  It was during the war years and I was looking after a grazing farm; I had to till 30 per cent of the land and that was no joke when there were no preparations for doing the job.  To make the situation much worse, just the same as the situation about which protests were made in the United States, wealthy people have devious ways of getting out of paying income tax.  Legal and illegal evasion of tax both occur. The wealthy people are better at using the legal methods of evading tax, whereas the less wealthy people very often have to use illegal methods.</P>
    <P>It shocks me to think that a single person who now has only half the real income that a man had before the war should be paying a sizeable amount of income tax.  It shocks me still more that a man with a wife and two children should still be paying a sizeable amount of income tax on an income of £1,200 a year, when pre-war a married couple with no children, with the equivalent of £1,200 a year, paid no income tax.  This is the disgrace of this Finance Bill.  Everything else in the Finance Bill is only dotting i's and crossing t's and messing around with the way these Bills are drafted, this deplorable method of legislation over the years resulting in the fact that no ordinary person can understand this code of legislation at <Col N="129" /> all.  This is a great trick.  It suits the fellows who make their incomes out of construing the Acts on behalf of the taxpayer and it suits the fellows who administer the system because they cannot be put on the spot by any ordiary person.  They are not subject to the ordinary sanctions to which a civil servant administering any other code is subject.</P>
    <P>It was said by one of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who spoke tonight that it was very hard to say anything about this Bill and that was proof that the Bill was good.  This is not the case, of course.  The reason why it is impossible to say anything about this Bill is that the Bill contains little or nothing.  The Minister talks about 50,000 people being taken out of the net.  Is it 650,000 or 700,000 people who are now in the net?  I remember quite well&mdash;it seems only yesterday&mdash;when there were fewer than 200,000 people in this net. The smart aleck answer from those benches will be: &ldquo;People are so much wealthier now than they were then that they are all paying income tax.&rdquo; That is not the reason at all.  The reason is that the value of money has gone down and down and income tax in real terms has gone up and up and up, and it has left the unfortunate worker who is trying to feed his family and clothe and educate them, in the direct position.  To go back to what we were discussing for the last hour and a half, that is the reason why the people who live in the city have no use at all for the Fianna Fáil Party, and they are right, because ordinary decency would require that some bow should be made in the direction of exempting from income tax people who are at subsistence level.  As that tough old man, Ricardo, said so long ago, subsistence varies from time to time and what is subsistence level in one age is not subsistence level in another age.  Accordingly, many people are paying income tax at present who in any age would not have had to pay income tax, and they would not have had to pay income tax before the first world war, let alone before the second world war, although the level of income tax at that time was 6d or 1s in the £.</P>
    <P>That is the aspect of this Bill that <Col N="130" /> I deplore.  It is no use the Minister saying: &ldquo;If I reduced the rate of tax or raise the level of exemption it would cost me tens of millions.&rdquo;  It would cost him so many tens of millions because he is collecting this year £175 million in income tax.  This is far and away the biggest part of the revenue. Up to comparatively recently, ten years ago, the income that came from customs and excise was very much bigger than the amount of money that came into the Exchequer from income tax.  The whole thing has changed and has changed by the deliberate policy of not altering the exemption level as the value of money has fallen.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the concession the Minister has given this year will be worthless. Already the floating of the pound, or whatever has happened to it, has already taken most of it away.  In any event, it was merely restoring what was given in 1970 and taken back last year.  Therefore, despite the fact that the value of money has depreciated at the rate of 10 per cent a year, we are now back where we were in 1970.  In other words, the people will be paying income tax at a level at which they are 20 per cent worse off in real terms than they were in 1970.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I shall allow the Minister to explain if he wants to. Is he talking about the 9.5 per cent increase in prices one year and the 8.5 per cent increase in another?  Is he talking about 18 per cent instead of 20 per cent?</P>

      <P>I shall try to deal with this point when I am replying, but I would suggest to the Deputy that if he wants to make the comparison the only way to do it is to take figures in terms of real increases in income and to compare post-tax income of one period with that of another, adjusting for the fall in the value of money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister is not, because what I am saying is quite simple.  Let me become technical about it for a moment.  This fall in the value of money is a compound thing.  The 8.5 per cent by which prices are only supposed to have gone up last year is compound on the 100 plus the 9.5 per cent by which they went up the year before.  I can stand over my figure.  The Minister may take it for certain that, this being the end of June, he having introduced the budget five or six weeks ago, that even if my 20 per cent, compared with 1972, was wrong by one percentage point when the Minister introduced his budget it is no longer wrong.  That degree of inaccuracy has already been rectified.  It will be rectified more and more as time goes on.  He will only have to wait a week or two and my figure will be quite accurate.  I promised the Minister he would get an easy run on this out of our kindness of heart since he is having such a tough time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has met one or two points in which I was particularly interested.  I am very glad to see that he has been able to do something for the pensioners. People on fixed incomes will always have my sympathy.  Whether they are on higher or on lower incomes it is extremely difficult for people with fixed incomes to face the phenomenal rise in the cost of living. It has gone out of all proportion. However, that is not relevant to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with one or two other points I put to him but there is one thing about which I must express extreme dissatisfaction.  The Minister is not the first Minister for Finance to whom I have expressed dissatisfaction about estate duty.  I have always thought that this country has a golden opportunity of doing something which no other country is doing and something that would not cost the Exchequer very much.  The collection of estate duty probably entails a good deal of expenditure.  I have never been <Col N="132" /> able to ascertain from any Minister what it costs to collect estate duty. The amount of estate duty must be variable from year to year.  People who were not within the confines of estate duty previously and not likely to be so are brought into it now.  I do not know whether the Minister knows the extreme hardship estate duty is causing in all sections of the community.  A recent speaker referred to the farmers, the easy time they have in life generally, how they do not pay income tax <i>et cetera.</i> It is the farming community and the type of farmer who is the backbone of agricultural production, the man who has between 55 and 80 or 90 acres, who is hardest hit by estate duty.  I have had innumerable cases of hardship in my constituency where the breadwinner passed on unexpectedly.</P>
    <P>A 70-acre farm at present, if it is good land, is often valued at £200 or £300 an acre.  I am not as good a mathematician as the Minister for Finance so I will leave him to work that out.  A farm of that size carries a good deal of farm machinery because it is quite impossible to get labour. There could be several thousand pounds worth of machinery on such a farm. A 70-acre farm would carry about £4,000 worth of stock.  If one looks at the figure at the back page of this Bill one will see the high rate of interest that is payable.  When the breadwinner dies unexpectedly in the prime of life, the widow finds herself having to face, perhaps, a charge from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, a bank or something like that with no funds at her disposal and she must sell all the stock to give money to a predatory State.  I do not think this is sensible. I do not think it is in the national interest and it greatly militates against national production which is so essential.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the professional arena. I do not know the price of a house in Dublin but in a town like Arklow a small house costs £6,000.  I should imagine that a house of any size in Dún Laoghaire or Dublin would be worth about £20,000.  Possibly there is a life insurance.  I understand that although there are certain remissions on that it <Col N="133" /> is included in the overall capital. Generally speaking, estate duty is causing hardship to all the professional classes.  Let us look at the business arena.  Take a garage, for instance.  If one takes the stock, the premises, the spare parts <i>et cetera</i> it would run up to £30,000.  There is an 18 per cent duty on that which imposes tremendous hardship.  The answer to my mind is so simple.  I have brought it in here year after year.  I must be boring Dáil Éireann.  I am not asking for the total abolition of estate duty though I think it would be an advisable thing to do.  It would be a courageous thing for a Minister for Finance to do.  It would be a beneficial thing for the country.  If we were free of estate duty many non-nationals would ask to be domiciled here with regard to taxation generally.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have asked successive Ministers for Finance to deduct the capital allowances that are made from the overall estate.  As I read this document, £7,500 is free of estate duty in the case of a single man.  It is higher for married people and people with dependent children.  I am asking that the amount should be deducted from the total estate.  That would give the Minister the inflow of the necessary capital.  Our major problem here is that we have been short of capital.  We have to use every form of inducement. We have to give huge grants to people to start factories <i>et cetera.</i> If we were to give them suitable facilities with regard to taxation, we would not have to do these things.  We would be able to save from the finances that are dovetailed into the IDA, the ACC and such semi-State bodies.  I have put down an amendment on a couple of occasions and I have been unable to get a vote.  I have been unable to get the support I felt I was entitled to for it.  As far as this year is concerned, we have this unsatisfactory figure and I am afraid that will continue.  I hope for anybody who lives another 12 months or more that the Minister will consider this for the future.  I can assure him he will go down in history if he does so as having struck a blow in regard to innovation in taxation which would be acceptable, not only to one class of society, but to all, because <Col N="134" /> practically everybody is caught in the income tax net now.</P>
    <P>Now I want to deal with surtax. A few years ago a reference to sur-tax would have aroused indignation among all the democrats in the House. A Deputy who referred to it would have been regarded as being right-wing, as being interested only in rich people. The figure at which surtax operates is £2,500.  The Minister will accept that that is not a big income nowadays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, of course, that that is £2,500 of assessable income, that is, after all allowances have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully appreciate that.  I am one of those who speak on behalf of the community as a whole.  There are many people earning £3,000 and £4,000 a year who, because of income tax, the cost of living, the cost of educating their children and so on, are not necessarily well off. They find that the more they earn the more income tax they pay.  This reduces efficiency.  That was found to be the case in the United Kingdom. After the war when, in some cases, profits were considerable, it was found that surtax at the then existing level militated against production and efficiency. The level was raised.</P>
      <P>I do not think it is realistic to impose surtax at the level of £2,500 a year income.  I fully accept that there are personal and other allowances.  The Minister should review the matter.  As far as I can read from the document before me, an income of £4,500 is liable to 15 per cent surtax in addition to the standard rate; £6,500, to 30 per cent, and up to £50,000 a year to 45 per cent.</P>
      <P>Persons in the lower income group are engaged in production and in securing the continuity of employment.  In the case of those in the higher income group, the State takes a vast sum of money and not sufficient is left to the producer to plough back into industry. Crippling taxation hits the small man because it militates against the creation of employment opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, practically everybody pays income tax.  An old age pensioner <Col N="135" /> who is a widower without dependants, who goes back to work as an agricultural labourer, pays about £3.50 in income tax.  I have mentioned the higher income group and the middle income group and the person at the lowest point of the lower income group scale.  We have got to the stage where there is no incentive to work.  That is why production is at a low level and is decreasing.  The people are less well off than they were.  Business is not good; money is not available.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donovan who is a financial expert or an economist, suggested that farmers are not taxed. Of course, the farmers are taxed.  The Deputy said that farmers pay £1 an acre in rates.  I have 200 acres and I pay £1,000 a year in rates.  That represents £5 an acre.  A large proportion of the 200 acres is under wood, pleasure gardens and lakes, which are of no monetary value.</P>
    <P>The Minister has inherited a system whereby the country is strangled. Heavy taxation is imposed on everybody. I believe in a free economy, in private enterprise.  Success should be encouraged.  What encouragement is there to a trade union member to work overtime when every penny received in overtime is absorbed in income tax?  There are income tax collectors whose job is to collect as much money as they can.  Gradually, the commercial life of the country is being strangled.  When we go into the EEC on 1st January next, we will have to complete with other countries.  To put us in a position to do that, production must be increased and made efficient.  There must be an incentive. What incentive is there if everything a worker earns is collected by the Revenue Commissioners?</P>
    <P>We have a glorious opportunity here. We have a great deal to offer that other countries in Europe have not got.  The taxation system that has developed here has practically destroyed enterprise. I understand that the Government will hang on to office at all costs, fearful, perhaps, of what the Minister describes as the socialistic menace that is on us now.  The Minister has 12 months in which to produce a good financial policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill and the statement of the Minister should be considered in the context of the great demand in our community for increases in income and for some form of price stabilisation.  I do not think this Finance Bill makes a really effective contribution towards what we on these benches want, namely, a more socially just taxation system.  Such a taxation system as we advocate would enable one to say to the taxpayers in our society, predominantly wage and salary earners, that our taxation system affords real opportunities of increasing their real incomes and at the same time assists in the stabilisation of prices.  The Bill gives no indication of having been drafted according to that concept.</P>
      <P>One has to consider this Bill in the context of the other forms of taxation in operation, particularly the central government taxation system, the taxation on commodities, such as the VAT, the question of social insurance contributions and the rating system.  It is impossible to consider the Finance Bill without referring automatically to these areas of Government taxation.  However, I will confine my comments to what is proposed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to this Bill, one could ask to what extent does it give a balance of advantage to different income groups?  To what extent can we be reasonably certain that a balance of advantage is transferred to the lower income group?  I do not think the Bill contains any serious evidence that this concept underlines the Government's approach to taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally the Minister will state that <Col N="137" /> because of this Bill some 50,000 persons have been removed from the taxation net and that, hey presto, we have a more egalitarian system of taxation, that a more redistributive system of taxation has been introduced. This is a rather superficial interpretation of the purpose of a Finance Bill, namely, to introduce fundamental reforms in our community which would be widely distributive and more egalitarian.</P>
    <P>I would stress that in no way does the Bill meet the essential need for the substantial transfer which is needed from the better-off sections of the community to the poorer sections.  The Bill does not meet that fundamental criterion of political administration. The concessions contained in the Bill are quite marginal.  This is the only summing-up that one can do of the Bill. I would suggest to the Minister that if his Department undertook an in-depth analysis of the evolution of our taxation system during the past five or ten years they could come up with ample evidence that there is a transfer to the relatively better-off sections of the community. I challenge the Minister to face up to that assertion.</P>
    <P>If the Minister consults the staff of the ESRI, or the Revenue Commissioners, or if he considers the studies which may be available to him, he could discover that the real incidence of taxation on different income groups is much different from what we imagine it to be.  He could also discover that the alleged benefits accruing to different sections of the community from public spending are different from what we imagine them to be.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is evidence that the impact of total taxation on the lower-paid workers is highly regressive and that it is grossly unfair.  A simple examination of the income tax system in the context of the overall burden of taxation will show this.  For example, in 1971-72 income tax paid by wage and salary earners amounted to almost £100 million&mdash;a phenomenal growth of payment by wage and salary earners. The extraordinary thing about that figure is that it is £25 million more than it was in the previous year.  In other words, it represents a growth of <Col N="138" /> one-third from wage and salary earners in a period of 12 to 15 months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  A lot of that increase was due to last year's Finance Bill to which some Deputies objected most strenuously&mdash;I cannot recall Deputy Desmond's attitude on the matter.  Its effect was to get tax from people who either had not been paying tax before or were so delaying it that the value of the tax to the Exchequer was reduced.  That is the main reason for the substantial increase&mdash;it is not the only one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The total earnings of wage and salary earners are about £930 million per year.  Out of that amount in 1971-72 the aggregate payment of income tax is £100 million&mdash; a jump of £25 million, or one-third more than in the previous year.  I do not agree with everything Deputy O'Donovan says but on this matter he has a valid point when he speaks about the massive imbalance that is developing in our taxation structure. This is highlighted in this Bill in relation to income tax and its effect on the one million labour force in this country.</P>
      <P>One might consider the simple statistics of farmer's incomes&mdash;this is conventionally estimated in our income account at £210 million a year.  There is no income tax payable on this amount.  What contribution is made out of that £210 million towards the central taxation income?  This is where there is a tremendous imbalance.  The incomes of the farmers have increased substantially in the past five years, and this is to be welcomed.  This increase has been particularly based on growth of prices.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that now there is a situation where the incidence of taxation on wage and salary earners is getting more and more regressive. At the same time the farmers' incomes are increasing with no attempt by the Government to come to grips with the serious income problem that is developing. I stress we are speaking about a substantial minority of wealthy farmers who do not pay income tax but who should be included in the income tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="139" /> It would be unpopular for any Minister for Finance to come to grips with that social problem but I consider it scandalous and disgraceful that many wealthy farmers on a certified and verified cash income do not pay income tax.  This is at a time when wage and salary earners who earn £1,200 per annum must pay income tax.</P>
    <P>There is that problem, and the other very serious problem facing the Minister which I do not think is effectively dealt with in this Finance Bill.  It is widely believed, and I think there is reasonable evidence of it in our community, that some categories of professional groups and business people in our community gain from substantial tax evasion.  I do not think the Minister would deny it.  I see some of the loopholes, a few of the valuable loopholes particularly in relation to the setting up of the dummy company and the second company covered later on in his statement, and I am glad the Minister has closed off that loophole because certain people made very substantial five-figure fortunes in this community over the past three years because of failure to close that gap.  It is now closed to some extent, but it is still true to say that there is a widespread belief in our community that some professional categories are, taxation-wise, getting away with murder, to put it quite bluntly, and that there are still substantial opportunities open to them for tax avoidance, exemption and evasion, if they want to be dishonest enough to go in for tax evasion as such.</P>
    <P>To sum up on this aspect of the Bill, there are serious defects and serious omissions which have been evident in successive Finance Bills and are evident in this Bill.  These are four omissions of which I would be very critical.  There is the failure to bring certain wealthy categories of farmers&mdash; and I stress the qualification&mdash;under the income tax code on the basis of their actual incomes.  This is a serious omission from the Bill.  Secondly, the Minister must give serious consideration, not so much on the basis of the revenue he will receive because it will not be that large&mdash;I suggest not more <Col N="140" /> at most than about £700,000 or £800,000 a year&mdash;to bringing in a section relating to capital gains tax to prevent the accumulation of large private fortunes at the expense of the general good of the community.  I have no objection to anybody accumulating a large private fortune, provided he does not do it at the expense of the taxpayer and of our social structure.  If he can do it through entrepreneurial ability, through legitimate business undertaking, the best of luck to him, but the Minister should not permit a situation where the absence of a capital gains tax now almost acts as an incentive to the accumulation of large private fortunes.  This is an anomaly and it is a gap which must be closed quite definitely.  Of course, we want to see the third gap closed to which I have referred, the simple tax evasion and avoidance and the deliberate and fraudulent evasion of liability by some sections of the community.  These to me are the gaps in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to only two other aspects, the first of which is in relation to the Minister's reference to the new code of tax dealing with superannuation schemes for employed persons and the application of the new code to occupational pension schemes generally. I am reasonably certain that there will be a change of Government, reasonably certain that there will be a new political administration. We urgently need an alternative Government, and I think that one of the immediate priorities of that Government will be to bring into operation, as exists in all progressive western European democracies, a national occupational pension scheme that will provide with the existing retirement pension an income amounting to two-thirds of earnings at retirement. There is nothing particularly novel about this proposition but it is a proposition which I would hope to see embodied in future Finance Bills.  It would be my ambition, if I had anything to do with any alternative administration, to see a completely new national occupational pension scheme in operation.  This would mean a completely new realignment of the social insurance system and of the <Col N="141" /> existing occupational pension schemes and one would have a situation where one would develop the kind of approach that was developed in relation to the Crossman Pensions Act in Britain.</P>
    <P>One way or another, I would submit to the Minister in reference to his statement that the existing tax law governing occupational pension schemes is being repealed as from 6th April, 1980, that, with due respect to him, an alternative administration, a new Government, will not be working on that basis.  I do not want to confuse the occupational pension companies any more than they are confused at present and the Bill does materially affect the schemes they administer, but I think we can say legitimately on this side that given the opportunity, we will have a universally applied new national occupational pension scheme which would marry in the existing retirement pension schemes, providing massive transferability within them and on superficial examination of the pension schemes in existence in Sweden, Belgium and France&mdash;now that we are about to enter the EEC, we might as well adopt the more progressive things they have&mdash;I say to the Minister that the proposition related to 1980 is not likely to gain much favour at any level.</P>
    <P>The final point I would make in relation to the Bill is the failure of the Government to include in it a separate and completely new section as I would wish to see brought in dealing with capital gains made from land sales transactions.  I think this must be brought in if we are to have a socially just society and there is no point in having marginal taxation palliatives within a Finance Bill, giving slight relief to various sections of the community, if they are to be crucified when they try to buy a house or to come to grips with the enormous increase in the price of building land over recent years.</P>
    <P>I would hope that before the introduction of the next Finance Bill there would be a change of Government but I would hope too that in the context of such a Bill a strenuous effort would be made to bring in the necessary statutory provisions whereby the present <Col N="142" /> exemption on capital gains arising from land sale transactions, outside of the company context, would be closed off in no uncertain manner.  A really progressive Finance Bill would ensure that the increments in land values, created by and large by the actions of the community through the rates system, through the building up of better water and sanitary services and by way of planning decisions, would accrue to the community and that no part of that land value created by the community would accrue to speculative land owners and speculators.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the serious deficiencies that I see in relation to the Bill.  The Bill gives no cause to anybody to rejoice.  The question is simply one of marking time.  On close examination of the Bill one finds, particularly in relation to income tax, that we are going backwards in terms of a more egalitarian and a more redistributive system of taxation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy is proposing tax incentives for group farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing the removal of a tax disincentive to group farmers and in this context I refer to an OECD survey that was published in Paris in 1971 on group farming.  This country was not covered in the survey. It was stated in this publication that in other cases, particularly in Belgium and Germany but also in the northeast of the Netherlands, there was undoubted interest in group farming and that a number of groups had been formed.  This, according to the report, <Col N="143" /> was not occurring openly nor was the movement spreading and was due largely to taxation difficulties.  It stated that there was no specific legislation for farming groups which, therefore, were treated for taxation purposes as industrial or commercial undertakings and which lose consequently the tax concessions available to individual farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my contention that that situation obtains here also and that farmers forming themselves into a group in order to pool their activities and, possibly, their land so that they might have a more viable unit while still retaining the same number of people on the land in full employment, are at a disadvantage in doing this because of the present tax situation.  As I understand it, the position at the moment is that a farmer acting alone as a farmer is exempt from income tax so far as his profits from farming are concerned.  However, if he were to join with his neighbours and form a group in the form of a co-operative, his income would then be derived in one of two ways: he could become an employee of the new co-operative but as an employee he would be taxable because at present employees of any co-operative are subject to income tax. The alternative might be that he could take his income in the form of a dividend declared by the co-operative but in that case also he would be brought within the tax net because dividends declared by co-operatives are subject to income tax.  Therefore, the formation of an agricultural co-operative would mean that a farmer would lose the tax exemptions that he enjoys as an individual farmer.  A similar position would obtain if a company were formed in that a farmer, if he were to become an employee of that company, would be subject to income tax even though his income was being derived from agriculture.  However, if such a company were to declare a dividend it is possible, I think, that the dividend would come within the scope of the present exemption for income derived from agriculture but, as I understand it, the added disadvantage in such case would be that the company would be <Col N="144" /> liable not only for income tax but also for corporation profits tax.  Therefore, a company engaged in farming in this way would run the risk of a higher level of taxation than would apply to the members acting as individual farmers.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert on these matters and it is possible that I have been inaccurate on some aspects of it.  However, I am aware that the IAOS are very concerned about this particular problem and they have studies it in much greater detail than I have done. They have made representations to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and to the Department of Finance because they believe that the present tax situation is discouraging the development of group farming and we all know that such development should be encouraged.  The IAOS are anxious that the small farmer should be in a position to survive but they realise that in order to be able to compete he must be able to pool his resources to some degree.  The various degrees are a matter for argument. Different cases would require different degrees of co-operation but in any event it is essential that the State, if it does not give an incentive to the development of group farming, should not impose a disincentive on such development which is important for the development of agriculture as a whole.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the way might be open to find some way out of this.  Perhaps if groups farms were formed into co-operatives&mdash;this would mean a reduction in the minimum membership of seven of a co-operative&mdash;and if the Department were satisfied that the group was a <i>bona fide</i> group farm, it should then be possible for the Minister to make a ruling that dividends or, alternatively, income paid to the participants in the form of wages, would not be taxable and would retain the exemptions which are available at present to income derived from farming by persons acting alone.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, including Deputy Desmond and Deputy O'Donovan, referred to the position of income tax and farmers, and the fact that farmers do not pay income tax.  The farmers are as anxious as <Col N="145" /> anybody else to share in the expenses of the State and to contribute to the social reforms which are desirable.  I do not think they want to find themselves getting away with something which other people cannot get away with, but it is wrong to take one tax in isolation and say: &ldquo;Farmers are not paying income tax and, therefore, they are getting away with something which others are not getting away with.&rdquo;  Farmers pay rates and death duties.  The whole position must be looked at to find out whether the farmer is getting away with something. It will be found that few farmers are getting away with what Deputy Desmond thinks they are getting away with.  The burden of rates on agricultural land has been rising very fast.  It has been rising quicker than the earning capacity of such land. Rates are levied regardless of income of farmers.  Even if a farmer suffers a loss he must pay rates.  That is not the case with somebody who is&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;paying income tax, but it is the case with everybody who is paying rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the position is that land is something akin to the tools of production.  A man does not pay rates on a machine.  He does not pay rates on goodwill.  A shopkeeper might have goodwill.  They are akin to land.  They are the tangible and intangible assets out of which a person is able to make an income.  A shopkeeper might have goodwill or a man might own a machine, but rates are not necessarily paid on those.  The land is the source of a farmer's income and this land is entirely rated. The same goes for death duties.  The value of the land assessed for death duty purposes has risen far faster than the level of the returns in terms of actual income from that land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this are various. People from outside farming have been bidding-up land values, because they want solid investments and they think the land is the most solid investment of all.  This has bid-up the value of land which means that when that land comes to be valued for death duties the amount of death duties to be <Col N="146" /> paid is out of proportion to the actual earning capacity of the farmer who inherits the land and who has to pay the death duties out of the income derived from that land.  Death duties are borne on land regardless of income. A man still has to pay death duties on land even if he is not earning any money from that land.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the general question of death duties.  I am not among those who believe that death duties should be abolished.  Wealth is something which should be taxed.  I do not wish to see, even though it might mean an inflow of capital, the development of ostentatious fortunes in this country. The glaring inequalities which might arise in this country if we were to institute some form of death duty haven here, in terms of high income people coming to live here in order to avail of generous death duty exemptions, would not be desirable.</P>
    <P>I am rather sceptical about the tax concession for artists.  We have had some very wealthy people coming to this country.  Some artists who are well established and who do not need a tax concession have come.  They do not need concessions to encourage them to start on the production of works of art.  They have come here in order that their substantial incomes may not be liable to tax.  This is not socially desirable.  It may mean that more books about Ireland may be written or more paintings executed about Ireland, although that is arguable.  James Joyce wrote his best work about Ireland while he was in Paris.  If we are attracting artists in here, they will not write about Ireland but will produce material of no interest or value to Ireland; they will write about the countries from which they come.  The present Minister for Finance was not responsible for this particular tax concession. A predecessor of his, in his enthusiasm for matters artistic, found it desirable to attract established artists to this country and not struggling men who are trying to get going. The people attracted did not need tax concession at all.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to death duties is that speculation in agricultural land has bid-up the price to an <Col N="147" /> extensive degree.  When death duties come to be borne, they are out of proportion to the actual earning capacity of the land, because the value of the land is out of proportion to its earning capacity.  The value has been bid-up because of speculation.</P>
    <P>The Minister has claimed that we have an artificial valuation for agricultural land, which is seen as a concession which the Minister thinks gets over this problem.  I do not think it does.  The Minister will, no doubt, correct me if I am wrong in saying that the position is that if 25 times the poor law valuation is below a certain figure and if the personal estate is less than £1,000, then the artificial valuation comes into effect, and a lower rate of death duty is paid.  I think that is the correct statement. That is roughly the position.  So far as I know, where that really effectively falls down is the provision in regard to the personal estate being less than £1,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the figure is £2,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be found that the value of many farms tots up to a figure in excess of £2,000.  I thought the figure was £1,000.  With increasing mechanisation and the increasing value of machinery, a farm with that sort of machinery will possibly, when it is all added up and all the personal assets, such as a car and furniture in the house are included, if the farmer is thrifty and has not gone heavily into debt, and there is no overdraft to be subtracted, be valued in excess of £2,000.  It is very easy for a small farmer to have a personal estate in excess of £2,000 in which case the artificial valuation does not operate and men whose income&mdash;which is what death duties must be paid on&mdash; from farming is comparatively low, find they have to pay heavy death duties.  This is undesirable and has led in many cases to the breaking up of holdings through little bits of them having to be sold in order to pay death duties.  This fragmentation is not beneficial to agriculture and hits people at, perhaps, the most crucial stage in the <Col N="148" /> development of a farm enterprise, when one person is handing over to another and the other person is trying to find his feet and in the normal way would be expected to be running losses. On top of this is added the burden of death duties which in many cases have caused considerable hardship.</P>
      <P>I realise there are certain difficulties in finding a way out of this problem because if you give a global concession to all agricultural land in respect of death duties you further increase the attraction of agricultural land for speculators.  They will say: &ldquo;If I have my capital in shares I shall have to pay death duties but if I put it into agricultural land, I shall not.&rdquo;  People who are not <i>bona fide</i> farmers and are wealthy in their own right will come into the land market to a greater extent for agricultural land outbidding small farmers trying to buy land.  That is not a desirable development.</P>
      <P>I sympathise to some extent with the Minister in this problem but we must try to find a way of helping a person who has been in farming all his life and whose major occupation it has been when he is handing over to some close relative on death and this relative also intends to engage in farming as his major occupation.  In that situation it is unfair that the very heavy rate of death duties should apply.  If the Minister looks at it, he will find it does apply.  We must help a man in that situation without giving such a global concession that it will attract into farming people whose entry will further bid-up the inflated value of land thereby making farming more difficult for smallholders trying to expand their holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no ready-made solution for this dilemma but it could possibly be approached through this five-year period.  If that period of five years could be reduced in regard to the transfer of agricultural land by somebody engaged in farming for, say, 20 years prior to the transfer, and if he were to transfer his land, say, two years before his death, he could avail of that exemption rather than be bound by the present five-year period.  The present five-year period is not realistic.  People <Col N="149" /> do not look that far ahead and do not say: &ldquo;I expect to live five years and I shall transfer my land now and, therefore, I shall avoid death duties.&rdquo; If a two-year period were accepted in the case of agricultural land transferred by a person engaged in farming for over two years to another person who will be engaged primarily in farming, that would be one way of meeting the situation.  Perhaps in this situation we could find a way to abolish death duties altogether or alternatively the conditions under which the artificial valuation is applied could be made more generous.</P>
    <P>I know there will be difficulties and people will possibly avail of unintended loopholes in any concessions made but the Minister should not be too upset by the few who may manage to do this.  The fact is that we have a serious social problem in that a fairly substantial number find that the burden of death duties is such that it is breaking up farms and causing untold hardship to farm families.  Many people in rural Ireland are living in dread of death duties.  Meetings held to protest about them have attracted not only big farmers but also small farmers who are just as concerned about this problem. The Minister should examine this matter closely and try to find a way out of the problem.</P>
    <P>My final point refers to a proposal put forward by my party in 1965 when they advocated a tax concession for companies which encouraged the development of co-partnership in their enterprises, in other words, companies which brought about the situation where the employees had shares in the company and a say in its management thus creating greater involvement of those employed and greater commitment to the enterprise by those working in it.  It would give the employees a sense of some control over their own work environment, which is a desirable thing.  My party suggested as a means to this end tax concessions for companies making such provision.  I should like to remind the Minister of this suggestion and I hope he will consider it favourably.  I also hope that, as Deputy Desmond said, by the time the next Finance Bill comes there will <Col N="150" /> be another Government committed to this proposal in a way in which the present Government are not and that it will be able, in its first budget, to bring in such proposals so as to encourage worker partnership in industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House is aware&mdash;but it may be no harm to put it on record&mdash; of the fact that I regret that I was unable to be present to introduce the Second Stage of this Bill and that I missed portion of the debate.  As Deputies know, I think, the reason is that I was on my way back from a meeting of Ministers for Finance in the EEC and the applicant countries in connection with recent developments in relation to sterling and I was unable to get here earlier.</P>
      <P>The debate on this Stage of the Finance Bill this year is, I think, quite uncharacteristic of the kind of debate we have had in the past.  It is uncharacteristic in many ways but I suppose chiefly in its relevant brevity.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not complaining at all about this.  I am all for brevity when it can be achieved.  It is, I think, of some significance because this Bill, substantially, is implementing various provisions of the budget.  It is doing certain other things which have been outlined in the introduction to this Stage but substantially that is what it is doing.  The fact, as I say, the debate on this Stage of the Bill, as compared with the similar Stage in previous years is relatively shorter is, I think, perhaps the best tribute that could be paid by the Opposition parties to the effectiveness of the budget which we are implementing in this Bill.  There have been certain points raised which I would like to deal with, some matters of principle and some matters of detail, and some matters of detail which I will not deal with because I think they are more appropriate to the next Stage of the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first matter I want to deal with is on the question of income tax and the allegations that have been made that in this country it is regressive and becoming more regressive.  The statement <Col N="151" /> is simply not true.  I suggested, when Deputy O'Donovan was making this point, that the correct way to compare, if one wanted to compare, is to try to take post-tax income and having had regard to the fall in the value of money, then see what is the position of the wage earner on foot of that.  On this basis the only figures immediately available to me are those which I am about to mention and they cover the difference between 1960 and 1970.  I have not got, offhand, the figures that will emerge from the implementation of the provisions in this Bill but I am quite certain they will, in fact, improve the position.</P>
    <P>To give it shortly and without going into details I will just give the summary that is of importance but if anybody is concerned about how the figures are arrived at I can furnish that information too.  The summary works out in this way.  If you take somebody whose annual gross income in 1960 was £500 he paid income tax of £50, leaving him with a post-tax income of £450.  That was in 1960.  In 1970 the average remuneration per non-agricultural employee had increased by 141 per cent which would mean that the comparable figure for 1970 was £1,205 per annum. That was subject to income tax of £229, leaving a post-tax income of £976.</P>
    <P>The equivalent of the 1960 post-tax income at 1970 prices was £716 so that in real terms, after payment of income tax and adjusting for the increase in the cost of living, one arrives at the position where the equivalent figure, post-tax in 1970, was £976 as against £716 in 1960.  On a similar basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister say £760?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, £716.  On a similar basis for somebody who was on an income of £1,000 in 1960 the comparable figures work out at £1,304 as against £1,829 so that in both of those cases one finds that, after making allowance for the charge to tax, and making allowance for changes in the cost of living, those people had a higher after-tax income in real terms in 1970 than they had in 1960.  It is important to realise that this is so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Not exactly the same thing but it takes account of the increase in the cost of living over the same year period.  The point I am making is that I think it should be known that that is the position, but that being the position does not mean that there is no case for increasing personal and other allowances under the income tax code.  Indeed, that is demonstrated by the fact that this Bill provides for such increases in allowances, but we ought to be clear on what is happening. What is really happening is that people's standard of living has increased and their expectations have increased and quite legitimately so in my view.  People who ten years ago had quite different and lower expectations today have higher expectations and therefore find that the money available to them on the things they want to spend it on is stretched to its limit as it was in 1960 for them, as it was in 1950 and I suppose as it will be in 1980.  We should realise what is happening. People's standard of living is increasing and their expectations are increasing, as I say, quite legitimately. Let us not assume because they find it difficult this is because they are worse off.  They are better off but they want more and they are entitled to more.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual figures are as I have given them.  In 1960 on an annual gross income of £500 the amount of tax payable in 1960 was £50 and in 1970 on £1,205, which is comparable, the tax is £229.  Then I have given the adjusted net of tax figures arising from that.  I also want to say in regard to income tax&mdash; Deputy Desmond touched on this and perhaps some other Deputies did also &mdash;that it is well known that there are people who are legally subject to income tax who are not paying the amount for which they are legally liable.  This is notorious.  It is bound to happen under any system where the tax is related to one's income and, in the first instance, one is depending on a true return of income from the taxpayer.  I said, in the first instance because, of course, we are not so naïve as to depend solely on the tax-payer's assessment of his income, as Deputies are well aware.</P>
      <P>The point I want to make is that there have been a number of efforts in different areas in recent years to close these gaps and get after the people concerned with a considerable degree of success.  I am not saying with 100 per cent success because I doubt if that can ever be attained, but there has been a considerable degree of success in this regard, as I said in an interjection earlier, in certain aspects of the law.  For instance, what we provided last year in the Finance Bill in regard to lumpers and in regard to increasing interest rates on tax in arrears, has been quite successful in increasing substantially the amount of income tax collected, as was pointed out by Deputy Desmond. The very substantial increase in income tax as between one year and another is largely due&mdash;not entirely, of course&mdash;to those two factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is due mainly to the fact that a proportion of every wage increase given goes back to the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Even allowing for that, the results from these two provisions have been very substantial and, I may say so far as I am concerned, very satisfactory.  Deputies may recall that I defended these provisions with considerable vigour here last year when they were subjected to considerable attack.  I think I am entitled to draw the attention of the House to the fact that they have paid off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Other things were done in recent years which are not a matter of law but rather a matter of administration.  These also are having the effect of&mdash;let me put it this way&mdash; making life more difficult for certain kinds of people who have been evading their liability for tax.  Of course we get a lot of complaints about this both on the practical level and on the theoretical level.  Earlier this evening Deputy Esmonde complained on the theoretical level and said we were taking away the incentive to work.  This is always a problem with any form of income tax.  One runs this risk.  It is reasonable to say that one ought, as far as one can in practical terms, try to ensure that those who are legally liable to tax are made to pay in accordance with the law.</P>
      <P>Deputy Desmond talked about the question of imposing a form of capital gains tax on the profits from land sales.  He is aware, I presume, of the fact that there is a special tax on the profits of land sales.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I should like to put to Deputy Desmond, <Col N="155" /> through the Chair, is this.  I do not think this is the right approach to this problem at all because whatever you do, whether by way of income tax or by way of increment value levied by the local authority or the State, the effect is ultimately to increase the price of land and therefore increase the price of houses.  The only effective solution, in my view, is one which ensures that the price available to the person selling the land is reduced in proportion to the contribution of the community; not a special levy or tax on the land because that does not achieve the objective but rather that the price is reduced to give what I would regard as the true market value.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that this presents considerable legal and constitutional difficulties.  We have been trying to tackle this problem for quite some time in various ways.  It was because of these very complex difficulties that the Government set up the committee under a member of the judiciary to make recommendations in this regard.  The legal and constitutional difficulties involved prevented us from doing what in my view is the only thing to tackle the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, would the Minister favour a constitutional amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If this were necessary, yes, although I would suggest to the Deputy that if that situation developed there would probably be enormous difficulty in drafting a constitutional amendment which would do what the Deputy and I have in mind and nothing else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister envisage this, and would it have the effect of reducing the price of land sites?  Surely no matter what happens the person who is selling the site will attempt to get back from somebody whatever he has to pay even if a value is put on whatever public work is done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy is saying is certainly true in the event of a sale from one private person to another private person.  I could envisage <Col N="156" /> a system in which there would be compulsory acquisition of land by local authorities as, indeed, there is at the moment, and as is being done in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not talking about proposals during an election, I am talking about what we are doing and have been doing for some years.  I am talking about the acquisition of land by local authorities and the giving out of it in small parcels to builders.  We are doing this.  We are not talking about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem I have been referring to is a constitutional one.  In answer to the question I was asked I am saying that I could envisage a system in which that method of operation would continue but in which the local authorities, in the price they were paying for the land, would be entitled to arrive at a figure which, in my view, would be the true market value of the land, that is, taking the figure for the sale between one private party and another and deducting from it the increase in the value of the land which can be attributed to a contribution either by the State or the local authority, by the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one could do this legally one would get land which would be available for housing at a cheaper price. In some cases it would be substantially cheaper than it is today.  In my view that is the only way in which one can successfully tackle this problem of land values and the effect on housing. No system of tax and no imposition of <Col N="157" /> any kind will help.  It will only make the position worse.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald, I understand, referred to the proposed right of appeal to the appeal commissioners provided in section 33 of the Bill in respect of non-quoted securities and suggested that there should also be a right of appeal in respect of other property such as the market value of land and chattels which are referred to in section 32 of the Bill, the section which deals with discretionary trusts.  The fact is that since the estate duty code came into force in 1894 there has been such a right of appeal to the courts. The appeal lies to the Circuit Court if the value of the property is under £50,000 and if it exceeds £50,000 the appeal is to the High Court.  If, however, the question in dispute is the buying of land or house property, then there is a right to appeal since 1909 to the property arbitrator and there is a subsequent right of appeal from him to the court.</P>
    <P>Section 31 of the Bill enlarges the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to enable it to hear such appeals.  The point about this provision is that it introduces a system of appeal which does not compel the taxpayer to go to the court if he wants to appeal.  The case was made to me that in many instances people were put in the position that they either had to accept the Revenue Commissioners' decision or appeal to the courts and that in some cases the cost, the delay and the risk prevented them from going to the court and that in practice, therefore, the decision of the Revenue Commissioners was unilateral and binding.  It was for that reason that I decided to introduce this right to appeal to the appeal commissioners in the case of non-quoted shares.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Bruton, the position is that farmers are exempt from income tax. If, instead of continuing their farming in the traditional way, they operate by way of a co-operative, then their farming profits are exempt from tax in the hands of the co-operative, and if the farming profits are distributed <Col N="158" /> by way of dividend to members they are also exempt from tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are they exempt as dividends or as earnings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people involved are employees, clearly they come under PAYE and I do not think there is any justification for changing that system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A dividend declared by an agricultural co-operative is not liable to tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct to the extent that, in the case Deputy Bruton mentioned, which was the specific one of farmers who get together on a co-operative basis, if they have a joint profit and then distribute that profit in dividends it is not liable to tax whether as a profit in the hands of the co-operative or as a distribution of dividends to members.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton referred to representations made by the IAOS.  I think they go further and cover certain other aspects than the straightforward one I mentioned.  The Deputy mentioned exempting people from tax on their incomes if they are employed by co-operatives. I can see many objections to that, especially if the object of the co-operative can be achieved without their being treated in that way.  There were other cases mentioned by the IAOS which go further than that.</P>
      <P>I understand Deputy FitzGerald wondered whether there is a need to define the words &ldquo;credit union&rdquo; in section 43.  I have been specifically advised that this is not necessary because a credit union which is registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, as stated in the Bill, could only refer to a credit union to which the Credit Union Act, 1966 applies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There were suggestions about the increasing burden of death duties especially on farmers and there were complaints about the inadequacy of reliefs being provided.  I have given some of the facts and I will give them again although I do not think it <Col N="160" /> makes much difference because we will still hear the same complaints. The facts are that this estate duty is assessed in relation to relatively few cases.  There are about 2,500 cases annually and of these only about 4 per cent involve farmers.</P>
      <P>Listening to some of the arguments made inside and outside the House one would imagine that there were farmers all over the country in dire trouble because of death duty.  That simply is not true.  The position is that about 4 per cent of the cases involve farmers and this is due largely to the system of the artificial valuation of agricultural land to which Deputy Bruton made reference.  I will concede that the percentage I have mentioned may well increase as a result of the increasing value of farming land and we may have different statistics on it later, but let us start from the low base of 4 per cent and deal with the situation as we know it.  The position in relation to farmers' liability is about as generous as we can manage, again for traditional reasons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that, if that is true, then it is true of almost every case that is liable to duty.  Take the case of a small shopkeeper: all the arguments advanced by Deputy Bruton&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The point made by Deputy Cooney can equally apply: where does he get the cash?  The fact is most people who are worried about this problem and want to make provision for its solution take out an insurance policy.</P>

      <P>Apart from the special arrangements which have been made and which are quite generous from the point of view of relieving farmers up to a certain point from liability for death duties, there is an equally generous system of broadly based estate duty abatements in respect of widows and dependent children.  This, of course, applies to farmers and others.  The net effect of the present proposal in section 29 is to exempt from duty an estate of £17,750 where the widow is the only beneficiary, an estate of £25,500 in the case of a widow and two dependants, an estate of £30,200 in the case of a widow and three dependants, and an estate of £33,330 in the case of a widow and four dependants. I do not think it can be said these are not generous exemptions taking account of the situation of a widow and dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now you will often have cases in which people, who are not closely related or may not be related at all, inherit valuable property and I can see no reason why such people should not be liable to duty at a reasonable threshold.  A case was made last year here, and with some force, in regard to the changes then being made in the abatements for widows and dependants <Col N="162" /> that, while that was all right because of the increase in the value of property all round, there ought to be an increase in the threshold at which property became liable to duty.  I thought there was substance in that argument.  I listened to it with sympathy and this year we are proposing to raise the threshold from £5,000 to £7,500.  This is before there is any liability to duty.  Over and above that there will be abatements for widows and dependants, with the results I referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said the abatements were inadequate because they have not kept pace with the increase in the cost of living.  The increase in the consumer price index since 1965, when abatements were first introduced, has been around 40 per cent: in contrast, the abatements have been increased by eight times in the case of a widow from £250 to £2,000 and by nearly seven times in the case of a dependent child from £150 to £1,000. We are in this field considerably ahead of the situation we were in before 1965.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are several reasons, some of which I went into in a previous debate.  Deputy FitzGerald will find the reasons stated there.  I will not embark on a discussion of the theoretical basis for taxing capital.  The fact is we have this form of tax.  I think it is legitimate to say that it is an imperfect form of tax on capital.  I would accept that and I would say that, as time goes on, there will almost certainly be changes.  However, I am not concerned with that aspect in this Bill.  I am concerned with the operation of the death duty code as it operates today and I suggest the reliefs provided in this Bill go a substantial distance towards meeting the problems of the increased value of property and the position of the widow with dependent children.  I quoted the abatement figures earlier.  This is the only realistic approach to the problem in relation to the operation of estate duty and property values today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Different views have been expressed on the question as to whether estate duty should operate and, if operated at what rate: whatever their views, however, I think Deputies would accept that what we are doing here is certainly in the context mentioned the right way of approaching the problem, given that we are going to have estate duty and given the way property values are going.  Therefore, I am quite happy with the provisions involved and with the reactions of Deputies as indicated in the debate. <Col N="164" /> There were certain other points raised which, as I indicated earlier, may be because of being of some detail, more appropriate to a discussion on Committee Stage.  But I would repeat that one of the unusual characteristics of this debate at this stage has been its relative brevity.  I have already underlined the fact that this is the best tribute that can be paid to the Opposition benches&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>NOTES: (1)  Lands taken over by way of exchange, surrender, etc., are not included in Column 5&mdash;there being no Purchase Money applicable in respect of such lands&mdash;but they are included in Column 6.</P>
    <P>(2)  Records are not kept on the basis of offers of land made to the Land Commission.  The collection of this information would involve an inordinate amount of staff time and would not be justified.  Figures dealing with offers of land for cash for the 2 years 1970-71 and 1971-72 have been extracted and are given in reply to another Question tabled by the Deputy today.</P>
