      <P>On the Order of Business, the Taoiseach will no doubt be aware that a resolution has been tabled in the names of the leader of the Opposition and myself asking for the establishment of a select committee of this House to be joined with a select committee of the Seanad for the purpose of considering European Community affairs.  In the ordinary way, I understand, this would be treated as a Private Members' motion. Would the Taoiseach consider, between now and the taking of the Bill itself, providing some time to have the principle of the resolution considered and decided on either together with, or at a time as near as possible to the taking of the Bill?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tairgim:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Go léifear an Bille an Dara hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the main, Article 44 of our Constitution is a charter for the free practice and profession of religion and in this respect I suggest that it is second to none in any part of the world.  It gives, for example, the following guarantee&mdash;and I quote from Article 44, subarticle 2.1º0:</P>
      <P>Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</P>
      <P>It goes on to guarantee in subarticle 3º0:</P>
      <P>The State shall not impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status.</P>
      <P>These two fundamental guarantees are the basis of religious freedom in the civilised world and are to be found in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.  The words used in these two documents may not be exactly the same as the words used in our Constitution but fundamentally and in principle there is no difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> Article 44 gives further guarantees not to endow any particular religion or provide State aid on a more favourable basis to one religion rather than another.  It sets out that every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own affairs and its rights in regard to property.  Controversy in regard to Article 44 has arisen in relation to its references to specific churches and in particular its assigning of a special position to the Roman Catholic Church.  It has been contended that this favours the church of the majority in some way. It has been referred to in recent years as an obstacle to Irish unity.</P>
    <P>Calls for the deletion of the &ldquo;special position&rdquo; subarticle seem to come mainly from persons who say that people other than themselves are aggrieved at the maintenance of this subsection in the Constitution.  It is now, almost unexceptionally, accepted that it confers no benefits or favours and the guarantees given elsewhere in Article 44, which I have just listed, specifically preclude any preferential treatment for any particular denomination.</P>
    <P>This was the view taken by the all-Party Committee on the Constitution which reported in 1967 as follows:</P>
    <P>The prevailing view is that subsection (2) merely recognises the statistical fact that the Catholic Church is the guardian of the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.  Other provisions in Article 44 and elsewhere in the Constitution prohibit religious discrimination of any kind so that there can be no preference for any particular religion.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, subarticle 3º0 of the first section of Article 44 gives full recognition to the other denominations then existing in Ireland, and in the years since the adoption of the Constitution it has been widely acknowledged that there was full and ungrudging recognition of every one of those churches regardless of their numerical strength.</P>
    <P>The report of the 1967 committee mentioned that 3º0 gave rise &ldquo;to doubts in regard to other denominations&rdquo; but <Col N="424" /> in practical terms the listing of existing churches did not inhibit the setting up of other religious bodies either <i>de novo</i> or by the coming together of existing churches.</P>
    <P>Whatever one may feel about the merits or otherwise of the two subsections of Article 44 now in question, there has been in recent years a growing feeling that the general provisions of Article 44 in regard to religious liberty are sufficient in themselves and that the specific listing of churches is neither desirable nor necessary and should be deleted.  It has been argued that this would contribute towards Irish unity or that the making of such a change would be an indication of the outward-looking approach of the Government and the people of Ireland in relation to unity.  Whatever the force of these arguments may be, if these provisions are divisive in relation to people living in Ireland, and they seem to be; if they are unnecessary, and this is now generally acknowledged; then, in view of the firm guarantees of religious freedom and freedom of conscience contained in the Constitution already, these two subsections ought to go.</P>
    <P>The Government have joined with the Opposition parties in a committee to study the constitutional, legal, economic, social and other implications of Irish unity; the members of that committee are seeking to find common ground in these matters and, as the House is aware, this work is going on apace.  I would personally prefer not to see constitutional amendments in this context tackled in a piecemeal way but rather as part of a general constitutional review.  However, since there is already common ground in this matter between the parties and since we have the opportunity now of combining a referendum on this particular issue with a referendum on the issue of votes at 18, the other parties in the House having indicated their desire to co-operate to this end, the Government are now putting forward this measure with our full commitment.  I do not think the House will have any difficulty in accepting it but I wish to emphasise again before I conclude that the free profession and practice of religion will still be guaranteed in Article 44 of the Constitution if the amendment <Col N="425" /> of that Article now proposed in this Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill is ultimately approved by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal to amend Article 44 has our support, mainly because we think it should never have been in the Constitution and was introduced many years ago by Fianna Fáil who are now attempting to correct that mistake, as I hope they will.</P>
      <P>The committee which sat on this and which reported in 1967 referred to this matter and adverted to the fact that the two sub-articles had been referred to in a number of court decisions and the general view was that the provisions are of no juridical effect and do not give any special privilege to the Catholic Church under the Constitution. Indeed, it is now recognised by all reasonable people that it was no help to religion in its phraseology, that it did not enhance the Catholic religion or give it any special status or position, nor for that matter did it enhance in any way the Protestant Church or any other faith.</P>
      <P>The Catholic Church does not require constitutional or other guarantees or sanctions to ensure its status or position. If anything, this Article, as phrased, did a disservice to the Catholic Church in particular and very likely to other faiths in general.  Its significance, of course, has been exaggerated but, because of the fact that it has been used from time to time as a weapon with which to criticise the State here, it is desirable that it should be removed. Its removal is also important at this stage, because some critics, in their anxiety to attack the State here, have endeavoured to use this Article and it is in that context that we in particular are glad to see the decision taken to remove it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be made abundantly clear that since this State was set up there has been no religious discrimination. Indeed, many tributes have been paid to the fact that no discrimination on religious grounds existed.  It is right to say that for the fact that this is so credit must be given to this party who at the inception of the State ensured that no religious discrimination <Col N="426" /> would be allowed or permitted.  We have not always received gratitude for that achievement but recognition of the fact cannot be withheld and that principle of non-discrimination was vindicated.</P>
    <P>This Article, as the Taoiseach has said, with the changes made, will largely follow a similar Article in the earlier Constitution which provided that freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen, that no law may be made either directly or indirectly to endow any religion or to prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status or affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the religious instruction at the school or make any discrimination as respects State aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations or divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution any of its property except for the purposes of roads, railways, lighting, water, drainage works or other works of public utility and on payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>The provisions that remain after the two sub-articles are deleted are similar in phraseology to this and effectively guarantee freedom of worship and the free practice of religion as well as other fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>Our general view is that it would have been better, if it were possible to do so, to draft an entirely new Constitution.  We recognise that it is difficult in present circumstances to draft a Constitution that would cover the needs of a united Ireland but it is desirable, because of the criticism that has arisen, that this amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <P>On many occasions we have supported the idea of an all-party committee. We participated in the earlier committee on the understanding that the recommendations of that committee, particularly those that were unanimous, would enable a Constitution <Col N="427" /> to be drafted that would satisfy all interests and provide the essential constitutional and legal framework. It is of significance that this amendment was unanimously recommended in the report of the committee who reported in 1967.</P>
    <P>The committee at present considering the Constitution were established after a good deal of discussion and they have been considering a number of matters in respect of other aspects of the Constitution. There is no doubt that the various religious denominations will welcome the deletion of these two subsections. On many occasions representatives of the Catholic hierarchy have expressed the view that because of the effect of the reference in Article 44.1.2º0 to the Catholic Church they would agree to its removal.  The same controversy has not arisen in respect of the other subsection but so far as this party are concerned we believe that it is desirable that it should be changed. We, therefore, support this amendment.</P>
    <P>We believe that the all-party committee should proceed as rapidly as possible with a view to providing the essential basis for a constitutional and legal framework.  One of the defects of the present Constitution has been noted in the report of this committee, that it attempted to deal with a number of matters that are not appropriate to a Constitution.  It is possible that because of that some of the objections expressed in regard to this particular Article, have been justified.  We support this amendment and recommend that in the interests of getting a better atmosphere in the whole of this island, North and South, the removal of these two sub-articles should take place.  It would be wrong to exaggerate the effect of this but at the same time anything that will help in the present circumstances to ease tension is welcome.  We want to show the people in the North that so far as religious freedom in the South is concerned no religious discrimination of any kind is allowed or supported.</P>
    <P>We would like to see a new Constitution. We look forward to the all-party committee recommending the necessary changes and providing the basis on which a new Constitution <Col N="428" /> can be formulated.  These two amendments should be supported by the necessary legislation and should afterwards be endorsed in a referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have sought this move for some considerable time.  It is welcome at this belated date and we will urge everybody to endorse it in the coming referendum. However, we are conscious of the fact that the Northern situation has contributed greatly to our arriving at the position where the Government are prepared to introduce a Bill which will allow a referendum to be held on these Articles of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>We do not think that the Constitution should be changed in the context of the Northern situation; we think it should be changed because it is right to change it.  We hope that what we are seeing here today is only a start to some of the changes we need in our society.  If any real progress is to be made towards getting the majority of the people in the North to realise that we meant something by the 50 years of talk and propaganda in which we have indulged in this part of the country with regard to the North we need to make many changes here.  I said &ldquo;we&rdquo; because I think all three parties have been guilty in this regard. If we want to show the majority of the people in the North that we are sincere in our wish for unity, that we are sincere in trying to establish a society that would be acceptable to all of the people in this country a lot more imagination, courage and generosity of spirit will have to be shown by the Government.  We lack generosity of spirit in this part of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe these two sub-articles have any real significance in our Constitution. I do not believe that by their inclusion in the Constitution the Roman Catholic Church exercises any undue influence in the South&mdash;not by virtue of those two sub-articles in the Constitution, possibly by other means &mdash;but I do think that if I were a non-Catholic living in this part of the country, I could justifiably feel myself to be, if not a second-class citizen, at least some sort of inferior citizen <Col N="429" /> by virtue of the fact that one church is given special recognition.</P>
    <P>I accept the fact that the majority of our people here in the South are members of the Roman Catholic Church but surely it is sufficient, or should be sufficient, that any special position which the Roman Catholic Church would hold in this part of the country would be in the minds and hearts of the people who are members of that church and not in our Constitution which by implication stated that members of other religious persuasions were somewhat inferior.  As I say, these two subsections should be removed because they are wrong, not because we wish to inveigle people into this State.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why, when this Constitution was being drafted and put before the people in 1937, there was any interference with Article 8 of the 1922 Constitution which was quite clear and which gave freedom of religious practice and belief to everybody and did not single out in any way any particular religion.  I take the wording contained in a book <i>Fundamental Rights in the Irish Law and Constitution</i>, written by a present Member of the Upper House, Senator J.M. Kelly, who states on page 185:</P>
    <P>In fact subsections (2) and (3) of this section which from time to time cause a great deal of foolish and embarrassing controversy seem to have been inserted in an effort to please everybody and in the end have come near to pleasing nobody. It should have been possible to omit them altogether without irreverence to the Catholic Church as it certainly would have been possible to do so without danger to the religious practices of other churches.</P>
    <P>While I do not necessarily agree with the author on all matters, I most certainly agree with him in that statement.</P>
    <P>We have been talking here over the years about desirable changes in our Constitution and at the moment we have an all-party committee examining the Constitution, and I suppose it would not be proper to go any further into their deliberations until they have had an opportunity of concluding them, but <Col N="430" /> the Taoiseach in his very short opening statement&mdash;deliberately short, I would say&mdash;on this major step, which we hope will be a major step, referred to the former committee that sat and its report on the Constitution issued in December, 1967&mdash;that was an all-party committee which, I believe, sat under the chairmanship of the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley&mdash; although I do recognise that his major ability lies in counterpunching and not attacking, quoted a particular section but omitted to quote several others. The portion which he quoted from the committee's report at page 47 was:</P>
    <P>The prevailing view is that subsection (2) merely recognises the statistical fact that the Catholic Church is the guardian of the faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.</P>
    <P>That was the end of the Taoiseach's quote but if he had gone very slightly down the page, he would have found some other references.  At paragraph 136 he would have seen:</P>
    <P>There seems, however, to be no doubt that these provisions give offence to non-Catholics and also are a useful weapon in the hands of those who are anxious to emphasise the differences between North and South.</P>
    <P>Turning over the page at paragraph 139, there are other pieces to quote:</P>
    <P>The deletion of this provision would in particular dispel any doubt and suspicions that may linger in the minds of non-Catholics north and south of the Border and remove an unnecessary source of mischievous and scurrilous criticism.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 140&mdash;and this is an all-party committee&mdash;it says:</P>
    <P>We accordingly recommend unanimously that subsections (2) and (3) be deleted from this Constitution.</P>
    <P>That was in 1967 and Deputies will recall that in 1967 this island was a lot less disturbed, saddened and, I might say, shamed by the events which have taken place between the date that recommendation was made by an all-party committee and today.  It is shamed and saddened by no less than 620 odd deaths&mdash;it is very hard to keep an exact count&mdash;but what effort <Col N="431" /> was made by the present Government to implement that recommendation, to make any gesture, any effort, towards bringing about in this country the kind of society that one would wish to see, the kind of society that might attract the majority in the North to join?  We have seen none whatever and even after we have had full consent by all three parties, even after there have been statements by leading members of the Hierarchy to the effect that the deletion of these two subsections would not cause them any unnecessary worry, we have also seen the caution and the anxiety on the part of the Taoiseach and the Government to ensure that, if there was going to be any criticism of the introduction of this Bill, that criticism would be shared amongst all three parties.  We saw the exercise here last week when we were told there were practical difficulties. In our anxiety on these benches to try to create a decent society in this island we once more took the Taoiseach off the hook by saying we were prepared to make the necessary arrangements to overcome these difficulties.</P>

      <P>I am afraid this will have to be postponed until there is a new Government over there because I doubt very much if either the courage or the generosity of spirit which could produce such a new Constitution will ever exist on those benches.  It seems to be the opinion of the Government and of the Taoiseach that, if and when the time comes when they sit around <Col N="432" /> a table to discuss unity with their fellow Irishmen in the North, these things can be used as negotiating or bargaining points.  Could there be anything more contemptible than to use or to attempt to use the rights and the privileges of our fellow countrymen as a bargaining point?  I sincerely ask the Taoiseach and the Government to change that.</P>

      <P>The present position is unworkable and unreal and its continued existence can lead only to harm and damage to Ireland.  When we call for further changes in the Constitution and amendments to existing law, particularly in regard to the sale of contraceptives, we do not do so in the belief that the people of Northern Ireland, irrespective of their religious beliefs, are running around looking for the pill and for divorce and that there is nothing else preoccupying their minds.  We know, at least I know from talking to many general practitioners in this part of the country, that the pill is as widely used here as there and that the only difference is that if you happen to have a blue card it is not available to you but if you can afford to pay a general practitioner not only can the pill be used but it is freely available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently those dirty people up in the North have an awful lot of fellow creatures down in the South.  Now that the 50 years of talk and propaganda at the expense of the communities in the North have gone by let us remove all the barriers that we can remove.  Let us remember that though they are not up there running around in droves looking for the pill and for divorce, they are running around in droves looking at some of our social services.  Far more of them are concerned with our unemployment benefits, with our family allowances, with our educational system and with our housing situation.  If we were to show them that we genuinely mean to create a new Ireland we <Col N="433" /> might find far less opposition to any suggestion of unity than we find now.</P>
    <P>I have a long list of statistics here but I do not intend to read them all. I shall read one or two to illustrate the progress Fianna Fáil have made in this part of Ireland in the last few years towards enticing our fellow Irishmen in the North to join us.  Central Government expenditure in the Republic on social services announced for the current year is £234 million.  The Northern Ireland budget for social services for the current year amounts to £224 million.  The population of Northern Ireland is a little more than half that of the Republic and therefore one can safely say that expenditure on social services in the North is running at twice the level of social services here.</P>

We sacrificed our political careers.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this whole controversy surrounding the Constitution. What is the purpose of a Constitution? A Constitution reflects the morality and the aspirations of a nation at a given time in the history of that nation.  If, a thousand years from now, someone should ask what the Irish people were like in the year 1937, the best means of obtaining the answer would be to peruse the Constitution of 1937.  Our Constitution is one of the finest documents that has ever been written.  Despite the unworthy remarks that have been made regarding it by certain people, I am convinced that in a thousand years time the name of its author will be the greatest in Irish history while the name of his detractors will not be mentioned.</P>
      <P>I have here copies of two statements of welcome that were given to the Constitution in 1937.  The first was delivered at a special service in St. Patrick's Cathedral.  I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of December 30th, 1937:</P>
      <P>On the 29th of December, 1937, the day the Constitution came into effect, a special Service of Intercession for Ireland was conducted in St. Patrick's (Protestant) Cathedral.</P>
      <P>Benediction was pronounced by the Archbishop of Dublin, Most Rev. Dr. Gregg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dean, Rev. D.F.R. Wilson, asked the congregation to pray for Ireland, saying: &ldquo;Let us pray for the Government of Ireland, and for all those who are set in authority in this land, that all things be so ordered and settled by their endeavours upon the best and surest foundation, peace and happiness, truth and justice, religion <Col N="435" /> and piety may be established among us for all generations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The second quotation is from the same issue of <i>The Irish Press</i> and is as follows.</P>
    <P Just="Center">JEWISH MINISTER'S TRIBUTE TO TOLERANCE.</P>
    <P>Service at the Jewish Synagogue, Adelaide Road, was conducted by the Senior Minister, Rev. A. Gudansky, assisted by Rev. M. Roith.</P>
    <P>Rev. Gudansky said that it was their great privilege and infinite pleasure to join with their fellow-citizens in the celebration of the occasion of the new Constitution for the government of Éire.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This Constitution,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;will go down in history as a memorable system of government, truly fashioned after the pattern of God's holy law, containing the loftiest creeds of justice and equity of freedom, of conscience, and equality of rights for all.</P>
    <P>We confidently hope that this Constitution will uplift the nation to a still higher level, enhance its prestige, and will further advance its material and cultural welfare along its own national lines&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Constitution was welcomed in 1937 but it appears that certain people find objections to it now.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote some constructive comments from the issue of <i>The Irish Press</i> to which I have referred already.  These are from an editorial:</P>
      <P>It will be instructive to the Irish public to see the comment of the <i>Manchester Guardian,</i> an independent, but at the same time one of the most powerful and influential organs of opinion in Great Britain, on the coming into force of <i>Bunreacht na hÉireann</i>.  Says the <i>Guardian:</i>&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is an important day in Irish history.  The new Constitution has been accepted by a majority of the <Col N="436" /> electorate by plebiscite; it is opposed in principle by no considerable political section.  In essence it is unchallengeable, much as it may be revised in detail and some of its mechanism changed in the light of experience.  But no Irish party is likely to go back on the status that the Constitution lays down for the Free State.  That status is hardly capable of exact definition, but Mr. de Valera was not far wrong when he spoke of the Constitution as one for an independent Ireland.  If Ireland were to proclaim herself a Republic she would need no change in form. For, under the Constitution, &ldquo;Éire is a sovereign, independent, and democratic State,&rdquo; drawing from the people its powers of government which are exercisable only by or on the authority of the organs of State established by the Constitution. There is no word in the text of the Crown, of Great Britain, of the British Commonwealth of Nations, (nor is there equally any reference to a Republic.)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This is a description of the new Constitution which is substantially as fair and accurate as it would be possible to give.  It is a recognition that the independence of Ireland has been, in the fullest terms, asserted and proclaimed in <i>An Bunreacht</i>, that every trace of the British connection has been eliminated, that there is no fetter or bond to restrict Éire's freedom of action in any course she may decide upon taking, and that when the Six Counties are restored there need not be a change of a syllable or a comma in the instrument when the Republic is declared for the re-integrated territory.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To him (Mr. de Valera) the Constitution is a long step, almost the last, towards the historical fulfilment of Irish dreams of independent nationhood.  And he is entitled to congratulation on the way he handled it.  Who would have thought it possible fifteen years ago, when the doctrine of &ldquo;external association&rdquo; was so keenly resisted by the British in the treaty negotiations, <Col N="437" /> that by 1937 we should see it in practice, with no Irish voice raised seriously against it?  And, what is more to the point, that no one should be the worse because the treaty-conditioned Constitution of 1922 has disappeared?  We must give Mr. de Valera credit for a single-mindedness almost unique in modern politics.  We may also reserve a little credit for ourselves in having the common sense and patience (with only a few lapses) to leave him alone and to recognise that the internal government of the Free State is its own affair.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The editorial continued:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It would be churlish not to recognise the generous spirit which characterises an article written on those lines.  It strikes an altogether new note in British journalism, so far as Ireland is concerned.  It shows a desire to approach the new situation which has been created with sympathy, with an understanding of Éire's position, and with a sense of historic justice.</P>
    <P>I shall not read any further from the article but it would be well worth while for anyone to read the newspapers of the 30th December, 1937. Unfortunately not enough homework has been done by those who criticise the Constitution.  There is another article which I cannot find at the moment.  It is one which refers to the 1922 Constitution.  It says that, whatever can be said about that Constitution, it was not Irish, that it was accepted under intimidation, under threats by Britain, and that certain suggested passages were deleted by them; that, therefore, those who would defend the 1922 Constitution defend a British Government.  That Constitution was not the work of Irishmen.  It was the work of British statesmen who told the Irishmen what they&mdash;the British&mdash;could accept.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Jokingly I asked some of my colleagues the following question: &ldquo;If this Article is deleted, does it mean that the Catholic faith will no longer be the majority faith in this country?&rdquo; All the Article states is that the Catholic religion is the majority faith, nothing else.  That is my interpretation. I remember reading the debate on the 1937 Constitution and one of the points made by President de Valera at the time was that the document was drafted in the language of the people so that ordinary people could read the Constitution and understand it.  Unfortunately, it seems the only people who do not understand it are the lawyers.  They have always tended to make something else out of it.  Anyone who reads the Constitution can understand it clearly; it is not complicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who suggest we <Col N="439" /> draft a new Constitution.  Our Constitution belongs to the people and only they have the right to change it.  To go behind their backs, which Deputy Cosgrave was suggesting, and put a completely new Constitution to them is cowardly.  It is an effort to ensure that the people do not have the opportunity to use their good sense and judgment.</P>
    <P>I have listened to many debates on radio and television about the Constitution and about various items contained in it which it is thought would interfere with the rights and freedoms of people.  There is nothing in the Constitution that interferes with the rights and freedoms of any individual. Deputy Cosgrave skirted around the issue of divorce.  He would not put his finger on it; he said there are certain Articles in the Constitution which he considered should not be there and I interpreted that to mean the Article dealing with divorce in particular.  This was not put in as a religious matter and this needs to be understood.  The Article was inserted because it was considered that divorce was a social evil; in other words, it was a social issue.  The judgment in 1937 was that if divorce were allowed a greater social evil would be created.</P>
    <P>Perhaps standards of morality have changed since then; I do not know. At some future date the people may have an opportunity to test this but I do not agree with the idea of going behind their backs drafting a new Constitution and deleting certain Articles. The people should decide these matters.  The Constitution is a precious document and it belongs to the people.</P>
    <P>Cardinal Conway has stated that he will not lose a night's sleep if this Article is deleted and neither shall I. However, I resent the inference that the Constitution confers a certain status on the Catholic religion and I do not accept this view.  If it is the opinion of the people that our brothers in the North of Ireland consider this Article would impinge on their rights and if it is thought that its deletion would help, that is fair enough.  However, I do not think this deletion will change anyone's opinions.  People want to pick holes in the institutions in this part of the country.  I have not heard <Col N="440" /> any complaints from the Jewish community or from the Protestant community about discrimination.  Those people in the North who accuse us of discrimination have the worst record of discrimination in these islands and we should not forget that fact.  All the time we are bending over backwards and asking them what else they want us to change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

When I hear British statesmen make suggestions that we should change certain Articles in our Constitution I am tempted to ask them what about their own country.  In Britain a Catholic cannot become Prime Minister, neither can he become Lord High Chancellor, and the Queen is the head of the Church.  It is time that we say to these people and to those in the North who talk about theocratic States: &ldquo;Look at the United Kingdom.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>West of the Shannon the Constitution has never been thought about because it was always regarded as the 1937 Lenten pastoral of Most Reverend John Charles McQuaid.  It was held that his powers did not hold west of the Shannon and nobody took much notice of it.  I always regarded it as the lawyers' bible, the lawyers soft method of making even softer money.  I understand that when any Acts or regulations of this House were challenged the Government paid the expenses of the other side in addition to their own expenses.  There must have been some soft money got out of it and there is a man here at the moment who must have got a lot out of it.  I am not that person.</P>
      <P>While I do not completely agree with the Constitution it is considerably better than the previous Constitution which was imposed on this country by Great Britain.

It is strange that the British have succeeded in keeping going without a Constitution.  I should love somebody to be able to explain that to me.  I should love to see the Constitution of the Soviet Union.  Even more so I should like to see the Constitution of the Chinese.  For some reason or other they jog along.  Instead of having <Col N="442" /> this amending Bill before us today we should scrap the Constitution and start all over again.</P>

      <P>This Constitution should never have been produced because it was not necessary.  We would have got on even if we never had a Constitution.  It is true that a few lawyers would not have the vast accumulation of wealth which they now have if we had not got the Constitution. That is about the only purpose I ever saw it serving.  It was never recognised west of the Shannon. Bar myself, probably nobody west of the Shannon ever read the Constitution, and probably never will read it.  Even when they voted for it, they did not know what the hell they were voting for.  They thought they would go to hell if they did not vote for it because it was a religious Constitution. It was a series of extracts from the Bible, the Koran and the famous Chinese book&mdash;I cannot think of the name of it.  Eventually it will go down in history as the bible of some undiscovered religious sect and it will probably end up in oblivion.</P>
      <P>If it went to a vote on this Bill, and I do not think it will, I would have to make up my mind which way I would vote.  If a Bill was introduced to wipe out the Constitution and start anew in this day and age I would certainly vote in favour of it.  The present hub-bub about the deletion of one Article, which never meant anything anyway, is a bit of a joke.  Who in this country has bothered about religious discrimination?  Nobody as far as I know.  At any rate, the row appears to be simply between Protestant and Catholic or <i>vice versa</i>.  It is rather strange that the Jews, the Muslems, people of various faiths, and people of no faith at all and no religion at all, have no trouble in this country.  Nobody has ever said anything to them and it is unlikely that anybody ever will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some biassed people. Recently I was at a meeting about community schools and a young and inexperienced priest was daft enough to state that, if there was a community school in Erris, there would be a danger of the Protestant element there getting control.  He forgot that in the whole barony of Erris there are only two Protestants&mdash;two old women, both over 70 years of age&mdash;and it is unlikely <Col N="444" /> that they will produce any more Protestants. I can assure the House he got it from me.  I do not think he will repeat that piece of bigotry again.</P>
    <P>Whether or not we delete this Article will make no difference.  I regard this as just a cheap-jack means of kow-towing to the Orange thugs of Belfast, and nothing more.  Does anybody think that by removing this Article&mdash;and it will be gone tomorrow evening&mdash;they will rush in here on Saturday?  Who is crazy enough to believe that we should be influenced by that crowd of thugs?  This will not have any effect good, bad or indifferent. Why can we not waken up to that fact?  Even if we did change the Constitution, it would still make no difference because this problem has nothing to do with the Constitution or with our religion.  Even if we had no religion that would not influence them to come in here.  God grant that we will never see the day when that &ldquo;shower&rdquo; of thugs do come in here.  We have enough &ldquo;gombaloons&rdquo; in this country as we stand without introducing a new breed and getting cross-breeds after them.  They would be worse.</P>
    <P>We should face reality.  To be quite honest I have grave doubts as to whether we should bother our heads putting this question forward for decision by the public.  If it is considered necessary to have a change I do not see why the political parties should have to spend any money on it.  Let the priests and bishops get up on their altars and tell the people what to do. This would solve the problem for us and for the parties, and save us a lot of money.  I fail to see what the point is in changing it since it is a non-event, a non-affair.  It has no effect; it never had any effect; it is never likely to have any effect.  I should not like to see money being squandered on what is a piece of utter nonsense anyway.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy raised the question of contraception and the pill.  I do not think there were any pills in this country in 1937 except Beechams pills.  It is quite possible that they were regarded as acceptable while the new one&mdash; whatever it is; I do not know&mdash;is not. I heard a Deputy speaking on the radio recently about contraception.  He does not have to worry about contraception <Col N="445" /> at this stage any more than myself.  It is funny that that is the type of person they put on to talk about these things. There is not a Deputy in this House who does not know as well as I know that contraception is being practised extensively in this country.</P>

Deputy Briscoe got away with the same thing and I do not think that a poor man from the west coast of Ireland should be shot down because he is trying to justify his case.  This Bill will not make one bit of difference. There has been contraception since the time of Adam.  There is no question about that.  He probably practised it in a different way from the way it is practised today, but it was there.</P>
      <P>There is no change which can be made in the Constitution, including this proposed change, which will bring one extra Orangeman back into the fold. The faster we realise that, and the sooner we decide to hold on to our own national identity, if we have one, the better not only for ourselves but for all belonging to us, and for the future as well.  Deputy Briscoe is a practising Jew.  His father was one of the finest men in this country.  Deputy Briscoe gave the facts of the case.  I agree with him.  I have not much faith; I have less hope; but I have charity. Very few Catholics have charity. Deputy Briscoe has charity.  His father before him had charity.  He was quite right, no matter how many pro-British Deputies may oppose him.  If these people are, as they profess to be, pro-British, then there is a place for them in the Westminster Parliament but there is no place for them in this House.</P>

      <P>We find ourselves today engaged in endeavouring to undo the mistakes of Fianna Fáil and it is, perhaps, fortunate that it is Fianna Fáil that has to come into this House now to admit that its Constitution of 1937 was a serious mistake, serious in that it built into the fundamental law of this <Col N="446" /> State a wholly unnecessary irritant which has given to the opponents of this State a stick with which to beat it. It is, perhaps, small wonder&mdash;I am sorry Deputy Lenehan is running out of the House to escape the truth and the facts&mdash;that the imperfect Constitution of 1937 received the support of only 26 per cent of the people; 20 per cent of the people voted against it; 32 per cent of the people were ineligible to vote; of those who were eligible to vote, 22 per cent did not vote on it.  Contrary to what Deputy Lenehan suggested when he inferred that the Constitution of 1922 had not received popular support, the Constitution of 1922, when submitted to the people for approval in the context of a general election, received 78 per cent of the popular vote whereas the Constitution of 1937 received only 57 per cent in the context of those eligible to vote.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave was quite right&mdash; it is necessary historically to recall this&mdash;when he said that the 1922 Constitution, which was belittled for 15 years and which some people could not get rid of quickly enough&mdash;is now found to be the Constitution which would most suitably meet the many tensions and difficulties that now exist. There was, of course, no need to set out in the Constitution of 1937 the numerical superiority of people of a particular religion.  Neither was or is it necessary nor desirable to identify any religions by name.  To do so is to infer that man has achieved a full knowledge of the truth and can never have greater truth revealed to him. This is so clearly illogical and so contrary to all man's experience that one is amazed at the stupidity of the draftsmen of the 1937 Constitution adopting the particular line they did. In passing, I might here remind Deputy Lenehan that the person he attacked this morning, the Most Reverend Dr. John Charles McQuaid, was neither a Bishop nor an Archbishop in 1937.  He may possibly have had a part as adviser to Mr. de Valera at the time, but he was not then a bishop and the remarks the Deputy made were, to say the least of it, unfortunate.</P>

    <P>Now, if a Constitution ignores essentials, <Col N="447" /> it will breed both cynicism and hypocrisy.  It will also tend to be an imperfect weapon.  It will not be that which it should be&mdash;a document to promote the happiness of the greatest possible number of people governed by that Constitution.  When we say that sectarian references should be omitted from our Constitution we are not saying that our Constitution should be made a purely secular Constitution. Belief in God is an overwhelming belief of nearly all Irish people and it is, indeed, this excess belief in God in parts of this country which is the root of much of the difficulty that exists.  A totally secular Constitution or a totally secular administration would be as effective in reflecting the basic approach to life of Irish people as would be a mirror in total darkness.  The avoidance of sectarianism, which it is our passion to avoid, does not require secularism; it requires tolerance.</P>
    <P>One of the great fallacies of the modern Irish reform movement is the call for non-denominational education. This is a reform advocated in the erroneous belief that neutralised education will bring neutral and, consequently, tolerant adult citizens.  But that does not necessarily follow.  Deep religious conviction is an asset in any society and positive religious conviction should be fostered rather than discouraged. Loyalty to the Christian ethos demands tolerance of the views, the rights and the beliefs of others.  I would prefer to see our people looking to a country like Holland, where the old irrational religious antipathy has disappeared because of the unity of view which developed between the Protestant and the Catholic Churches and because they joined in a common struggle to establish and maintain schools of their respective denominations and opposed the move to neutralise education.  By coming together in this common interest in Holland, the Churches preserved their separate identities and, at the same time, found a new service to God by working together for the improvement of the young people.  Holland now, at one time so divided, divided as we are in <Col N="448" /> the North of our country, laughs at the folly, the bitterness and the bigotry of their past.  If we were to adopt secular schools here in the South they would necessarily be Catholic schools by reason of the weight of the Catholic population, just as the non-denominational schools, so-called, in the North of Ireland have become Protestant schools by reason of the concentration of Protestants in that area.  Secularism <i>simpliciter</i>, either in a Constitution or in an administration, can aggravate divisions.  It should, therefore, be avoided.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, the draftsmen of the 1922 Constitution did not risk the pitfalls into which the 1937 Constitution fell.  The earlier document was a Constitution of fundamental principles in which the people of this island believed.  A Constitution should guide public and private life and, at the same time, avoid troublesome denominational references and moral homilies like those we were given in the 1937 document.  I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who said that there was, perhaps, some transient political advantage to the Government of that time in identifying the Church of Rome as the church of the majority faith in 1937; perhaps there was an anxiety on Mr. de Valera's part to escape from the smirch on his character flowing from his earlier deeds and perhaps it was this which instigated Mr. de Valera at the time to formulate the particular kind of Constitution he did.  It is regrettable that ever since then, we have been taunted with adopting in 1937 a form of words which suggested that there was some substantial link between Church and State here, a link which, in fact, never existed.  I speak from my own humble experience now as a Member of this House for 13 years.</P>
    <P>During all those years I have never been ordered, directed or even counselled to follow a particular line in relation to my public affairs which was required by or pleasing to the Catholic Church as such.  I, the same as any other Member of Parliament in any part of the world, am naturally influenced by my own environment and by the contacts I may make. Perhaps our outlook here is more <Col N="449" /> strongly coloured by Catholic beliefs than it may be in a country in which one does not find so many members of a particular church.  Yet, I have never found myself, and neither do I believe any other Member of this House has ever found himself, embarrassed by any pressures brought to bear by members of the Catholic Church or, indeed, of any other church.  That is not to say that Members of this House are not asked by religious leaders of different parties to consider their opinions and their views on legislative and administrative matters.  This would be an important Parliament if it did not invite and did not listen to the opinions of everybody in the community, and particularly religious leaders, on matters that might be worrying their flocks.  However, the kind of intimidation to which we are supposed to be subjected does not exist, and I believe the Members of this House, individually and collectively, would strongly resist and repudiate any pressures, direct or indirect, which might be brought to bear on them by any particular church which could conflict with a public representative's obligation to represent all impartially.</P>
    <P>The Constitution can and should be made religiously inoffensive without purging it of all references to God.  The Preamble to the 1922 Constitution acknowledged, very properly, that all lawful authority comes from God to the people, and in exercise of that authority the people's constituent assembly enacted the Constitution and received subsequent approval from the people by way of a general election.  Thus in 1922 was proper acknowledgement given to God as the basis of sound Government, but that was the only reference to God in the 1922 Constitution.  Article 8 of that Constitution, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out this morning, gave a most effective guarantee of religious liberty and equality but carefully excluded any reference which could have cast suspicion or generated any doubt.  But the 1937 Constitution which we are today called upon to amend has seven specific references to God, three of them admittedly in oaths to be taken <Col N="450" /> by office holders, but it is not necessary to put the form of an oath of an office holder into a constitution.  Six religious denominations are named in the Constitution and it is implied that any religious denomination which comes into existence after the 1937 Constitution is not recognised. That has created troubles and could create even more administrative difficulties were it not to be amended. The publication of blasphemous matter is declared a punishable offence in the 1937 Constitution.  A strange thing to do, to start spelling out particular crimes in a constitution, a wholly unnecessary performance and one which I think any lawyer would be anxious to avoid.</P>
    <P>God is named on seven occasions in the 1937 Constitution but he is also referred to not simply as God but in Roman Catholic terms such as &ldquo;The Most Holy Trinity, Our Divine Lord Jesus Christ and Almighty God.&rdquo; The most that can be said against any reference to God in the Constitution is that it could offend a humanist, an atheist or an agnostic.  It is not desirable that any such people should be offended but in any society you are bound to find that its fundamental law and legislation will reflect the overwhelming view of its people.  It is impossible to provide in man-made law a form of words which will not cause some irritation to some people.  However, the typical Catholic terminology in the 1937 Constitution could reasonably be unacceptable to some Christian sects and to members of the Jewish congregation.  In any modern constitution which we hope some day we will introduce here it is highly desirable that references of those limited kinds should be omitted from it.</P>
    <P>The arguments most frequently voiced for deletion of sub-articles (2) and (3) of section 1 of Article 44 of the Constitution is that to recognise the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church is a useful weapon in the hands of Northern bigots who oppose Irish unity and because of that it should be omitted. That is a sound argument for omitting it but it is not the principal argument. This alteration to the Constitution <Col N="451" /> should be made because it is good in itself to make it and it is good for our society to make it.  We cannot now escape the charge, which is a true one, that we are making this amendment because of the pressure of the recent tragic savagery in the North of Ireland and perhaps because of diplomatic pressure or approaches which might have been made by the British Government and, indeed, by other countries as well.  I am aware that several of the member states of the Council of Europe were surprised to find that the tolerant Republic of Ireland did have a provision in its Constitution which suggested that there was some formal, substantial association between the Catholic Church and the institutions of State, and they have suggested to the members of the Irish delegation in the Council of Europe that these could with benefit be omitted.  It is unfortunate that this mistake was made in 1937, and it is particularly fortunate that even now, subject to the pressure of recent catastrophic events, we are making good this very foolish mistake which was made 35 years ago.</P>
    <P>The Vatican Council Decree on Ecumenism exhorted men to eliminate words, judgments and actions which did not fairly respond to the wishes of others.  Even people who may feel very strongly obliged to conform precisely with the teaching of the Catholic Church can find in the words of the Vatican Council encouragement and, indeed, an incitement to make this amendment to eliminate words from the Constitution which do not fairly respond to the wishes of others. I think it is true to say that the church references in our Constitution do not fairly conform to the wishes of others.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ben Briscoe very usefully quoted the addresses of the Church of Ireland and Jewish Congregation leaders in 1937 in connection with the 1937 Constitution.  I think the leaders of all churches were consulted in 1937 in connection with the drafting of Article 44, but even though they accepted the document as a whole in their public declarations as a comprehensive Constitution which <Col N="452" /> did not impose or impinge unfairly on anybody, it is common knowledge that the phraseology on the churches caused a certain amount of unhappiness and irritation.  That was the situation, I think, within our own jurisdiction, but it certainly caused untold mischief in the North of Ireland.  It is, therefore, not entirely a true picture to quote the eulogies of churchmen in 1937, because if that were to be accepted as our present guide we would be wrong to be influenced by the 35 following years.  I would suspect that the successors of the same people, if asked for a comment upon the Article in 1972, would not be using the same form of words as were used in 1937.</P>
    <P>A Constitution is essentially a legal document.  Deputy Joseph Lenehan offered some criticism of the use to which lawyers put the 1937 Constitution. What he is saying is that the lawyers were wrong to uphold the Constitution against the Government, against Governmental abuse, and against Parliament which was purporting to breach the Constitution.  Any legal historian will quickly ascertain and point out that there was far less litigation under the 1922 Constitution than under the 1937 edition, probably because the 1922 one avoided the pitfalls, avoided the carelessness in language, avoided the soft approach, avoided the inept homilies which were in the 1937 Constitution.  The 1937 Constitution has, admittedly, furnished very fertile opportunities for lawyers and for litigants, but the fault is in the extravagance of the language and in the failure to have regard to the fundamental requirements of the Constitution.  I think the fundamental Constitutional requirements are brevity and preciseness.  The 1937 one is full of ambiguities and it is one of these very ambiguities which we are seeking to amend today because of the irritation, confusion and mischief which have arisen out of it.</P>
    <P>A Constitution, then, is a legal document, a document to control the behaviour of a society, to fix the bounds within which the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary may operate to ensure effective recognition <Col N="453" /> and observance of the fundamental beliefs and rights of the people governed by that Constitution.  In a country like our own, where the population is overwhelmingly one which believes in God and where all but a minority are Christian, it would be unjust and unthinkable were the fundamental law not to respect God and not to respect and reflect Christian outlook.  Christian instruments and institutions cannot, of their nature, if they are Christian, be unjust to non-Christians&mdash;certainly not in this modern age, when one is guided by the more modern perspective and more tolerant outlook of the present day Catholic Church.  Therefore, a Christian society in Ireland could not infringe the reasonable sensibilities of non-Christians, and a Constitution and the society it controls can be Christian without having all this effusive, ecclesiastical moralising of the present Constitution of the Republic.  That is why we in Fine Gael urge that the present Constitution should be scrapped at the earliest possible date and replaced by a modern, more efficient and honest document.</P>
    <P>The Irish, whether they come from ancient Celtic stock or are descended from people who came later to these shores, are a deeply religious people, as I have emphasised.  This fact has been grasped by ill-disposed people, who for evil political ends have twisted deep religious convictions into hatred and prejudices.  The best way to overcome the prolonged savagery and terror of misused religion in this island is to use positively and constructively the religious loyalties of people for good political ends.  A great and just Presbyterian Minister, the Reverend Henry Montgomery, depicted his melancholy country in 1829 in the following words:</P>
    <P>Political and religious bigroty have mingled together and those who foment persecutions among us have made it their policy so to conjoin the two principles that scarce an individual is now held orthodox who is not also an enemy to the civil or religious rights of his fellow men.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="454" /> Those are words uttered a century and a half ago.  Are they not tragically true of our experience today? A century and a half after the Reverend Montgomery spoke, things have not changed for one-third of the people of this island.  Misled people deny justice, kill and physically attack their neighbours because their neighbours hold different beliefs.  They do these terrible wrongs in the conviction that their God sustained their fathers and blessed the arms of their fathers in like deeds in the past and that the same God, their God, smiles and blesses their atrocities today.  It has been said and one can repeat, that God does not demand such fervour from his servants.</P>
    <P>If this bitterness, this bigotry, this religious savagery exists in this island it is not because of this foolish irritant in Article 44 of the Constitution; but as long as that irritant is there it will be identified by hypocrites as one of the causes.  Bigotry exists because of the existence of the Orange Order. In 1835 a Parliamentary Committee of the Westminster Parliament carried out a most exhaustive research of the operations of the Orange Order and recommended to the British Government and Parliament, on the conclusion of its work, that the Orange Order should be suppressed.  I shall quote from the actual report. Referring to the Orange Order it says:</P>
    <P>A great political body thus organised in the ranks of the Army, and in every part of the British Empire, is a formidable power at any time and in any circumstances, but when your Committee look to the political tendancies of the measures of the Orange Societies in England and Ireland, and particularly to the language contained in addresses to the public and in correspondence to the Grand Officers of the Institution, and consider the possible use that might be made of such an organised power, its suppression becomes, in their opinion, imperatively necessary.</P>
    <P>The Orange Order was not suppressed. It is as free today to carry on its malicious, anti-Catholic campaign <Col N="455" /> in the North of Ireland as ever it was.  If an explanation is to be found as to how the Unionists of the North of Ireland were unable to use independence and power which was given to them in 1920 to break out from the shackles of bigotry, the explanation will be found in the attitudes of the leaders of the Unionist Party, an attitude spelt out by Mr. Brian Faulkner, an attitude which in the end crushed Brian Faulkner and Unionism, an attitude which he described to a meeting of Orangemen in July, 1958 as &ldquo;the invincible combination of the Orange Order and the Unionist Party&rdquo;, to which, he said, there was &ldquo;no alternative&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Even though we from these benches in Fine Gael opposed the 1937 Constitution and even though now we are pleased at this move to eliminate these irritants of the 1937 Constitution, let no one pretend that the references in the Constitution of 1937, or indeed any of the practices here, are in any way a contribution to the vicious religious bigotry which exists in the North of Ireland and which will continue to exist as long as the British Government and any administration in the North of Ireland ignore and do nothing to break this invincible link between a sectarian, bigoted organisation and a political party.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the political divide, as a consequence of this link between the Orange Order and the Unionist Party, the Nationalist Party also has an arrangement with the Ancient Order of Hibernians; but that is an arrangement which, though it exists on paper, in practice is not now effective.  That is not the situation in relation to the Orange Order, which has as of right, and continues to practise as of right, a right of nomination of 130 religious bigots from the Orange Order on to the Unionist Council, the governing body of the Unionist Party.  No matter what plebiscites are proposed or questions proposed in plebiscites, no matter what the colour or the number of papers for a solution published by the British Government or by anybody else, I believe there will be no end <Col N="456" /> to the misery of our people until there is a severance of connection between sectarian organisations and political parties.</P>
    <P>Therefore, one hopes this particular nettle will be grasped and that the British Parliament and Government, which did not suppress the Orange Order, as they should have, in 1835, will now see the price that they have paid for their past omissions and will endeavour in 1972 or soon to break this most vicious connection between religious sectarianism and political domination.</P>
    <P>Europe and the world are baffled that a modern country like ours in the modern age could endure the kind of religious warfare we have.  Where does one find the explanation?  There is certainly a conflict between national loyalties, between Unionists and Nationalists: there is perhaps also a conflict between religious outlooks of Catholics and Protestants.  Conflict is perhaps too strong a word, one might say incompatabilities.  Differences of opinion exist between people of other nationalities in other parts of the world, and between people of the same and other religions, but they do not boil up into the vicious and continuing sectarian hatred which results in such misery and death in Northern Ireland.  But it is only in Northern Ireland that you have an Orange Order, so well, so permanently and so fully organised.  While I respect the many fair-minded Orange men who are in the Orange Order because they see that order as a way in which they can maintain their religious beliefs and although there are vast numbers in the order who have no animosity towards their Catholic brethren, the reality is that the Orange Order is organised, dominated and controlled not merely as an organisation to promote Protestantism &mdash;which is a perfectly legitimate objective&mdash;but it is also an organisation to promote hatred of Catholicism. If that simple fact is not grasped no pious resolutions, no amount of legislation or amendments of Constitutions will provide a cure for the misery to which our country, and particularly the North, is subjected at present.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> While we are glad to be omitting the special position of the Catholic Church in the Constitution, perhaps we have some reluctance in removing from the Constitution the Protestant Churches by name, churches whose members have contributed most generously to the happy atmosphere and to the soundness of our society.  I should like to use this occasion to express my unqualified praise for the manner in which Protestants have contributed to the building up of our society.  Some Protestants were not politically sympathetic to the establishment of an independent Ireland in 1920, and some began with less than enthusiasm for a new and independent Ireland.  Today they are not merely contented citizens but they are contributing in a greater way than ever before to the building up and improvement of our society.</P>
    <P>In the charitable field the endeavours of Protestants frequently outdistance the contributions of Catholics. Work of very great value is done by many charitable organisations often without any public credit and generally without any worthwhile public recognition. Again and again you find that not only are the Protestant community playing a generous part but frequently a leading part.  In many social fields they have initiated reforms and they have done so in a way which has always dovetailed easily into the political work of our institutions.  This is evidence of what can happen in a society where you have tolerance.  If only the Ulster Unionists had displayed towards their minority the tolerance of the minority exhibited here by successive Governments, you might well have in the North a society as peaceful, sound, progressive and as generous as the one in which we are very happy to live.</P>
    <P>But apart from the corporal works of mercy and the effective initiative they have taken in social and political fields, the Protestants in southern Irish society have given us a dimension we would not otherwise have.  They have often forced members of the majority faith to think.  It is a very important thing to do some fundamental thinking from time to time.  The more one becomes engaged <Col N="458" /> in political life the less time one has to think.  But again and again we have had a new dimension added to our thinking.  Our approach to social and other problems has been improved by the contribution which the Protestant churches and members of the dissenting churches have given us. We want to promote this working together throughout this island.  We believe this constitutional step today, even though little more than a gesture, is a step in the right direction. It could be described as a two-inch step forward but it is at least better than standing still or moving backwards.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to over-estimate the importance of this gesture in the North at present.  Certainly there will be mischievous people in the Orange Order and other sectarian groups who will say that they cannot trust the Greeks bearing gifts, that if the South are doing this they are at the same time secretly entrenching the position of the church more strongly than ever. We cannot control that situation. Until we are far more generous in our approach to the fears of the Unionists in the North, we can do very little to overcome that kind of propaganda.  Quite a large number in the North will regard this as little more than window-dressing but perhaps it is better to dress the window properly than leave it in the rather unacceptable condition in which it has been up to now.  It is important for us to be free of the notion which could be interpreted from our Constitution that we have an established relationship between church and State. It is good to make this reform if it is desired by any people in the North &mdash;and it is desired by some&mdash;and it certainly means that our qualification and right to be consulted in relation to a solution of the Northern problem is more obvious and easier to recognise if we remove from our Constitution something to which many people in the North may take strong exception.</P>
    <P>In this regard ours is a more positive and more constructive plebisite than that which the British Government announced yesterday for Northern <Col N="459" /> Ireland.  I appreciate that to discuss in detail the proposals of the British Government in regard to their plebiscite would be beyond the scope of this Bill but I must observe that this proposal, small though it is, is not divisive whereas the proposals of the British Government are divisive. The step we are taking is progressive; it is looking to, and will govern the future.  The plebiscite proposed by the British Government seeks confirmation that their decision of 52 years ago to set up a politico-religious state was right and that everything that has happened as a consequence was also right.  To that extent it is appropriate that we in this Parliament should point the way forward, should show that we are prepared to make changes, and hope this would be a guide to the British Parliament and Government as to how they ought to behave.</P>
    <P>But as we do this let us recognise that there is a great deal more to do. Deputy Cosgrave has rightly said that there are many other parts of our Constitution which would be better omitted, and they are not merely the parts to which Deputy Lenehan made reference.</P>
    <P>Apart from the express references to criminal offences in our Constitution and the claim in Article 3 of the Constitution to have a right&mdash;a right &mdash;to legislate for the North of Ireland, the whole Constitution of 1937 is written in terms which might have been appropriate in 1937 but which today are not appropriate.  They were to a large part inspired by the Papal Encyclicals of the 1920s and 1930s. That does not say that they were wrong but it does perhaps mean that some people might have difficulty in accepting some of the Roman Catholic homilies contained in the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>So, let us therefore get away from the verbiage.  Let us get away as fast as we can from the dead wood which tends to strangle and inhibit us and let us introduce here a modern Constitution which will avoid the many pitfalls of the 1937 Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the all-party <Col N="460" /> committee which is considering the 1937 Constitution and other matters which may be impediments to the unity of Ireland.  I do not want to disclose, because I think it would be improper for me to do so, the workings of that committee but I do think some of the thoughts I have mentioned today reflect the thinking of all parties in this House when they express a desire for a modern document. Let us hope the Fianna Fáil Party will overcome any embarrassment it may feel as a party in moving to replace the 1937 Constitution, which is certainly regarded as the handiwork of Mr. Eamon de Valera. It would be wrong for our generation or future generations to be limited in their scope or activity or to be restrained by a Constitution which has now become unacceptable and unworthy to meet the demands, the aspirations and, indeed, the very needs of our people at the present time and of future generations.  I believe it is possible to produce without a great deal of difficulty an acceptable Constitution for our own society and one which, by reason of its acceptability to our own society, will in fact not be unacceptable to our brethren in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>But we as politicians will have to remember this: we may well in this House pass this legislation and the other House may do likewise; we have to sell this to the electorate, the electorate who are emotionally involved, who are emotionally indignant, who are nationally irritated by many happenings in the North of Ireland and many events which may occur between now and the referendum.  The consequences to our own society, to this whole nation and to our relationships with Britain, Europe and the rest of the world were this referendum to be defeated would be disastrous. It would be catastrophic if this proposal were not carried in a referendum, not merely carried but carried by an overwhelming majority. Therefore, people cannot afford to say in this referendum, &ldquo;It is beyond me.  I do not want to take part in this. I will leave it to somebody else to vote.&rdquo;  This is a crucial issue.  This is a referendum which asks our people <Col N="461" /> to declare for tolerance, which asks our people to repudiate all sectarianism, which asks our people to hold out hands in loving friendship to all people irrespective of their religion or political beliefs and that requires also that we declare an end to violence, pressure or chicanery of any kind to try to bend people from beliefs that they dearly hold.</P>
    <P>This, I believe, is a challenge to our people to vote for a new society.  It may be a small gesture in itself but its significance can be immense and if we as politicians fail to convince our people of the need to support this referendum <i>en masse</i> then I believe we would today, while we intend to do well, be doing very great harm to our society.  So, our task is only beginning and it will not end even when this referendum is carried.  We will have to carry on this aspiration to create a new and more tolerant outlook for our people in this island so that the sectarianism and bigotry which is tending to destroy us at present can be eliminated from this island and from our thoughts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party's approach to this question is governed by our statement of Northern policy adopted at our Wexford conference of which the primary relevant part at this stage of our discussions is this:</P>
      <P>The Labour Party is convinced that peace and better understanding between the communities is a necessary pre-condition for the achievement of both socialism and of eventual unity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our test in relation to this has to be: does this advance the fulfilment of the necessary pre-condition?  I think the answer is, yes, it does, just a little.  It is too little and it is too late. Better late than never, yes, but, above all, I think most of us in this House must have been disappointed, considering the magnitude of the issues we are concerned with here, with the cold, grudging, perfunctory speech in which the Taoiseach introduced this. If this is an olive branch, and I suppose it is intended as one, it is being extended with a very languid hand, <Col N="462" /> almost contemptuously.  The implications of the Taoiseach's remarks &mdash; I do not have his text here; none came to us &mdash; the implications of his remarks appear to be that any objections which are made to these subsections are unreasonable, silly, not wellfounded but that we are so magnanimous that we are prepared to drop these Articles even if the objections are unreasonable.</P>
    <P>I do not think that either the Taoiseach's statement or many of the things that have been said in this debate do much to advance peace and better understanding between the communities.  I make an exception for Deputy Cluskey's speech and for part of Deputy Richie Ryan's speech, not for anything else, although I have listened attentively to the debate.</P>
    <P>I cannot allow to pass here without some protest certain language used here by Deputy Joe Lenehan, at which no one has yet protested at all. I do not want to make too much of Deputy Lenehan's statement.  He, perhaps, does not carry a tremendous amount of weight in this Assembly or in the country but a certain amount of weight should attach to what he says because he says in a very blunt and sometimes somewhat offensive manner things that quite a lot of other people are thinking and not saying or saying in a more genteel or oblique way.  He referred, and there was no protest in this House as he spoke, to Orangemen collectively as &ldquo;that crowd of thugs down there&rdquo;.  Now, I am as well aware as any Deputy of this House, and rather more aware than most, that there are such beings in this country as Orange thugs.  There are, indeed.  There are murderous thugs in that community and some of them belong to that institution. But, there are also republican thugs in this country and murderous republican thugs, at large, and openly at large under this Government, parading with their bodyguards through the streets of this city but we do not, and we would be called to order if we did &mdash; we do not refer to republicans collectively, to all who hold republican opinions, as thugs. We do not do it and we should not <Col N="463" /> do it.  If we are trying to promote peace and better understanding between the communities, we have to recognise the fact that many members of one of these communities belong to the Orange institution.</P>
    <P>We may not like its historical influence which has been one of the sinister stands in our history but if we are really trying to stretch out the hand of friendship, as Deputy Ryan said, we must think of the people we are addressing and we must not project on them all the guilt for the action of a handful of extremists in their community.  We, rightly, are appalled when they project on all Northern Catholics responsibility for the murderous actions of a few extremists. We must not be guilty of that. Above all, we must not be guilty of it in the context of a debate such as this in which we are supposed to be stretching out an olive branch.</P>
    <P>As I listened to the debate here, I was thinking of what effect it would have if somebody issued the full debate as a pamphlet and got it circulated into the hands of as many Northern Protestants as possible. Would it do good or would it do harm?  Our debate is not over but as it has gone so far I am afraid I reached the conclusion that there was more in it to do harm than to do good.  I hope that balance will be corrected as we go on.</P>
    <P>I said this offering was too little and too late.  Too late is obvious.  It is five years since this was recommended by an all-party committee but we are acting on it only now.  Why are we acting on it?  Is it really intended as a gesture towards Ulster Protestants?  I did not perceive any genuine sign of concern with Ulster Protestants in what the Taoiseach said this morning.  I sometimes doubt whether the Taoiseach even believes in the existence of Ulster Protestants, they are creatures so remote from his Cork world.  If he is concerned about them it did not come through in his opening speech this morning.  Let us hope it may come through in his concluding speech.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> I inferred from the introduction of this measure at this time and from the way in which the Taoiseach introduced it that it was aimed more at British public opinion than at the North, that this sub-article of this Article has become an incumbrance for him in his discussions with British statesmen and it is for that reason more than concern with any section of Northern opinion that he is dropping it.  I may be wrong and the Taoiseach or some member of his party may correct me.</P>
    <P>It is too little.  It is too little for a very specific reason.  The Taoiseach in the guarded language, of which he is a matter, said it was now generally acknowledged that the Article served no particular useful purpose.  There is a specific element in the general acknowledgement which is not without importance, that is, the known public fact that Cardinal Conway said that he would shed no tears if these sub-articles went.  We have to ask ourselves what would have happened if Cardinal Conway had said that he would shed tears.  He indicated that he would be opposed to the repeal of Article 41.3.2º, that which rules out divorce in all circumstances. No proposal concerning that is now before us.  He said he could accept the other one and a proposal concerning it is now before us.</P>
    <P>That is not an intellectually cogent way of providing to Ulster Protestants that the Catholic Church does not have power over our legislation.  On the contrary, it might seem to some that this was actually an illustration of what the special position of the Catholic Church means in practice, that is, if the Cardinal gives the green light it goes ahead and if he gives the red light it is a stop sign. This would appear to be the case.  We remember that when the former Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. McQuaid, indicated his opposition to the repeal of the anti-contraception legislation the Government backed away.  It is possible that under a new archbishop there may be a green light for that, too, and that will go through.  None of that is a way of refuting the existence of the special position.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Cardinal Conway meant, when he rightly said that he would shed no tears about the repeal of Article 44, that it was not necessary.  The special position of the Catholic Church in the Twenty-Six Counties is so unassailable that it does not require this kind of confirmation and a sense of economy and prudence would suggest that it is better that it is not there.</P>
    <P>Many people in this debate suggested that we need a new Constitution. That could have been prepared in the five years since the all-party committee made certain recommendations. When we are repealing these sub-articles we must bear in mind what exactly we are saying to Northern Protestants.  We are not saying that we are dropping an item in our domestic legislation.  The majority there do not care much about what our domestic legislation is.  We are saying to them: &ldquo;We have a Constitution which we have declared to be enacted by all the people of this nation, the Thirty-Two Counties.  It was only voted on by 26 per cent, as Deputy Ryan said, of the people, by electors in the Twenty-Six Counties but we claim it to be enacted by and for all the people of this island.&rdquo;  We are specifically saying to them: &ldquo;You in the Six Counties, although you will not be consulted about this, are no longer required to recognise the special position of the Holy Roman Catholic and Apostolic Church.&rdquo; If we get a thank-you-for-nothing answer to that proposition it is not entirely surprising.</P>
    <P>Article 44.1 has not in itself been basic to this matter.  It is the combination of Article 44.1 with Article 3 of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>... without prejudice to the right of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of that territory,...</P>
    <P>That is the right there enshrined.  The implicit claim is that the Constitution applies to everybody on this island.</P>

      <P>It is frequently done and it is a quite legitimate procedure I assure the Parliamentary Secretary to draw attention to a phrase in a sentence to which one sees objection.  It is quite legitimate particularly when the text is one with which every Member of this House is deemed to be familiar.  I see nothing really extraordinary about that.  It is the kind of fussy little point we get when the substance is pressing a little hard as I think this is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe we need a new Constitution and I suggest that we should be a little less arrogant, a little more humble and a little more honest in <Col N="467" /> our approach to it.  If it is to be a Constitution, as it seems overwhelmingly likely it will be, which will be adopted by a Twenty-Six County electorate, it should not purport to bind people who have not been consulted about it.</P>
    <P>Here I am not referring just to the Ulster Protestants but to everybody in the Six Counties, Catholic and Protestant, Nationalist and Unionist &mdash; the lot.  We should not purport to have the right to blind them by laws about which they are not consulted. This is elementary political science and it is violated in that Article.  I think that Article must go and we should be honest enough to take it out-and go back to something fairly close o the 1922 Constitution which was more honest in that respect.</P>
    <P>I would like to put it on the record here that in discussions with members of the Social Democratic and Labour Party in the North &mdash; I refer specifically to Mr. Paddy O'Hanlon and Mr. Austin Currie &mdash; they have agreed with me that they do not want these Articles, that they regard them as irrelevant and presumptuous They, representative of a wide section of the Catholic community in Northern Ireland, reject the right of Twenty-Six County people to exercise jurisdiction over them, although they do desire a united Ireland in which all the people of the island shall have their say in making the laws.  There is a distinction there.  I know that in this country anyone who tries to make distinctions of any degree of fineness is likely to find his words distorted. My words have been distorted into saying that we should abandon our aspiration to unity or &mdash; an alternative distortion &mdash; that we should pretend that we no longer cherish that aspiration.  I am saying just the opposite: I am saying that in a new Constitution we should place on record the aspiration held by the great majority of the citizens of the Twenty-Six Counties to see a united Ireland, united by free consent of all its inhabitants through a process of peace, better understanding and reconciliation. Those are the sentiments <Col N="468" /> of the great majority of our people, I believe we all know, and I am speaking in a Twenty-Six County context and honestly in that context.</P>
    <P>That aspiration should be recorded there.  It should not be concealed.  It should stand on the record but it should not be confused with a territorial claim of right of jurisdiction because that is not a way to begin a dialogue.  What that Constitution in effect says is: &ldquo;This is our land and we are going to get it back from you whenever we can&rdquo;&mdash; a territorial irredentist claim and not a movement towards reconciliation.  That, I think, is very important and basic&mdash;and this point is in fact much more basic than Article 44 with the two subsections which are now to be taken out&mdash;because the Northern objection to the recognition of the special position was not that they objected to people in the Twenty-Six Counties recognising the special position as long as they liked but that they objected very much to their recognising it for them.  This was indeed an astonishing combination of propositions to have.</P>
    <P>We are taking out&mdash;and it is a good thing: let us not quibble about that&mdash;&mdash; the special position of the Catholic Church in the Constitution and the recognition of the other churches also, the sort of secondary recognition that is there, but we are retaining the right to exercise jurisdiction over the whole of the territory.  We are holding on to that legalistic claim.  We are continuing to approach this problem completely from the wrong foot as the exercising of a territorial right and not as an exercise in reconciliation between people.  We can never get anywhere that way, never at all.  You do not begin a process of reconciliation by a legal quarrel over land.  Everybody in Ireland knows that; every farmer knows it.  It is basic and we violate that principle in these Articles and every time the Taoiseach says&mdash;&mdash; and he has said many good things about this&mdash;that what we want is unity by free consent of all Irishmen, on terms acceptable to all Irishmen, his words continue to be belied by this unfortunate Constitution of 1937.</P>
    <P>The Church has been blamed, and, <Col N="469" /> to my mind, wrongly, for this Constitution. I think that Ulster Protestants are mistaken about that.  They see churchmen as waving a big stick and saying: &ldquo;We must have all this Catholic stuff in the Constitution.&rdquo;  I do not think it ever happened.  I think that, as one would expect, the 1937 Constitution is a Fianna Fáil Constitution with Fianna Fáil motivation behind it, and Fianna Fáil motivations are powerful, clear-cut, effective things &mdash;we all know that&mdash;and none of us is in any position to underestimate Fianna Fáil skill in these matters.  In 1937, Mr. de Valera&mdash;I regret having to refer to our President in this context, but I am now speaking in the perspective of history and I am not going to say anything personal or derogatory about him&mdash;and his party had a problem in that they had been described by Fine Gael as more or less Communists, or something like Communists, and they seemed vulnerable to that sneer at that time, a time when a prominent figure in the party was referring to the Soviet Union as &ldquo;the great democracy of the East, if he might so describe it.&rdquo;  They were a little vulnerable then and they wanted to correct that and in their Constitution to show that they were better Catholics, and better Nationalists, than the opposing party.  They wanted to take the wind out of their sails&mdash; better Catholics with Article 44 and better Nationalists with Articles, 1, 2 and 3.  It was very effective Twenty-Six County politics but it had nothing whatever to do with uniting the country and in that respect and every other respect it was wholly consistent with everything Fianna Fáil have done since.</P>
    <P>They no longer need Article 44 now.  No one is calling them Communists and they are now in the safe, good business of calling other people Communists and waging their own form of sectarian political warfare, the slyboots variety which they practise as opposed to the rough, rude variety of the Northern Orangemen. They do not need it; they are in the clear; but the Nationalist bit they think they can still use for a while, so Articles 1, 2 and 3 in their present form stay.  I wish, because I know <Col N="470" /> that my words will be distorted, to put it clearly on the record that I believe that a Constitution enacted by the people whom we represent&mdash;and they are the people of the Twenty-Six Counties and not of the Thirty-Two Counties; let us never forget that and let us not too presumptuously exceed the boundaries of our actual responsibility&mdash;should record in unmistakeably clear words our aspirations towards the unity of this island and the people of this island by free consent and free consent alone because the principle of free consent is not in the present Constitution which speaks of &ldquo;pending the reintegration of the national territory&rdquo;, and bars no holds as to how that territory might be reintegrated, nor did the architects of the Constitution ever bar such holds and that also is a rather sinister undercurrent in relation to our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Ryan, I am a member of the Committee on the Implications of Irish Unity.  I wonder about the mechanics of the Committee on the Implications of Irish Unity.  What are they there for?  We are now acting on just one of the committee's recommendations five years afterwards. How many years must we wait before we implement the recommendations of that committee?  There is a logical puzzle about the committee.  Their terms of reference state that it is their function to find common ground between the parties as to what ought to be done to promote Irish unity.  Of course, &ldquo;common ground&rdquo; means specifically that nothing that Fianna Fáil do not want for the moment will be common ground and, therefore, that nothing that Fianna Fáil do not want can happen as the result of the deliberations of that committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an unfair sort of inference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect Deputy Carter and his intervention but might I ask for a little indulgence? Deputy Carter has not spoken.  If he believes that any inference I make is unfair he can try to establish that in his speech.  I do not want to be <Col N="471" /> heckled by Deputy Carter and I do not heckle Deputy Carter when he is speaking.  My inference, whether fair or not, may be dealt with by Deputy Carter and if he can prove that it is not fair I will yield to him, but my inference is sincere and genuine.</P>
      <P>The committee have to find common ground, but they will not do so if Fianna Fáil object.  That is so obvious that I need not emphasise it.  Anything Fianna Fáil want to do they can put through this Dáil.  Equally, that committee cannot take any action Fianna Fáil do not want.  They can, of course, recommend action.  Throughout the years, Fianna Fáil could have produced the draft of a new Constitution. They have had a good many years in which to do it but they have not done so and I am not convinced that the Committee on the Implications of Irish Unity, which must have the consent of Fianna Fáil, could move Fianna Fáil in that direction.  Indeed, we seem to be uncertain about a committee of that kind.  They are a curious committee in the sense that Fianna Fáil are in a minority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, all parties have a veto on anything coming out of that committee.  A better way to proceed would have been for the Government, which have the means of initiating the changes in the law which are required and also to dispose of the State apparatus, including the legal apparatus, to have said that the 1937 Constitution has become completely out of date, that it was accepted in a certain historical era.  They could say that no one need say anything disrespectful about it but that we need a new Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing of that kind is likely to come with any speed from this committee as at present staffed or non-staffed. The Government could have had a draft Constitution.  It could have been a fairly short draft in line with international thinking today.  They could have put it before an all-party committee for examination and criticism. <Col N="472" /> That need not have taken very long.  The whole exercise could have been completed well within the five years that have elapsed since those recommendations were made.  We can only conclude from what has happened that this Government are not very serious about this whole exercise. They have the power to do things without having to toss them back into the laps of the Opposition.  Of course, it would have been wise to have allowed the Opposition room and time for criticism to which adequate weight should have been given.</P>
    <P>Now we should like to hear some indication from the Government whether they have in mind the making of a new Constitution and, if so, how they will do it.  All Opposition speakers so far have called for this. The Government need not have any fear that if it is introduced it will be obstructed.  One suggestion, a senseless one, which was made by Deputy Briscoe, is that it would be going behind the backs of the people.  We cannot do that even if we wished to do it.  We could draft a new Constitution and take it to the people and let them decide on it, and let it not include any extraneous things like Article 44 (3) (2), the one on divorce.  Of course, everyone who refers to that is liable to have his words distorted.  That item is supposed to have been put in the Constitution in order to protect the family.  That is an excellent thing&mdash; we are all in agreement that the family should be protected&mdash;but this does not protect the family at all as many thousands of deserted wives and deserted children living on the cold charity of this State know only too well.  What it does is to protect the hypocrisy of the State and, of course, it has also served to advance the political fortunes of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>If Article 44 is really out so is Article 41 (3) (2) which is simply a practical expression of what Article 44 means, and if we take out Article 44 and leave in Article 41 what we are saying is that we do not need to say anything about the special position. But the special position still exists.</P>
    <P>While we accept this measure without any loud cheers&mdash;we hope that <Col N="473" /> when it is put to the people it will be carried by a large majority&mdash;it is not anything like enough.  It is but a tiny mouse to come out of the mountain of the Government's deliberations on this matter and it is utterly inadequate to meet the horrors in which we are involved.  The Government remain entirely complacent on this issue.  I do not believe anything serious in this whole range of issues will be done as long as Fianna Fáil hold office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I will discuss the proposed amendment to the Constitution with which we are dealing in the light of recent Irish history, and by recent Irish history I mean in the light of happenings here is the last 50 years or thereabouts. However, before coming to that aspect of the matter I should like to invite the House to have a brief look at the clauses of Article 44 which we propose to delete.  I ask the House to look at them in the light of the Constitution of 1937 as a whole.  That Constitution purported to be a 32-county Constitution, one which could operate without any change whatever when this country regained its full freedom and was completely united.  That claim has been made on behalf of this Constitution several times and it was repeated by Deputy Briscoe today.  I think we must look at Article 44 (1) (2) in that light.</P>
      <P>If this country had been united during the currency of the present Constitution we would have here approximately 1,500,000 persons who profess faiths other than the Catholic faith.  Sub-articles 1º, 2º of Article 44 must be taken as an insult, calculated or otherwise, to the people of this country who profess a faith other than the Catholic faith.  It states that:</P>
      <P>The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While that Article confers no benefit on the Catholic Church or on Catholic citizens of the State, it goes out of its way to lead Catholics and Protestants to believe that in some <Col N="474" /> way Catholics are singled out for special treatment or preference.  Sub-article 3º of the same Article states that:</P>
    <P>The States also recognises...</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;also&rdquo; there can be taken as being offensive.  One might expect to find after that word the statement that the State condescends to recognise the other churches.  That is the sort of atmosphere that this section of the Constitution creates.  Those two sub-articles taken together tend to create such an atmosphere.  Their writing in was unwise in the extreme especially in a Constitution which, presumably, was enacted to encourage the unification of the country and to serve the country when united.  They were calculated to do a lot of harm.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of 1921 which was ratified in 1922 and the Constitution of 1922 were mentioned here today.  It is my belief that the Treaty of 1921 was the maximum available by way of Irish freedom and that it was the minimum acceptable to the Irish people at that time.  It was not accepted as giving the Irish people absolute freedom.  It was accepted reluctantly as the best and greatest measure of freedom available at that time.  In the immortal words of Collins who supported the Treaty and who died in support of it, it was not an instrument that conferred absolute freedom on the country but an instrument through which absolute freedom could be achieved provided, of course, that it was wisely and prudently operated.</P>
    <P>There were provisions in that Treaty which we would not have accepted if we had been able to obtain better.  The preamble to the Treaty and to the 1922 Constitution says:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, sitting as a Constituent Assembly in this Provisional Parliament, acknowledging that all lawful authority comes from God to the people and in the confidence that the National life and unity of Ireland shall thus be restored, hereby proclaims the establishment of the Irish Free State (otherwise called Saorstát Éireann) and in the exercise <Col N="475" /> of undoubted right, decrees and enacts as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>That preamble acknowledged that all power in this country comes from God and it professed the desire, the hope and the confidence that the country would be united.  Article 8 of that Constitution confers all the safeguards that any religious group could wish for or would find necessary to safeguard the free profession of religion. Now in 1972 it is no harm to put on the record of the House during this historic debate the words of that Article:</P>
    <P>Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen, and no law may be made either directly or indirectly to endow any religion, or prohibit or restrict the free exercise thereof or give any preference, or impose any disability on account of religious belief or religious status, or affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending the relegious instruction at the school, or make any discrimination as respects State aid between schools under the management of different religious denominations, or divert from any religious denomination or any educational institution any of its property except for the purpose of roads, railways, lighting, water or drainage works or other works of public utility, and on payment of compensation.</P>
    <P>That conferred as much religious freedom as did the Article with which we are dealing now but the only difference between the two&mdash;and it is a great difference&mdash;is that Article 8 of the 1922 Constitution while giving the necessary guarantees offended no one, gratutiously or otherwise, whereas sub-articles 2º and 3º of Article 44 of the 1937 Constitution, while giving no more guarantees to the Catholic faith, went out of the way to insult the minority in the language used.  As I have said, the Treaty of 1921, as ratified in 1922, was accepted as an <Col N="476" /> instrument under which this country could attain ultimate freedom and be united under one Government provided it was operated in the way those who accepted it&mdash;and they represented the majority of the Irish people&mdash; intended it should be operated.</P>
    <P>Looking back one can see how unfair people can be.  During the past 50 years the people who accepted the Treaty, who fought and died for it, were spoken of as traitors, as being anti-national, because they did not succeed in securing at that time a 32-county Irish Republic.  Those people who speak like that know it was not &ldquo;on&rdquo; at that time.  The people who blamed Collins, Griffith and the others for not obtaining a united Ireland in 1921 and 1922 are now saying&mdash;50 years later&mdash;that we must forget about a united Ireland for the moment, that we must work towards it.  That is what the Taoiseach is saying and he is head of the Government. That is the case he is putting forward now, that in 1972 a united Ireland is not &ldquo;on&rdquo;.  He is the leader of the party that waged a civil war in this country because our party in 1922 did not get what he admits is not available now, although there has been much progressive thinking in the last 50 years and people have mellowed a lot.</P>

It is a pity that the Treaty and the Constitution of 1922 were not operated, improved, amended and developed but that did not happen.  In the thirties we had operations which I regard as divisive in the extreme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of operating the Treaty as it was intended it should operate so that people in the North and South would get to know each other better, would understand each other better, and would learn to live together, in the thirties we set about driving the people of the six north-eastern counties of this island and the people of the Twenty-six Counties poles apart We did that in 1932 when we set up <Col N="477" /> trade barriers which drove an economic wedge between the two parts, which put an end to commercial communications between one part of the country and another.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> We are discussing the effect of Article 44 of the 1937 Constitution on the country as a whole.  I have said all I wish to say about the divisiveness of the 1932 trade barriers which drove an economic wedge between the two parts of the country.  Not being satisfied with that, in 1937 we drove an ideological wedge between the two parts of the country by inserting Article 44 and other Articles in the 1937 Constitution.  Those two operations in 1932 and 1937 postponed the unification of this country for very many years.</P>
      <P>After 1932 physical communication between the two parts of the island ceased.  There was no trade or commerce, no communications.  The year 1937 finished the job because it was open to the people of the North to say we had established here a sectarian State, a State in which Protestants were regarded as somewhat less than Catholics.  I am not saying, and I do not wish it to be understood I am saying, this happened but, as a result of Article 44, it was open to the people of the North to say it happened and to use it as an argument.  As a result, one part of the country lost touch with the other and a colossal ignorance developed particularly in the North of Ireland regarding the type of society here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following that ignorance fear developed in the people in Northern Ireland that they were going to be hounded into some kind of sectarian State.  Following fear, hatred developed and, in my view, hatred played a part in bringing about the bloodshed, the bombings and the atrocities that have occurred in Northern Ireland. In this part of the country we must <Col N="478" /> take a share of the responsibility for the ignorance, fear and hatred that developed in Northern Ireland regarding the type of society we have here.</P>
    <P>In the thirties there was a gentleman who proclaimed that in Northern Ireland they had a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people.  We should not have fallen into the trap, we should not have said that anything they could do we could do better.  We should not have written into the Constitution the kind of Article which could be used by those people justifying their argument about our society and Constitution.  Now we are dismantling some of the divisive measures which were enacted in this country in the thirties.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that what we are doing here will play some small part in demonstrating to the people of the Six Counties, and the people of the world, that we have here, and always had since the foundation of the State, a society in which there was no victimisation, a society in which a man could live and earn his living without any regard to creed&mdash;I will not go so far as to say without any regard to political beliefs, but certainly at no time was any man or woman ever victimised here on account of his or her religious beliefs.</P>
    <P>In introducing this Bill the Taoiseach said that Article 44 was an Article which could be regarded as second to none in any part of the world.  If I heard him correctly, I find that rather difficult to understand and difficult to follow.  Deputy Briscoe followed, speaking obviously from a very elaborate brief, and praised the 1937 Constitution as something akin to the bible.  Yet we know that the Taoiseach proposes to advocate the complete dismantlement of the 1937 Constitution and its replacement by another Constitution because, later in his speech, he said he did not approve of amending the Constitution piecemeal and that he thought it should be done in one operation.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to understand his reference to Article 44&mdash;and Deputy Briscoe's praise for the Constitution&mdash; and almost an intimation that he proposes <Col N="479" /> to scrap it and introduce another Constitution.  I do not approve of amending the Constitution piecemeal. I hope that the committee which is at present sitting will bring forth a report which will recommend a new Constitution. If this Government are still in power I hope they will then put a Constitution before the House immediately.</P>
    <P>It is hard to follow the thinking of the Government in regard to this Article because on the first day the Dáil sat when the Taoiseach was asked was it proposed to amend Article 44 he stated that it was proposed to have a referendum on votes at 18 years but he did not think it would be possible to have this legislation we are now dealing with put through in time to have a referendum on Article 44 on the same day.  Of course, it was clear to everyone that it was possible to put this legislation through in time to put the two questions to the people on the same day.</P>
    <P>I would certainly have regarded it as a tremendous waste of public money to ask the people on 30th November whether people should have votes at 18 years and spend £100,000 in that operation, and then to come back in the spring, or some other time, and spend another £100,000&mdash;and with inflation I am sure it would be more &mdash;to ask them whether Article 44 should be amended.  When it was being thought about at all the rational thing to do was to put the two questions to the people at the same time.</P>
    <P>I believe that sub-articles 2 and 3 of Article 44 should be removed.  I am confident that the people will vote in an overwhelming manner to delete them.  In my opinion they were never necessary; they never served any useful purpose.  They conferred no rights upon anybody.  They simply insulted between one-quarter and one-third of the people of this island.  I hope they will go as a result of the referendum and I hope Fianna Fáil will repent and see that what they were expecting, or leading the people to believe they were expecting, 50 years ago simply was not possible.  They are <Col N="480" /> coming around piece by piece to the Fine Gael way of thinking.  Somebody said today that the people who sat on the Opposition benches in 1937 would smile today if they were to hear that this Constitution, which was introduced in 1937 as the be-all and the end-all of constitutional activity, is being pulled asunder bit by bit and that the promise is that it will go entirely and be replaced by a more forward looking and democratic document.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose one should be thankful to the Opposition for passing references to Article 44 which is the very basis of this Bill.  Practically everything was discussed except that.  Cardinal Conway has been quoted very liberally on what he said or is supposed to have said about &ldquo;no tears.&rdquo;  On reading his speech fully I notice he also said that Article 44 conferred no legal privilege whatever on the Catholic Church and that, if this was the only way to convince our fellow Christians in the North, it might be worth the expense of a referendum to do it.  The Constitution also confers power on the people to amend it after the Oireachtas has made the necessary arrangements.</P>
      <P>I heard Deputy Fitzpatrick speaking in glowing terms about the old Free State Constitution and about unity.  With the benefit of hindsight we can look back 50 years and say that the Constitution was never meant to be a force for unity.  I want to be quite clear in stating this.  I do not cast any reflection on the men who thought at that time that this was a good document.  It is much easier to speak with 50 years' experience than it was in those turbulent days when threats were held over the heads of the people by an outside power that if they did not do certain things drastic measures would be taken.</P>
      <P>Going back to the debate on the Constitution in 1937, I want to quote now a Mr. Nicholas Barron who was, I believe, a constitutional lawyer. Writing in <i>The Irish Press</i> on Wednesday, 20th December, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clauses of the old Constitution <Col N="481" /> may be brought forward by those who have advocated its retention and from them arguments may be derived to show a possible greater economic development under that form of basic plan.  Notwithstanding such a possibility it remains clear to us that the Constitution of the Irish Free State was not of the handiwork of the people of Ireland; that its inception was of London that it was handed to us under threats.  Whatever else its worth, it was not Irish and, therefore not ours.</P>
    <P>That was the day on which the Constitution was inaugurated, if that is the correct word.</P>
    <P>If we are going to discuss one Constitution <i>versus</i> another Constitution, then let us examine, first of all, the source of each.  As I said, the first Constitution was imposed under threat.  It was not drafted by Irishmen.  Our present Constitution was drafted by Irishmen, passed by this House and subsequently enacted by the people. Enactment by the people is one of the first essentials of democracy.  A country must have freedom to frame its own Constitution and, therefore, any comparison between the Constitution of 1922 and the existing Constitution is an odious comparison.</P>
    <P>The House apparently is agreed that Article 44 does not matter very much. If there is agreement why, I wonder, is the debate being protracted?  Since the Opposition were so vehement and so clamant for the removal of Article 44 it is a pity they did not withstand the temptation of playing party politics on this.  That is what they are doing.  They are trying to show that the whole Constitution is unworthy.  The people enacted the Constitution freely and democratically in a secret ballot. Remember, this Constitution was drafted in such fashion that, should unity come about, it could apply to the whole Thirty-Two Counties and, should unity come about, it will be possible for people by way of referendum under this Constitution to test out certain enactments.</P>
    <P>Those who drafted this Constitution were indeed wise.  Only a few months ago our people were enabled <Col N="482" /> through the medium of this Constitution to decide whether or not we should take the major step of entering the European Economic Community. Across the water there is a cleavage of opinion and great bitterness because the people in the United Kingdom were not given any opportunity of expressing themselves on the major issue of Britain's entry into the European Economic Community. If there is any higher form of democracy than giving the people the right of choice then I do not know what it is.  I think that both the Northern Catholic and the Northern Protestant appreciate that, while Article 44 does not confer any power on the Catholic Church, the Constitution as a whole ensures the rights of the people as a whole.  If the Constitution ever extends to the entire Thirty-Two Counties then the Orangeman and the Catholic will have the right to go into the polling booth and cast their votes as they see fit.  That is something denied the people of the North at the moment.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear as to the relative merits or demerits of the old Constitution <i>vis-à-vis</i> the present Constitution.  Any fairminded person must recognise how superior our present Constitution is to the old Constitution. It is not alone the Catholic Church which is mentioned in Article 44.  Other churches and congregations are also mentioned.  I do not believe any Protestant in the North would object to that.  It may be that some benefit will accrue because we removed Article 44 in order to allay fears&mdash; fears, let me say, that are absolutely groundless.  That is fair enough but, for Heaven's sake, let us not belittle the Constitution.  Above all, let us not try to demonstrate that the old Constitution was in some way superior to it.  That kind of argument confuses people.  An attempt is being made to show that the Constitution drafted by the British in 1922 is superior to the existing Constitution. That kind of woolly thinking will not do anybody any good North or South. Even British statesmen have conceded that some day this country will have to be united.  We are moving towards that and if the removal of <Col N="483" /> Article 44 inspires any greater confidence in the people in the North then it is a good thing to remove it.</P>
    <P>To suggest the Government are doing this because they were forced into doing it by the Opposition is just absurd.  It is no credit to the Opposition to introduce these false arguments. Both parties opposite have said that the Article is innocuous and it does not really matter whether it is in or out.  What we should be seeking to do is to bring home to the people, North and South, the fact that the present Constitution was drafted by some of the greatest men in our history to ensure we would have certain principles to live up to and to replace a Constitution imposed on us by an outside power.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned this morning that one did not hear any clamour in Britain to alter their constitution, the Magna Carta or whatever they base their law on.  This is quite true, but I suppose in Britain there is no victimisation of people on religious grounds, and we have to face the fact that this has happened in the North.  I believe the reason there is not this clamour in Britain at the moment may be that the vast majority of Catholics do not ever want to be Lord Chancellor or Prime Minister, and therefore the whole thing is irrelevant. The point is that Catholics in Britain are not denied employment because of their religion, and I do not hold with those who say that it is religious differences which keep us apart, North and South.  The very fact that there are not enough jobs to go around means that you must find some &ldquo;fall guys&rdquo; who can be deprived of jobs so that the ruling class can hold on to power; therefore you label them Catholics or dissatisfied, and it is quite easy to do it then. I look forward to the day when the whole island will be a prosperous unit with full employment, and then I believe you will not have this terrible sensitivity about Articles of a Constitution which are held to give one church a greater place in the scheme of things than the other churches.</P>
    <P>I will say that the Protestants of this <Col N="484" /> city have always taken their Irish citizenship very seriously.  They have played their part and I have no doubt that if we were able to get our position across to the majority in the Six Counties, most of these people would see, too, that we are not a theocratic State; they would see that we have a State under the Constitution which guarantees their rights.  I believe we are increasingly getting the people to understand that our Constitution is a document under which they could live at least as well as they are living at the moment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if the Opposition speakers this morning want to show us that Article 44 should not be in the Constitution, well and good.  They are entitled to their viewpoint, but let them not try to demean the whole Constitution which, as I say, was drafted by some of the greatest men our history has given us.  Of course it is possible to say after 35 years of the operation of the Constitution: &ldquo;We might have a look at this&rdquo; and this is good in a democracy, especially when those men who framed the Constitution included in it the right of the people to speak directly on any issue arising from this Constitution.</P>
    <P>When people in this House or outside it criticise our State and when they suggest that other states are more democratic than ours, we might ask them to examine this claim very carefully.  If an Englishman living in the north or south of England wanted to express his view on whether or not Britain should enter the EEC, he did not have that right.  His counterpart in Ireland, because of the Constitution, was able to record his vote directly on that great issue.  If some British politicians criticise us for our alleged shortcomings we can tell them to put their own house in order and, indeed, let them study our Constitution and they will learn a great deal from it as regards the workings of democracy.</P>
    <P>I know of no finer document for the preservation of democracy than our present Constitution, because its whole basis is the fact that the people themselves have the power to decide on constitutional matters in a referendum. <Col N="485" /> I know there are some other European countries which have this provision in their Constitution in regard to the holding of referenda, but they are not all that numerous.  It may be that as time goes on we shall have to review provisions in the Constitution, but we shall always do it remembering that the final decision is with the people and, as I said earlier, if there is any higher form of democracy I do not know it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing in this debate not with the policy of this Oireachtas <i>vis-à-vis</i> the North of Ireland State, but with an amendment to the Constitution, and I hope to relate my remarks as specifically as possible to that.  It is well to remember that this amendment to the Constitution, if passed, will be the second measure of its type to have been accepted by the people since 1941. From 1941 on there was no method by which, by simple Act of this Oireachtas, the Constitution could be amended.  We need not exercise ourselves here as to why constitutional amendments have had such a chequered history in the years since, but it might help us to cast our minds back on the background against which this document of 1937 was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It might, first of all, be said that something approaching a cordial conflict was in progress in the middle thirties between the then President of the Executive Council, Mr. de Valera, and the Judiciary, in regard to Mr. de Valera's attempts to alter certain aspects of the Constitution.  There had been a difference of view between the Irish judiciary and the English judiciary in relation, particularly to, the entrenched Articles of the 1922 Constitution and a 1925 case stated that &ldquo;the one and all sufficient root of title for the 1922 Constitution and for the Treaty,&rdquo; which were both scheduled to the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) Act, 1922, was in Dáil Éireann &ldquo;sitting as a constituent assembly.&rdquo;  Mr. de Valera resented very much the attitude of the Irish judiciary and when he was drafting his Constitution in 1937, a Constitution <Col N="486" /> which would follow more closely his own ideas, he said, at column 416 of Volume 67 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>The Courts here have expressed certain opinions in dealing with certain cases and made certain suggestions as to their views about the powers here to pass Acts in relation to the terms of the Treaty.  We are not going to risk a Constitution like this ... being enacted here and being operated with such possible views held by the Courts.  What we are doing is, we are going back to the sovereign authority, to the Irish people, or that section of the Irish people whom we can consult on the matter... It is they who will enact it, and when they enact it there is a provision that any judge or anybody else, who is not prepared to function under it, can resign and get out.</P>
    <P>This 1937 Constitution then was put to the Irish people and enacted by 685,105 for as against 526,945 against. The most notable feature of this Constitution is its rigidity.  I have already mentioned the fact that Article 51 allowed three years in which to make amendments and very few changes took place during that period.  One such amendment, which has a lot more constitutional implications than any that we have discussed here, is the one that says that if any Act is prefaced by the statement that it is for the protection of public safety in time of war or armed rebellion it shall not be capable of being overturned by the judiciary.</P>
    <P>I suppose one major aspect in which the 1937 Constitution differs from the 1922 Constitution, apart from the addition of certain Republican statements, is in the area of fundamental rights, Articles 40 to 44.  It could be held that by contrast with the 1937 Constitution the 1922 Constitution was a liberal, democratic Constitution which could have been suitable for a country of any religious complexion. I do not intend to read out again what members of my party have read out, Article 8 of that Constitution, which provided sufficient safeguards for the practice of religion.  Other personal rights were given as a stock list <Col N="487" /> in sections 6, 7, 9 and 10.  The 1937 Constitution was the coping stone of Mr. de Valera's achievements in the thirties but his reasons for introducing the new Constitution were political and not religious.  He was always opposed to the 1922 Constitution and sought to change it but in doing so I think he entrenched in our Constitution what could be described as the Catholic sociological view of the period.  These Articles deal with aspects such as the rights of families and so on.  We must remember that this creation, which includes Article 44 which we are discussing, was Mr. de Valera's own creation.  He piloted the Bill proudly through this House without getting very much assistance from any other Minister and I think it can be asserted that it was largely influenced by the Code of Social Principles which was published at Malines in 1929.  Article 44 is, therefore, an exposition by the then President of the Executive Council of his view of Church/State relations.  It is noticeable, in comparing it with the previous Constitution, that he keeps very closely to the 1922 Constitution with the exception of the very Article and sub-articles which we are now discussing.  The question arises then as to what motivation was there for the insertion of these particular Articles and I think if we are honest with ourselves we can find the answer in a certain amount of pressure which arose at that time from society, pressures which can be seen in other respects, in relation to the 1935 Criminal Law (Amendment) Act and various other Bills which came before this House at the time.  People have pointed out that had this island been united this tendency towards an overemphasis on the Catholic sociological position might have been avoided.  It is against this background that we must view the insertion of these two sub-articles.  Their insertion brought about the position that there was deliberately introduced a distinction between belief systems which did not exist before.</P>
    <P>The first sub-article of Article 44 is one which is very important.  I know <Col N="488" /> we are not now discussing its deletion but the others must be seen in relation to it, It states that:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God.  It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.</P>
    <P>This was a change from the previous situation but it was unfortunate that that particular change had to be followed in the Article by two other sub-articles, No. 2 which recognises the special position of the Catholic Church and No. 3 which recognises the position of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, as well as the Jewish Congregations and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.  It has been stated widely that it is doubtful if these sub-articles have any juridical effect.  Mr. de Valera, in piloting this measure through the House, observed that all he was doing in this Article was recognising a sociological fact.</P>
    <P>It is also historically true that this recognition of the special position of the Church did not go far enough to satisfy some people.  There are references in the books and periodicals of that time which show, for example, that Cardinal MacRory was not altogether satisfied and might have liked the section to go a little further. We must also remember that at this time our society witnessed a phenomenon without which it could have managed very much better.  I refer to a group which called themselves <i>Maria Duce</i>.  I do not wish to go into much detail about this except to point out that this group was exerting pressure for, if anything, greater recognition of the special position of the Catholic Church.  For example, its six-point programme included a reference to the fact that the Catholic Church is the one true church and ought to be acknowledged as such by states and nations.  Faced with that sort of pressure it is probably true that Article 44 did not go as far as some individuals would have liked it to go.  It is <Col N="489" /> interesting to find that at the time and later various local authorities in the country were circularised by people advocating a change in Article 44 to amend it more drastically to put, as it was stated, the one true church founded by Our Divine Redeemer on a plane above manmade religious in the world.  One does not need to dwell on that except to say that we note with satisfaction that we have moved from statements of that type and are very glad we have done so.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Article and its subsections do not have any juridical standing is not conceded by all and the debate should make at least passing reference to views expressed by certain eminent people.  In quoting these I do not wish it to be understood that I necessarily agree with these points.  Rev. Dr. Newman in <i>Studies in Political Morality</i> (1962) at page 44 and the following pages discusses the special position of the Catholic Church and asks many interesting questions.  He examines whether the statement that Article 44 is merely a statistical statement is the correct interpretation of it.  He quotes the main argument in favour of &ldquo;factual&rdquo; interpretation of the Article as being based on the fact that the Article also gives recognition to the principal Protestant sects and the Jewish religious organisation.  He quotes a colleague, I think Dr. MacDevitt, who said: &ldquo;This looks suspiciously like the liberal principle of religious indifference.&rdquo;  But, Dr. Newman points out what may look like and what may be are different things.  He says it would be a liberal principle of religious indifference only if it placed all religions, <i>qua</i> religion on the same footing and he asserts that it does not.</P>
    <P>He points out that the Constitution recognises the Catholic Church as the guardian of the faith of the majority of the citizens and it says &ldquo;and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the time.&rdquo;  He says that in the case of these denominations what the State is recognising is not any religious belief as such but the rights of the denominations as legitimate societies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> I think it can be maintained that the most notable person who saw some juridical relevance in Article 44 in the history of the past 35 years was Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy.  On three separate occasions Article 44 might seem to have had some slight, tangential effect on judicial decisions. But the matter was put beyond doubt by a decision of the Supreme Court in the Tilson Case (1951) IR 1 where Mr. Justice Black said:</P>
    <P>It is not in my view enough to say that we are not now holding that the last mentioned Articles confer any privileged position for that might be read as admitting of a mental reservation that these Articles do confer such privileged position and that although not now held to do so they may at some future time be held to do so.  I think it would be in the national interest and in that of our jurisprudence that we should here and now unequivocally declare that our Constitution does not confer any such privileged position before the law upon members of any religious denomination whatsoever. For my part I declare that such is my opinion.  Further counsel for the respondent while making the disclaimer alluded to seemed reluctant to answer my query as to whether the non-discrimination in the matter of ante nuptial contracts was confined to those whose religion is Christian and this leads me to add that in my opinion it is not so confined.</P>
    <P>I hold, therefore, that the weight of opinion seems to be that this particular subsection does not, or the two subsections do not, in fact, have any juridical value.  My purpose in drawing the attention of the House to other persons who have written on this matter was to show that the question was in some doubt.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like very briefly to say that the deletion of these two subsections of Article 44 will not in any way affect subsection (1) which remains and which is that &ldquo;The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God and it shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.&rdquo;  The deletion of these <Col N="491" /> two subsections, while removing a possible source of divisiveness and irritation in our society, does not remove the subsection which now becomes the full section and which in no interpretation could be regarded as stating that this Republic as between religion and irreligion is neutral.</P>
    <P>This is not, in fact, a secular State. I would not, speaking personally, wish to see a time arrive at which it would become so.  The section which will remain after we have got these two sub-articles excised from the Constitution, will mean that the position of religion will still be upheld publicly in our Constitution.  This viewpoint is, I would suggest, welcome to members of not alone the majority faith in this island but to all the other religious denominations, North and South.</P>
    <P>I should like it to be clearly understood that the deletion of these two sub-articles and by their deletion the facilities for a greater coming together of our various groups in the country is not a move towards an unwelcome secularisation of our society. This point needs to be made.  We should emphasise that Article 44 is being changed in respect of these sub-articles which deal with special positions and special recognition of individual groups.  For those reasons, I would commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the various contributions to the debate and I would think that the speech by Deputy Richard Burke has been the most dispassionate and objective that we have heard so far.  Tied up with this whole matter as we are, we always manage to generate an emotional atmosphere, sometimes coupled with enthusiasm, and to attempt to review history out of context and to denigrate some great figures in history who were associated with the movement for independence here and who subsequently became politicians and administrators.  Therefore, in this context, I, for one, welcome the contribution by Deputy Richard Burke.  He did not confuse the issue with history. Neither did he attempt unfairly to <Col N="492" /> criticise great figures of the past, either on one side or the other.</P>
      <P>Seeing that this House is composed of three parties, founded on a democratic basis, it would be a pity at this stage if there were an attempt to overkill in respect of the actions of the men of the past or to misinterpret or misrepresent some of their aims. We must consider this matter dispassionately and try to arrive at our own conclusions.  We must try to find common ground between the parties in the House as to the method by which the problems may be solved.  If we can approach the referendum in this spirit, we may show to the people of Northern Ireland and, indeed, to a wider number outside, that we are arriving at a point where we can discuss the past dispassionately and can try to interpret the laws which were then made&mdash;made in times of high endeavour.  Irrespective of what may be said to the contrary, the Constitution of 1922 was a good document. The Constitution which we are now debating was and is accepted by all as an outstanding document.  Therefore, if there are some Articles in the basic law which we consider to be divisive in present circumstances, it behoves us to refer to those Articles in terms of moderation, in terms that take into account the obstacles which we face at present in discussing the question of reconciliation and the road leading to eventual unity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take together Questions Nos. 3 to 6 and No. 8 which relate to the Green Paper on the North of Ireland published by the British Government on 30th October.  I have arranged to have copies of the Green Paper placed in the Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On several occasions recently, I expressed the hope that this Green <Col N="494" /> Paper would not be long delayed.  I did so because I believe that it is to no one's benefit to allow the present situation in Northern Ireland to drift.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper has now appeared. In a preliminary comment on the day of issue I said that it was a useful contribution in the development of political thinking and that as a paper for discussion it deserved very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>The Green Paper is not a solution; and it is not a plan for a settlement. But it does outline some of the dimensions of a solution.  It offers opportunities for further progress; and it is important that we do not let such opportunities slip.</P>
    <P>I have said recently elsewhere that we live today in this island in a situation which we have inherited and which has developed to a stage of serious crisis.  It is up to us to meet our responsibilities and to work to resolve that situation.</P>
    <P>In broad terms, I believe, as I have frequently stated, that any settlement which is to work must be found in an Irish context; that it must be achieved peacefully; and that, because of this, it must be achieved politically.  I do not put forward these views as political demands by the Government.  I see them rather as requirements which the facts of the situation itself have set.</P>
    <P>What we are saying in this regard&mdash; and I would hope that our voice on this can be clearly heard and understood&mdash;is that all of us who live in Ireland today must share this island. We cannot do so on a basis of dominance or compulsion; and a separation based on the fears of another era is now seen clearly not to be feasible.</P>
    <P>Seeing this clearly now, we must&mdash; all of us&mdash;accept our responsibilities and we must begin working towards an accommodation which will bring reconciliation and peace to the island. We have no other real choice.  But we have&mdash;all of us&mdash;real opportunities once we face realities.</P>
    <P>The structures that existed hitherto in the North of Ireland did not <Col N="495" /> encourage reconciliation or open up such opportunities.  This is now recognised and accepted.  But an absence of structures, and the general feeling of uncertainty and doubt as to the future to which this gives rise, can also make reconciliation difficult.</P>
    <P>Steps must now be taken therefore to set up the right institutions.  To be &ldquo;right&rdquo;, they must have real possibilities for growth towards reconciliation and accommodation.  I say growth, because I believe that it is preferable for all of us to think in terms of organic growth rather than in terms of rigid frameworks.  In speaking of growth we must set no absolutes; and we must allow for development.  If steps are taken now on these lines&mdash;which respond to what I believe to be the requirements of the situation&mdash;it would be in the interest of all of us, not only to accept, but to support, such institutions and to encourage them to grow and develop.</P>
    <P>In the North new institutions must be widely acceptable if they are to work; and they must guarantee the rights and identity of the minority&mdash; not only socially and economically, but politically as well.</P>
    <P>But the structures which are now to be built must also encourage, as an organic growth, a process of reconciliation in the island as a whole; and unless they do, they cannot bring permanent reconciliation in the North.  The Green Paper seems to allow for the possibility of some institutional arrangements of this kind; and in so far as it does it calls for a response from us.</P>
    <P>For our part, we in the Government are prepared to make such a response. We are committed to work for reconciliation; we are prepared to enter into negotiations with the British Government, and into discussions with representatives of all political parties in the North, which will take account, in addition to the Green Paper, of the statements of policy of both Governments.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to consider seriously the working out of suitable institutions.  But to be of value the <Col N="496" /> institutions must not be either empty of substance or rigid in form; they must have real and serious functions; and they must have in them the possibility of organic growth and development.</P>
    <P>Finally I wish to say that having at this time a simple plebiscite in the North about the Border, of which the result is a foregone conclusion in present circumstances, would introduce a new element of rigidity in a situation which is otherwise evolving.  It would contribute nothing to progress in the general sense contemplated in the Green Paper and would inevitably be provocative to some.  I would hope that, on reflection, those who feel that they must have a plebiscite would, in determining its timing and content, so arrange it so as to afford some possibility of making a constructive contribution towards shaping the future rather than confirming the sterile rigidities of the past which have left us with the present unhappy situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach, in view of the possibilities which he has referred to and which are recognised as being in the Green Paper, make it clear to the British Government that it would be desirable to hold discussions on the content of the Green Paper and at the same time indicate to them, as he has mentioned now, that the form and content of the proposed plebiscite, which was announced yesterday, is not a helpful contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can say that I have already done what the Deputy suggests in the latter part of his supplementary. So far as the first part of his supplementary is concerned, I think it is evident in the reply I have just read that I would welcome these discussions. In fact, I would put them on the level of negotiations.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider providing Government time for a debate on the Green Paper or, alternatively, would he consider setting up an all party committee to examine all aspects of it?  He will agree that Mr. Whitelaw suggested that there be a very close study of the <Col N="497" /> Green Paper.  In those circumstances would he not consider either of those alternatives?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>What serious objection could the Taoiseach have to ordering a number of copies of the Green Paper so that they may be readily available for Deputies who may want to give it serious thought and study, not alone in the Library of this House but in the constituencies? It is a document that has great relevance to this country and I feel Members of this House would like to have a copy readily available for perusal. In view of that would the Taoiseach not consider it desirable, more particularly if he is going to have a debate on the contents of the Green Paper, to have copies made available so that serious thought and study may be given to its contents.  It is a reasonable request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

      <P>When the Taoiseach speaks about meeting our responsibilities and living on this island together is he aware that the Green Paper also calls for more action against subversives in this country?  The Green Paper calls for some show of good faith by Fianna Fáil that they really want a united Ireland and that they do not want a country, North and South, in shambles.  Is the Taoiseach further aware that the people of this country are appalled by the fact that members of the Army Council of the IRA can strut around the streets of this city?</P>

It is likely that this country will participate in the 1975 survey.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>McKinsey &amp; Co., management consultants, were engaged to undertake three studies in relation to the management of the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first study, which was carried out between August and November, <Col N="512" /> 1970, the consultants were asked to advise on the method of working of health boards, with particular reference to the relationship between the boards and their chief executive officers; the management structure under health boards and the extent to which services should continue to be administered at county level.</P>
    <P>The second study, which was carried out between December, 1970 and June, 1971, was concerned with the implementation and development of the key recommendations made as a result of the first study and dealt with four main items, i.e.</P>
    <P>&mdash;development of management processes;</P>
    <P>&mdash;training of senior staffs;</P>
    <P>&mdash;preparation of guidelines on the functions and staffing of local offices; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;development of a suitable grading structure.</P>
    <P>The third and final study, which commenced in April, 1972, and has just been completed, involved the provision of advice on the roles and interrelationships of the hospital boards, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Department and the management processes to be adopted by each of these bodies.  The estimated total cost of the three studies is £132,482.</P>

Some of the recommendations cannot be implemented until multi-annual budgeting commences and some of them cannot be implemented because in some cases the health boards have not yet acquired their full staff and because procedure has yet to be set up, but in general the health boards adopted the recommendations of the Report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not indicated at the conference referred to that the Louth County Council could dispose <Col N="517" /> of surplus land at this hospital.  What was said was that the council need not transfer to the health board property which was not solely for the purposes of the health services.  This meant that the county council could retain surplus land but the question of the financial implications of this did not arise at the conference.</P>
      <P>I dealt with these implications in a reply to a parliamentary question on 11th June, 1970, and in a letter of same date to Louth County Council. There has been subsequent correspondence with the council and the health board.  I understand that the county council are now seeking counsel's opinion on the matter and in the circumstances, I do not wish to make any further comment at the present stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the statement by Dr. Hensey in reply to a question by me at the particular conference referred to indicated clearly that Louth County Council could keep, so long as they purchased it before the transfer of land, land that was not solely for medical use?  Surely this intimated that there would be no financial implications in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a very valuable precedent to go on when lands sold are used for health purposes. When the lands are sold the proceeds must go for health purposes and that is the question on which there is disagreement.  Louth County Council are now employing counsel and I do not think I can make any further comment on the matter at present except to repeat that I was following what I regard as a very valuable precedent in insisting that the proceeds should go towards health purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since only 80 acres of this land are necessary for medical purposes and since that amount of land is being given to the health board without charge is it not proper that the remainder of the land, almost 220 acres, should remain the property of the Louth ratepayers who paid for the land?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not certain of the report to which the Deputy is referring. In the 1971 Report on the State of the Public Health issued recently by the British Department of Health and Social Security, the percentage quoted by him is referred to, in respect of an increase in the incidence of gonorrhoea in persons under 16 years of age in England during the year 1971 as compared with 1970.</P>
      <P>I am aware from reports generally that there has been a world wide increase in the incidence of venereal disease in recent years and that increased incidence of the disease among the younger age groups has been a notable feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no specific figures available as to age groups of cases of <Col N="519" /> venereal diseases notified in this country. I understand, however, that while an increasing percentage of cases notified are occurring in the younger age groups only isolated cases occur in persons under 16 years of age.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got detailed statistics on the total number of persons awaiting admission to hospitals in Dublin.  This total would be made up of two elements&mdash;those scheduled to enter hospital but whose admission is not urgent, and those waiting for treatment for urgent conditions. <Col N="521" /> If the average waiting period for non-urgent conditions were unduly long, this would be of concern to me but I have no evidence that it is.  As far as urgent admissions are concerned, I have had inquiries made from the Bed Bureau in order to establish to what extent difficulties are currently being experienced in securing urgent admission of patients to the Dublin hospitals.  The information obtained was that during the week ended 30th October, 1972, the bureau was asked to assist in securing admission for patients in only five cases. This does not suggest that there is a serious problem in urgent admissions.</P>
      <P>It is considered that the total hospital bed provision in Dublin in general is adequate but, as demand is subject to variation&mdash;as, for example, in the case of maternity needs&mdash; the position is kept constantly under review so that adjustments can be planned to meet changing needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this occasion is concerned, I was asked for a decision about reviewing what was in the document.  Since it was little more than the bringing up-to-date of statistics and developments since 1969 I decided that there would only be the addition of new statistics and developments and that it would not be necessary to have a serious review.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, there was controversy here from the Fine Gael benches regarding the first edition because of what they considered were too limited references to the early leaders of their party.  It was pointed out by the then Minister for Foreign Affairs that the document was not intended to be a history; only a small part of it was historical and, in fact, it dealt with the setting up of the economic, social and political structures. The references to which they took exception were no more limited than a reference to the same person made in a document produced by the Department when their own Government were in office in 1950.  A later edition had photographs of the early governments of the State which, I think, redressed whatever imbalance they considered might have been created.</P>
      <P>The publication <i>Facts about Ireland</i> had something the earlier document did not have.  It had references to written histories which had the independence and detachment of the historian and took away from the idea of any Minister or civil servant writing history for this purpose.  Therefore, people interested in history could read in <i>Facts about Ireland</i> references to books on history, written by historians. This was absent in the earlier booklet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953 the Bord na Móna superannuation schemes must be financed by equal contributions from the board and the members. There is, therefore, no element of State subsidy in any part of the Bord na Móna superannuation schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the amending <Col N="525" /> superannuation scheme to which the Deputy refers, relating to the calculation of contributions and pension on a percentage of basic wages plus service pay plus 16 per cent of basic wages are unusual.  The reason for these provisions is that Bord na Móna workers, in the turf cutting and harvesting season, earn considerably more than their basic wages and it has long been agreed that part of such earnings should be pensionable, hence the inclusion of the additional 16 per cent of basic wages as part of a worker's overall pensionable earnings.</P>
    <P>The purpose of each provision in the amending superannuation scheme, indeed in any superannuation scheme, is examined in detail before approval is given.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to a question on 26th October, while approval of the amending scheme could not be conveyed to the board until 25th October, the operative date is 31st August, 1972.</P>

The B &amp; I and Irish Shipping Ltd. are alive to the opportunities which should arise from increased trade between Ireland and the EEC.</P>
      <P>With delivery of a new vessel in May/June next, Irish Shipping Ltd., in partnership with Continental interests, will introduce a new service between Rosslare and Le Havre.  This service will cater on a year-round basis for both tourist and freight interests.  The B &amp; I Company introduced in April, 1971, in conjunction with the Holland/America line a twice-weekly container service linking Dublin and Cork with Rotterdam and Le Havre.  On the tourism side, the company have at present various arrangements with Continental operators for tourist traffic to Ireland using the UK landbridge routes.  The company have recently completed a major examination of the potential for freight movements between Ireland and the enlarged EEC. In conjunction with that study they have examined various routing strategies and the implications for terminal and ship construction as a guide for future investment policies.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power the steps he is taking to provide guaranteed cattle shipping facilities to Britain after 1975 when the B &amp; I and British Rail consortium's guarantee of service expires; and if there is any danger in the fact that cattle shipments to Britain may then be in the virtually exclusive control of a single private operator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on cattle shipping facilities on 26th October, 1972.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in that reply, the extent and frequency of shipping services provided for the conveyance of cattle is a matter primarily for the initiative of shipowners and other commercial interests concerned, in the same way as shipping services for the carriage of goods, vehicles and passengers. The B &amp; I Company and British Rail have informed the Govvernment Ministers concerned, both here and in Britain, that they are undertaking a radical review of the whole future of their cattle-carrying services and the matter is being further examined.  No changes will, however, be made without full consultation with the Government Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>Pending the outcome of this examination I am unable to give a more specific reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that B &amp; I and the consortium appear at the moment to be running down their cattle shipping services?  They have increased their rates to such a level that they really are not practical any more for the shippers.  Would he agree that if this service is discontinued there will be a virtual monopoly in the hands of one private Continental individual and that this <Col N="529" /> is not a satisfactory situation?  The Minister has an overall responsibility to prevent a monopoly position developing to the detriment of Irish exporters in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the purpose of establishing the consortium between British Rail cattle exporters and the B &amp; I.  The net result was that the cattle trade refused to support this consortium which lost £300,000 last year and, instead, transferred their support to the private interests the Deputy referred to.  This is a fact of commercial life which is in the hands of the cattle exporters. It was their attitude which made for the situation which developed.  I would certainly share the Deputy's anxiety regarding any monopoly situation developing.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the most suitable time for business houses to take stock is the end of January; and, in view of this, as VAT became operative on 1st November, 1972, he will extend the period of stocktaking so that goods may be assessed for at least three months to enable assessment to be made at 31st January, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The most suitable time of the year for stocktaking varies in different sectors of trade.  The requirement of stocktaking in relation to the introduction of VAT on November 1st affects only those firms who wish to claim a refund of tax borne on stock-in-trade at the changeover date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have stated that, where the normal stocktaking for accounting purposes is within two months before or after <Col N="533" /> 31st October and it is possible to make an accurate calculation of the stock at the changeover on the basis of such stocktaking, they will accept the calculated stock for the purposes of the claim to refund.  An extension of this period would make it difficult to calculate the stock position on November 1st of the ordinary trader.  Where, however, accurate stock records are kept from which it is possible to make an accurate calculation of the stock on November 1st, the Revenue Commissioners will be prepared to consider claims based on stocktaking at the end of January.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnthonyCEsmonde" hpid="Sir Anthony Esmonde Sir Anthony Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of my question was to draw attention to the fact that the suggested time of stocktaking is the busiest time of the year for business houses and there is a good deal of muddled thinking on the matter.  Some business firms think they have to take stock at that time.  Am I to understand now from the Minister's reply that he is prepared to put the period back to 1st January?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, the question of what is a bad time or a good time for stocktaking varies from one business to another.  The position is that the Revenue Commissioners have already indicated that where the normal stocktaking for accountancy purposes is within two months before or after 31st October, and it is possible to make an accurate calculation of the stock at the changeover, on the basis of such stocktaking they will accept the calculated stock for the purpose of the claim to refund.  I have indicated they will even extend this to stocktaking at the end of January provided that the stocktaking at the end of January is based on records which are sufficient to enable a reconstruction of the stock as at 1st November.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will give a comprehensive list of the products affected by the change in the tax rate involving the introduction of VAT on 1st November in respect of which the Government estimates it will receive £3.5 million additional revenue; and if he will state the estimated aggregate amount of tax currently received in respect of these goods and the current pre-tax retail value of these goods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The VAT rate of 16.37 per cent is designed to compensate for the elimination of double taxation in the present system amounting to about £3.5 million.  This rate is chargeable in respect of the supply of all taxable goods and services for which a special rate is not specified, and it would not, therefore, be feasible to give a comprehensive list of the products to which the rate applies.</P>
      <P>The estimated pre-tax retail value of the goods to which the 16.37 per cent rate will apply, based on 1971-72 figures, is £180 million, and the estimated yield from turnover tax and wholesale tax on this base would be £25.9 million.</P>

Having rejected my suggestion that there is an increase in tax rate yielding an extra £3½ million he has now admitted that there is such an increase and has said it is in compensation for a quite different financial transaction affecting different people.  Will he therefore agree <Col N="537" /> at this stage to publish this list and will he further agree that it is most desirable that the public should know precisely which goods have in fact had the tax increased by one quarter on them so that the public will know which goods they are legitimately entitled to be asked to pay more for and which goods they should not pay one half-penny more for?  By introducing this extra tax on a wide range of goods, which the Minister has refused to specify, he has created total uncertainty in the minds of the public as to which goods have had tax increases and which have not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. Timmons Mr. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the approximate loss of revenue to the Exchequer if all foods were not subject to value-added tax; whether he has considered the feasibility of extending the exemptions to a wider range of foodstuffs; and, if so, if he will state the conclusions reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated annual loss of revenue from the application of a zero rate of VAT to food is £15 million.  No foodstuffs are exempt from the tax nor were any exempt from the former turnover tax.  I considered very carefully the question of relieving food generally or a range of foods from tax on the changeover to the VAT system.  My firm conclusion was that it would be unlikely to be of ultimate benefit to consumers.</P>
      <P>The reasons for this conclusion are set out in a statement which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the statement:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;VAT will apply to food at exactly the same rate as that which applied effectively under the turnover tax.  If it were removed:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  The Exchequer would lose £15 million a year.  When one considers <Col N="540" /> that unemployment assistance alone costs almost this amount and that old age pensions (non-contributory) cost about £24 million a year, one can see how difficult it would make social improvements if we were to lose this £15 million.</P>
    <P>(b)  It is almost certain that food prices would not universally fall by the full amount of the tax reduction. In these circumstances retailers would gain many millions of pounds at the expense of the consumer and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>(c)  The tax on non-food items would have to rise in order to recoup the loss of £15 million, and this would cause a rise in prices of such essential items as fuel, clothing, footwear, medicine, <i>et cetera</i>.  The increases would be far-reaching and would severely hit the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>(d)  All food would benefit&mdash;the dear cuts of meat as well as the cheap cuts, caviar as well as cabbage&mdash;and there would be no way of limiting the benefits (even if they were passed on) to the poorer sections.</P>
    <P>(e)  It would be impossibly complex for the retail trade.  They would have to contend with three rates of tax, that is, two, as at present operated, and a zero rate for food.  To overcome this it would be necessary to combine the two remaining rates into a single rate so that all prices would have to change.  This would make it virtually impossible to keep proper control and the ensuing confusion would provide an excellent opportunity for widespread price increases.</P>
    <P>(f)  The simplest way to effect the changeover to VAT is to leave the tax on goods undisturbed as far as possible.  This is what has been done, which means that very few prices should change.&rdquo;</P>

I am not making any reflection on the Minister, but I do think that if a Deputy is assured in the kindly words of the Ceann Comhairle &ldquo;I hope not&rdquo;, that his question will not be ruled out of order, he can interpret that as meaning that the question will not be ruled out of order. I think, as a result of this answer, that next week I will get, as I so often got from the Ceann Comhairle, a letter prepared by some civil servant to the effect that the question is out of order because it was asked last week.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are acutely conscious of the economic and social evils attendant upon inflation and have consistently endeavoured to bring the rate of increase in prices down to more tolerable levels.  We have ratified the two national wage agreements which, although inflationary, we regarded as being in the best <Col N="543" /> interests of the community.  We have assumed wide powers to investigate and control an extensive range of prices and charges and, more recently, we have promoted legislation to extend and strengthen these powers, especially in the field of restrictive practices.</P>
    <P>The Deputies will appreciate that inflation has been endemic in the Irish and international economies for quite a considerable time and that, consequently, it cannot be eradicated overnight.  However, Government policies are meeting with some success; the most recent indicators show that the rate of price increase so far this year is lower than in the same period of last year.</P>

      <P>A directive on the lines mentioned by the Deputy has not been adopted by the Council of Ministers of the EEC.</P>
      <P>A draft directive at present before the council contains a proposal for the tax-free importation of certain non-commercial consignments up to a value of 50 units of account sent by a private individual in one member State to a private individual in another; it also contains a proposal for the tax free admission, subject to conditions, of periodicals, books and the like in small consignments up to a value of 25 units of account sent by a taxable person in one member State to a private individual in another. It is not known when the draft will be adopted or whether it will be adopted in its present form.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the steps taken by the Revenue Commissioners to ensure that all persons who render services to the public, whether professional or otherwise, give a fair and factual return of income for tax assessment; and if he is satisfied that tax avoidance is at a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Deputy's question refers to tax avoidance&mdash; which is a matter of arranging one's affairs, within the law, so as to reduce the tax otherwise payable&mdash;I assume from the context that he is concerned with the question of tax evasion.</P>
      <P>The main weapon against tax evasion is the obtaining of accurate information as to the incomes of taxpayers. Over the past 12 years various items of legislation have been enacted to enable the Revenue Commissioners to obtain such information. The provisions include:</P>
      <P>(a) a mandatory requirement on persons engaged in a trade, business or profession to keep adequate records;</P>
      <P>(b) a right by the inspector of taxes to inspect books and accounts relating to the transactions of a trade or profession;</P>
      <P>(c) a requirement on traders to give information on fees, etc., paid to persons not employed in the trade; and</P>
      <P>(d) a scheme whereby payments to sub-contractors in the construction industry may be taxed by deduction.</P>
      <P>In addition, the assessment of persons in the Dublin area engaged in vocations and professions has been centralised in a single tax district for a number of years with a resulting standardisation of treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the provisions outlined go a considerable way towards reducing tax evasion, there will always be areas where additional measures may be needed.  This matter is kept constantly <Col N="549" /> under review and further steps may be introduced as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance why a person (name supplied) has been assessed for succession duty by the Revenue Commissioners and has paid part of it although the value of his lands and contents was assessed by the Revenue Commissioners at less than £1,900, in view of the fact that persons with property of £2,000 value or less are free from any of these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the exemption limit referred to by the Deputy is the general exemption limit from estate duty and legacy and succession duties which originally applied to estates up to £2,000.  This figure was raised, in 1960, to £5,000 and raised again this year to £7,500.</P>
      <P>The exemption does not apply in the case of settled property unless such property were derived from the deceased.  In the case referred to by the Deputy, the property passing was settled property in which the deceased had a life interest only.  One-fifth of the settled property was derived by the successors from the deceased and was exempted from death duties.  The remaining four-fifths was derived from the successors' uncle and aunts and, as such, was chargeable to succession duty.</P>

While, in accordance with these arrangements, Ireland's maximum share of the Communities' annual budget to 1979 is fixed, the absolute amounts payable will vary with changes in the total amount of the Communities' budget.  The tax implications of a particular level of contribution can be examined only in the context of our own overall budgetary position from year to year.  Furthermore, since the level of our contribution each year is related to the total of the Communities' budget, any assumptions about the tax implications of a particular element in that budget would be valueless.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware <Col N="555" /> that Common Market Governments decided to spend 270 million dollars over five years to create 330,000 new jobs mainly for farmers who leave the land; if, in view of this, he proposes to keep a register of all farmers who leave the land in this country from the 1st January, 1973, so that they may qualify for benefits under this proposal; and if he will indicate how farmers leaving the land can apply for and obtain compensation and the new jobs which will be available for them under the scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At their meeting of 25-26 September, 1972, the Council of Ministers of the EEC agreed in principle that the sum of 50 million units of account would be provided annually for a five-year period out of the Guidance Section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund for financing projects which involve, within the framework of development activities in priority agricultural regions, the creation of permanent non-agricultural jobs likely to be filled by persons ceasing their agricultural activity and their direct descendants.  The maximum capital subsidy from the fund towards the creation of each such job would be 1,500 units of account.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to answer the final part of the Deputy's question until certain administrative and technical issues arising from the use of the EAGGF are resolved.  Meanwhile, the appropriate administrative arrangements likely to be required are being kept under constant review.</P>

Can the Minister further say, in view of the fact that it is now only a matter of weeks until we are members of EEC, if it is possible that he has <Col N="556" /> not worked out any plans to deal with farmers who may have to leave the land and who may qualify for benefits under the scheme already mentioned? This is a very serious matter.  Can the Minister give the House and small farmers, who may have to leave the land and have no alternative employment and who may want to avail of compensation or the jobs which the Minister has in mind for them in Brussels, any further information so that this information will be readily available on New Year's Day and so that if there are farmers who qualify they will know exactly what to do, to whom to apply and where they will be employed?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will agree to the immediate establishment of a public sworn inquiry into the closure of the Ballingarry Mines, County Tipperary in view of (a) the loss of jobs involved, (b) the amount of public funds already expended on the project and (c) the damage to the entire local community by its closure; and if he will make every effort to have the mines re-opened in the meantime in order to maintain the miners in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision not to provide further State assistance for Ballingarry Collieries was taken after consideration by Fóir Teoranta of an application for further financial assistance for the collieries.  Following a careful examination of the position, Fóir Teoranta rejected the application as they were not satisfied that the mine had reasonable prospects of viability in the long-term.  The matter was further considered as a result of representations made to the Minister for Industry and Commerce following the announcement that no further State assistance would be made available in support of the collieries.  After a full review of all the factors, including the social and human considerations involved, it was decided that State support for the continuance of operations at the collieries could not be justified.</P>
      <P>In the light of the foregoing, I am not prepared to agree to the establishment of a public sworn inquiry into the closure of the collieries.  In view of the reasons which led to the closure of the collieries, I consider that resumption of production on the basis of State financial assistance would not be justified.  I would like to point out, however, that Ballingarry has now been scheduled as a designated area under the Industrial Development Act, 1969, and that, in my view, the best interests of the people of the area will be served by concentrating on the efforts now being made to establish viable enterprises in the area.</P>

      <P>The designation of &ldquo;under-developed&rdquo; to which the <Col N="560" /> Minister refers applies for one year only&mdash;is this not so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that some most reliable reports of surveys carried out indicate that the mines can be made viable and profitable over the next 15 years?  Is he not aware that the machinery is there, some of it new and very costly, and that the men are there?  Is he not also aware that a recent advertisement, for which I understand the receiver was responsible, seeking to dispose of the mines clearly indicated that there were sales of the product? In all these circumstances would the Minister not re-consider his attitude?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any responsible survey or report which indicated that, taking all relevant factors into account, the future of the mines as a viable enterprise was assured.  In fact, the contrary is the case.  It is true that certain reports indicated viability for the mines on the basis of certain assumptions.  For example, one assumption in one report &mdash; and it was not the only one &mdash;was that no employers' liability insurance would be paid and that no claims in that regard would be pressed against the collieries.  I do not think anybody in this House would expect any responsible employer to engage on that sort of assumption to establish on paper that there was viability ahead for the mines.  I am not aware of any report from any responsible area that would have the effect of showing that the mines had a viable future and in the circumstances there cannot be any question of reviewing the decision made.  As I say, I think the best interests of the people of that area would be served by concentrating as far as possible on getting the benefits of the scheduling of the area under the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  I might add, for the benefit of Deputy Treacy, who did mention the point that this is for one year only, that this can be very much to the advantage of Ballingarry.  A permanent scheduling of Ballingarry could be far less advantageous than <Col N="561" /> that of one year.  This was our experience in another area which was scheduled for one year.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister say whether in taking this decision the full social benefit of the colliery was taken into account or whether the decision was based on a narrow view of the purely private benefit in terms of the actual profitability of the company and bearing in mind the impact of this mine on the economy as a whole and its contribution, for example, in terms of the transporting of coal and the employment given, whether this broad view was taken and whether some kind of cost/ benefit analysis was carried out or whether the decision was taken purely on the profitability of the mine? Finally, would he accept that such assessment can be very fallible, as was seen in the case of the Avoca mine?</P>

      <P>I do not accept the implication in the last part of the Deputy's supplementary question at all but perhaps he did not hear what I said in the reply, which was, that after a full review of all the factors, including the social and human considerations, it was decided, <i>et cetera, et cetera</i>.  May I take it from the Deputy's question that he would be of the view that the mine should have been kept open with further State assistance?</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to say whether a cost/benefit study had been carried out to quantify the social benefits.  He has not answered that question.

If it was not carried out, how can I or anyone else know whether or not it should be kept open?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we are now becoming a member of the European Economic Community, did the Minister give consideration to the tremendous benefits which could accrue to Irish mining, and Ballingarry in particular, arising out of our association with the European Coal and Steel Community and the Treaty in which we are now a partner?  Did the Minister consider the tremendous boost that the reserve fund of the European Coal and Steel Community, which now stands at £65 million, could give to an important industry of this kind?  Was it not the height of folly to close the mine on the advent of our joining this Community, when we could have availed of the fund and could have done something worthwhile to rehabilitate the mine or to provide worthwhile alternative benefits and further employment? Was this matter considered?</P>

      <P>In so far as there would be any benefit from the source the Deputy has in mind, this was taken into account.  There is considerable room for doubt on this score.  Let me say finally to Deputy FitzGerald that since we did get something like an answer, though it was a rather fence-sitting answer again from him, I suppose he is entitled to be told that there was a measurement made of the consequences of keeping open the mines and of closing them and of the social consequences in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Ministe for Finance whether in view of the critical inflationary situation he will take immediate steps to undertake discussions leading to a prices and incomes policy covering all incomes and not only wages and salaries; and whether as a preliminary to such negotiations he will request manufacturers to limit price increases to a specified maximum figure for a sufficient period of time to enable such a policy to be agreed and implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have consistently taken the view that the best interest of the community would be served in the field of incomes policy by agreements voluntarily negotiated through the medium of free collective bargaining.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, the 1972 national agreement, which was concluded after many months of detailed negotiation, was ratified on 31st July, 1972, and will not expire for the first groups until 31st December, 1973.  Despite its inflationary character the Government decided at the time that the best course was for the State to join in the ratification and to trust that all concerned would operate it with the greatest sense of responsibility.  I take it the Deputy is not suggesting the reopening, at this stage, of that agreement.</P>
      <P>As regards price increases, the Deputy is aware that surveillance of manufacturers' prices is at present exercised by the National Prices Commission, with the agreement of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in accordance with the guidelines set out in paragraphs 4-6 of their report of September, 1972.  I am not clear whether, and if so to what extent, the Deputy has in mind that these guidelines should be made more restrictive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that in his reply, suggesting <Col N="565" /> that any arrangements with regard to incomes must be negotiated between the two sides in industry, he is by implication excluding the possibility of an incomes and prices policy as distinct from a wages policy? Would he not agree that at this stage it is crucial that the Government should make efforts, as are being made in Britain, to secure such a general incomes policy and that there is no possibility of securing a deceleration of future wage demands unless trade unions and workers can be assured that all incomes would be restrained and not only wages and salaries?  Does he not agree that the onus falls on the Government to initiate steps in this respect and is he going to sit on the fence, like the British Government did for a couple of years, and then suddenly become a convert to an incomes policy when it is nearly too late?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the continuing high rate of inflation could cause this country's exports to be noncompetitive on foreign markets; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have on a number of occasions made clear the Government's constant concern with the effects of inflation on the economy, particularly in the field of foreign trade.  I have also indicated to the House the specific policies being pursued to contain the rate of inflation. The operation of these policies will continue and, if necessary, will be supplemented by action in other areas.</P>
      <P>Rising prices in the countries with which we trade have mitigated the adverse effect of inflation here on our foreign trade.  Our position has also been cushioned by increased foreign demand for our agricultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" /> Thus in the first nine months of 1972 the value of our total exports rose by £66 million, or 17 per cent over the same period of 1971.</P>
    <P>These figures, satisfactory though they are, give no grounds for complacency.  An even higher level of exports and foreign trade generally is necessary if we are to achieve the growth in output and employment which is the fundamental aim of our economic policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the rate of inflation in Ireland is higher than in England or the European countries and that only the Japanese rate is higher than ours, amongst industralised countries?  Is he further aware that this inflationary situation in Ireland has been the major contributing factor in 11,600 persons losing their jobs last year?  Is he further aware that the major component of this inflationary situation is Government expenditure?  Is he not aware that it is assumed that in industrialised or developing economies such as Ireland the Government can control the level of inflation?  It is obvious to me that the Government have completely failed to do so.</P>

      <P>I am telling the Deputy.  His assertion that it is not true can be taken for what it is <Col N="568" /> worth.  That is the fact and this is a direct consequence of the action we have taken.  The major reasons for the increases have been because of two factors: (1) a scarcity of potatoes and (2) the increase in the price of beef.  If the Deputy would care to analyse the figures in the consumer price index he will find that is true.  He would, of course, prefer to make misleading statements and then get worked up when he is told they are misleading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the requirement in regard to an established place of business for the issue of a certificate to a subcontractor under section 17 (7) of the Finance Act, 1970, can in certain circumstances place individual tradesmen who carry out subcontracting work at a disadvantage as main contractors prefer to deal with subcontractors who have certificates; and if he will consider amending the section to delete this requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970, is an anti-evasion measure.  It provides that a principal contractor must deduct tax from payments made by him to a subcontractor under a construction contract unless the subcontractor holds a certificate <Col N="573" /> under subsection (7) of the section entitling him to receive the payments without deduction of tax.  Such certificates are granted by the Revenue Commissioners in cases where the subcontractor satisfies them that he has an established place of business and has delivered, or has undertaken to deliver, accounts of his business for purposes of assessment to tax.</P>
      <P>The requirement in relation to an established place of business is to ensure that the subcontractors to whom the certificates are issued have a fixed place of business so that the inspector of taxes may effectively be able to trade them and assess them to tax.</P>
      <P>I am not aware that these provisions have the effect suggested by the Deputy and I am satisfied that any easing of the requirements in relation to certificates would result in a return to the type of evasion which the legislation was brought in to stop. I do not therefore propose to amend it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept my assurance to him that I am aware of a number of cases in my own constituency&mdash;in fact I am somewhat surprised that he has not similar cases in his&mdash;of reputable tradesmen who are attempting to build up businesses of their own and who are seriously prevented from doing so by the necessity for having an established place of business?  I have concrete statements from such people that main contractors will give preference to subcontractors who have a certificate and to that extent this regulation militates against the smaller man who is attempting to establish himself as a self-employed subcontractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the allegation has been made from time to time that people who are unable to obtain this certificate are thereby debarred from a subcontract from the main contractor, but inquiries which have been made do not seem to bear out that this is the real reason.  After all, main contractors are deducting tax in respect of hundreds of employees in many cases and there is not any really good reason why they should refuse to deal with a person on this basis.  The <Col N="574" /> inquiries which I have made suggest that, in some cases at least, there are other reasons why the main contractor does not want to employ the particular subcontractor and uses this as an excuse.</P>
      <P>I should perhaps also add that, despite the admittedly fairly rigid conditions which are operated by the Revenue Commissioners in these cases, there have been perhaps a few hundred cases in which certificates have been given where the undertaking to furnish accounts has not been satisfactory and the people concerned will not be given the certificate again.  I mention this to show that, although, as the Deputy appreciates, it is fairly rigid, there are still loopholes in it and that I would be extremely wary of opening the gap any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to accept my assurance that I am quite satisfied that the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners attempt to administer this particular provision&mdash;they are very flexible and very helpful&mdash;in regard to this requirement about a permanent established place of business seems to me to cause difficulty in a number of cases.  I hope the Minister will accept some correspondence which I will send on to him to establish this.  I would also like if he could indicate to me whether or not an ordinary residence in which a tradesman lives would in certain circumstances be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners as an established place of business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I would be glad to receive any correspondence which the Deputy has on this which would tend to support the argument that was made.  Secondly, I believe that an ordinary private dwellinghouse could be accepted in certain circumstances but the circumstances would probably have to be those in which the particular subcontractor had been carrying on business from that address for a considerable time.  In those circumstances I think it could be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with some aspects of this proposal when the debate was adjourned.  Having listened to the debate from the outset, I found that, as is usual in such debates, some speakers over-indulged, as was their right, in history; other speakers were more inclined to dwell on certain parts of history which would be taken, I suppose, in the context of a Bill such as this to amend our basic law but which at the same time did not, I think, add anything to the aim of this House, namely, to make a start in amending our basic law as a sign that we are prepared to go along the road with those who do not think in the <Col N="583" /> same way as we do, amending our basic legislation in order to promote a spirit of reconciliation.</P>
      <P>Some speakers made the charge that the Hierarchy came into this and that, in effect, we in this House would be subject to the Hierarchy in this regard. I do not think that in my time in politics or in the time of most people in this House the Hierarchy ever interfered to prevent progressive legislation.  If the Hierarchy did interfere, it was to offer advice in an objective way, it being left to the good sense of the Legislature whether or not at any given time that advice would be accepted.  This is my understanding of Dáil Éireann since I became a Deputy.  I think it untrue then to say, as one or two speakers have said, that the Fianna Fáil Party as a Government would be more or less subjective to the Church.</P>
      <P>This reference in Article 44 set out to recognise the Almighty and proceeded at the time to recognise also the statistical fact that roughly 93 per cent of the population worship in the Roman Catholic Church.  It expressed this point of view in sub-article (2) and thereafter proceeded to qualify this expression by going on to deal with other churches and other denominations, and I do not think it could be held to be as divisive as it was said to be by a number of speakers who would be outside this country and deemed to be our opponents. Yet, withal, we are prepared to eliminate those two sub-articles from our Constitution, in the knowledge that we do so with the general consent of this House and, I think, the general consent of all denominations in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not then true to say, as was said on many occasions, that we set out to promote or to give a special place within the country to any particular denomination.  We have had, today, members of minority churches speaking in this debate and they acknowledged the fact that there was a place here for all denominations, and there is not merely a place here for all denominations when it comes to religion but also a place within the <Col N="584" /> community for the free thinker and for that matter, the agnostic, provided he conforms to the general rule of law of the State.  Therefore, in putting certain parts of this Article to a referendum, we are showing our goodwill towards those who think otherwise and we hope it will be a step on what may be a long road to a general reunion.</P>
    <P>At the time the Article was introduced Mr. de Valera, who piloted the Bill through the House in those days, had advertence to the fact that 93 per cent of the people of Ireland as a whole belonged to the Roman Catholic Church and believed in its teaching, and their whole philosophy of life is the philosophy that comes from its teaching and therefore he said, and I quote this in a broad general way, that if we were going to have a truly democratic state, if we were going to be ruled by the representatives of the people, it was clear that their whole philosophy of life was going to be affected by that. That has to be borne in mind and the recognition of it is important.  We are prepared to believe that the apprehension expressed at the time by lawyers and theologians and certain academics was divided and that it all depended, at the time the Constitution was formulated, on the political philosophy of the individual expressing those sentiments.  There was never any cause, so far as I can remember, for undue apprehension on the part of any member of the community.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that quite a number of the minority have taken part in the politics of this country since the State was founded.  Perhaps not as many of them as we should have liked to see entered public life here but there was little we could do about that beyond giving encouragement to the minority to participate not merely in politics but in other spheres of life as well.</P>
    <P>For my part, whenever I got the chance I always encouraged the minority to enter local politics and to participate in local and central administration. To be charitable in this matter, the Opposition parties also encouraged this.  Therefore, we should <Col N="585" /> not read into this amendment any sinister implication.  Some people would be inclined to do that but I do not see such an implication in this amendment.</P>
    <P>Whenever we had trouble on the Border, whenever there was polarisation of viewpoints, there was always someone in the community to take up the idea of divisiveness and point to this clause of Article 44 as justification. The clause was always quoted out of context without any advertence to the following clauses of Article 44. Indeed, in the course of the years we have discovered that in certain ways parts of Article 44 were more or less in conflict with the common law in the sense that certain people involved in court cases found that its existence was to their disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Having regard to that and to the fact that the three parties who make up the membership of this legislature are of one mind on this matter, I think this is an appropriate time to refer it to the people for their decision with full knowledge of the implications of what we are doing, in the knowledge that we are trying to promote reconciliation and unity.  Talking about it will do no good.  It has been asked in the House why it was not done years ago.  Those who put this forward take a superficial view of history here.  Those of us who have lived with our political history know of the difficulties encountered in past years.  We know that there always have been hardliners both here and on the other side who have tried to step in to take command, to wrest the initiative from the hands of politicians.  This has always been an obstacle on the road towards reconciliation and, of course, it is very hard to convince a person that you will be even partially reconciled to his viewpoint if you keep reminding him of the past, if you keep firing shots at him and so forth.</P>
    <P>We who have enjoyed 50 years of freedom should not be afraid to go along the road to reconciliation.  Anyone adult in politics realises that there will be a long period of reconciliation before there can be any sort of unity. We must remember that the unfortunate people north of the Border <Col N="586" /> have been brainwashed during those 50 years by leaders who knew better but who tried to persuade them that there was no living in any pattern outside the Border.  For that reason I say the British Government must bear a fair share of blame for this, but let us for the moment lay that aside and bear in mind that the British Government of the day have made a step forward.</P>

Let us remind those who go back through history that history is the action of people and let us say that some of the leaders of the people in the past were great men in their own way.  We can ask people what they would have done if they had been abroad in those days.  People would find it hard to explain what they would have done.</P>
      <P>I would wind up by saying that we should examine this matter not in a spirit of carping criticism but in the background of a loosening up of attitudes, north and south.  Let us begin our journey on the road to reconciliation by hoping we will be able to encourage enough of our people to march along the road with us.  If that can be achieved we can deal with the hardliners on both sides.</P>

      <P>Deputy Carter regards our action in this House today as a march along the road.  I would be more inclined to regard it as a pathetic public confession, a sad occasion.  I do not march joyfully anywhere on this particular Bill.  I do not think that it can be regarded, to quote Article 1 of the Constitution, as being worthy of the genius and of the traditions of the Irish people. Members of the House must, with humility, place the Bill and the central issue in it in its proper current perspective and, indeed, in its proper historic perspective.  Not many Deputies who have spoken have displayed such perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by some political commentators that the Taoiseach has shown great guile in allowing his arm to be twisted on this <Col N="587" /> matter.  It has been pointed out that last week the Taoiseach referred to difficulties in respect of the time scale in holding the referendum and that we in the Opposition, in our clamour for a referendum, have managed to persuade him.  It is not worthy either of the Taoiseach or of the House that we should descend to such a level of interpretation of what is a single element of a social principle in Church/ State relations.  I cannot see that this matter has anything to do with the Northern Ireland question or with reconciliation.  Neither has it anything to do with the stupid and obscene expression used either by the Taoiseach or by Deputy Carter.  I refer to the term &ldquo;statistical expression in the Constitution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us bears no relevance to a settlement of the Irish question. The Article of the Constitution with which we are concerned should never have been written into the Constitution at any stage in the evolution of the Irish Republic.  The point at issue is that, for party political purposes and in order to win a general election simultaneously in 1937, the then leader of Fianna Fáil decided to railroad this Constitution through the ballot box.  He succeeded in doing so but only by a very narrow majority.  In doing so this distinguished Irishman made one of the major mistakes of his political career and he did not make many such mistakes.  This was an error that should have been rectified as a matter of urgency but until now successive Governments have failed to do so.  It can only be described as a scandal to have given explicit <i>de facto</i> predominance to one religion within the whole island.</P>
    <P>Let us have no public confessions from individual Deputies as to what they might have done if they had been here in 1937.  At that time I was only two years of age so I can claim exemption but, unfortunately, it has fallen to a new generation to undo the wrong that was perpetrated then.  No Government, regardless of how great a percentage of the electorate may profess a particular faith, have the moral, the theological or the political right to give exceptional recognition in a written <Col N="588" /> Constitution to one particular religious group.  This matter has been one of political debate down through the centuries and in the evolution of democracy in Europe it has been resolved. At last we are now resolving it.  It is to the historic disgrace of Fianna Fáil that they proposed this Constitution but it is important to emphasise that the voting in favour of it was very narrow, the figures being 685,000 to 527,000, in 1937.  I have been in public life for the past 17 years and I have yet to meet a member of the minority in the Republic who voted in favour of the 1937 Constitution.  Even then the minority were scattered minutely throughout this country.  The measure of opposition at the time to the proposals reflected the concern of the people on the issue.  It is insulting to the intelligence of the electorate, both North and South, to suggest that the proposed amendment has anything to do with the proposition for a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the amendment will not change to any extent the different traditions of this island.  I do not think it will lead to a much greater sense of reconciliation.  As Deputy Cruise-O'Brien pointed out correctly this morning, the religious minority of this island, North and South, will say to the majority professing the Roman Catholic faith, &ldquo;Thanks for nothing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Having made those comments which are strong, as far as I am concerned, we must regard this measure as a small step towards making our society more open, more pluralistic, more voluntary and more multi-denominational in a real sense.  Of course, it is a step also towards making our society a truly Christian one.  In the long term it will mean a healthier and a more positive relationship between the Irish people of different religious affiliations.  I welcome the slow, tortuous changes that are taking place.  I welcome the decision of the Irish Hierarchy to sit down in conference with the various other churches.  That is a positive step towards better community relations on this island in so far as relationships are affected by Christian beliefs, traditions and practices.  The basic <Col N="589" /> framework of Christian attitudes and ideals will be strengthened by an affirmative decision by the people in a few weeks' time.</P>
    <P>I do not think the adoption of the constitutional amendment will diminish in any way the better attributes of the Irish Christian tradition from which much of the basic fibre and structure of Irish society is derived. I do not think the adoption of the constitutional amendment will dilute the impact of that tradition.  Of far greater danger to that tradition is the sectarian hatred and the political violence in Northern Ireland between fellow Irishmen and women. This hatred and violence has not only weakened that structure; it has made it almost totally obsolete in the frenzy of hatred and viciousness between people.</P>
    <P>In relation to the views of individual Catholics in the Republic and in the North, it is important to point out that modern social Catholic philosophy no longer favours&mdash;as it did in the 1920s and 1930s&mdash;a very closely written formal Church/State relationship in the Constitution.  This is no longer sought or required.  I think the more flexible provisions we favour now will also find favour with the Catholic theologians who may comment on the constitutional amendments in the coming weeks.  I have no doubt their views will coincide with the body of responsible opinion in this House.</P>
    <P>The fact that we are holding a referendum needs comment.  There is a danger, and I am sure the Minister for Transport and Power will agree with me, that referenda can easily deteriorate into party political exercises.  It would be a tragedy if this should happen in this instance.  Referenda are essentially questions to be decided collectively by the people.  In relation to a constitutional amendment which could be said to bear considerably on the individual conscience, the politicians' obligation is to put the opportunity to the people, to provide the opportunity for a free decision in the light of each person's conscience and, having granted that opportunity, we should not regard the matter as a <Col N="590" /> party political issue.  We should exercise extreme care and moderation in our public comment in relation to the referendum.  We should not allow it to become, as it may well do, a party political football.</P>
    <P>I hope the referendum will not be availed of by the rather negative small minority who are obsessively anticlerical, largely because they are incapable of thinking in a positive way. Such people may avail of this occasion to indulge in denunciation of individual churches or snide reaction to the fact that the referendum is being held or may resort to unfair comment on those who devote their living to the spiritual ideal and to personal service to the community, North and South.  Politicians should urge that the greatest restraint be shown in the presentation of the options open to the electorate on this occasion.</P>
    <P>In recent days some individuals have been clamouring for a parallel referendum in the Republic in relation to the two questions which the British Government will put to the electorate in the North of Ireland.  It would be illuminating and interesting to speculate on the result of the referendum we are holding if we asked the British Government to arrange for a parallel exercise in the North of Ireland.  I do not think we would be under any illusions about the result of the referendum. I do not think there is any need to labour the point in respect of such counter-productive exercises.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to make three or four points.  First, I wish to express my disappointment at the typically smooth introduction of this amendment by the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach is so smooth in his presentation of problems that I get the shivers.  I see in this referendum Bill what I would describe as the &ldquo;Jack Lynch scenario for a united Ireland&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must refer to the Taoiseach as The Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past four years and particularly in relation to Article 44 of the Constitution, the Taoiseach's scenario runs on the basis that we will sit down with those enlightened <Col N="591" /> Protestants of Northern Ireland, now that they have been bombed into submission.  Needless to remark, this has nothing to do with Fianna Fáil but, the Fianna Fáil Party are not averse to reaping the benefits of such an occurrence.  Of course it is entirely coincidental, entirely fortuitous and, of course, nobody throws a lovely red apple out of the window if it happens to land in his lap, even if it is a by-product of 650 dead and 7,000 or 8,000 injured fellow Irishmen and women, many of them British citizens as well.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's proposition has been and still remains the same.  In reply to a Dáil question this afternoon he said that future relations could be a matter of negotiation.  I have no doubt that, when he comes to write his political memoirs, he will write that, were it not for the twisting of his arm indulged in by the Opposition in 1972, he would of course have wished to defer Article 44 to his longer timetable, and would have sat down with those recalcitrant individuals in Northern Ireland, and with Ted Heath, in this mirage of quadripartite talks which will go down as the greatest non-event in Irish political history.  When the politicians in Northern Ireland cannot even sit down together what hope is there of the politicians in the Republic, in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain sitting down together? This is the kind of nonsense he indulges in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's scenario will be that he would have been quite prepared to delete Article 44 and quite prepared to envisage a Constitution for a new Ireland.  I fully support him when he calls for a &ldquo;minimal document&rdquo;, a document &ldquo;which would not demand any agreement on broad philosophical assumptions&rdquo;.  It is about time that he brought out of cold storage this new Constitution.  If our new Constitution is to be such a &ldquo;minimal document&rdquo; and if it has already been prepared&mdash;and the outline and essential features of this Constitution have already been prepared; as a Member of the Opposition I am aware that a great deal of work <Col N="592" /> has already been done on the Government side on a new Constitution&mdash;why is it being held in cold storage?  Meanwhile people die, meanwhile people are injured; and meanwhile so-called chiefs of staff of so-called army councils strut around the city with their <i>Gauleiters</i> guarding them in full view of our own security forces.</P>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach serious about his vision for a future Ireland and has he any serious respect for the report in 1967 of the committee on the Constitution, a committee including the names of Deputies now dead and gone?  The late Deputy Don Davern, Deputy Seán Lemass and Deputy Gerry Sweetman were members of that committee and contributed well to that report which pointed out the need for a new Constitution.  The Taoiseach is not prepared to come forward.  Rather he allows his arm to be twisted in relation to Article 44, and we get no further than that.  I regret to say that this holding back for the ultimate negotiations, this ultimate one might say three-card trick of reunification which, in my opinion, is not &ldquo;on&rdquo; in the context of the Taoiseach's thinking, is not likely to bring about peace, reconciliation or reunification within the lifetime of my children.  He must think in terms of that time-scale rather than thinking about how many votes he will get in the general election next March or next April.</P>
    <P>What is at question is what kind of vision Deputies have of a future Ireland.  Not many visionary concepts were explained here today in the Taoiseach's speech.  Very little has been forthcoming from the Government side, apart from what I would call retrospective exculpation of a wrong done in the 1937 Constitution. We should not be under any illusion about some of the visions which still exist.  Deputies have visions, so far unexpressed in this debate.  Many people in the country have visions. Deputy J. Lenehan went very close to the mark when he made it quite clear that he was not in favour of national unity and did not want to have anything to do with the &ldquo;shower&rdquo; in Northern Ireland.  So he said.  He used the classical phrase, <Col N="593" /> the good racialist phrase, that he did not want any cross-breeding in this country.  That is a very thought-provoking comment.  His is the vision of a very narrow introverted Ireland. In fairness to those who may have a rather exclusively Catholic vision of a future Ireland, perhaps theirs is more honourable than the viewpoint expressed by Deputy J. Lenehan.</P>
    <P>But there are those whose vision of a future Irish society is still rather exclusively Catholic in social and political affairs.  The Fianna Fáil party are exclusively Catholic still in the context of their attitude towards the draft Bill on contraception.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I was giving an illustration.  I will not press the matter. It looks as if that view is a diminishing block of opinion in the whole of Ireland.  We must also state the reverse.  There are those who have an exclusively Protestant vision of life in Ireland in all its manifestations, political, social and administrative. They too have been exposed as advocating a form of sectarian <i>cul-de-sac</i> mentality.  There are those who have what one might call a pure Sinn Féin vision, a very narrow Catholic vision, a very narrow and ultra-Republican vision of society, and who rely extensively on selective interpretations of the writings of the dead leaders. They too finish up in a sectarian blind alley.  This is a trap into which this House must not fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also those of us&mdash;I would hope a growing majority in the country, and I would hope a growing majority in Dáil Éireann&mdash;who see a future Irish society in the context of adopting this Bill, and who see a future Irish society which would be very specifically Irish in many ways, which would be Irish in its origins and in its traditions in the best sense of those words, a society which would be truly Christian. The adoption of this Bill and an affirmative vote in the Referendum will lead us along that road.  We will not be marching along it as Deputy <Col N="594" /> Carter says, but we will be going along it.</P>
    <P>It is essential therefore that we adopt this Bill and fully support it. By doing so we may in the long run restore some of the international respect which this country had in the world in the past, and which we will have to fight very hard to regain in the future.  The reputation of Ireland either as a political entity, or as a partitioned country, or as a Christian people, was never at a lower ebb on the international scene than it is today.</P>
    <P>Our future society must draw on the very mixed cultural, political and spiritual origins of the peoples of this common land.  It will have to draw on all that is best in both the Catholic and the Protestant traditions.  Our removal of these sections of Article 44 from our Constitution will most certainly be an immeasurable step forward in that direction.  Our Constitution must not be exclusively oriented towards any one sectional interest, religious interest or tradition.  I say that as one who comes from what might be described in the South of Ireland as Catholic and Republican stock.  I admit I have been slow in my political assessment of affairs to reach the conclusion I did, but the elementary demands on sanity, peace and reconciliation on the part of Irish men and women North and South must prevail over any other approach I might have personally.</P>
    <P>The approach so far in this debate has been a broad one on the part of most speakers.  The debate has been what one might describe as a political ecumenical debate.  The approach so far seeks to put the history of the country behind us and define a new approach towards a new Constitution and a new Ireland.  We must not lose the opportunity now of building on this new constitutional approach.  It would be a tragedy if we were to lose it.  As a result of our work here today we shall see a definite movement towards a new Ireland, towards a new Constitution for the Republic in the short term and ultimately a new Constitution for the whole of Ireland.  I would strongly urge all Members of the House to support this Bill.  I would strongly urge the electorate to vote <Col N="595" />&ldquo;Yes&rdquo; when given the opportunity to do so.  We have had no such opportunity as this since 1937.  It is now 1972.  A democratic right is now being offered to the electorate and it would be a tragedy for the future of this country and its people if the electorate failed to exercise that right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at this moment debating this matter as part of the tragedy of the division of Ireland.  The fact that we have in our Constitution such provisions as this is a reflection of the way in which the devision of Ireland encouraged both parts of it to develop along introverted lines and not in their inter-relationship on the kind of lines on which the country could have developed had it not been divided 50 years ago.  Both parts of Ireland have suffered as a result of this.  The ill effects of that division have been, I think, more obvious in Northern Ireland and the sufferings of the people there have been greater but, in a curious way, we have ourselves done more to move away from Northern Ireland than Northern Ireland has done to move away from us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision this Bill seeks to delete is part of a process of dividing Ireland which we in this part of Ireland indulged in unconscious, perhaps, of its effects in the early decades of independance.  In fact, if you look at Northern Ireland and its laws and practices you will find that what is wrong there is not that Northern Ireland cut itself off from us by the decision to opt out of the new state in 1922, not that Northern Ireland began to turn itself into a sectarian State, but that it kept in existence laws and practices which had been there at earlier times and which became intensified when a local majority gained power over their own internal destinies in that part of Ireland.  They did not enact laws which cut them away from the rest of us.  There were changes in legislation in Northern Ireland which differentiated Northern Ireland from us.  Some of these were quite constructive.  They had an evolution in the educational sphere which was in many ways a healthier one <Col N="596" /> than ours.  But, apart from certain changes of that kind, the main differences that exist between the laws of these two parts today in sensitive areas are ones that arise from our legislation.</P>
    <P>It was we who decided to create a different kind of society here, a kind of society incompatible with that which existed in Northern Ireland. They can be faulted for failing to change old laws that were bad laws, for abusing their laws and abusing the powers given to that local majority; but it is we who have, in fact, done the legislating to divide Ireland rather than they.  This process goes back quite a long way.  It must be said that in the early days of the new State there was a firm determination to maintain a non-sectarian position here.  Our first Constitution had no sectarian provisions in it.  Some one alleged that this was attributable to the fact that there was a British influence on what that Constitution contained.  If that is the case, then it was a good British influence if it restrained sectarianism, but I do not think we needed that British influence. I do not think that in those early days of the State, if we had been completely free to enact our own Constitution, if we were not tied by the terms of the Treaty, as that Government at that time was, we would have enacted a Constitution which would have contained sectarian provisions.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere of that time was one of great goodwill towards the minority.  The minority were given a very powerful place in the Seanad of the new Irish Free State and the rights and property of the minority were protected against sectarian attack. Let us be clear about this: sectarianism, involving attacks on property and people, has not always been completely confined to Northern Ireland. There was a period when the fact that a house in the country was owned by a Protestant was enough to condemn it to destruction.  I have a letter in my possession addressed to the Chief of Staff of the IRA pleading that a certain house be spared from destruction because the owner, although a Protestant, was well disposed towards Republicanism.  That <Col N="597" /> letter was written in County Waterford, not in Northern Ireland.  Our Government at that time set its face resolutely against sectarianism and created a state which, in its laws and practices, was one that would bear favourable comparison with the State from which it had cut itself away.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear, as we accuse ourselves of having moved in a sectarian direction in a certain period, that we had a very good example from the other side of the Irish Sea because Britain today has laws and practices which involve a degree of establishment of a certain church and limitations on the religious denomination of certain high offices of State which remain, at least theoretically, in the Constitution and have never been repealed.  These are anachronisms from the past.  One could understand anachronisms continuing; people are not very concerned about them if they do not impinge directly on their liberties, but we cannot easily, I think, forgive ourselves in that we did not just inherit anachronisms; we created anachronisms in the 1920s and in the 1930s.  After that early period there was a drift towards creating a different kind of State. Some things were done even in the 1920s which were the kind of things which would not have been done if this were a single, united country.</P>
    <P>There was the attitude taken up by the Government at that time in regard to the question of divorce.  It became an issue in Parliament in 1925.  Had this been a single united State, I do not think the Government would have taken up quite the attitude they did. There was other legislation introduced, such as the Censorship of Publications Act.  I do not think such an Act would have been introduced if this had been a united country.  The main weight of this type of legislation, tending to create a State modelled on the principles, outlook and attitudes of one religion came later and it is interesting to speculate as to why it came.  Why was there this movement in this direction, a movement towards a certain sectarianism in the 1930s?  I think the roots of it go back into the 1920s.  We see <Col N="598" /> them in some of the statements of people on the other side of the House. But the blame is shared here.  I have said there was certain legislation introduced in the 1920s which might not have been introduced and which did not reflect the kind of legislative outlook there might have been in a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>But it must be said that the main problem arose in the 1930s.  It arose when a new Government came to power which had already indicated a certain attitude of mind which showed its predisposition in this direction. There were certain statements made before 1932 by that party.  There was, for example, the claim by one leader of Fianna Fáil that it represented the big element of Catholicity, an attempt to take to itself the mantle of Catholicism, become a Catholic party, a curious statement.</P>
    <P>There were the accusations against the Cumann na nGaedheal Government about being in league with the Freemasons, a sectarian type of accusation, which was certainly unfounded but indicated an attitude of mind on the part of those Members of the Opposition who made this accusation. There was also the criticism of the Government of the day because it had not consulted the Hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church before entering into negotiations with the Vatican about the establishment of a Nunciature here, again a criticism from a particular viewpoint which was designed to give an impression of the attitude of that party.  Finally there was that disgraceful case of the appointment of a librarian to Mayo County Council where the Government had to intervene to prevent an attempt locally to make the appointment on a sectarian basis and where the Fianna Fáil Party, supported on that occasion, I regret to say, by the Labour Party, tried to appoint a Roman Catholic on the grounds that no Protestant should be allowed to be a county librarian.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  On that occasion the Cumann na nGaedheal Party stood against a certain sectarianism which I am afraid temporarily but very <Col N="599" /> temporarily infected the Labour Party as well as the Fianna Fáil Party.  You had on that occasion Mr. de Valera's <i>obiter dictum</i> that he thought that, perhaps, in Catholic areas dispensary doctors should not be Protestant.  All this is on the record.  Then this Government came to power and proceeded to import specifically Roman Catholic attitudes into the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1935, and then to introduce this Constitution which contains the provision we are deleting today.</P>
      <P>There is a whole history there of a development in a particular direction. Historians will speculate as to why that came about.  I suspect myself, but it is purely a theory, that that Government coming to power having been in conflict with the Church authorities on political grounds some years previously were seeking to purge their contempt, were seeking to make themselves respectable in the eyes of the Church; if that was the motivation, I am afraid they overdid it, as we can see from this Bill.  I am not saying that all the blame is on one side. There was at that period a general attitude of mind brought about by the division of the country which encouraged people of all parties to think in terms of moving towards some kind of Catholic State in which the Protestant minority would be treated tolerably, of course, but as a minority, a bit outside the Pale: &ldquo;We will be nice to them; we will not do them any harm&rdquo;, but they would not be part of the totality of the State; they would not share in that Catholicity to which a Fianna Fáil leader had referred as being a particular mark of his party in the late 1920s.  All groups shared to some degree in that, but the main impetus for that movement came unhappily from Fianna Fáil from 1928 up to 1937.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we have to do here today is to set something right that was done wrongly at that time by the Government of that time under the auspices of the leader of that time, Mr. de Valera, and which was opposed in Dáil Éireann by certain people, opposed in particular on the matter with which <Col N="600" /> we are now dealing, I notice, by Mr. Frank McDermot, who was then a Deputy of this House and who had shortly before that been the Vice-President of the Fine Gael Party.  In a Second Reading speech he suggested to the House that this particular provision was unnecessary and not particularly useful, and he put down an amendment on this subject on Committee Stage of the Bill proposing half of what we are proposing here today, that is, the deletion of subsection (2).  He put it to the House that this was undesirable.  He quoted an article by Professor Berriedale Keith who said that the subsection in the article in the Constitution &mdash; that is the draft Constitution&mdash;was what offended most against the idea of the unity of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The President, Deputy de Valera at that time, replied in curious terms. He said that if we were going to have a democratic State, if we were going to be ruled by the representatives of the people, it was clear their whole philosophy of life was going to affect that and that had to be borne in mind and a recognition of it was important in that sense.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dr. Rowland spoke of the implications of our relations with Northern Ireland.  He pointed out that:</P>
    <P>The statement here going into the Constitution is unnecessary and may give rise to a suggestion in the future that the Catholic Church, having been specially recognised, is in a position of special privilege as regards giving advice to the State...</P>
    <P>And he felt this might create in Northern Ireland a certain resentment in opposition which might be harmful to the cause of unity.  Deputy McDermot, in a later intervention also referred to certain dangers which would arise especially in connection with Partition. These warnings coming from the Opposition side were not listened to by the Government of the day. They were not even adverted to.  It is interesting that Deputy de Valera, then the President of the Executive Council, in replying to the debate dodged these issues.  He did not face up to the implications for the unity <Col N="601" /> of Ireland or for Northern Ireland. He put his support for these measures on very vague grounds.  He said:</P>
    <P>It was put down only after careful consideration and, I might add, testing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>He did not say what kind of testing.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to whether there was anything that was going to cause reasonable objection in any quarter. In the form in which it is I think we can let it remain without any qualms or fears.</P>
    <P>Words, which I am afraid, do not read too well today.  It is not clear to me why the President of the Executive Council, whose concern for the unity of Ireland we all know of, should have swept these considerations on one side and why he should in this instance have thought that this article was so important that it must go into the Constitution despite what he must have seen, listening to the debate, as obvious dangers as regards national unity.</P>
    <P>I should like to add here that the attempt to give some kind of vague special status to the Catholic Church and, indeed, even the reference to other churches is not in any particular way helpful to them.  The whole experience of history is that when any church is given special recognition or special status by the State its interests as a religion are not thereby furthered.  All that happens is that it is identified in some way with the establishment in people's minds, and its hold on popular support, its hold on the loyalty of its members, may be weakened.  In Ireland this has not happened because this provision, as we know, has been effectively meaningless.  In Britain the established position of the Church of England does not help it particularly but, if anything, makes people suspicious of it it is that for three and a half or four centuries it has been put in a position of being subject to the Government of the day in the matter of appointments to clerical positions, something highly undesirable.  We have avoided that, and, indeed, it must be said that this Article of the Constitution contains other provisions taken over from the previous Constitution which have safeguarded religion in this State from this kind of identification.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> I doubt, therefore, if this provision has done much harm; it certainly has not done any good, nor has it done any good in any other way that I am aware of.  Certainly people in Northern Ireland who are not concerned with constitutional niceties, who are not in a position to determine whether, in fact, there is any legal decision of a court in the Republic of Ireland that has ever rested on the authority of this particular section, people who are not in the position to go into these abstruse analyses of the situation are clearly liable to be and have been put off from thinking in terms of a closer association with us in this part of the country by virtue of the provisions of this section of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Clearly we need to change this and other things, and one has to ask why we are at this moment concerning ourselves only with this particular section of the Constitution.  I am not entirely clear on this and I do not think the Taoiseach explained it very clearly at the outset.  He spoke mysteriously about there being common ground on this issue.  He did not say common ground between whom but I think he meant the political parties.  It might have been wise if he had been explicit on that and not given any ground for suggesting that there has to be common ground with ecclesiastical authorities of a particular church before we can legislate in this House.  It is something which is being alleged forcefully at the present time.</P>

      <P>I wanted to help the Taoiseach to bring this out because there is a danger of this being misconstrued and that would be very unfortunate indeed.  Already the fact that we are only dealing with this section of the Constitution and that only changes in this section of the Constitution have been the subject of ecclesiastical animadversion&mdash;if that is the correct phrase&mdash;is enabling people in Northern Ireland to say: &ldquo;In the South they can change their Constitution only when the Cardinal <Col N="603" /> says it is all right.&rdquo;  It is a misjudgment on the Taoiseach's part&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It would be useful to make that clear.  There are only three parties in this proposition, the parties in this House.  That needs to be made clear to the people in Northern Ireland.  It is unfortunate that the only change we are making is one which has had the explicit approval of the head of the Catholic Church in Ireland.  That is enabling people in Northern Ireland to suggest, falsely, that we are only willing to change things when ecclesiastical approval is given.  As soon as possible that particular imputation should be dealt with.  It can only be dealt with in one way&mdash;by tackling the whole problem of those parts of our Constitution which are not acceptable to the whole people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>This is what we should be doing here today and I am not quite clear from what the Taoiseach said why we are not doing it.  He spoke about this common ground between the parties, but is there no other common ground between the parties?  I am not clear that there exists a difference of opinion between the parties on other issues of the Constitution.  Of course we have not yet had any report of the Committee on the Constitution, but nothing I have heard suggests to me that there have been deep divisions of opinion on other Articles of the Constitution. I am wondering why, if common ground has been emerging in that Committee, we should be now picking on one item where there is common ground and not dealing with others where, as far as I am aware, there is also common ground.  I find this &ldquo;common ground&rdquo; phrase puzzling.  The Taoiseach perhaps would need to clarify it from several points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="604" /> We need, at this stage, a new Constitution appropriate to a country of mixed religions, a country in which there are in this part of Ireland, as in other parts of Ireland, people of different religious views, all entitled to the common protection of the Constitution, all entitled to equal respect. As Deputy Carter pointed out in an excellent contribution to which I listened with great pleasure, there are also people whom he described as freethinkers, agnostics, people who do not have religious convictions and who are perfectly entitled to that position and entitled to the full protection of the State just as much as people who are members of a particular Christian Church or indeed the Jewish community.</P>
    <P>We have a problem here in expressing what we mean when we talk about what we hold in common in this country.  At times we speak of Ireland as a Christian country.  I myself, speaking 18 months ago at the Ard Fheis of my party in relation to educational matters, made the point&mdash;and it received considerable support&mdash;that this is not a Catholic country, that it is a Christian country.  I realised, as soon as I had said those words, that they could be misinterpreted as seeming to be exclusive of the Jewish community and seeming to reflect upon them.  Unfortunately, if one is making a point of that kind you do not make the point as emphatically or as elegantly if you say: &ldquo;This is a country with Judaeo-Christian ethics. That is not quite the same thing as the more punchy: &ldquo;This is a Christian country&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Here we can be misled at times by the fact that there is no single word to represent what is common in the Judaeo-Christian tradition.  There is only a compound, hyphenated phrase of a rather awkward character to indicate that we in this country share in common, not only among Christians but also with the Jewish community, a common tradition, a common heritage, arising from the Old Testament and that our attitudes, ethics and outlook on life have sufficient in common to bind us together. We need a Constitution which gives expression to this, a Constitution to <Col N="605" /> which not only Catholics, not only Christians, but also members of the Jewish community can give equal allegiance.  That will mean fairly considerable changes not confined to this part of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution should represent the common denominator of us all. It should protect those rights that are common to all, it should assert those principles that are common to all and it should not go beyond that.  Once it goes beyond that it becomes divisive and this is a divisive Constitution, a Constitution which has divided our country more deeply because we are much more deeply divided today between North and South than we were 40 or even 50 years ago.  These divisions have been consolidated in legislation and in Constitution making of a kind which reflects a particular local attitude of a particular part of our people who at one period in time were minded, at least their political leaders were minded, to try to create in this part of Ireland a curious phenomenon&mdash;a neo-Gaelic Catholic State which would in some way dominate, but very gently and not oppressively, those who did not share the particular idea of a Gaelic Catholic State.</P>
    <P>That is what we now have to get away from.  It will require a good deal of effort to get away from it because all of us have become, in varying degrees, prisoners of this past.  None of us is free from this particular heritage. None of us can really cast his mind back to the way in which people thought 50 years ago, before this movement towards creating a sectarian Constitution and laws here began.  We are all influenced by this past.  I know this myself because recently in writing a book dealing with these problems and others I was trying to write in a manner which could give no offence to and would not cause any Protestant or person in Northern Ireland to pull up and feel that I had said something which would offend him or surprise him or make him feel there was something unacceptable here.  I consciously tried to do this and because of the fact that my own background is half Northern Protestant and half Southern <Col N="606" /> Catholic I think I am in a slightly better position to attempt this than some less mongrel character, as a result of the miscegenation to which Deputy Lenihan referred as an undesirable phenomenon he wanted to stop&mdash;cross-breeding, I think he called it.  When I asked an eminent clergyman of the Church of Ireland in Northern Ireland to glance through the draft and to give me his comments, in many places he had to point out that I had unwittingly, unconsciously, and unintentionally put things in a way which to a Northern Protestant would seem, if not offensive, at least slightly strange.</P>
    <P>So much are we the prisoners of our background that even when we try, with goodwill, to get away from it it is not easy to do.  We are all influenced by the history of this country over the last 40 years and inevitably our thinking and the way we express ourselves, even with goodwill, is divisive in character.  We must all the time be watchful for this.  I notice when I go to Northern Ireland that both Catholics and Protestants pull me up at times when I use a phrase like &ldquo;this country&rdquo;.  Unconsciously we think of this country as the Twenty-six Counties and this is more offensive to Catholics than to Protestants in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In introducing this legislation I suppose the Government had in mind in some way to help the situation along in Northern Ireland as well as to rectify something which is wrong in this part of Ireland.  Our first concern &mdash;I do not mean our main or most urgent concern&mdash;must be to legislate in a manner which will create a Constitution which is appropriate to the needs of this part of Ireland at this time.  We must do what is right for its own sake.  We must also have regard in what we do, and what we do not do, to the implications of these actions or inaction for the situation in Northern Ireland.  In Northern Ireland there is a wish today among Catholics and among a certain significant number of thoughtful and moderate minded Protestants to look towards some kind of new Ireland in which they could share.  Ill-defined as the idea is&mdash;and the words themselves <Col N="607" /> are given different meanings, even adopted by the Provisional IRA, which suggests need for slightly greater precision if they are to retain any meaning&mdash;there is this feeling shared by Catholics and a significant minority of Protestants that we should be trying to create something new and more worthwhile in both parts of Ireland and that this might eventually lead to a coming together of the two parts on a common basis.  The things about which the people of Northern Ireland look to us for action are, I think, twofold.  One, which is controversial, is the matter of dealing with the IRA.  When one refers to that one is told the Northern Catholics want the IRA.  That is something of an over-simplification.  I have a letter here from a priest in Derry, written to a political colleague of mine, and handed to me before this debate began.  It is worth reading a few passages from it to indicate that there are people in the North of the Catholic persuasion who are very concerned that we should deal with this aspect of the problem as well as concern ourselves with constitutional changes.  The purpose of this letter is to wish us success in getting the Government to change its ambivalent attitude to the IRA. It says:</P>
    <P>I have worked as a priest in Derry for 13 years running youth clubs in Creggan and the Bogside. I have taken part in civil rights marches and sit-downs.  Except for teenagers, the great majority of Catholics are disgusted by the IRA's campaign and still more by the lack of comprehension south of the Border... The IRA have done incalculable damage to the cause of Irish unity ...  The Irish Government which, rightly or wrongly, did not use force to defend our people when 600 houses were being burned in Belfast is only digging its own grave when it allows a minority to use the name of the Army of the Irish Republic to wage war against the Protestants and the British. There would never be stability in an Ireland unified by this method. Any minority would see a bombing <Col N="608" /> campaign as the easy way to political power.  If the IRA seems to succeed, the UDA will adopt their methods.  If we tolerate the IRA, we have no right to complain if the UDA try to keep Stormont by bombing Clerys in return for the bombing of the Belfast Coop, by planting a bomb in Busaras causing the same loss of life as was caused in the Belfast bus station or by trying to repeat the scene of the Abercorn Restaurant bombing in one of the Abercorn's counterparts in O'Connell Street. When this happens, as it may, there will be an end to the plaintive statement: &ldquo;We are doing all within our power.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the need is for strong leadership, North and South.  The feelings of the Catholic people&mdash;I use &ldquo;Catholic&rdquo; only as a convenient label&mdash;need help to express themselves in the face of the prevailing intimidation... One would have thought that at a time when the future of Ireland is in the melting pot there might have been less party politics in evidence.</P>
    <P>At times also one wonders what is the aim and object of a united Ireland.  It is probably true that more has been done by Protestants in the North than by Catholics in the South to preserve our Irish heritage. Look at the work of the Belfast Records Office, the Belfast Folk Museum, the state of National Trust properties, <i>et cetera</i> and we have not yet descended to burlesqueing Irish culture in a Bunratty Castle...</P>
    <P>That is for the Minister for Transport and Power.  That is the view of one Catholic priest in Northern Ireland. There are other views, North and South, among the clergy and laity.  I am currently engaged in controversy with one clerical gentleman who has rather curious views about the nature of Christianity.</P>
    <P>If we are to help the situation or make it possible for people of goodwill in the majority community in Northern Ireland to contemplate coming together with us we must do two things: We must do everything <Col N="609" /> we can to prevent their lives and property being destroyed by people led from down here.  That means not permitting people who claim publicly to be leaders of an illegal organisation to march around surrounded by a bodyguard while the Garda Síochána are required, apparently, by their political bosses to stand idly by.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not dwell on that, but that is one thing we should do to help the situation.  The other is constitutional change.  We need to make it possible for a Northern Protestant of goodwill&mdash;and despite all we have allowed to happen and all that has been done there are many such people &mdash;to look towards us with hope that they can find in this part of Ireland coming together with Northern Ireland a society in which they would play a full and equal part and in which they would not be made feel they were second-class citizens if they had not studied a language which their forefathers never knew or if they did not practice a religion which had not been theirs for 400 years.  We need to be able to give them the chance to look with hope towards such a society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to enable the British Government to put to these people the proposition that the Republic is willing to change its way of life and create a kind of society they would find acceptable so that Britain can call on them to make a similar gesture of goodwill and move towards us.  Britain needs that assistance now because whatever was the case in the past we can say now that for the first time in eight centuries Britain has no interest in Ireland except to resolve her problems and leave us in peace as soon as possible. The danger is rather that Britain will leave too suddenly, with inadequate safeguards against what might follow than that she wants to remain here complicating our lives.  Given that situation, we must face the fact that all three British political parties are utterly frustrated with the failure of <Col N="610" /> the Government in this part of Ireland to take any action that would help towards creating conditions out of which a united Ireland might emerge.</P>
    <P>I think every politician from this House who meets a delegation from British political parties or who goes to Westminster and meets them there has the same experience: they cannot understand how a country which for 50 years has proclaimed its desire for unification is unwilling to take even the smallest step in that direction by making changes which could so easily be made to show we are serious about this subject.  They cannot understand how we can allow an organisation based here and under control here to murder our fellow citizens in Northern Ireland.  They cannot understand how we are willing to make only this small change in the Constitution and not go beyond that and make the kind of changes that would mean something.</P>
    <P>When they ask us why we are not doing this, how can we explain it? Nobody on this side of the House likes, when dealing with people from other countries, to be in a position where one cannot defend one's Government's actions.  We criticise the Government at home; when we go abroad we try not to do so, but I honestly find it impossible or at least very hard, faced with questions that are put to me as to why the Irish Government is not doing something serious about Irish unification, to defend the Government.  I may not be particularly successful in doing so with any conviction in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>We need also to help not only the British to go along the path towards which the Green Paper points; we need not only to help the Northern Protestants of generous and moderate views to move towards us but we need, above all, to give hope to the minority community in the North who are the main sufferers in all that has happened there in the past 50 years and particularly in the past four years.  We need to show them that we care.  I find it hard to show my face in Northern Ireland at present among the Catholic community; they do not understand our lack of concern.</P>
    <P>I spoke a few weeks ago at a meeting <Col N="611" /> when the title of the subject on which they asked me to speak indicated their feelings&mdash;&ldquo;What the Republic Can Do to Help Northern Ireland&rdquo;. They wanted to know did we really care and, if so, how was it we were doing so little.  They could not understand.  I am talking about Northern Catholics, although there were both Catholics and Protestants at the meeting.  Some Northern Catholics had the experience&mdash;two different couples mentioned this&mdash;of coming down here and being very well received and people being very nice to them so long as they thought they were Protestants but when it was discovered that they were Catholics the natural generosity of Irish people to strangers evaporated and the general attitude they found was: &ldquo;What are you people up to? Why cannot you live with your neighbours?&rdquo; That was a rather curious reaction.  This resentment among the Northern minority at the fact that we have not been doing anything to help them other than permitting the IRA to range freely and make their life impossible with intimidation is very hard to face and very hard to answer when these points are put to one.</P>
    <P>What is needed is an effort of imagination to see into the minds of Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland to discover how we can help them.  Does anybody here, including the Minister, seriously think that a Northern Catholic or Protestant of moderate and generous views reading the Taoiseach's speech today would be inspired to want to live in a united Ireland?  Was any note sounded there of generosity, of hope, of imagination? It was a pedestrian utterance, perfunctory in character which offered nothing in the way of hope to either community in the North.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Taoiseach is unable to rise to the occasion, unable to sense the feelings of people there, the deep and passionate feelings of people there, and do anything to meet these feelings.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that he had not had the opportunity at any time, and it is obviously difficult for him now, <Col N="612" /> to come face to face with people of Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland.  As things are at the moment, his contacts have to be largely, although not exclusively, confined to one community there.  This accounts, perhaps, for some of the insensitivity in his utterances and his failure to sound the kind of note that would resound through a Northern Ireland which today is shell shocked, uncertain of its future, demoralised.</P>
    <P>One only has to read the editorials in the newspapers there, like the editorial in the <i>Belfast Newsletter</i> of last Friday, calling for peace.  One could see there, as in the editorial of the Thursday after internment, a note being sounded quite different from the normal triumphant note of Northern Unionists, a note of despair, a note sounded of people simply seeking peace and security and willing to forget about past political attitudes if only they could be met with goodwill by others in the community, others in this part of Ireland.  We are not responding to these calls; we are not listening to them; they do not seem to penetrate the complacency in this part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear about this: we bear our share of responsibility.  It is, in fact, as I said at the outset, we who have divided this country more deeply by legislating in such a way as to cut ourselves off from the kind of society acceptable to people in Northern Ireland.  We had a civil war.  That did not encourage people in the North to have much to do with us.  It is we who have tried to create the neo-Gaelic Catholic State.  It is we who have tolerated the IRA over all these years.  We have to purge these offences. We have to show ourselves worthy of being partners in a new Ireland.  We have not done that.  This legislation is too small, too unimportant, too easy, to have much meaning from this point of view.  There is no good our blaming other people when we have this beam in our own eye.  First, we must try to set our own house in order before we can speak with conviction to people in Northern Ireland on these matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> We have only to read what the SDLP had to say in their policy statement, we have only to read a recent speech by Mr. Gerry Fitt, to see the kind of mood that is there.  From the latest SDLP policy statement, I read the following:</P>
    <P>Those who object to Catholic ascendancy, particularly in the religious field, in the Republic of Ireland are, in effect objecting to the results of the Partition settlement which institutionalised the differences between the two main traditions, creating a Protestant ascendancy in the North and a Catholic one in the South, thereby preventing the positive interaction of one tradition on the other which a unified State would have provided. Normal politics has thus become impossible in both parts of this island ever since, preventing the essential debate on what politics should be about.</P>
    <P>Mr. Gerry Fitt put that in his usual blunt language in Galway a week ago when he said that he would not be prepared to support joining the Republic as it is.  That, from the Leader of the SDLP and the leader, effectively, of the bulk of the Catholic community in Northern Ireland, is an indictment of us that we have created a State that Northern Catholics are not prepared to have anything to do with.  Could there be a worse indictment than that, of this part of Ireland, with all its claims to wanting to create a united Ireland?  Yet, that is the summing up by the leader of the SDLP in blunt terms of what is implicit and, indeed, stated in the party's official policy statement.</P>
    <P>People tell us at times it is a waste of time, what is the use in trying to make changes down here &ldquo;to please that gang up there&rdquo;?  That phraseology has been used frequently.  We are told, why should we have to change?  Have not we got the kind of State that suits us?  We created the kind of State that we wanted. Why should we have to change it now to suit people in Northern Ireland who, first of all, it is said, we do not want anything to do with because of the way they are behaving and, <Col N="614" /> secondly, who in any event on the Protestant side would not be a bit persuaded by anything we do?  Here there is a basic misconception because while it is obviously true that the vast majority of Protestants will not be influenced in future by any legislative changes we may make here, that does not mean that making those changes cannot help the situation.  First, if we do make these changes, if we do create an open society here, a society in which Northern Catholics and Protestants could reasonably want to join, we make it easier for the ordinary Northern Catholic to talk to his Protestant neighbour with some pride and conviction about the possible advantages of a united Ireland; we make it possible for the Protestant of goodwill to argue the case with his fellow Protestants for this.</P>
    <P>It is sad, it is tragic, that at this moment the most urgent pleas for action down here to help the cause ultimately of unification come from the Protestant side, come from Protestant politicians, as well as Protestant clergymen, trade unionists, civil servants and others, but from Protestant politicians who ask us to help them, to put them in a position to persuade their fellow Protestants that it is worthwhile thinking in terms of some kind of movement towards a united Ireland. We today, by the inadequacy of the action we are taking here, are, in fact, betraying, not just the Catholic community in Northern Ireland but a minority&mdash;certainly a minority, but an important minority&mdash;of people in positions of leadership in the Protestant community who want to help.  Some of these have stuck their necks out very far in this cause that we are not prepared to do anything about.  It is much more difficult for an ex-Unionist Minister to put his name in public, in print, in the papers, to propositions which involve discussing how to move towards a united Ireland, as more than one of those people have done, than it is for us to make legislative changes down here.  Yet, they have the courage to stick their necks out.  They are willing to risk in their case more than their reputation, more than their seat in the Northern Stormont, their place in politics; <Col N="615" /> they are willing, indeed, to risk their lives in order to open up the possibility of a movement towards a new Ireland in which the two parts of Ireland could come together.  While they are doing that, while former Northern Unionist Ministers are doing that, all we are doing is fiddling here with a minor measure because we are not prepared or willing to tackle the more difficult issues which alone would convince people in Northern Ireland of our seriousness towards the whole proposition of unification.  We have much to be ashamed of in that.</P>
    <P>Of course, when we talk of unification it must be clear that we are talking of what is now a long term matter.  Our failures over 50 years, our failure to deal with the IRA more recently, have made it difficult for anyone in Northern Ireland to contemplate early reunification and, indeed, the SDLP themselves make this point that nobody is proposing or would propose immediate reunification of Ireland at this time. There is far too much to be done down here before that could be possible, never mind up North, and we are not doing it.</P>
    <P>No one would suggest that, if we make more energetic movements along the road that we are starting to stumble along today this will overnight change the situation.  It will not.  It will just remove a roadblock that will make some progress possible over time.  It will take a long time.  Deputy Carter spoke very wise words on that subject. It will take a long time before it will be possible for people in Northern Ireland to forget what has happened, to forget our share of responsibility for what has happened.  Whatever may be the case today, a lot of gelignite got across the Border before tightening up occurred.  A lot of people come for rest down here.  A lot of orders issue from down here which affect the lives of people up there.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the amendment.  I submit that in amending the Constitution we are motivated by several considerations one of which is the feeling that this is a first step towards creating the kind of society here that might bring unification nearer.  All I am saying is that it is only the first step, that there are other things more urgently needed to be done and that we have not done and that this Bill is an inadequate response to the situation.  I think that is a legitimate comment and well within the ambit of the debate.</P>

    <P>In conclusion, I hope that this is a first step only and I hope it will be followed by speedy action.  I hope that somehow we can stir ourselves out of our lethargy.  I hope that the Government that have given such inadequate leadership over the past four years will find it possible to give the kind of lead that will inspire people in most parts of Ireland to work towards the <Col N="617" /> creation of a new Ireland in which both parts can live peacefully together, sharing the common institutions.</P>
    <P>Until a much more imaginative and a much more thorough approach is taken to the problem we shall not go much along that road.  If this is a first step and is not simply a fobbing-off of the problem by nibbling at the easy part of it and ignoring the rest, if it is a first step to be followed by other moves then it will have been worth while.  We on this side of the House could not of course oppose any move of that kind even if it only makes inadequate progress.</P>

      <P>The deletion of this Article, judging by the debate here today, is not a matter for controversy. Other speakers have remarked that Constitutions which attempt to buttress the place of any particular religion, in a strict, formal constitutional manner, do not in fact, secure the position of that religion in any binding fashion on the people. Religion depends for its hold on the majority on far more important ties than simple references in a Constitution.</P>
      <P>I share the general disappointment of speakers that the response of this Government to the challenge before us is inadequate.  I get the unhappy impression during this debate that there is an unstated opinion behind the various speakers, on the Government benches especially, that this deletion is in some way a gesture to Northern Unionist opinion.  The deletion of this Article will have only very minimal influence on Unionist opposition to a united Ireland and on the general attitude of Unionists to this part of Ireland as the way we run it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> It is arguable whether any constitutional amendments in this part of the country will have any effect on Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland. It is incontrovertible however that we could be doing far more in economic affairs and in constitutional matters by making some advance towards meeting some of the objections made by Unionists in regard to a united Ireland.  A year ago, at a meeting in London between the British Labour Party, the Socialist Democratic and Labour Party and our party we requested the Taoiseach to explore the economic and constitutional implications of unity.  The Dublin Government up to then had not accepted that there was any obligation on them to do any particular investigation.</P>
    <P>This is a very timid response to the agony the North has gone through over the past three years.  The question must be asked whether we would be making this response, whether the Government would have agreed to put forward this particular amendment if these events had not taken place in the North.  One must recall that it was in 1966 that initial consideration was given to deleting this Article from the Constitution.  Would this referendum, in fact, be taking place if events had not intervened and the unfolding tragedy of Northern Ireland had not occupied public attention for the past three years?  Would we even have advanced to the point of this Government putting forward the case for the deletion of this particular Article of the Constitution?  We are left in some doubt with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>One can only rely on the reported statements of the Taoiseach to understand what is the approach of the Government to the entire matter.  It appears he sees the future in this context, that somehow, when those events take place in which a united Ireland is at hand, we will, in a blinding flash, present our proposals for a Constitution for that united Ireland and simultaneously our economic plans will be presented.  The Taoiseach does not appear to think there is any urgency attached on our side of the Border to making clear our approach to what a Constitution <Col N="619" /> should be for the State we live in, in anticipation.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about achieving unity by consent and agreement there is a heavy duty on us to anticipate the Constitution of that united Ireland which some day we hope to achieve by peaceful means.  The Taoiseach believes that there is no responsibility on us to declare our hand on this matter at this stage.  There is a fundamental flaw in his entire approach to the matter of constitutional reform.  He appears to be saying that it would be wrong for us to enact a Constitution in the formulation of which the northern people did not take an active part, that it could not therefore be a perfect instrument, be a proper Constitution for a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is technically true.  There is no doubt that whatever changes we make in constitutional matters in this part of the country would have to be revised whenever the electorate could be extended to include the people of the entire country but it does not remove from us the obligation of presenting our ideas as soon as possible, of a Constitution which would anticipate the Constitution of that future united Ireland, which we could enact.  It would not debar consultation with the enlarged electorate whenever that time arrives.  The Taoiseach, notably in his public statements, appears to be quite clear that there will be no fundamental change in our Constitution until the happy day of unity dawns.</P>
    <P>This attitude is not good enough and does not adequately meet the seriousness of the situation before us. There are people in our country with unity on their lips and using violent means to achieve that unity but those of us who believe in unity by consent and agreement must not leave the pass to those who would seek it by other means.  We must not give the impression that they alone are looking for unity.  If we believe in unity by consent and agreement then there is a responsibility on us to declare the positive consent of that unity.  While <Col N="620" /> we are asking the British for this initiative, that initiative and some declaration on their part, is there not work for the politicians and the Dublin Government to do?  Are we doing that work?  I do not believe we are.  I believe we are not living up to our responsibilities in this often declared view of ours that we seek unity by consent and agreement.</P>
    <P>We just advance a timid deletion of an Article of our Constitution which everybody accepts has no particular purpose or utility in that Constitution. This is not a serious response on the part of the Dublin Government anxious to achieve unity by consent and agreement, I repeatedly ask myself what exactly could a Unionist, who may think that there might be something in the idea of a united Ireland, grasp of the factual nature of a united Ireland, either constitutional or economic. Constitutionally, it is to be decided on the day and economically there will be some sort of an arrangement undefined at this moment.</P>
    <P>At present we are permitting the whole idea of unity to become a vague fantasy and we see no particular onus on us to say what we mean at this stage.  I regret to say that the Taoiseach appears to be the most skilled exponent of a do-nothing strategy on the Northern question.  The deletion of this Article is part of the same kind of wait and see approach which has been adopted by this Government during this entire troubled period in our history and I do not believe that it answers up to the full dimensions of the situation. It is not an adequate response.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution&mdash;people have dipped back into history and I do not intend following that practice&mdash;was seen as the high water mark of constitutional republicanism but I have always seen it as being a step backwards into mediaevalism rather than a step forward into any kind of enlightened constitutional republican approach. Certainly the 1937 Constitution could not be said to answer up to the full complications of the divisions of people on this island and certainly&mdash; it seems a strange thing to say&mdash;in the sense of understanding what the complexities and problems that beset the <Col N="621" /> pathway towards Irish unity, the Free State Constitution of 1922 was a superior document to the so-called Republican document of 1937.  I know that this seems an extraordinary statement for me to make but compare the two documents and ask yourself the question which apparently showed the more sensitive idea of what was a correct statement of religious freedom in the context of the Ireland in which it was produced&mdash;the 1922 or the 1937 Constitution.  Any unbiased observer will have to say that the 1922 document is superior and seems to be inspired more deeply by the problems of a divided country.</P>
    <P>The 1937 Constitution, it is true, does not have the external relations which the 1922 Constitution had with London and somebody will say on that technical basis that the 1937 Constitution is a superior document, but anybody looking at the serious issues in both Constitutions will agree that the 1922 document is superior in the sense I have mentioned.  It could be said that the 1922 document is not quite as detailed in its social directives section as the 1937 Constitution but I think that anybody looking at the social directives clauses of the 1937 Constitution will agree that they are for the most part meaningless, and when we come to consider the revision of Constitutions, we should consider revising that whole area of social directives.</P>
    <P>It may be that Constitution changing is not the real nub of the question in Ireland and that may be, but we are not doing enough to deprive opponents of unity of arguments which they at present hold on the basis of provisions of the 1937 Constitution which we apparently are reluctant to change.  What is holding up the opportunity of the people of the Twenty-six Counties enacting a new Constitution, a Constitution which would not have certain of the 26-county features which the 1937 Constitution has and the 1922 Constitution did not have?  The 1937 Constitution, far from helping us on the road to unity, is now seen to be an impediment and what a melancholy comment it is on progress, realisation <Col N="622" /> of what is needed to achieve a united Ireland, that we are today in 1972 returning to the thinking of 1922 on the approach required to a united country.  Imagine what a commentary it is on our seriousness on the questions posed by Irish unity that this melancholy comment could be made, that we are deleting a section which in the 1922 Constitution did not exist.</P>
    <P>The economic matters may be more important than the constitutional ones and again we have called repeatedly&mdash;it does not arise here&mdash;on the Government to set up a permanent secretariat to consider what, in fact, are the economic implications of unity so that there again the Unionist who might be considering unity would have something to look at, and it may be true to say that when we have changed all the Constitutions, when we have done everything possible, perhaps, other issues which are totally outside the jurisdiction of this Assembly may, in fact, be a greater impediment in certain Unionists' minds towards the entire idea of a united Ireland composed of different traditions.  None of us can influence the theologians on the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree.  That is a matter for theologians on the facts involved but the fact of the matter is that if one reads the statements of Protestant spokesmen, they have repeatedly pointed out that the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree as operated in the South is the doctrine which is responsible for absorbing and decreasing the number of their co-religionists each particular year and maybe, in fact, the decree is probably one of the most important elements in making it necessary for Protestants and Catholics to develop on separate lines here even in the South, in the Republic.</P>
    <P>As I see the question in this country, the nationalist position is the one looking for unity.  That tradition I belong to myself.  Does it not, therefore, devolve on the Dublin Government, the only sovereign Government left in this island at present, does it not devolve on us, to set out in as much as we can the outline of a society and remove from it the imperfections?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="623" /> Surely it is not sufficient simply to wait on events considering how each statement will affect our party political fortunes in the Twenty-six Counties? Surely there is a higher station for a Taoiseach and a Government at present in the South, a higher responsibility, than stoking the prejudices of 26-county opinion on each issue. Surely if we are anxious to help in this tragic situation, we should be courageously setting down now the outline of that so-called new Ireland of the future?</P>
    <P>We do not have to postpone action, to procrastinate until that future time arrives.  We have a duty to set down the Articles and clauses of that Constitution which would as far as possible be without the imperfections of the present Constitution.  We do not need British permission or a British initiative to do it, we do not need any outside agency to do it.  The sovereign people of the Twenty-six Counties may in their wisdom do it and it should be quite possible for the Government to consult with all organisations in the South to see that it simply is not politicians changing the Constitution but that we can consult all outside interests. Part of the problem of the 1937 Constitution is that there was insufficient consultation with people outside. At least it may be said of the 1922 Constitution that the consultations&mdash; and the kind of consultations that did take place are pretty well chronicled &mdash;were widespread and many.  Many interests were consulted and involved but the 1937 Constitution was very much the creation of one man and has all the imperfections of that limitation.</P>
    <P>The constitutional politicians, if they are sincere about unity by consent and agreement, must fill out that concept with real content and we do not appear to be doing that at present.  Instead we appear to wait on events, to postpone and to procrastinate, and it would appear that we move only when we have secured each step, considered its effect on the most important feature which appears to determine Government policy at the present time, the party's fortunes in the 26-county area.  Some <Col N="624" /> would say it is possibly an unfair time to be asking a Government to be taking courageous action on the eve of a general election but the northern holocaust has been on for the last three or four years and the Government response has been very inadequate indeed.  Their whole approach on the Constitution appears to be &ldquo;Shelve any action; pass it on to a committee&rdquo;, and, therefore, there appears to be no strong executive line on making any decision, either in constitutional or economic areas, and it appears that the basic fault is in the Taoiseach's own mind when he thinks that all action on constitutional and economic matters can be postponed to that misty day when unity will be there and the Angel Gabriel will be at hand to announce that it has arrived and that there is nothing necessary, nothing that we must do in the meantime.</P>
    <P>On the contrary, we in the Labour Party suggest the immediate enactment of a new Constitution which will be without certain of the objectionable features of the present Constitution, one which would anticipate inasmuch as we may the Constitution of a united Ireland and one which Unionists who might be thinking&mdash;and these are very few&mdash; of accepting the idea of a united Ireland could at least point to the Constitution as not being in itself a bar.  At present we have not committed ourselves either constitutionally or economically and it will be the position of our party that we will support this non-controversial motion, and our general approach would be that we are not satisfied the Government are fulfilling their full responsibility if they are serious about the quest for unity by consent and agreement.</P>

      <P>I will be very brief.  I agree with the amendment at present before the House.  I listened with interest to Deputy FitzGerald when he was talking about inadvertently giving offence to Northern Ireland.  Some years ago I had to buy a pair of shoes in Lurgan and when I came to pay for the shoes I asked the <Col N="625" /> shopkeeper if he would take Irish money.  I felt horrified, but he did not take offence and accepted the Irish money.</P>
      <P>The 1922 Constitution was designed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party for the whole Thirty-two Counties.  When they came to power, the Fianna Fáil Government should have retained that Constitution.  Possibly it needed amendments in certain places but I do not hold with a rigid Constitution.  A Constitution has to be amended from time to time as necessity arises.  As far as the 1937 Constitution is concerned I am glad I voted against it in the referendum. In this referendum I will vote for the amendment.  We have heard a lot of talk about the North and so forth. I do not believe this amendment will make an awful lot of difference in our relations with the North but I accept it as a step towards a Constitution here which will be acceptable North and South.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to say straight off that the establishment of an all-Ireland socialist republic is the fundamental objective of my party and that national unity is the basic objective of the Labour Party.  Having said that, I will quote from the policy document of the Labour Party:</P>
      <P>The Labour Party seeks the voluntary reunion of all Irish people of the territory, and the achievement of the voluntary unity of all the people of Ireland clearly implies that the real and profound differences that exist at present must be removed by persuasion, dialogue and communication and not by the bomb and the bullet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="626" /> In a peaceful and unenthusiastic atmosphere, we are debating a proposal by a Government who believe the gesture we are making here is bigger than we regard it to be.  If we want a majority in the North to be part of a united Ireland, there must be peace and reconciliation. We must do what is required to remove all the barriers to mutual understanding.</P>
    <P>Up to the present we have had too much violent action through which innocent people in the North have suffered and during the past three years we have not had in this part of the country enough political activity. There is no point in our criticising or damning the British Government or criticising and damning the Unionist Party and putting ourselves forward as being entirely blameless in this whole situation.  What we have got to realise&mdash;not alone Members of this House but the people throughout the Republic&mdash;is that there are one million Unionists in this whole country which has a total population of 4½ million, and we just cannot ignore those one million in a total population of 4½ million.  We must therefore make changes which will be a recognition that there is such a vast body of people among the 4½ million.</P>
    <P>Our role must be to highlight, to condemn and to remove aspects of our Constitution, of our laws, of our social services and political institutions, which offend against the civil rights not alone of people in the North but in the Republic, and which militate against the unity we all desire. Connolly stated in his Workers' Republic:</P>
    <P>Unite the workers and bury in one common grave the religious hatreds, the provincial jealousies and the mutual distrusts upon which oppression has so long depended for security.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution contains some of these distrusts.  We are asked here to amend Article 44 but there is no mention at all of other offensive sections in the Constitution.  As a matter of fact, there are other clauses in the Constitution which in my view are empty gestures to the people in the <Col N="627" /> Twenty-six Counties for whom the Constitution under which we operate was designed.  I quote from Article 45 just to show how shallow many parts of the Constitution are.  Clause 2 is as follows:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing</P>
    <P>i.  That the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.</P>
    <P>We certainly have fallen down on that in a big way.  We have not in this Bill, nor has it been suggested that we should have done it, considered the prohibition of divorce in any circumstances. As a result of a commission five or six years ago, there was a unanimous decision that divorce could be and should be allowed in cases of people whose religion allowed divorce.  I do not think our Constitution should deny people of that religion the advantage of the recommendation of that body, of which the late Seán Lemass was chairman.</P>
    <P>As far as I can remember, the Taoiseach said that changes in the Constitution should be tackled in uniform manner and not piecemeal.  I think he referred to drawing up a new Constitution rather than amending the present one.  There is no indication of any intention on the part of the Government to do this.  We have been asking for a new Constitution for the past two or three years.  As Deputy Cluskey said this morning, Fianna Fáil do not seem to be prepared either to draft or to support a new Constitution.  There may be reasons within Fianna Fáil for not wishing to scrap entirely the present Constitution.  I have a suspicion that deep in the hearts of Fianna Fáil there is a reluctance to scrap this Constitution, which in many respects is meaningless and contains many platitudes, merely because it was an instrument of Mr. de Valera.</P>
    <P>I do not know who Mr. de Valera consulted in regard to the framing of the Constitution but at any rate there <Col N="628" /> seems to be some sort of emotional attachment to it merely because it was introduced by the man who is now our President.</P>
    <P>So far as changes are concerned in the context of Northern Ireland, I suspect that the Taoiseach had in mind the withholding of certain changes, or, as some people might say, certain concessions until he or some other person reaches the bargaining table.  That would be a shabby trick.  If we are to have changes or a new Constitution we should have them irrespective of any bargaining there might be.  It seems that the Taoiseach is not prepared to lead in this matter.  In fact in some cases he has found himself to be far behind those who attended his own Ard Fheis.  For example, when he was pressed on the law governing the importation of contraceptives and when the consensus of opinion seemed to be that the law should be changed, not in a manner that would lead to a permissive society but in a manner proposed by members of the Labour Party, the Taoiseach said that he wanted to assure the majority&mdash;that is the majority in Northern Ireland&mdash;that when they sit down with us to discuss our future in Ireland together they will find us reasonable and oncoming in these matters.  Certainly the Taoiseach has not been reasonable and oncoming not only in relation to that matter but in respect of many other matters also. Indeed, he did not appear to be very enthusiastic last week when it was suggested that the referendum on Article 44 should be held in conjunction with the referendum on votes at 18.</P>
    <P>The deletion of Article 44 is the beginning but let us remember that it is one of the easiest Articles to delete, as has been indicated by the reception which the proposed amendment has been given both in the House and throughout the country.  The vast majority of people seem to agree that Article 44 should go.  I suppose this is one of the nettles that the Taoiseach spoke of when he said some time ago that he was prepared to grasp nettles. However, he will not suffer any stings by reason of bringing in this particular proposal.  This amendment was recommended unanimously in December, <Col N="629" /> 1967, by the Committee on the Constitution.  It is a pity that report was not acted on before the troubles began in the North in 1968 and which escalated to such an extent in 1969.  I do not know what was in the mind of the late Mr. Seán Lemass but I suspect that in 1967 he had his eye on the North, that he wanted reconciliation and understanding with the people in the North.  That was demonstrated by his visits to that part of the country and by his other gestures in that respect, although these were not tremendous in so far as the North was concerned.</P>
    <P>If the recommendations made in 1967 had received the approval of Fianna Fáil at that particular time I do not think there would have been the fear and the tension that exist now in both communities in the North. There was a unanimous recommendation, too, in respect of that section of Article 41, which deals with divorce. That recommendation was not regarded as being objectionable but, like many reports that have been presented to the Government in respect of the various social and economic aspects of our life, it was merely noted and left aside.</P>
    <P>The effect of the present proposal and other recommendations, if implemented, would not have a major effect on relations between the Northern majority and the Republic. Deputy Cruise-O'Brien this morning referred to this being too little too late.  It would not have been too little or too late if it had been done two or three years ago.  Let nobody be under the impression that changes of this nature in the Constitution will allay the fears of the majority in the Northern part of our country but their fears might have been allayed if, instead of regarding the present Constitution as being sacrosanct for the past 35 years, Fianna Fáil had done something in regard to it.  That was typical of our neglect and our unconcern for our brethren in the Northern part of our country during the past 50 years not only in so far as the Constitution is concerned but in respect also of many other economic and social matters.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> I wonder if the Taoiseach and the Government have the courage now to grasp all of the nettles that were referred to by the Taoiseach in Killarney in the autumn of 1969.  All of us took hope from that particular speech but, again, it was merely a speech. It was made at a time when the troubles in the North were at a very high level, though of course they are at a much higher level now.  There was hope then that this Taoiseach, who said that he had no involvement with the 1922 era, would show himself to be a modern and up to date Taoiseach. We have neglected such matters as social services, health and education. These, also are nettles to be grasped if we are to give any hope to the majority in the North that their rightful place would be in a united Ireland, but a united Ireland with all these changes made.  There is no point in seeking to amend the Constitution piece by piece.  It should be scrapped entirely.  This view was expressed by many people who have spoken here today.</P>

It was voted on by the people in the Twenty-six Counties.  Also, it reflects the political philosophy of the thirties, a philosophy long since abandoned by political thinkers.  In the context of a divided country, or even of a united Ireland, that sort of Constitution should be scrapped entirely and we should set ourselves the task of creating a new one.  We should draft a new Constitution in consultation with the people from the two Northern communities. Let us enact it first for the <Col N="631" /> Twenty-six Counties as a clear and unequivocal demonstration to the people in the North of our <i>bona fides</i> regarding the creation of a non-sectarian State by creating one now in the Republic.  By this one action let us finally bury the fear that exists, whether real or not, among people in the Northern part of our country that home rule is Rome rule.</P>
      <P>We do not pretend such a Constitution would be suitable in every respect&mdash;that would be impossible&mdash;for a united Ireland but we could offer it as a starting point, unemcumbered by embarrassing and offensive sections of the Constitution.  This new Constitution would take into account the plurality of views that exist in the South because if we cannot guarantee full civil liberties to the minority in the Twenty-six Counties, how can we guarantee the same rights to Unionists in a way that will convince them we are sincere?  In any event, let us make the changes for ourselves now. This we can do without waiting for anyone.</P>
      <P>If we want unity with the North, we cannot tolerate disunity in the South and unfortunately we have done this for the last 50 years.  At the moment our society is the antithesis of ecumenism.  It is intolerant and is a disgrace to those who describe themselves Christian.  Dick Ferguson, an ex-Member of Stormont, said that people like himself in the North despaired of unity because of the refusal of the South to budge even one inch. We usually associate the expression &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; with Unionists but this is a comment from an ex-MP from Stormont who wants to see the necessary changes made in order that the people on this island can live in happiness and prosperity.  I do not think we can blame him for his despair considering what has gone on during the last two or three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time the Taoiseach has been looking for initiatives.  Speakers from these benches have questioned him regarding his role in the matter of unity.  The Taoiseach has been looking for initiatives from Harold Wilson and from Mr. Heath; he has <Col N="632" /> sought initiatives from Mr. Faulkner, from Captain O'Neill and from Major Chichester-Clark, but there is not much evidence that he is prepared to show any initiative.  I make that statement while accepting, as my party do, the proposal that is before us today.  It is a small step.  The Taoiseach should be prepared to grasp the other nettles that are so obvious not only in the Constitution but in our economy.  The Taoiseach has said that the former Prime Ministers in Northern Ireland must accept much responsibility and he also speaks about the responsibility of two British Prime Ministers, but he is forgetting that, as Prime Minister of the larger portion of this country, he has shown little initiative in the grasping of any nettles in order that there would be an end to violence, reconciliation among the communities throughout the country and eventual unity.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with the Constitution can be described as a rather technical exercise.  In this Bill it is proposed to delete two paragraphs of Article 44. This Article has been the subject of comment frequently and continuously since 1937.  If not commented upon by one section of the community, it was commented upon by the other.  In approaching this matter in 1972, we must realise that we are in a great period of change.  There is no comparison <Col N="633" /> between 1937 and 1972.  I agree wholeheartedly that many Articles in the Constitution could be reviewed and brought into line with the thinking of 1972 rather than 1937. It would have been a worthwhile exercise if, instead of changing Articles of the Constitution to suit the strongest winds of public opinion that were blowing, the Government and the House had got down to drafting a new Constitution as has been suggested already by a number of Deputies based on a future united Ireland.</P>

      <P>This would be a most desirable exercise.  Listening to the debate since 10.30 this morning one is inclined to ask oneself a variety of questions.  One question which struck me very forcibly was: had everybody in this House taken leave of their senses with the exception of myself, or was I the one who was completely out of step and was everybody right except me?  We are discussing Article 44 of the Constitution and spending a whole day of Parliamentary time on it.  While tens of thousands of workers are facing redundancy, and while the housewives are wild with anger and rage over rising prices, Parliament is devoting its time to whether the Catholic Church should have a special position in the Constitution.  If you stop people at random on the streets and ask them what does Article 44 of the Constitution provide, very few will be able to tell you.  This Article is very familiar to us as Members of Parliament and to all those connected with the legal profession, but the ordinary man in the street does not give two straws about Article 44.  It is a great pity that we have not got our priorities right.  If we had, we would be discussing something which would affect the livelihood of our people more strenuously and seriously than an exercise of this type.  Nevertheless, Parliamentary procedure has decided that today we have to deal with the question of Article 44 which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due <Col N="634" /> to Almighty God.  It shall hold His Name in reverence, and shall respect and honour religion.</P>
    <P>That paragraph is to remain.  The paragraph under review and being debated and which will be under examination in the country in the next few weeks is:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens.</P>
    <P>That is what this House is deciding to delete from the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the following one later.  It relates to the other important Christian churches.  &ldquo;The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the Guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens&rdquo;, is a statement of fact.  Whether it is in or out of the Constitution does not alter that fact.  Why it was ever put into the Constitution I cannot understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church is the Church in this State of which the majority of the citizens are members.  That church is one, holy and apostolic.  The supreme and sovereign authority of that church is the Pope, the Bishop of Rome.  This is recognised by the majority of our citizens.  Whether this is written into the Constitution or not would not alter that fact, and will not alter that fact.  The Catholic Church can be described as a world-wide organisation, founded and established by Christ Himself and it will reign, last and prevail until the end of all time. There will not be any quivering within the church nor will there be any rumblings in the church or anywhere else if this Article is removed from the Constitution.  If it will make <Col N="635" /> people happy to take it out of the Constitution I do not suppose there is any great objection to endeavouring to make them happy.  I fail to understand why we should delete it from the Constitution when it means nothing and never meant anything except to convey a statement of fact, and it is a fact whether it is in or out of the Constitution.  Various excuses are put forward as to why we should take steps to have the recognition of the Catholic Church removed from our Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power interjected that another paragraph was being removed.  Paragraph 3 provides:</P>
      <P>The State also recognises the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, as well as the Jewish Congregations and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.</P>
      <P>Some people are anxious to remove the paragraph which recognises the special position of the Catholic Church but that special position is recognised because the vast majority of the citizens are members of that church.  If the vast majority of the citizens were members of any of the other churches mentioned in paragraph 3, they would have been in a special position but, through the Grace of God, the vast majority of Irish citizens were members and are members of the Holy Catholic and Apostolic Roman Church.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand the agitation. This is the only opportunity we will have of extracting from the Government information in relation to this amendment of the Constitution.  These clauses have been written into the Constitution for 35 years and we have not yet heard from the Taoiseach or from any Minister who it is who wants this change in the Constitution.  I think the House is entitled to be informed if there has been any request from the Church of Ireland, from the Presbyterian <Col N="636" /> Church, from the Methodist Church, from the Society of Friends, from the Jewish Congregations or any others.  All these were consulted in 1937 and all apparently were agreed.  I believe there is more to this amendment than we have been told.</P>

      <P>We are told that the reason Article 44 is being amended is to make national unity easier.  I do not believe this has anything whatever to do with national unity.  It would be a physical impossibility to draft a Constitution which would meet with the wholehearted approval of 100 per cent of the people for whom it was drafted.  The Constitution of any State must cater for the majority, for the common good, for freedom to practise one's religion and even freedom for the unbeliever.</P>
      <P>Article 44 gives recognition to the special position of the Catholic Church. It does not say that any citizen has any privileges because he is a member of the Roman Catholic Church.  It does not say that he is a superior citizen.  It does not say that he is superior to any of the citizens of the other churches mentioned in the Constitution.  If we take the 32 counties 98 per cent of the people are members of these Christian churches.  Whatever other criticism we might make of the Constitution we must all of us admit that there is complete freedom of religious practice under the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I was referring to the fact that in this country there is and there has been free exercise of religion and that in addition to the Roman Catholic Church being recognised under the Constitution all other churches are likewise recognised.  I do not believe that the deletion of Article 44 of the Constitution is, as has been suggested, a step towards a united Ireland, no more than I believe that the removal of the two sections of Article 44 will make any better or worse Catholics or better or worse Protestants.  The second last paragraph of the Preamble to the Constitution reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established with other nations...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The unity of our country restored&rdquo;, although those words are enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution, we are removing recognition not alone of the Roman Catholic Church but of the Church of Ireland and the Presbyterian and Methodist Churches. I do not believe that it is with the intention of paving the way for a united Ireland that this Article of the Constitution is being deleted.  It is being done because our Constitution was examined in Brussels, and it is being pruned and trimmed to suit Brussels, not Northern Ireland.  In relation to the questions of money from the World Bank and from the International Monetary Fund, for health and education, and particularly education, changes are being brought about by influences outside the State. This section of the Constitution was regarded as having a religious bias, and of course the handiest way to get over this in the referendum is on the plea of national unity.  It is being done clearly to suit the Parliaments that meet in Brussels.  We are, perhaps, the only country in the world today in which special recognition has been given in our Constitution to all the Christian Churches.</P>
    <P>It may be argued that the removal of Article 44 is a step towards a united Ireland, but we have no great evidence as to who in the North of Ireland, either Catholic or Protestant, ever made pleas to have the Constitution amended in this fashion.  I think this amendment has nothing to do with national unity.  It has been said that our fellow Irishmen in the Six Counties had certain fears about coming in with us because of Article 44.  What fears could they have when the churches of the majority of the people in the Six Counties have been given mention in this Article of the Constitution?  It is regrettable that there are certain fears on the part of <Col N="639" /> people in the North who are not members of the Catholic Church. There are no grounds whatever for them.  They would be treated with respect, with kindness, with tolerance, with courtesy and with charity.  They would be received with open arms just as the minority who do not profess the Catholic Faith are treated with respect, neighbourliness, tolerance and charity.  The wonderful cooperation and teamwork, the wonderful social work that is performed in this country by the joint efforts of Catholics and Protestants is an inspiration to the whole world.</P>
    <P>There is the manner in which Catholic employers treat their Protestant workers and the generous, kindly and friendly way in which Protestant employers treat and have treated down through the years their Catholic employees.  We do not know what religious bigotry is in the south. Thank God for that.  May it always be so.</P>
    <P>Surely it is the duty of the Taoiseach and the leaders of all political parties here and of all church leaders, to convince people in the North that religious bigotry does not exist here, never has and never will.  In the South a person's religion is his own business and the concern of nobody else.  We probably do not understand the situation that prevails in the Six Counties but while there is that element of fear there it will take a lot of constitutional Articles to remove it.  Even if we had a completely new Constitution how would we remove that fear from a large proportion of the population who think that they will not be received with open arms by the majority of the citizens of the Republic who are Catholics?  There are no nicer, more friendly or more hospitable people than the people of the Six Counties, Catholic and Protestant.  They have a sense of humour, hearts of gold, sincerity and genuineness.  It is most regrettable that that extraordinary element of fear is there which will not be removed by changing various Articles of the Constitution.  That fear must be removed by our example, our tolerance, our Christian charity.  By <Col N="640" /> example we can do more than by all we could write into rules, regulations or constitutions.  Nobody can say that there are not Christians as good in the North as there are in the South. There most certainly are.  By working with each other and for each other we can get to know and understand each others problems.  We are all Christians. We know there is only one God; we recognise that God, recognise that He is the Supreme Law-maker.  The recognition of Almighty God by all Christians should be common ground on which all could come together, irrespective of whether they call themselves Catholic, Protestant, Methodist, Presbyterian, or anything else.  I venture to say that the good Methodist, Presbyterian or member of the Church of Ireland in the South has nothing for which to apologise to those in the North because in the Constitution enacted in the name of the Blessed Trinity and acknowledging God as the Supreme Law-giver there is no sneer or insult expressed or implied to the atheist or unbeliever.</P>
    <P>If we have atheists and unbelievers in our midst nobody in the South interferes with them.  They have that right and the laws of the land in no way deprive them of that or any other right. There is no law here to compel a person to have any particular religion or to have any religion.  That is the kind of freedom we want to hold on to.  I can never understand why it cannot be driven home even to the hardest hearts in the Six Counties that we have all that freedom down here.  In the South the law deprives the unbeliever of nothing and the fact that one is a Catholic does not make him a better citizen or a citizen superior to the person who professes any of the religious mentioned at sub-article (3) of Article 44.  Some of the best Irishmen in history were Protestants. Some of the most courageous and most loyal, some of the best farmers, the best businessmen, the best company directors, have no fear in this House and it is a great pity they did not do a little more to ease the tension in the North by telling the people there that they never had any fears because of religion in the South.  It is because of the charitable and Christian outlook <Col N="641" /> of the majority of the people in the South that you have the understanding and co-operation which has helped so considerably.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution gives no legal recognition to any Church or its members and penalises no religious association. It places no legal restrictions on those who have no religion.  What is needed North and South is a little more of the true spirit of Christian toleration which is wanting in both areas.</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House but I should like to ask the Minister for Transport and Power to answer my question regarding the presentation of our Constitution in Brussels some time ago and the changes that were suggested there.  He should tell the country the truth.  Is it not because particular churches were mentioned in the Constitution that this Article is now being put to the people for deletion so that an easy run can be made for money from European financial interests that would like to see religious references&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I accept wholeheartedly the Minister's assurance.  It is the general belief, particularly in regard to the financing of community schools and in regard to other funds that are to come from outside sources, that unless we take certain lines of action this money will not be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>There are divisions among the people on grounds of social status, profession, income and place of residence. These differences arise not because of religion but in spite of it. Religion is also being used at present as a justification for violence.  All who resort to violence and believe in it have long ceased to be Christians because the true Christian does not live by violence or entertain violence: he must banish violence completely from his heart and replace it with love, sympathy, tolerance and understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 44 which refers to the Roman Catholic religion as the faith professed by the majority is a statement of fact which will not be altered <Col N="642" /> whether it is in or out of the Constitution. Whether it is there or not makes no difference; it means nothing. The strength of the Catholic Church in the South will not be altered one iota the day this section goes out of the Constitution.  I think the Cardinal once said that he would not shed a tear if it were removed. Why should any of us shed a tear for the passing of something that means nothing, a mere statement of fact? Whatever the outcome of the referendum it will not alter the fact that the Catholic Church is the Church of the majority of the citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution has accorded an honoured, dignified and protected place to all the churches and because of that no Act of Parliament could be passed which would in any way interfere with that situation: that could only be done by a referendum. In no other country, to my knowledge, have the Christian churches been so honoured and protected as they have been here, particularly when we realise that the churches mentioned in Article 44, with the exception of the Roman Catholic Church, have the great majority of their members residing in Northern Ireland.  This ecumenical spirit prevailed in the thirties long before the reign of the much-loved Pope John XXIII.</P>
    <P>If Article 44 is deleted in the referendum&mdash;and this is a possibility or even a likelihood&mdash;does anybody seriously think we shall be any nearer on the following day to the political unity of Ireland?  The Constitution gives the guidelines for the society in which we wish to live and should be so framed as to guarantee complete religious freedom and equality of citizenship, but the common good of the majority must at all times be in the forefront.  If a Constitution were to be imposed by the minority on the majority that would not be democratic. The desire of every ordinary Christian layman and of every Member of the House, irrespective of party, is for a society that will be truly and determinedly Christian because this alone will ensure peace and progress for us and for all Irishmen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> I think of the time which we have lost this day in dealing with this matter. It may have been a very useful exercise in debate.  If Article 44 is removed, its deletion will not change the position of the Catholic Church.  The Catholic Church will be there and will be thriving, probably to a greater extent, to the end of time.  It is established by Christ; it is directed by the Holy Spirit.  The fact that we in a small insignificant part of the world alter our Constitution by the deletion of the term &ldquo;Roman Catholic Church&rdquo; will have no bearing whatever on the fruitful expansion of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.  It is right that it should go forth from all the faithful in that church that we are part of the great Christendom who believe in God and who welcome the members of other religious faiths. It is by working together, doing God's work together, that we should try to establish not only in our native land but throughout the world a lasting peace in which we can live in tolerance, understanding, charity, respect and brotherly love for one another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelCBrowne" hpid="Dr. Browne Dr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Flanagan has said, and he and I have spent nearly the same amount of time in the House, great changes are taking place and have taken place.  I think in his obviously very genuine and very sincere speech he spoke for the majority of the people in the country when he said that no matter what we do about Article 44 of the Constitution, the position of the Catholic Church in the hearts and minds of the people of Ireland will not be changed.  That was really the main point which he quite rightly wanted to stress.  Also, I think he did give some expression to a feeling of puzzlement, doubt and concern that the House should take time to bring in this Bill and to make this change in our Constitution.  That puzzlement and doubt may be shared by a considerable section of the community because, while I have said and many people say that this is a relatively unimportant act in itself, there is no doubt whatever that taken in the <Col N="644" /> time, not only nationally, in the context of the terrible struggle in the North, but also in the time of the great changes taking place within the Catholic Church throughout the world, this is going to be from now on a stressful period for many people within our society.  Many of the values, many of the ideas, many of the immutable truths which we have been led to believe were sacrosanct and could not be changed are, I believe, faced with inevitable change.</P>
      <P>To some extent Deputy Flanagan echoed the commonly held belief of the negligible quality of Article 44 in our society but, leaving aside the important consideration that the 1937 Constitution purported to apply to the Thirty-two Counties&mdash;and therefore it seems to me its inclusion in 1937 by Mr. de Valera was an extraordinary gratuitous act of provocation to the religious minority in the total community of Ireland&mdash; leaving that aside for the moment, we do know that the inclusion of Article 44 has been of importance in certain instances in our courts and also in certain instances in this House.</P>
      <P>I suppose I should try to clear up my own personal position in this because over the years it has appeared that I have taken up a particular position myself in relation to the Catholic Church and the general impression created has been one of sustained hostility to the Catholic Church.  I should like to make it clear that I am, I have tried to be all my political life, a social revolutionary and that as such I have never considered either political party or religious organisation or institution, trade union movement or any other group of people gathered together except in the context of their influence or their power to retard or to further social revolution and it is only in that context that I would presume to discuss or consider the influence of any particular religion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned with the religious belief held by anybody.  I think it would be an impertinence to criticise the religious belief of anybody. Nothing could be farther from my political attitudes than to question <Col N="645" /> anybody's right to hold any religious views they wished.  My sole concern always has been to consider the religion, the political party, the trade union movement leader, political leaders, whoever they are, simply in the context of the power and influence they have had in the attempts by some of us fundamentally to change the structure of our society and to create a socialist society.  That is the only concern that I have ever had.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable because of the special position of the Catholic Church, to which Deputy Flanagan quite rightly referred, in the minds of the mass of our people that it has become a particularly influential institution. The social and political attitudes of that institution were therefore of paramount importance in the kind of social organisation created by the products of that institution.</P>
    <P>I am one of the products of that institution.  I suppose it is true to say that 99 per cent of us here, for historical and other reasons, are products of that religious institution.  My only conflict, if conflict it is, is with its political and social manifestations and not at all with the exclusively religious quality of Catholicism.  We would be doing the Catholic Church a disservice if we were to say that it had not been influential in creating the kind of society in which we now live.  The Catholic Church controls our whole educational system. It certainly has done so in the past 50 years.  It has had the function of educating or indoctrinating&mdash;this is simply an unkind word for it but is just as valid in its meaning&mdash;all of us, first of all the electorate, through the electorate the Deputies, through them the parties, the Cabinet, the Government and the social and economic organisations of our society.</P>
    <P>That seems to be a logical assessment of the effect and influence of the Catholic Church and the part that it has played in our society.  The reality is, as Deputy Flanagan said, that the mass of the people owe allegiance to this belief which has a very clear-cut social and political pattern and is given a special position in our Constitution <Col N="646" /> and defined in our Constitution.  That very fact has been used in this House in my hearing, to justify the particular social attitude of at least one Government&mdash;and perfectly correctly in my view.  If it is given a special position, presumably it must be given a right to special consideration for whatever attitudes and views it holds.  I do not agree with this process but it seems to me to follow that, if you give it this special position in a Constitution, you can then use it to argue that thereafter one's social attitudes must be determined by this Constitution.</P>
    <P>The problem is not a simple one. Everything that Deputy Flanagan said about our attitude to the minority religions is correct.  There have been isolated incidents, which I do not particularly wish to refer to, of bigotry and sectarianism.  The minority here have been treated in many ways as a privileged minority.  I do not think the minority have much cause to complain, but I do not think it is quite as simple as that.  There is a free exercise of religion and, as Deputy Carter said, we always encourage them to come into public affairs.</P>
    <P>We have to remember that the 1937 Constitution and every Act and every provision of that Constitution has always to be considered in the context of our declared ambition for a united Ireland.  I remember talking to a Cardinal on one occasion and saying that the present Northern struggle was a sectarian one.  He said it was a political one.  Ireland is not divided at all.  Geographically, it is a unit.  That is a simple truth.  People think we can unite our country by bringing the two parts together, but it is much more difficult to have a country divided on sectarian grounds, on religious grounds.  Every debate that has ever taken place on a social, economic or moral issue should have taken place in the context of the declaration of all parties.  All the parties say they are republican.  The Labour Party, the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party are republican parties.  We all want the unity of our people.</P>
    <P>One has a perfect right to create what John Hume has called a confessional <Col N="647" /> State if you want to, a strictly Salazar type of republic or a South American type Catholic sectarian republic if one wants to.  If the people decide that is what they want they have a right to have it, but it seems to me totally illogical to expect that you can have this kind of sectarian State and at the same time pave the way for union with a group of people who are inalienably hostile and opposed to the religious views which the majority of the people in that sectarian State hold.</P>
    <P>It is we who are constantly seeking unity.  It is we who are constantly saying we want to be united to our separated brethren in the North. They do not want unity.  The Unionists have never made any pretence to wanting a united Ireland but, in spite of all our protests, there have been successive enactments here which have been sectarian, giving privileges to the majority religion down here.  We are perfectly within our right to do that if we wish to do so.  But as a preparation for unity, it seemed to me extraordinary that a man of considerable intelligence like Mr. de Valera, who whatever other failings he may have had, was an extremely shrewd, able and talented politician, could have believed that this gratuitous act of provocation to the religious minority in our total society could have passed unnoticed and could have in any way reduced the inhibitions, to put it at its lowest and its mildest, which the Protestant minority had in joining a united Ireland. It completely astonishes me. The inclusion then of Article 41 and of Article 2, making this provision apply to the whole island were obviously again further acts of gratuituous provocation to the minority.  Let us put those in if we want to&mdash;I cannot emphasise this too much&mdash;but to expect the Protestant minority to ignore or not to notice them or not to resent them seems to me to be a succession of acts of such extraordinary naivete as to amount to near imbecility and we see the end results of it around us today, in this extraordinary impenetrability of our <Col N="648" /> people in the south of Ireland to understand that we have provoked this minority who we profess we want to join us in unity and harmony.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan was correct in all the things he said about the position of the minority but this is my interpretation of all that.  I share his belief that there has been tolerance and understanding, the right to free practice of religion and an extraordinary generosity in all aspects of the life of a religious minority in the community, including, of course, the famous act of making Douglas Hyde, a Protestant and member of the minority, the first President&mdash;quite an adroit act, in my view.  I believe it was considered that it may not have been but it was done, to make the other provisions of the Constitution more palatable to the Protestant minority. Leaving that aside, however, the record is good where the minority is concerned, but I think that one has to look at the Protestant minority in the South a little more carefully.  I believe they have been given every facility to build their schools, to build their institutions, to provide for their hospitals, to provide for the university, Trinity being the main one, and to provide every facility they might want to have or might need&mdash;<i>prima facie</i> extraordinary generosity, considering the whole historical development of our country over centuries, with penal laws and all the terrible things which we as Catholics suffered in our own time.</P>
    <P>Considering these, <i>prima facie,</i> our whole attitude has been remarkably generous and tolerant and compassionate and, I suppose, in Deputy Flanagan's description, Christian, but I think it is fair to suggest that, first of all, this is a tiny minority, which incidentally is getting tinier.  I have some figures here showing pupils in schools as between 1950 and 1970 dropping from 11,000 to 10,000.  I do not want to make too much of that but it is a falling minority, a very tiny minority, an unthreatening minority and also rather a special kind of minority, a predominantly wealthy minority. That, again, of course, is a mark in our favour, if I may speak <Col N="649" /> as a member of the Catholic majority in the South in so far as we did not take their wealth, their property and their land from them so that the result is that they are predominantly a privileged minority.  They own the great institutions of wealth, the banks and house money-lending societies, factories, industries, and so on.  They continue to own these and considerable amounts of property.</P>
    <P>For that reason, therefore, many of the disabilities which I see stemming from either constitutional or legal enactments here, they have been able to evade quite simply.  If they want divorce, they go to Britain for it; if they want education which they like for their children, they send them to England for it; if they want to have family planning, contraception, there is no serious problem really.</P>
    <P>The <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, the position of mixed marriages, was rather more difficult but if you take these points, the decision to impose the Catholic attitude in relation to family planning and contraception by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree upheld by the courts in the Tilson case, the matter of mixed marriages where the children must be Catholics&mdash;preferably that Protestants should not marry Catholics but if they do, the children must be Catholics&mdash; the denial of the right to divorce to those who conscientiously believe they have a right to divorce&mdash;all these disabilities could be largely overcome by the existing Protestant minority, but in a united Ireland&mdash;this is the important matter&mdash;the whole position changes completely and so the special position of the Catholic Church in regard to these matters which determined this kind of attitude in the courts and attitudes in this House becomes very much more important in the context of a united Ireland because then you have, first of all a significant, a frightening and threatening Protestant minority in the total community and predominantly within that significant Protestant minority, there are either working-class people or white collar workers, a relatively non-wealthy group, at any rate.  You have then a completely different situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> What we did, consciously or otherwise, during the last 50 years was to recognise the special position not only of the Catholic Church but of the Protestant minority, and to accept that because of their privileged position, of their wealth on the whole, they would not mind very much if we laid down some conditions for membership of that effective ghetto minority, because we told them: &ldquo;You must not marry our children, you must go to school in our rigidly sectarian schools.  If you marry our children, their children must be Catholics.  If your marriage breaks down you cannot have divorce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole process was one of separate development, rather on the lines of Vorster's separate development, except extremely paternalistic, extremely generous but, nevertheless, just as lethal in its isolation of the two communities.  So, one in fact has in the South just as clear-cut a division between the Protestant minority and the Catholic majority as there is between the Catholic minority and the Protestant majority in the North.  There are two partitions in Ireland, one in the North and one in the South.</P>
    <P>So, as a preparation for a united Ireland we created here a well-off, well-educated, well fed and cared for Protestant minority here so long as they kept away from us, so long as they accepted their role in separate development in the South and did not miscegenate with the Catholic majority.  If they did not accept this we stopped it by <i>Ne Temere</i>.  That is one aspect of it but probably of even greater importance is the factor which determined the right of probably the most conservative Catholic Church in the world&mdash;there are many kinds of Catholic Church but the Irish Catholic Church, in its social attitudes over the years has been extremely conservative&mdash;to oppose by Catholic social teaching any attempt radically to change, even by reasonably moderate means, the social structure here, the old age pensions and other social benefits.  We, accordingly, had a social vertical class structure in which 74 per cent of the property was held by 5 per cent of the people, the end product of the social policy of the <Col N="651" /> Catholic Church here during 50 years. Extrapolate that to a united Ireland and what do we find?  We find that our social services, health, education, care of old age, housing, social grants of one kind or another, are all very much lower&mdash;the latest trade union figures outlines them in great detail&mdash; than those paid in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Let me say we are doing the Catholic Church an injustice if we say she has not been influential in creating these enormous disparities which in my view, much more than the laws on contraception or <i>Ne Temere,</i> are the major obstacles to true unity.  This was summed up for me quite recently.  I was in the Newry march with some devout churchgoing working class people.  You all know the circumstances of the march.  It was very tense, very anxious and for people of their age it was quite a dangerous thing to be doing.  They summed it up for me by saying: &ldquo;Remember this afternoon we are not marching for a united Ireland. We are marching for civil rights.&rdquo; They should not have said that because they should not have had to say it because it should not have been true.  But it happens to be true.</P>
    <P>I think that will be one of the defects in the referendum.  If the Catholic Nationalists in the North get their civil rights, to which they have every right, then a referendum carried out in those circumstances, leaving no doubt in anybody's mind that whatever about the South being ready and prepared to pay the £300 million to £500 million per year mentioned in the Taoiseach's article in a German newspaper, the Catholic Nationalist in the North will vote with the Protestant Unionist.  Gerry Fitt said the other day that he has more in common with Paisley or one of the others than he has with people down here.</P>
    <P>I am trying to discuss this in the context of the situation in 1937 and the situation of crisis and possible civil war, and the role that has been played by our politicians here in the South over the years in taking action <Col N="652" /> after action which together have led to a very clearcut, positive and completely justified reluctance on the part of the Northern Protestant Unionist and the intelligent Northern Catholic Nationalist to come together.</P>
    <P>If I were the father of a family in the Six Counties I would vote against union with the South on the grounds of the lack of freedom of conscience and the gross defects in our social services, all of which have stemmed from the special position that the Catholic Church has held here since the State was founded.  I know of no leader of any Government who professed to be republican from Mr. Cosgrave through Mr. de Valera, Mr. Lemass or the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, who has been prepared to subordinate his declared ambition and hope for a united Ireland to his prior loyalty to the Catholic Church.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish put it very well once when he said: &ldquo;I am a Catholic first and an Irishman second.&rdquo;  That goes for the vast majority of the politicians in this country during the past 50 years.  I have no objection to that point of view except to say that at its mildest it is illogical in the context of those who say that they wish for peaceful unity with a significant sector of our society which differs from us on religious grounds in a deep and, it appears, irreconcilable way.  Indeed, that attitude is totally hypocritical.</P>
    <P>Often when watching the Taoiseach in action I realise the frighteningly difficult post that he holds.  It is a post that I would not have for all the money in the world.  The Taoiseach is head of the Government at a time when we all face very grave dangers because of the possibility of the breakdown of any existing control and of the spread of civil war both in the North and in the South.  I do not underestimate the difficulties he faces.  Sometimes I admire what I would consider the Chinese-like quality of his extraordinary patience but, on the other hand, I am astonished at the way in which at a time that he is asking for initiatives from Health and from the Northerners, his own reply is as minimal as this measure.  There <Col N="653" /> have been initiatives by way of the proroguing of Stormont and the issuing of the Green Paper.</P>
    <P>I would not flatter myself by thinking that I see things more clearly, more patriotically or with greater insight than anybody else in this House, least of all the Taoiseach.  Before we reach the stage at which we can enter into any serious discussion leading to a relaxation of the appalling hatred that exists between Catholics and Protestants there are many matters to be put right.  The fears of both communities are very real and in my opinion entirely justifiable on the record.  I am sure they will defend their beliefs in the same way as would the people about whom Deputy Flanagan spoke &mdash;the majority who profess the Catholic faith.  For that majority the deletion of Article 44 will not lessen the special position that the church holds for them.  Those Protestant people in the North who are frightened of us and of our religious, social and moral convictions and who hate us because of these convictions will fight us if we try to impose our convictions on them.  In their fears and their sense of insecurity they would act as would a Catholic majority down here threatened with what they believed could be a complete take-over by some Protestant majority from the North.</P>
    <P>The deletion of Article 44 is only of relative importance.  The leader of the Labour Party has said that the Taoiseach will have the support of this party in dealing with the major measures in the Constitution which should be changed&mdash;Articles 2 and 41 &mdash;and also the amendment of the Criminal (Amendment) Act relating to contraception.  I hope that the Taoiseach will accept the need for changes in all these matters in addition to accepting the need for improving all our social services&mdash;health, education, housing and so on.  All these matters would have to be put right before we could go honourably either to the Northern Protestant Unionists or to the Northern Catholic Nationalists and tell them that should they come into a united Ireland they would not become second class citizens in a fifth-rate society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of our discussion on this Bill there has been a very wide review of our present conditions and, indeed, of our past attitudes.  This morning particularly there was an element either of criticism by one group of another or of self-justification in relation to attitudes that existed in this State between 30 and 50 years ago.  I wonder how relevant is any of this examination of the past to what we are discussing this evening.  In particular I wonder how relevant it may be having regard to what we hope will be the condition of society in the whole of Ireland, whether together in one State or under whatever constitutional position we may have in the future.</P>
      <P>If this justification or criticism of the past has any relevance, it is only in so far as it shows the inevitable development of attitudes that must occur in any country in a period of 50 years.  To that extent it is relevant in showing how far or how little we have travelled in the last 30 or 40 years.  It should be understood that it is no part of our function here to justify or to blame the past.  We do little service to the present and offer little hope for the future if we set ourselves up with the wisdom of hindsight on what was done 30 or 50 years ago.  Constitutions, like laws, are drafted for the conditions of the society as they exist at any particular time.  The fact that the Constitution was accepted by the people was an indication of the views prevailing in the country at that time.  In addition, it was presented to the people who had emerged from a condition which is different from that obtaining now and probably much more different from the condition we hope to attain in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Browne, in what was a very reasoned contribution, referred to certain aspects of our society here. It is worth noting that some of the matters that caused him concern derive from the time before the establishment of the State.  Separate education for the various denominations was not introduced by the first Government of this country.  I am not <Col N="655" /> suggesting that it is either a good or a bad thing but I am pointing out it was not introduced 30 or 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the state of our society one must take into account the roots from which that society has sprung.  One must acknowledge that because of what was done 50 years ago by Partition both parts of Ireland became a sheltered society and to some extent this applies even now. Each part developed according to a rather narrow ethos and without having an opportunity of communication and consultation that might have given rise to a different kind of society if Partition had not been introduced. However, Partition was introduced and that is another fact we must accept.  In this part of the country where a significant majority belonged to the Roman Catholic faith it was inevitable that we were conditioned by the situation in which we found ourselves. Our religion, history, culture and our attitudes to these matters affected our laws.  Let that be the end of it.  Let us not continue to berate each other, to praise ourselves or to blame others for what was done 30 years ago.  In discussing this or any other proposal let us look to the future because we are concerned with the future.</P>
    <P>During the debate this measure has been described as a major step while others have called it window-dressing; in fact, every degree of importance or unimportance has been given to it. Which of us can be wise enough to say how important it is?  The real test is not in what is contained in our Constitution.  The real test of any society is the condition of that society operating under a Constitution or under laws framed for that society.</P>
    <P>Having regard to our sheltered past and to the struggle of the vast majority of the people to achieve independence 50 years ago and the conditions they inherited, it is fair to say that there has been a welcome, even surprising, understanding between the communities in this part of the island. Deputy Browne has acknowledged this fact.  I have said on numerous occasions that this is not something <Col N="656" /> for which any Irishman wants to claim any credit; in fact, none of us wants to talk about the divisions that would exist if we were enumerated in terms of denomination.  The social divisions referred to by Deputy Browne may have been characteristic of society 20 years ago, but now in Tipperary, and I am sure in other areas, they are not characteristic of society, with regard to business, social work, recreation or any other sphere. People mix together without regard to denomination.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to say this because we may fall into the trap of criticising too much and not acknowledging to some extent what has emerged in our society during the last 20 years.  It does not need to be stated that the Protestant minority and every other minority have been allowed to play, and have played, a significant role in the development of our society at political, commercial, cultural, judicial and every other level.  The only significant thing is the fact that people who do not know the recent history of Irish society are surprised at the extent of the role played by the minorities.  Perhaps this is because we have not promoted sufficiently this happy aspect to the world.  Other people are surprised to learn of the high office held by many of the minority in this country since the establishment of the State.  This is an indication of the kind of base we can build on in the future.  If the sheltered past could yield such tolerance, the future can develop even greater tolerance.</P>
    <P>I use the term &ldquo;minority&rdquo; merely for the purpose of definition.  The less we talk of &ldquo;minority&rdquo; or &ldquo;majority&rdquo; in this or in any other society the better.  One is a minority according to the views one holds of the social condition but hardly according to one's religious profession.  The minorities have given willingly and their contribution has been welcomed readily.</P>
    <P>This is a small island, North and South, and what happens in one part inter-reacts on the other.  There have been conditions in the North which, in the past 50 years, may not have measured up to the same opportunity <Col N="657" /> for the same tolerance as there was here, and which caused a reaction in that part of the country.  It may also be because, as Deputy Dr. Browne says, the minority up there are numerically more significant, and possibly that the minority down here are in a more privileged position than the minority in the North.  That may be the very reason why this problem has emerged in the North.  It has reacted on the conditions in the South.  In so far as we live together, and must live together, maybe this is not only inevitable but good.</P>
    <P>None of us can live or continue to live in the sheltered State in which we lived up to comparatively recently. For this I put no blame on the past or on the figures of the past.  We all recognise that, whatever be the structures of the future, we will become much more dependant one on the other, and the reactions in society will become more significant one on the other as we emerge into future generations.</P>
    <P>If the Catholic Church has had a special position in this part of the country, as a Roman Catholic, I cannot say that this has been brought to my notice.  It is not for me to say that others have not been offended.  From any information I could get in the course of my short experience, and from my constant social communications with people of every denomination, I have not been made aware of it particularly so far as it may be alleged to derive from the provision we are now proposing to delete from the Constitution.</P>
    <P>If Roman Catholics, or any other denomination for that matter, as has been said today, have a special attitude to their Church, and if their Church has a special position for them, this should prove one thing more than another, that is, that the more their Church has a special position in their minds, the more they must be mindful of the special responsibility they have towards others, not as members of a different denomination, but as fellow Irishmen in the same society.  If any denomination were to preach anything other than understanding, tolerance and mutual co-operation, it would not have the support of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="658" /> For that reason one of the possible happy consequences&mdash;it is not just a possible happy consequence; it is, indeed, a happy consequence&mdash;of the troubled development in the past five years particularly, has been that church leaders, church-goers, casual church-goers, people of every denomination, who previously might not have seen themselves as being Christians first and members of various denominations afterwards, are now looking upon themselves as having much more in common than they previously had. They are now praying together when previously they never did.  They are now recognising that the divisions which have been promoted in the North of the country in particular because of religion, are a denial and abrogation of what religion means to members of any creed, Christian or otherwise.</P>
    <P>Church leaders of Protestant denominations have expressed this view to me personally.  They feel one thing at least has been achieved.  None of us now, particularly church leaders, works out things in a vacuum.  All of us recognise now how dependant we are in every sense, even in the practice of our religion, on our neighbours who may belong to a different denomination. Some people who fault our conditions here in this part of the country would almost blame us for partition, much less the consequences of it.  Some people seem to imply that the solution for partition and the responsibility for it rests here.  That is not in accordance with historical or present facts.</P>
    <P>The danger is that, in making suggestions or criticisms of that sort, they may discourage the Irish people from taking an open, charitable and tolerant view of the conditions of society and taking a courageous view of the future.  What relevance has it that our social services and various other things, which were referred to this morning particularly by Deputy Cluskey, may not measure up to those in the North of Ireland, when we are talking about the special position of the Catholic Church as referred to in our Constitution?</P>
    <P>There are many factors which operate to affect harmony in a <Col N="659" /> society.  If we were to widen this debate to take in all those factors one year would not be enough, never mind one day.  Looking at the factors with which we are concerned here, the significant thing is that whatever be the view of each of us individually, this is, as was said this morning, an opportunity to declare in favour of tolerance, not that the previous position represents intolerance but in so far as some people may have thought this special position of the Catholic Church represented intolerance, although this paragraph is not the whole of the Article.  It is surprising how seldom the rest of the Article is referred to.  In so far as it may have represented some special privilege, at least in the minds of people who did not know our society, at least we are saying to them: &ldquo;We have reached the stage&mdash;it may not be a very significant stage&mdash;where we are now in a position to delete that provision.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Although it is not a representative view, I have heard leaders of extreme opinion in the North of Ireland refer to this Article outside this country as if the two paragraphs we propose to delete were the only two paragraphs in it.  In fact, they were very reluctant to consider the other guarantees in the Article.  In future such misrepresentation cannot be made of the conditions in our society.  It may not be a major step.  It may not even be a step.  At least it is a turning of our faces towards a step.  It is a turning of our faces towards those who may not yet be ready to turn their faces towards us for justifiable reasons, as they see it, people whose social conscience may be activated by higher ideals than ours and who may have reached their own conclusions through a different denominational practice.</P>
    <P>It is more than that too.  It is also a significant gesture to those in any part of the country who are restricted by prejudice which some people operate to effect political status.  We have had parties called Protestant Unionists.  We have had parties which apparently claimed adherence to a <Col N="660" /> certain denomination and a special position for that denomination.  People have been able to gather power and apparent authoritly for themselves because they have played on prejudice rather than developing the great potential of Christianity or, indeed, of any other creed.</P>
    <P>To the extent to which we correct that type of abuse of religion in any part of this country we are taking a step forward.  I hope that in no part of this island will we mix religion with politics or politics with religion.  We have a chance now to pass on to those who come after us something significant, as those who went before us have passed on something significant to us.  If we are humble enough to recognise that our contribution because of our imperfections must be small we will achieve something.  If we allow any abuse of religion then we will have a very real charge to answer before the bar of future generations. I do not think it is the will of the people that this should happen. I do not think the deletion of this clause is a significant step but it is, at least, a gesture and an indication of our willingness and, if we achieve nothing more, we will at least have gone some way&mdash;there may be a long way still to go&mdash;to heal the divisions, particularly the divisions in the area of religion, an area in which only harmony should exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard a good deal of this debate and I have been more struck by what the last three speakers said than I was by anything said earlier in the day.  I refer to Deputy O.J. Flanagan, Deputy Noel Browne and the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy O'Kennedy.  The latter pointed out that many people describe what we are doing here as window-dressing, as something small, as something not worth doing.  Possibly what we are doing is all of these things because this deletion is a very small gesture in itself, but there is the possibility that, if we make this gesture and take this small step forward, it will lead to bigger things.</P>
      <P>I and my party would much prefer to see a new Constitution brought in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> I cannot understand why we should be asked to amend just one Article of the Constitution at a time when a committee are investigating the Constitution of 1937.  The most sensible thing would have been to wait until the committee finished their deliberations.  I understand their is a time limit.  I understand that their findings must be unanimous.  If we waited for the report of that committee we could then draw up a new Constitution and present it to the people for ratification.  In the light of the committee, it is difficult to understand why this one amendment to one Article should be introduced at this stage.  There may have been certain pressures.  It may be that this will be beneficial from the point of view of handling the very dangerous and explosive situation in the North.  I just do not know.  We must, I suppose, be thankful for the little we get.</P>
    <P>The clause in question could not give offence to reasonable people.  It merely states, as Deputy Flanagan said, what is a fact.  The Catholic Church is the guardian of the faith of the majority and, because it is, it holds a special position.  The State also recognises other churches.  If, of course, this could be interpreted as being Home Rule/ Rome Rule, then we are doing the right thing in deleting this clause from the Constitution.  In the last 52 years Partition has caused many headaches and great sorrow to people in both parts of this island.  Anything we can do towards moving one bit along the road to reunification of the people is to be welcomed.  It is the people we must bring together.  The island, as Deputy Browne said, is united anyway.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Parliamentary Secretary say that some people in the North blame us collectively down here for Partition.  That was a welcome admission from a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  Over the years Partition, according to Fianna Fáil speakers, was an offence committed by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government. Partition, as the Parliamentary Secretary honestly admitted, goes back beyond the division of this country. The tragedy of the situation in the North has shaken both communities down here.  Like the Parliamentary <Col N="662" /> Secretary, I do not like using such words as majority, minority, Protestant, Catholic.  There should be no need for these.  In every country in the world wars have had religious foundations. However, as I said, events in the North have shaken both communities down here into a realisation that there is a problem in the Six Counties, a problem which cannot be solved by the tedious repetition of platitudes.</P>
    <P>Every speaker has admitted that relationships between the two communities down here have been good. We have shown tolerance to those of a minority religion.  What I am about to say now I have already said in my own part of the country to those of a minority faith: had they been completely one with us the evolution of events might have been written differently.  They were good citizens, but the majority will admit that for years they lived in a kind of intellectual ghetto.  They were good citizens. We mixed with them socially.  We encouraged them to join political parties but it was only within the last few years that they began to realise that more was wanted of them.  Even though they represented only 5 per cent of the population they were equal in every way.  But it is only now that they are prepared to stand up and say what they have to say irrespective of whom what they have to say may insult.  This is an attitude to be welcomed.  As Deputy Browne pointed out, the majority of the people in the north-east do not want to come in with us.</P>
    <P>Until we drive the fact home to everyone, political party leaders, Deputies, party members, ordinary citizens, that there are one million people in the North of this country who do not want to be part of the Republic of Ireland, we will not go near solving the problem of a divided Ireland.  They cannot be coerced into joining us.  We must find some way of showing them that it is in their interest to join with us, that we want them here, that it will be a better place for all of us to live if they will play their part in running it as a unit.</P>
    <P>There is a horrifying account in one of the evening papers of an interview <Col N="663" /> with the Grand Master of the Orange Lodge in which he says that one million Protestants in the North of Ireland have all the money and guns they want, that they have plenty of friends all over the world, that they would be glad to unite this country and make a present of it to the British Crown, that they will fight and that they will win.  That is a reprehensible statement.  It makes one shudder to think that a man in a responsible position as an elected representative could speak in such terms of hatred. However, we must recognise that Captain Orr is one of the people whom we say we would like to be united with.  What are we going to do about it?  Are we going to say: &ldquo;We will throw out Captain Orr and keep John Hume&rdquo;?  We just cannot do that.  We must take them, warts and all.  We are the people who want to be united with them.  It is up to us to show them that what we offer them is of benefit to them, that not alone will their contribution be of benefit to the whole island but it will be of benefit to their community as well.  Until we realise that we must make the running in this, then we are a long way from uniting this country.  In as much as this amendment to Article 44 of our Constitution is a small step in that direction, I welcome it but, as I said, I would much prefer to see a whole new Constitution being brought before the Dáil today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me start by repeating what Deputy Barry has just said. I would much prefer to see a new Constitution being introduced and, perhaps, we are making a mistake in amending this and doing the job piecemeal.  I was a member of the Constitution Committee that sat here for a number of years and brought in a number of recommendations; and as has been said so often here, the only thing we recommended against was what the Government put into operation, that is, an attempt to change the voting system.  We did recommend at that time an amendment to Article 44 of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="664" /> I do not agree at all with some of the statements made here today.  Indeed, I wondered if we had got a bit mixed up.  Some of the Deputies seemed to be debating a new Constitution and what should happen in regard to all the various sections of the Constitution.  One Deputy got lost and started talking about a referendum; I think it was the Northern one he was talking about.  Personally, I am surprised at the length of time spent debating this.  I know it is very important and many people like myself want to put their point of view. However, in view of the fact that this is an amendment to the Constitution which nobody in the House appears to be opposing &mdash; except that many of us feel it would have been better to change the whole Constitution &mdash; it is rather a pity that so much time should be taken on this.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for a moment that the deletion of these two subsections of the Constitution will have the Unionists in the North rushing in here.  Nor do I believe it is the main reason why they do not want to come in here.  I do not believe, and I think anyone is foolish who tries to persuade people inside or outside this House, that the Catholic Church, which has been mentioned here specifically, has been responsible for all the ills that have befallen this country over the past 50 years.  That is a lot of nonsense, and the Deputy who made that comment must be as well aware of that as anybody else.  We do have people who like to ride their own pet hobby horse and take a side swipe at this person or that person or at this institution or at that institution. I do not think that is what debate in this House is meant for.</P>
    <P>Very briefly I should like to refer to a couple of points which may not have been dealt with already.  First, seeing that everybody, including the Catholic Church itself, seems to be campaigning to have these two subsections deleted, why was there such delay in doing it. Secondly, I do not know whether or not many people have taken the trouble to read the Constitution. Because I was a member of the Constitution Committee and am at present <Col N="665" /> on the Northern Committee which is dealing with the Constitution, I was struck by the fact that while the State recognises the special position of the Catholic Church, in reality this does not mean a thing to the Catholic Church.  The Catholic Church realises that and the Cardinal said quite some time ago that he would shed no tears if that was removed.  However, as regards the second provision:</P>
    <P>The State also recognises the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the Religious Society of Friends in Ireland, as well as the Jewish Congregations and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.</P>
    <P>Does anybody understand what that means, that a number of religious that have sprung up or have been introduced in this country since 1937 are illegal organisations under this Constitution? That point does not appear to have been noted by quite a number of people who talk about having these two subsections deleted.  Therefore, for that reason only, this change should have been made long ago.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made, as I have said, to various other sections and subsections of the Constitution that should be changed.  As I have said at the start, a new Constitution is what most of us want, but let us remember that the main object of a Constitution or a change in the Constitution here should be to try to set up, as far as possible, a State which would be the envy of all our neighbours, a State with which nobody would object to being associated. We should go to extra trouble to ensure that when the Constitution is being rewritten, as I believe it must be rewritten, it will be a Constitution which will be accepted not alone by the people of Northern Ireland but by the majority of the people who live in this part of the country.  This is a point which some people seem to overlook.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the occasion has been availed of by some Deputies to take a side swipe at some well-known institutions, for instance, the Catholic Church.  That is a pity.  I do not <Col N="666" /> think anyone would suggest that any church, particularly any Christian church, has deliberately held down the social progress of a nation.  I do not claim to be a better Catholic or a better Christian than anybody else in this House, but I do not think we should, in the National Parliament, attack a religion.  I also think it is wrong to say, as one Deputy did say, that the other religions are in a privileged position in the South.  I have a number of friends who are members of other religions; in fact, I have a number of friends who do not recognise any religion.  The point is that these people get the same treatment as I do and as any other Catholic in this country does and that is the state which we should aim at.  To suggest that simply because a person is a Catholic or a non-Catholic he should get preferential treatment or is getting preferential treatment or, worse still, is not getting the treatment he is entitled to, is wrong, it is mischievous and it should not be indulged in in this House.</P>
    <P>If I was in the North at present and was one of the Nationalist minority, and claimed to be a Nationalist, then I should have as my aim a united Ireland.  I know that social conditions here may make people think twice before they express the view that they want to join the Republic as it is now but for anybody to suggest that because the Republic at present is not perfect no Nationalist should vote for association with the Republic is again mischievous. This is the sort of talk which adds fuel to the fire of the venom of some of our Unionist friends in the North. This is the sort of talk which allows them to say: &ldquo;Even the southern Republicans are saying it is not a State fit to go into.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe there is an awful lot wrong with this country, an awful lot of things that require changing.  I would not blame the Catholic Church. I think I would be on a far safer bet to blame most of the ills of this country on the misrule of the present Government over very many years.</P>

      <P>Not the last one. In many ways this debate ranged over a far wider area than is merited by the Bill itself.  Much of the debate was almost like a debate on the British Government's Green Paper or whatever White Paper emerges from that on the basis of consideration of their thoughts expressed in the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>I believe this step is necessary as being good in itself.  I agree, furthermore, that it will help to disabuse people's minds in the North or Ireland, in Britain and throughout the world who are suffering from grave misconceptions as to the exact nature of the Article.  I would agree with the view and I feel very strongly about it myself, that the amendments which involve the deletion of these two subsections are good in themselves because the two subsections as they now stand are superfluous and add nothing to the guarantees that exist in the Article.  I want to emphasise that the Article that will stand after these deletions is a far more fundamental and basic Article.</P>
      <P>In the first section the State acknowledges that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God, a basic fundamental matter.  With the deletion of the two subsections we go on to the next subsection that will remain and which is basic to the whole Article and, indeed, basic to a paragraph that exists in similar Articles guaranteeing freedom of worship under the United Nations and the Council of Europe and, indeed, under Constitutions in every civilised country in the world.  It reads:</P>
      <P>Freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion are, subject to public order and morality, guaranteed to every citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once that subsection is there there is no need whatever for the two previous subsections.  They are superfluous and redundant.  That basic guarantee of <Col N="668" /> free profession and practice of religion is further sustained by guarantees not to endow any religion, guarantees not to impose any disabilities or make any discrimination on the ground of religious profession, belief or status and further guarantees in regard to State aid for schools being non-discriminatory, the right of every religious denomination to manage its own affairs and manage its own property.</P>
    <P>Article 44 stands.  I want to emphasise that because there are misconceptions and loose talk already that Article 44 is being deleted.  That is not the case.  Article 44 is being trimmed down to a basic Article acknowledging that the homage of public worship is due to Almighty God and guaranteeing freedom of conscience and the free profession and practice of religion, guaranteeing not to discriminate in regard to any religion and not to endow any particular religion.  For its own sake, in the interests of having a cleaner, more basic, more fundamental Article, without any surplus or redundant verbiage, I feel the Article will be a much better one giving a far more generally understood type of basic guarantee in regard to religion without these two subsections.  As it now stands in 1972 for its own sake and on the very facts of the matter, irrespective of the question of the reconciliation of peoples in all Ireland, I feel the two subsections should go and that is the Government's view.</P>
    <P>I will not enter into any futile controversy about why they were included in the 1937 Constitution, why the 1922 Constitution was not continued. All of these matters of controversy concerning the 1922 Constitution and the 1937 Constitution, in my view, are best left at this stage to the historians.  We can have an academic discussion about the merits or demerits of the two Constitutions. Sufficient to say that these two Constitutions were drafted in the climate of a particular period &mdash; the one in 1922 drafted in the climate of the aftermath of the War of Independence, the Constitution of 1937 drafted 35 years ago in the climate of a very real political cleavage between <Col N="669" /> the two main parties in this State as to whether or not the appendages that obtained in regard to the British crown at the time should be retained or removed.  These were the dominant issues.  I would suggest that in the debates on the 1937 Constitution these two subsections merited very little debate or discussion.  We now move 35 years afterwards to an entirely new climate.  First of all, these two subsections and nothing to the Article.  There remains a basic Article which is far more widely understood and which is completely sustainable on its own without these superfluous subsections.  Furthermore, in the climate of the present time I feel it is important to make every gesture, symbolic or actual, in so far as we can at present.</P>
    <P>Time is running out.  I would agree with the view expressed here by many Deputies that we should have a completely revamped Constitution or, indeed, a new Constitution.  I agree with this view and, indeed, this is why the all-party committee is sitting at the moment.  However, there are many Articles involved in any such revamping of the Constitution or any such new Constitution.  There are many points of view as to whether the Constitution should be trimmed down to one of general principle rather to one of too much detail.  All of these points of view will take some time to iron out, will take time for drafting and with the best will in the world we will not have a revamped Constitution or a new Constitution in the immediate months ahead but the immediate months ahead could be very important.  We already have the British announcement, the green document, containing very interesting suggestions, the most dramatic of which is the commitment for the first time by a British Government, to the involvement of this part of Ireland in any all Ireland settlement.  Growing from that, a White Paper will be brought in by the British Government. They are committed to changes not just in years ahead but changes in the whole structure of society in the North of Ireland that are going to take place in months ahead.  I want to put it to the House that this is precisely the thinking <Col N="670" /> behind the Government's action in bringing in this amendment at this particular time.</P>
    <P>Our view was that this is an obvious anomaly which all parties agree should be removed.  If this anomaly exists, if the section is widely misunderstood in Northern Ireland, Britain and throughout the world, if people mistakenly think it means something, that it is some sort of overall commitment to rule by the Catholic Church in the Twenty-six Counties even though we well know that it means nothing and anybody who studies it will know it means nothing, and if this section is widely used as an argument against us as not being in some way a democratic State with the normal democratic process but a State that is beholden to a particular church, that we have some sort of archaic sectarian society by reason of these subsections, if that is the view, now is the time when we are having the referendum on votes at 18 to say: &ldquo;Let us get rid of it&rdquo;.  I understand the all-party committee sitting at the moment have already agreed that it should go.  They are moving to other areas of work.</P>
    <P>The Government's view is that if we can synchronise this with our commitment to hold a referendum on votes at 18 why not do so and at least get that work out of the way.  I mention that as the practical consideration motivating the Government to get rid of the surplus subsections in this Article.  Time is not on our side. If decisions are to be made in the next few months on the future structure of the Six Counties we shall not have our new Constitution in draft then.  Decisions will be taken by the British Government and consideration given to this matter in very great detail in the months ahead.  Why not do something that can be done immediately which will be clearly understood as a positive gesture and a first step in the right direction?  From the symbolic point of view I regard it as a significant step; here it may be regarded as a small step but symbols are very important in politics as we know.</P>

      <P>I have been appalled, as I am sure other Deputies have been, at the misconceptions existing regarding these subsections in Northern Ireland, Britain and other parts of the world; they just know Article 44 and see it as some sort of devilish Article which by some sinister means has been inserted by the Catholic Church to ensure its domination of our affairs.  I have heard this view expressed widely by intelligent people including parliamentarians in Britain, Europe and the US. I have heard it on numerous occasions from people in Northern Ireland. Whether for mischievous reasons in some cases or genuine reasons in others it is a fact that a large number of supposedly intelligent people widely believe this about Article 44 &mdash; that it is some sinister device frustrating democratic development and ensuring our domination by the Catholic Church.</P>
      <P>Everybody here knows that is not the case but what is relevant is that a large number think it is the case. When that misconception exists why not get a positive bonus out of it by saying: &ldquo;If you think that, we shall get rid of it quickly&rdquo;?  We now have a chance to get rid of it and there is general agreement to get rid of it when the opportunity exists particularly in the present climate when the very serious reforms postulated by the British Government are being considered regarding Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned these factors so as to give a practical explanation of the Government view on this matter. <Col N="672" /> I share the view of everybody here that the Constitution itself requires a very detailed review prior to bringing in a new document or a considerably amended document compared with what is there now.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan made the criticism today that as it stands the Constitution runs into too much detail.  This is a valid point and one to which I am sure the all-Party Committee is addressing itself.  I certainly criticise that aspect of the existing Constitution. I thought some Deputies, although possibly just scoring points were rather naive in suggesting that because people advocated something in 1937 which proves to be wrong now, in some way that indicts the Constitution as a whole.  That is not so.  No Constitution should be an immutable document for all generations and all time.  The insertion under Article 46 of the referendum procedure shows the framers of the Constitution envisaged change.  The whole point of the referendum procedure written into the Constitution is to provide for change.  When the public mind changes certain aspects of any Constitution become redundant and require change.  That is why a Constitution should be, through the referendum process, a continuing living document that can be up-dated from time to time.</P>
    <P>I should like to dissociate myself from some of the more extreme remarks made, particularly by Deputy Lenehan, this morning.  These remarks regarding people in Northern Ireland with whom we have a difference are not helpful.  We want to consider the situation now in this island as a whole, with compassion and sympathy and, above all, it is important to appreciate the other point of view and seek a path out of the morass in which we find ourselves. There is no point in ascribing blame even for some of the more recent horrible events which all of us deplore.  Ascribing blame North or South to institutions lay or clerical at this stage in 1972 is counter-productive and hopeless.  We are in a morass and the Government and, I think, all right-thinking people in this island believe that the Green Paper <Col N="673" /> produced by the British Government points to some ways out of the morass. If agreement can be reached through discussion and debate which will induce the British Government, in its White Paper, to bring in structures that are positive and will bring reasonable-minded people together &mdash; and they appear to be intent on this for the first time in the history of these troubled islands &mdash; in the months ahead we may find a way out of the morass and a way of establishing structures which will command respect in both parts of Ireland if we can get together with a properly structured Council of Ireland providing an umbrella under which we shall try to work towards the national aspirations to which we all subscribe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>And we shall only get out of it together.  Above all else, this requires to be emphasised.  We can only get out of it on the basis of responsible people of all persuasions North and South coming together. Even though the light is faint and flickering at the moment there appears to be light ahead due to the fact that the matter is being tackled seriously, in my view, by the British Government for the first time ever. In that alone, in that admission by them that the problem has to be tackled and tackled immediately, that the sands of time are running out and that we in the South must be involved in these very admissions, which are the whole basis of the recent Green Paper, I see very real hope.  Indeed, there is evidence of this in the very responsible attitude, which was referred to in the debate already, being adopted by the moderate Unionist parliamentarians, the moderate Unionist politicians, who were together in the Unionist Party and who now see the futility of extremism on their side.  I think there is great hope in that direction too that many of these men are now anxious also to seek a formula under which we can with them get in under an umbrella under which extremism of both kinds can be dealt with firmly and absolutely and <Col N="674" /> eliminated from the affairs of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank the House for the co-operation in facilitating the taking of the measure today. It has been a good debate.  Any of the points of criticism that were made were valid enough in a debate.  I should like to conclude on a practical note, that now that we have got the debate out of our system it is all-important that the three political parties forget about the debating points that were made legitimately today in regard to why this is being done now, why was it not done before, why is not more being done, why was it not included in the 1937 Constitution. All of these are legitimate parliamentary debating points but from now on we have to get together on the practical business of persuading a great majority of the people in particular to support the deletion of these subsections of Article 44.  We are all together on securing the votes at 18 as a desirable social development, which is consistent again with what has already been done in the North of Ireland, in Britain, in the United States and in many European countries; we are committed already to that; but it is not as important from the national point of view that we have such an overwhelming majority in that case as it is in this case.  It is fundamental from the national point of view that we down here are seen in the North of Ireland, in Britain and throughout the world in taking this step to do so in a very positive and overwhelming way, to ensure that 80 to 90 per cent of our people &mdash; at least that &mdash; come out positively and say that they want these subsections deleted, that we want to turn around and face our brethren in the other part of Ireland and say it is a small step but it is a step in the direction towards reconciliation.  We want to ensure that that vote is recognised throughout the world as being the overwhelming decision of the Irish people and it is the three democratic legitimate parties in this Assembly who can do this most effectively through our supporters.  It is up to us to ensure between now and polling day that this matter is fully explained <Col N="675" /> to the public who support each of the three parties and that we really put our hearts into a total campaign to ensure that, at the very least, there is an 80 to 90 per cent majority.  That is the target we should set ourselves. Once having achieved that, there can be no doubt in the minds of people who may have had misconceptions about us as to where our hearts and minds are in this part of Ireland.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go léafar an Bille don Dara Uair anois.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Tugadh Bille ós chomhair na Dála inniú chun Airteagal 44 de Bhunreacht a leasú.  Roimh saoire an tSamhraith d'aontaigh an Dáil agus an Seanad le Bille eile chun an Bunreacht do leasú, sé sin an Bille a dheineann foráil chun an vóta a thabhairt do gach saoránach a bhfuil ocht mbliana déag slán aige. Mar a chuireadh in iúl cheana, tá sé beartaithe an dá thogra seo a chur faoi bhráid na ndaoine ag reifrinn ar an lá chéanna go luath sa mhí seo chughainn agus sé an cuspóir atá leis an mBille atá á phlé againn anois ná socruithe a dhéanamh chun ráiteas speisialta a eisiúint mar eolas do vótálaithe.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill has dealt fairly fully with the purpose and contents of this measure and it does not appear necessary for me to make a lengthy statement on the matter.  Briefly, the Bill proposes to assist voters at the forthcoming referenda by making available to them a statement relating to the proposals which are the subject of the referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 provides that a special card, containing the statement set out in the appendix to that section must <Col N="677" /> be sent to every elector including postal voters.  The statement will also be displayed in and in the precincts of polling stations and presiding officers will be authorised to assist blind, incapacitated and illiterate voters by reading out this statement to them, where necessary, and asking them whether they wish to vote in favour of or against the proposals and then marking the ballot papers in accordance with the voters' answers.  These arrangements are the same as those made by the Referendum (Amendment) Act, 1968, in relation to the referenda on the Third and Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bills, 1968, and by section 5 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act, 1972, in relation to the referendum on the Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1971.</P>
    <P>Under existing law, the proposal which is the subject of a referendum must be stated on the ballot paper by citing, by its short title, the Bill containing the proposal for amendment of the Constitution passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and the ballot paper may not contain any paraphrase or summary of the proposal. The short title of a Constitution Amendment Bill does not give any real indication of the contents of the Bill and where two referenda are held on the same day, there would be a grave danger that voters would not be able to distinguish between the separate proposals.  In the circumstances I feel the House will agree that there should be a definite statutory arrangement for informing voters of the subject matter of the referenda. The most convenient way of doing this is to include on the polling card to be issued to each voter a statement approved by the Oireachtas in relation to the proposals as has been done in relation to previous constitutional referenda.  Copies of the Bills containing the proposals for the amendment of the Constitution will, of course, be available for inspection free of charge and may be purchased at a cost of two and a half pence at all post offices so that voters can study the actual terms of the proposed amendments.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be a very sloppy and inefficient way to handle referenda, to produce on each occasion that the Dáil and the Seanad are considering an amendment to the Constitution, a separate Referendum Bill which in all cases prescribes the same procedure to set out on a card that will go to each elector the purpose of the Bill.  One is tempted to suggest that we should bring in once and for all a Bill which will become a permanent Act which would prescribe the procedure to be followed in referenda.  It is not unlikely from the discussion we have had here today, and from the general development of thought in the country that we may have a series of referenda in relation to the Constitution and possibly other matters.  It appears to be quite ludicrous to require that in relation to each of these questions we should have a separate Bill which will do no more on each occasion than repeat the procedure which was adopted on a previous occasion.</P>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister why it is considered necessary or desirable to adopt this repetitious procedure instead of having a simple once-for-all remedy to this particular difficulty.  It is perhaps unfortunate that we do not have, in relation to referenda, some machinery whereby parliamentarians could convey to their constituents their views on the issues in the referenda without direct charge to the Members of the Dáil other than, of course, the cost of printing and paper.  It is desirable that there should not be postal charges on such occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge that in a comprehensive Referendum Bill steps be taken to ensure that Members of the Dáil would be able to communicate to their people, who have sent them here to represent them, their views of the particular proposals which are put before the people in referenda.  This Bill does not propose that.  It simply proposes that a summary of the intent of the legislation be spelt out on the card to be sent to each elector. Even the very best efforts to summarise the legislation will still leave the matter incomprehensible to a considerable number of the electorate. <Col N="679" /> That is not for a moment to suggest that the electorate are stupid or illiterate. Quite often matters affecting legal change have to be explained for the sake of accuracy in rather sterile and blunt legal language which may not convey to the electors the import and significance of the proposal.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable, if we are to operate democracy meaningfully, that we have ample communication with the electors.  That becomes particularly necessary in referenda like the two we are now facing where there is not a conflict between the parties and where you are not going to have that type of aggressive debate which means, inevitably, an exchange of views and the development of arguments, not merely between the politicians but through the media, the newspapers, radio and television.</P>
    <P>There is every danger that due to lack of debate, lack of communication of ideas and counter ideas in the few weeks between now and the referenda, we could have a situation in which we could have a small poll.  That would be disastrous, irrespective of the outcome. Even if the two proposals were carried it would be most undesirable that when our people are faced with two decisions they should, by their action, suggest apathy in relation to the proposals.  We urge the Government, even at this late hour, to provide machinery to ensure that there is adequate communication of ideas on the referenda proposals between the elected representatives and the people.</P>
    <P>I see that it is proposed to have ballot papers of different colours on the day of the election.  That will certainly help to reduce confusion.  It would be a mistake if we were to assume that the electors are not capable of differentiating between the questions put to them because we have had occasions in the past when we have more than one matter decided on the one day and our people showed a considerable amount of sophistication and capacity to differentiate between the proposals put to them.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party, subject to these comments, support this Bill as <Col N="680" /> it is apparently necessary.  We would like some explanation as to why it is considered necessary to have an individual Bill for each referendum.  We would also like an assurance from the Minister that we will not have this series of Bills in the future but that we will have a substantial Bill to provide for all future referenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the real possibility that the referendum we are preparing for may fall somewhat flat in that there will be little enthusiasm in the minds of the people actively to participate in the referendum.  The fact that the two proposals meet with the unanimity of all parties, that they are non-contentious, may mean a small vote on the occasion.  It may also mean a lack of real activity on the part of all of us in the different political parties.  It would be a great pity if these important events, such as votes at 18 and the other amendment to our Constitution, which we accepted today were to be seen in that light of apathy and indifference. Anything which the Minister can do to inculcate interest in the referendum will be welcome.</P>
      <P>It is very important that the people should know exactly what they are voting for.  Therefore, the suggestion of a statement in relation to the proposals on the voting card is desirable. The Minister has not indicated to us what the statement will be.  It is presumed it will be done with the concurrence of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope there will be a good turn out on the referendum day. There is a great deal of interest in the referendum especially from people outside the Twenty-six Counties and it would be a reflection on all of us if it turned out to be something in the nature of a damp squib.  I do not want to go into the ramifications of polling generally, but one of the things which has appalled us in relation to elections and referenda in recent times is the number of papers which have been declared invalid by reason of the inactivity of the presiding officers.  The failure of presiding officers to stamp the ballot papers is <Col N="681" /> a matter of amazement to many of us.  If it can be shown that a presiding officer failed in his duty to stamp the ballot papers properly he should not be re-employed for such purposes.</P>
      <P>This is a procedural Bill and I hope that what we are doing here tonight will inculcate interest on the part of all of us, will mean when polling takes place that there will be a good turn out and that a high percentage of our people will record their views on these two important matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the House for the welcome they have given to this short Bill.  As it is fairly clear and concise in form it does not need a lot of explanation but I would like to refer briefly to some of the points raised.  I would express agreement with Deputy Ryan in the point he made, that it does seem somewhat cumbersome that the Minister is obliged to come in each time with a separate amending Bill whenever there is a referendum to authorise the giving of an explanation on the polling card of the questions being asked in the referendum.  I understand that this matter was considered on a previous occasion and that there was some disagreement among the parties as to what authority would decide the exact wording of the explanation.  As Deputies will agree, this may be a very contentious matter depending on the issue to be decided in the referendum. It is not very contentious this time because there is general agreement with the questions and there has been no opposition from any parties in the House.  However, despite that difficulty, I should like to inform the House that I am considering the matter.  However, as this Bill is urgent, I did not have the opportunity to change the situation in the meantime, but on the next occasion on which the House gets an opportunity to deal with electoral law, I propose to introduce some change to eliminate the necessity to come back to the House every time there is a referendum.  That should clear up the point as to why it is necessary to have such a Bill as this each time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> The other point the Deputy made is a good one and I agree with it. This will also be considered for future legislation &mdash; the question of allowing Members of the House or political parties in the House the opportunity of circulating literature to the voters before a referendum in order to give them an opportunity of putting their point of view before the electors.  This facility is available to candidates in a general election and to parties but is not available when a referendum is being held and it is something we could provide.  It may present some difficulties but I am sure they are not insurmountable and I will certainly keep it in mind for future legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure Deputy Treacy that any presiding officer who is deemed to have been incompetent in the manner in which he carried out his functions at a polling booth has not been re-employed.  There were cases even in the last referendum of officers who were negligent in their duties and I can assure him that these people will not be employed again on this occasion.  This has always been the practice.</P>
    <P>Again it might be of interest to the House to mention that on a previous discussion here on a similar Bill, this question of the stamp on the ballot paper, the embossed stamp, being used now was not terribly clear. Some Deputies mentioned this, and particularly the late Deputy Hogan, and I did give an undertaking that at a future election I would experiment with a new system of marking ballot papers.  This would be the use of an instrument which would perforate the ballot paper and I intend carrying out an experiment with the new stamp which will perforate papers in one constituency in the forthcoming referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because I regard it as a very serious matter of principle, as chairman of Louth County Council, and a most serious matter for the ratepayers whom I have the honour to represent and whose interests I have a duty to safeguard. I am aware that the subject matter of this question has been by decision referred to counsel for opinion. I do not regard it as <i>sub judice</i> and I do not think it could, legally or in any normal man's way for looking at it, be regarded as such but I would preface what remarks I want to make now by making it quite clear that what the Minister said today was quite right, that Louth County Council have referred this as a very serious matter for opinion by learned counsel.</P>
      <P>I wish to deal with the reply to the question, which asked the Minister for Health:</P>
      <P>if, in view of the fact that at a conference in his Department on 27th October, 1969, it was indicated that there was no reason why Louth County Council could not dispose of the surplus farm land at Saint Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, County Louth, he will indicate why a different line of action has been taken.</P>
      <P>I refer the House to the first sentence of the Minister's reply in which he said that &ldquo;it was not indicated at the conference referred to that Louth County Council could dispose of surplus land at this hospital&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On 27th October, 1969, a conference was held between representatives of the Meath, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth County Councils and the Minister and his officials.  An official who spoke on that occasion in the Minister's presence had drafted a plan for the health service we now seek to implement.  Paragraph 13 of the minutes of that meeting is entitled &ldquo;Transfer of Assets to Health Boards&rdquo;.  The Minute states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Donegan (Louth) raised the question of the transfer of assets from health authorities to the health board.  He inquired particularly regarding property which was not <Col N="685" /> absolutely for health purposes and instanced the position where a farm attached to a mental hospital was not regarded as essential to the continued functioning of the hospital. Dr. Hensey explained the position in section 35 (1) (a) of the Health Bill whereby property solely for the purposes of the health services would be conserved for the Health Board.  In the case of property not within this definition, it would be a matter for the health authority concerned to decide under section 35 (1) (b) before the transfer took place to the health board whether or not it should be transferred.</P>
    <P>The next sentence is highly important:</P>
    <P>In reply to another query by Deputy Donegan, Dr. Hensey said that the health boards would take over responsibility for the payment of loan charges outstanding in respect of loans raised for the provision of health service facilities.</P>
    <P>I refer now to the third sentence of the Minister's reply.  The Minister realises that I appreciate he is a courteous man and that I mean no discourtesy to him in trying to demolish his answer.  His third sentence was:</P>
    <P>This meant that the county council could retain surplus land, but the question of the financial implications of this did not arise at the conference.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House again to the last sentence in the minute of the conference:</P>
    <P>In reply to another query by Deputy Donegan, Dr. Hensey said that the health boards would take over responsibility for the payment of loan charges outstanding in respect of loans raised for the provision of health service facilities.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I take it that the third sentence of the Minister's reply is incorrect. Quite clearly, Dr. Hensey involved the Minister on that occasion in the financial implications of the payment of loan charges.  I then go on to the question and answer in the final paragraph of the Minister's reply to a question by Deputy Tully on 11th June, 1970.  Deputy Tully had asked <Col N="686" /> if the Minister would state in relation to section 36 (1) (b) of the Health Act, 1970, and in respect of each health authority which had sought ministerial approval to terms for disposal of surplus land, (a) the area of land vested in or owned by each authority, and (b) the area of such land situated within the area of each rating authority concerned on 31st December, 1969.  Deputy Tully also asked the Minister to give an estimate of the value of such land, the value per acre and the area or areas designated to be transferred on the commencement of section 6 of the Act.  I shall give from the Minister's reply the list of health authorities.  According to that reply the Dublin Health Authority had land, so had Donegal County Council, the Longford-Meath-Westmeath Mental Hospital Board, the Leitrim-Sligo Mental Hospital Board and the Galway-Roscommon Hospital Board.  That referred to 11th June, 1970.  Those lands were the subject of correspondence and requests to the Minister.</P>
    <P>At that stage, the position in Louth had been completely cleared because on 27th October, 1969, the only local authority that were really doing their homework were the local authority in County Louth.  A county manager's order No. G. 35/71, signed on 9th March, 1971 by Mr. Patrick Lavin, deputy county manager, stated:</P>
    <P>In pursuance of resolution adopted by the Louth County Council at meeting held on 15th February, 1971, and in accordance with the provisions of section 74 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, it is hereby ordered that the consent of the Minister for Health be sought to the appropriation of approximately 220 acres of land at St. Brigid's Hospital Ardee, for the purposes of the Council's functions as a planning authority.</P>
    <P>The reply of the Minister to Deputy Tully on 11th June, 1970, related to other land.  We did not go into that land; we dealt with our own land in the proper legal manner.</P>
    <P>I now refer the House to the question of whether land not solely for the <Col N="687" /> purpose of health services should be transferred.  I refer to the second sentence of the Minister's reply:</P>
    <P>What was said was that the council need not transfer to the health board property which was not solely for the purposes of health services.</P>
    <P>On 21st June, 1972, the county secretary for Louth, Mr. Patrick Lavin, addressed a letter to each member of the Louth County Council and I shall quote the first part of that letter:</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the County Manager to forward for your information the attached copy of letter from the Department of Health to the Chief Executive Officer, North Eastern Health Board, dealing with the question of the transfer of surplus lands at St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee.</P>
    <P>In connection with this letter, the County Manager has asked me to draw attention to the following points&mdash;</P>
    <P>1. It is the view of the Resident Medical Superintendent that only 80 acres are required solely for health purposes.</P>
    <P>Now I wish to draw the attention of the House to a certain situation which is unlike any other situation in Ireland. The predecessor to Dr. O'Connor, who was the predecessor to the present RMS, Dr. Jim Wilson, was Dr. Patrick Moran.  Older members of this House will remember him as the first joint president of Macra na Feirme.  At a time when custodial medicine in the psychiatric field was perhaps more prominent than it should have been, Dr. Moran approached things in a different light. He brought patients who could be rehabilitated by going out and doing some work and enjoying themselves in the process, on to the farm.  I will be dealing with this later.  With the backing of Louth County Council, farms were bought far in excess of the need for such treatment of patients at a time when modern drugs were not available as they are now.</P>
    <P>As things progressed, and after Dr. <Col N="688" /> Moran had resigned, modern drugs such as tranquillisers became available in psychiatric medicine and the matter of having patients working on farms did not arise to the same degree as earlier.</P>
    <P>Dr. O'Connor took up appointment and set up clinics in the various towns. This resulted in many patients being discharged from hospital.  Consequently, there was no need for this large amount of land which the Louth County Council wished to keep and which was paid for by the Louth ratepayers.</P>
    <P>The second sentence of the Minister's reply says that what was said was that the council need not transfer to the health board property that was solely for the purpose of the health services.  This other land is not necessary for the health services.  I have quoted already from the report of Dr. Wilson in which he says he does not require the land.  There is no precedent in so far as this case is concerned because there is no other parcel of land surrounded by the same circumstances.  We acted in time before the health boards took over.</P>
    <P>I have here also, a letter, reference L 192 of the 11th July, 1972.  This was sent from the Department of Health to the secretary of Louth County Council.  It is stated in this letter that it would not be feasible for the Minister to make an exception in the case of one authority and that he regrets, therefore, that there would be no point in his receiving a deputation to discuss the position at Ardee. So far as we are concerned we have acted properly and legally.  In another letter from the Department dated 29 March, 1971, it is stated:</P>
    <P>The Minister will raise no objection in principle to the proposal to appropriate approximately 220 acres of Mental Hospital land.  In the event however, of a credit not being made to the Mental Hospital account equivalent to the value of the property as may be approved by the Minister following consultation with the Commissioner of Valuation, the matter will be taken into account in the context of Section 32 of the Health Act, 1970, &mdash;<i>vide</i> reply <Col N="689" /> to Parliamentary Question of 11th June, 1970, copy attached.</P>
    <P>Have I not proved conclusively that the reply given to Deputy Tully's question is entirely irrelevant in so far as this parcel of land is concerned?  There is no question of the land being required for modern psychiatric medicine. If in the past the then resident medical superintendent, Dr. Paddy Moran, approached Louth County Council, who were the health authority, and requested that more land be provided for his patients that was in order but we made our inquiries and we got our answers.  As chairman of the county council it is my duty to endeavour to put this land back into the hands of the ratepayers.  Each ratepayer in County Louth is entitled to receive whatever alleviations or improvements in services that it may be possible to give.</P>
    <P>I am now 49 years old and I represent the third generation of my family in local politics in County Louth.  My grandfather was chairman of the Board of Guardians, my father was a member of Louth County Council and I took over from him, but before ever going into politics I remember discussion of the question as to whether this land should be purchased, as to whether it was proper to put this charge on the ratepayers of County Louth.  On many occasions I heard my father discuss the matter not only with members of his own party but with Deputy Larry Walsh and others of the Fianna Fáil Party as well as with members of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>From the day that Dr. O'Connor took over from Dr. Moran there has never been any question of these lands being required in so far as psychiatric medicine is concerned.  In the few minutes left to me, I shall indicate what these lands were used for.  The day when patients worked on the land and had their lunch in a cottage on the land has gone for the past 15 years.  We might ask if the buildings on the lands have any relevance in so far as matters of health are concerned, or so far as profit or advantage to the ratepayers are concerned. To find the answer I shall quote from a letter dated 1st June, 1971.  It was <Col N="690" /> sent from Mr. W. Whately of St. Brigid's Hospital, Ardee, to the secretary of Louth County Council:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>The following is a list of the buildings on the lands being appropriated by the County Council:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Hale Street</i>&mdash; Land steward's house; slaughter house and pig sheds; pig shed for young pigs; farrowing shed; pig shed and loft&mdash; old land steward's house; shed for bull; corn store, grain drier, hammer mill and loft; calf stalls&mdash; shed for three; cattle shed for 35 cattle; open front cattle shed; piggery; cottage used as diningroom for patients.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Curraghbeg</i>&mdash;Open cattle shelter; dining-hall for patients; Nissen hut potato store; two potato sheds; machinery shed; poultry house; roofed silo pit; milking parlour; Nissen hut&mdash;cattle shed; three Nissen huts&mdash;baled straw; shed with two calf stalls; shed with three calf stalls.</P>
    <P>Can those buildings be related to health?  Have I not succeeded in demolishing the line taken by the Minister for Health?  Can anybody say now that the ratepayers of County Louth are not entitled to this land?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that counsel is acting on behalf of Louth County Council and therefore, I do not propose to go further than to refer to correspondence that was entered into between Louth County Council and myself. I would refer Deputy Donegan to a letter addressed to the CEO of the North-Eastern Health Board and dated 28th February, 1972, and to a further letter addressed to the CEO of the North-Eastern Health Board on the 31st May.  In that letter there is a sentence which says that the Minister desires to state the underlying principle involved in his decision, that any capital assets of the regional health boards no longer required should, in the Minister's view, be sold and the moneys derived from the sale utilised to finance capital projects of the particular board including hospitals, <Col N="691" /> homes for the aged, health centres, clinics, <i>et cetera</i>.  It was stated that prior to the coming into force of the Health Act, 1970, any moneys derived by health authorities, including county councils, from the sale of capital assets were devoted to health projects such as those mentioned above. There was no question of such moneys being devoted to housing, roads, or other non-health purposes. It was stated that the Minister saw no good reason why there should be any change in policy consequent on the Health Act, 1970.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wrote to the secretary of the Louth County Council on 19th July, 1972, and I repeated what I had said. I emphasised still more the question of precedent.  I said that, as was indicated in the Department's letter of <Col N="692" /> 31st May, it was the practice even before the coming into operation of the Health Act, 1970, that moneys derived by health authorities, including county councils, from the sale of land were used to finance capital projects such as the provision of hospitals, homes for the aged, health centres, clinics and so on.  I pointed out there was no question of utilising these moneys for non-health purposes. It would not be feasible for me to make an exception in the case of one authority and there would be no point in receiving a deputation to discuss the position at Ardee.  I wrote a further letter on 20th October, 1972. That is all I have to state in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 3rd November, 1972.</P>

      <P>This proposal was adopted by the Community in Regulation 609/72 of 23rd March, 1972, the text of which is available in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The Regulation extends Regulation 1059/69, which set up a Community trade system for certain processed agricultural products, by providing that when levies, charges or other measures are in force in respect of exports of a basic product, the Commission may, under certain conditions, apply appropriate measures to exports of processed products containing a high content of the basic product concerned. This helps to ensure supplies within the Community when, because of a shortage situation for a basic product on the world market, there may be a tendency to large scale exportation of processed products containing that product.</P>

The position is, however, that the vast majority of all the teachers in these schools are either registered teachers or probationer teachers awaiting registration.</P>
