      <P>I am afraid that you are mistaken when you say &ldquo;by agreement&rdquo;.  There was no agreement by this party that 3 o'clock would be the finishing time for any Stage.  We made it quite clear to the House yesterday and yesterday evening I informed Deputy Browne, acting on behalf of the Whip, that we would not agree to any time limit.</P>

      <P>May I say that I have a distinct recollection of you, Sir, saying yesterday that all Stages of this Bill were to be completed by 3 p.m.?  I heard you put the question, &ldquo;Is that agreed?&rdquo;  I think an order was so made by the House.</P>

      <P>I have here an extract from the unrevised Report and it says that you, at the end of the debate yesterday, used the following words:</P>
      <P>The Committee Stage to be taken at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning and the Bill to conclude before 3 o'clock.</P>
      <P>These are your words, Sir, as recorded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>May I make a comment? Deputy Crowley is the last person who should talk about dirt here in the House.  My recollection, and I think my hearing is as good as that of anybody else in the House, is that yesterday it was agreed that the Bill would be taken today.  The Taoiseach definitely was insistent that it should be taken yesterday and then he agreed eventually to the Second Stage being taken yesterday and the rest to be taken today. I did not at any stage hear a reference being made to 3 p.m.  I am surprised to find that it does appear in the record.  I was here all the time.  If somebody else heard it, then I must be at fault, but I certainly did not hear it.  I would suggest, since agreement has been made that we finish the Bill today, that we finish today, not at 3 p.m.  In fairness to everybody.  Deputy Corish did say that we were not going to filibuster.  We were not going to hold it up, but we want an honest debate on it.  There are points we want to get clarified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it could be regarded as an order of the House. Times for debates are usually arranged between the Whips and there was no arrangement between the Whips.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But there was no order of the House at all.  There was a mumble.  As a matter of fact, last night the Ceann Comhairle announced that we were resuming at 10.30 this morning.  Was that an order of the House, because we are here now at 10.07?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach says it is an order of the House, surely the Taoiseach knows that anything this House agrees to supersedes anything else?  So, if the Taoiseach is not persistent in this conflict, we can now agree that 3 o'clock does not apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>My hearing is very good.  It was agreed here yesterday that we sit at 10 o'clock this morning and that we finish the Bill at 3 o'clock and the Taoiseach accepted that in good faith.  I was listening to this.  If there is any quibbling on my left here, they are quibbling all their lives and it is nothing new that they should be quibbling this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that I left this House yesterday at about 4.15 p.m. under the clear impression that the order had been made and agreed to by the House.  There is no equivocation about <Col N="196" /> that.  It was stated in the newspapers this morning that the order was so made, that the Bill would be introduced into the Seanad at 3 o'clock.  I am not relying on the newspapers but since people suggest that they did not hear what was going on, apparently newspaper reporters heard it and so recorded it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not relying on it.  I am relying on what I heard the Ceann Comhairle say, what is written in the unrevised record of this House, written by the stenographer who was here at the time.  That was as clear as could be.  There is nobody in any doubt that we want that Bill into the Seanad today and passed today.</P>

      <P>Can the Deputy talk for the whole party?  I do not know who talks for it.  Sir, I want to say again that I came yesterday into the House indicating the urgency of this Bill, requesting the co-operation of the House and having in mind the passage of all Stages of the Bill yesterday. <Col N="197" /> I yielded to the Labour Party's appeal to give a little more time.  I yielded on the basis that I understood them then to agree to conclude the Bill at 3 o'clock today.  If I had not got that agreement I would have pressed my original motion to a division in the House.  I did not do so because I understood from the Labour Party that they were agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see any advantage in prolonging this, seeing that the Taoiseach is insisting on its going through.  The fact that the Taoiseach came in with an extract from the official record&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think I am entitled to anticipate the type of query you brought up here this morning.  It was entirely my responsibility.  The Taoiseach did not know anything about it until I brought it to his attention about a minute past 10 o'clock.  I extracted this particular quotation from the Record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and to substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) This section shall continue in operation until the 31st day of May, 1974, or such later date (if any) as may for the time being stand specified by resolution of Dáil Éireann passed at a time when this section is in operation and it shall then expire.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment would continue this section, which is the chief section of the Bill, in operation until the 31st May, 1974, which is marginally over two years, or such later date, if any, as may for the time being stand specified by resolution of Dáil Éireann passed at a time when the section is in operation and it shall then expire.  The purpose of the words &ldquo;passed at a time when the section is in operation&rdquo; is to prevent its being reactivated at some vague future date.  If it were to be continued after the 31st May, 1974 it could only be continued by a resolution passed in the first instance before the 31st May, 1974.  Whether or not such a resolution would be moved would, of course, depend on what the circumstances were at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied, having considered the <Col N="199" /> matter overnight, that this period of two years is the minimum period which in all the circumstances it would be reasonable to keep this section in operation for.  One of the factors involved is the rebuilding of Mountjoy Prison, in particular rebuilding it from a security and rehabilitative point of view.  I described in some detail yesterday the damage which was done but from the point of view of long-term repair the most significant part of that damage is the damage to the roofs. That is particularly extensive and it is a long arduous and difficult job to repair these roofs.  All four roofs of the prison, that is the roof of each wing of the prison, are damaged to a greater or lesser extent.  It is unfortunate that these roofs were in fact renewed within the last year or two.</P>
    <P>We have discovered, as a result of that rebuilding, and in particular as a result of the riot on Thursday night last that the most vulnerable part of the prison from the security point of view is the roof of each wing.  Mountjoy, as you know, was built approximately 100 years ago.  The roof structure is such that it is possible for a prisoner on getting out of his cell and climbing up the wire, which surrounds the upper corridors of each wing, to get into the inner roof space above the top flight of cells but not on the roof proper and having got in there he can very easily break out through the roof and then climb up on to the top of it.</P>
    <P>We will never have proper security while that type of roof remains and for that reason it will be necessary to put a flat roof on each of the four wings.  Unless we are to close the prison altogether only one of the wings can be re-roofed at a time.  It will take several months at least for a contractor to do each wing.  This means that at least a quarter of the prison must be out of operation at any given time over a period approaching two years. In practice more than a quarter of the prison will be out of operation because if, for example, the hospital wing of the prison were being re-roofed it would be necessary to establish a hospital in one of the other wings.  Therefore, that wing being out <Col N="200" /> of commission, the effective accommodation available would be half of what the total accommodation would be.</P>
    <P>I might mention that it is, of course, proposed to move the hospital out of the cell blocks altogether into what is now the officers' quarters in the grounds of the prison.  I understand that work has, in fact, commenced on the building of the new officers' quarters immediately outside the wall on what, I think, is called the Glengarriff Parade side of the prison.  When those officers' quarters have been completed it will be possible to start building a new hospital in the existing officers' quarters block, which is separate from the main building.  Taking all these factors into account and also, of course, taking into account the general disturbed state of this country north and south, and the unfortunate likelihood that we are going to have to hold in custody prisoners of a particularly dangerous kind for the next two years at least.  I think the time limit which I propose in this amendment in response to suggestions and urgings from the Opposition, is the minimum time limit that is compatible with all the factors that are involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to see that the Minister is prepared to accept the principle of the time limit for this particular Bill.  That is entirely logical with the need for the Bill as expressed by him when dealing with it on the Second Stage.  It is a temporary Bill because there is a crisis in Mountjoy. The position now resolves itself into deciding whether the time in the amendment and the other powers in the amendment are compatible with that predicament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We on this side of the House do not know how much damage was done at Mountjoy.  We take it from what the Minister says that it is substantial and will obviously take considerable time to put in order.  There is not a lot of difference between the Minister's amendment and amendment No. 2 but there is a fairly substantial difference with regard to time between those amendments and amendment No. 22.  If the Minister could indicate <Col N="201" /> that the work in Mountjoy would be something more than just repair of what has been damaged, if this opportunity could be used for a general rebuilding or reorganisation of Mountjoy, then it would be easier for us on this side of the House to agree to a period as long as the 31st May.  It is common knowledge, as the Minister says, as Mountjoy is such an old building that it is not really suitable for the rehabilitative end of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Up to now I understand there has never been money to do anything with it on any large scale.  Circumstances now force something to be done and if what is to be done was to be fairly drastic we would be more inclined to go along with the 31st of May but if it is just going to be ordinary rebuilding and repair of the damage it is difficult to see why this could not be done by the 1st September, 1973.</P>
    <P>Our motive in drafting the amendment as drafted was to ensure that there is a final termination date and the subsidiary clause in our amendment is to give power to the House to terminate this Bill at an earlier date. It recognises the temporary nature of the Bill and the temporary necessity for it.  The Minister's amendment, on the other hand, allows the Bill to continue for two years which seems excessively long for a rebuilding job.  It also has in it the subsidiary clause that it can go even longer than that if the House passes a resolution requiring it to go longer.  To my mind that, in effect, means that the Minister is asking the House for an open cheque in relation to how long this Bill shall continue.  I think he should completely recognise the principle he has partly recognised and agree to an actual final termination.  With regard to the other State agencies that will have to be involved in the carrying out of this building work I think it would be of considerable assistance and would strengthen the Minister's hand if he could say: &ldquo;This work has to be finished by the 1st of September, 1973.  That is as long as the temporary Bill is in operation.&rdquo;  This could assist in the work being expedited.  I would suggest to the Minister that there should be a final date set out in the <Col N="202" /> Bill so that we would all know where we stand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's amendment instead of alleviating the worst fears of many people regarding this Bill has confirmed them.  It now appears that, if the Minister's amendment succeeds, this Bill will be in existence for far longer than many of us thought it would be when it was introduced yesterday and, indeed, far longer than the Minister indicated in his introductory speech.  He said yesterday that the necessary repairs and alterations would take at least 12 months.  When that becomes at least two years, as it does in this amendment, we must express some further reservations about the Bill.  Essentially it is a Bill brought in as a result of damage done in Mountjoy Prison and it should, therefore, only cover what we consider a reasonable period in which to have the necessary works carried out.  I cannot see why the necessary works could not be carried out within the period specified in amendment No. 22.  With modern methods of construction a complete new prison could be built within the period the Minister wants and, indeed, within a period of 12 months. We have seen major buildings go up in this city and in the country within a 12 month period.</P>
      <P>The other reason given for the introduction of this Bill yesterday was that it would take a certain period to recruit and to train prison staff.  I maintain this could be done within a matter of six to eight weeks.  People could be recruited and given the basic training to become prison warders in that period.  The Minister's amendment clarifies his intentions in the matter and, indeed, confirms the worst fears of those who have reservations about this Bill.  There is another way of ensuring that the necessity for this extra prison capacity over the next two years need not arise and that is by dealing more quickly with cases that come before the courts.  This would result in the absence of the necessity to keep prisoners on remand for long periods and to bring in what is now being called, with some justification, this form of internment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal with the personal <Col N="203" /> attack which the Minister made on me last night.  He made it on two fronts, the first being that I was not here yesterday as spokesman on Justice for the Labour Party.  I note that the Minister recognises me as spokesman on Justice for this party.  If he does so I do not know why he or any of his officials did not make any attempt to inform me of this measure either on Monday or Tuesday.  Due to a bereavement in the family I was attending a funeral on Monday evening.  On Tuesday I was attending meetings and was away from home and I did not get word about this provision until 6 o'clock yesterday evening when I was about 80 miles from this House.  I was here at 8.30 last night.  The Minister's trying to read into my absence from the House in the early part of yesterday evening some sinister motive just underlines his ineptness in trying to justify certain provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was one of those who supported the Second Stage last night because I felt there was some justification for the basic principle of a Bill that would provide for the few months that we feel should elapse while Mountjoy is being repaired and while the recruitment of additional staff is being carried out.  That is as far as I am prepared to support this Bill, just to cover that emergency period.  I have put down these amendments in order to take out of the Bill the elements in it which go far beyond the present necessity for taking care of the aftermath of the destruction of Mountjoy. I would ask the House to support amendments Nos. 3 and 22.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support amendment No. 2 in particular. When I spoke in the debate yesterday evening I was critical of the fact that the Minister seemed to indicate a fairly long period to carry out the reconstruction and repair work necessary in Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill yesterday he told the House he was faced with an emergency, that there was a critical situation and that he expected the support of the Opposition <Col N="204" /> parties for this legislation.  Having regard to the duration of the legislation suggested by the Minister this morning, I have considerable fears that if the Minister gets this legislation he will sit back and let it continue for as long as it suits him.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to understand that we are not prepared to accept this kind of attitude.  The Minister and his party have many friends in the building trade and there are single firms in this city who are building more than a house per day, that is 365 houses per year.  If the Government cannot get sufficient co-operation and assistance in an emergency from their friends in the building trade to do the reconstruction work in Mountjoy in 12 months it is obvious that something has gone wrong with Fianna Fáil.  They have stressed here that they have an emergency on their hands; we do not want them to forget that tomorrow or the following day.</P>
    <P>There are very serious objections to having a civil prison within a military establishment.  First, it is not the kind of work in which the Army want to engage.  I said yesterday that it is only because of their loyalty during the years that makes them undertake this kind of job.  Apart altogether from that, the accommodation in the Curragh is deplorable.  It was not being used and, consequently, it was allowed to become run down.  I visited the Curragh last year and I know the circumstances; only the inner compound is usable at the moment, the exercise ground is not usable.</P>
    <P>All responsible people want to support the Government but they do not want the Government to sit back and disregard the emergency nature of this legislation.  We want the Government to decide who are their friends in the building trade and who will carry out this repair work in the shortest possible time.  The Government should not think that once they have got the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas that they can take their time and use this excuse to see what they can do in their own time and when they have the money to reconstruct completely Mountjoy Prison.  I should hate the Government <Col N="205" /> to adopt this kind of attitude but having regard to the Minister's statement that this legislation will continue until 31st May, 1974, I am afraid that this is the attitude the Government are adopting.  I am completely opposed to this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">

      <P>The amendment proposed by the Minister indicates that he requires two years presumably to carry out necessary repair work to Mountjoy Prison.  If that is so, the damage must be extensive and costly and part of the building must be reduced to a heap of rubble.  We do not know because we did not get any estimate of the cost of repairs, neither did we get a clear-cut picture of the nature and extent of the damage.  The only thing we know is that in the Minister's view it is likely to take two years to carry out the repair work.</P>
      <P>It is a serious reflection on the Minister, his Department and on the Government, that in our capital city and in our main prison a group of people could take over the premises and destroy it.  The prison housed a number of prisoners who were agitating to obtain freedom by any means.  Surely it did not require much foresight on the part of the authorities or the Minister to realise that there was a likelihood of a riot taking place in the prison&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Although the press have stated that I did not vote the House has the record that I voted on this measure last night.  I do not shirk responsibilities. <Col N="206" /> It is not my role to abstain on votes when I am present in the House and I am sure the Clerk of the Dáil has the necessary record.  I do not know how the newsmen got it into their heads that I was not here and why they gave it publicity.  I voted in favour of the measure because I think a measure like this is necessary.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated it will take two years to rectify the damage that has been caused to Mountjoy Prison&mdash;at least that is the implication in his statement.  According to the Minister the period of one year which was mentioned yesterday is insufficient and it is more likely that it will take two years.  I maintain it is relevant to discuss this on Committee Stage.  The Minister's view is that it is likely to take two years to repair the damage. Fine Gael say it should be 15 months. We reduced that to three or four months, and I am worried about what steps were taken&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am making a statement on the amendments before the House.  Of course I do not want to make an issue of it with the Chair, whose ruling is absolute, but the main issue behind the amendments is the period of time it will take to restore Mountjoy Prison.  Some people feel the damage could be repaired in six months, Fine Gael say 15 months and <Col N="207" /> the Minister says two years.  On the assumption that the Minister has more information at his disposal than the Opposition have, my claim is that the nature of the damage must be exceptional.  Therefore, it is not unreasonable to go into the cause of the damage.</P>

When I was interrupted earlier I was about to say that because of the time limit last night I was unable to contribute to the Second Reading of the Bill and I felt that the amendments today would give an opportunity to those of us who did not get it yesterday. I will conclude by repeating that I supported this measure last night. I voted for it and newspaper reports that I did not do so are erroneous.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the Minister's amendment.  He is in a better position to judge the state of Mountjoy Prison.  Deputy Cooney appreciated this to a certain extent.  He has the reputation of being a responsible person and I think he is behaving responsibly now.  There is a period of nine months difference between Fine Gael and the Minister.  If I were Shadow Minister for Justice in Fine Gael I would have gone to Mountjoy Prison to survey the extent of the damage.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister would have arranged it for any member of Fine Gael who wanted to go to Mountjoy to survey the damage, if they had asked him last night.  I doubt if any member of Fine Gael asked him. The extent of the repairs and the kind of repairs are the two matters of importance here.  There is the question of the structural changes which may be necessary to a building more than 100 <Col N="208" /> years old and if we are to spend a lot of money on repairs, let us spend the money well and do a proper job while we are at it.</P>
      <P>The Minister said it would be necessary to have a flat roof rather than the existing one.  This will take a certain amount of planning, drawings, <i>et cetera</i>.  Therefore, I urge Fine Gael to accept the Minister's amendment on the basis that he has sources of information as to the length of time necessary to do a proper job.  I would ignore the Labour Party amendment because they do not want this Bill at all.  No matter how much they may endeavour to argue among themselves, it is obvious that they are playing a middle of the road game to pacify some of their members.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure how we are to establish the result of that particular wager.  Deputy Briscoe's final remarks were not relevant to the amendments or appropriate at this stage and they would have been better not said.  On the amendments, we have a problem.  The Minister told us yesterday it would take a year to repair the prison.  He now tells us, through the formal wording of the amendment, that it would take two years or more. I did not understand from his opening speech yesterday that there is justification for this two year period.  If by taking a longer time we could produce radical improvements in the structure of the prison which would make it a place in which there could be rehabilitative effects for the prisoners, one would be prepared to consider the Minister's amendment without suspicion, but we have not had any adequate assurances on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indeed, his amendment makes provision for more than two years but not for less.  If the Minister was right yesterday, the prison could be ready in a <Col N="209" /> year.  We accept there might be a dispute or a strike and that work might be delayed, and the Minister's amendment might be acceptable if he had not added &ldquo;or more&rdquo;.  As it is, the amendment is unacceptable but we might get somewhere on it if we had assurances on a number of things. First of all, could we get a guarantee that radical improvements will be made in the prison?  All of us had a letter this morning from the Reverend Father Byrne, the head Catholic chaplain in Mountjoy, who read a paper recently on penal treatment.  He makes reference to improving the prison and to restoring it possibly to its earlier futility at great expense.  He went on to add other relevant questions such as:</P>
    <P>Do you know that the reason given for failure to develop remedial services in the past was said to be shortage of money?</P>
    <P>I must say that plea has influenced me.  We are willing to consider a somewhat longer period if there is a guarantee there will be radical improvements in the prison, making it a different kind of prison altogether.  If that is so, then there is a case for a longer period.  If the Minister cannot give us that assurance then there are no grounds for agreeing to a period twice or more as long as the period the Minister himself said yesterday was necessary.  First of all, I want to ask the Minister if he can tell us that there will be radical improvements and that the intention is to change the whole character of the prison and to make it more a centre of rehabilitation. I am anxious to have the Minister's attention on these points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Our acceptance of a form of amendment similar to what is here depends on the Minister's response on these issues.  First of all, can he guarantee us that there will be radical improvements in the character of the prison?  Secondly, will he be willing to agree that Members of the Oireachtas can satisfy themselves of that by being given a consultative role and being consulted during the <Col N="210" /> planning and carrying out of these improvements so that we can satisfy ourselves that the work will radically transform the prison and as to the pace of the work so that there will be no unnecessary hold-ups in the work or no slow-downs because of any Government policy that might involve wishing to keep prisoners in military custody?</P>
      <P>Thirdly, it will, of course, be essential to delete from the amendment as at present drafted the word &ldquo;later&rdquo;, which confines action by Dáil Éireann to an extension of the period of two years and makes it impossible for us to shorten it.  I wish to point out that in suggesting that deletion I am very much in the spirit of the Bill as originally drafted, which left it open to the Dáil to act at any time and did not prevent the Dáil from acting in the first two years which is the effect of the amendment as at present granted.</P>
      <P>If the Minister can give us a guarantee of radical improvements, and if he can give us, also, a guarantee that we will be allowed to satisfy ourselves that the plans involve such improvements, and that they are being carried out with due expedition, and if he is agreeable to delete the word &ldquo;later&rdquo; so as to enable the Dáil if it is dissatisfied with the plans or with the progress, and if it feels that the job can be done more quickly, to move by resolution that the section of the Bill be terminated at an earlier date, we will be prepared to consider his amendment in this revised form.  If that is not the case, if he is simply throwing in another year for good measure, and giving himself power to extend it beyond that, and if there is no intention to improve the building radically, it will be impossible for us to support the amendment as drafted in its present form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The marked reluctance or unwillingness of the Minister to concede this reasonable request from the Opposition for a reasonable period of time, together with other safeguards which would make clear the intention to terminate this measure, confirms in the minds of many of us the fears we <Col N="211" /> harboured concerning this proposal. The Bill now appears to be of a permanent nature by power the Minister is taking under this section.  It has already been said that there are portents of danger in this measure and sinister connotations, that to all intent and purposes it represents internment in disguise.  It is now taking on all these ugly appearances.</P>
      <P>It is absurd to suggest that it would take two years to renovate and repair Mountjoy.  If the Minister were serious about restoring Mountjoy and providing proper accommodation, he could have impressed upon the Office of Public Works that they should engage upon a crash programme to carry out such repairs.  Clearly he has not done that.  He could have utilised the space in the other jails.  He could have availed himself of alternative accommodation which many of us believe is readily available in this city and in many other parts of the country.  It seems to me, therefore, that the Minister is using this section, and using the wrecking of Mountjoy, to take upon himself additional powers, powers which may turn out to be of a very repressive nature which this House does not wish to give him.</P>
      <P>We believe that six months should be adequate to have the necessary repairs carried out especially in circumstances in which fundamental human rights are involved and the legal system as we know it, in that the prisoners&mdash;and there are not many; some 40 or 50&mdash;are not being transferred to another jail as such under the aegis of the Minister for Justice and the prison system as we know it, but are being transferred to military custody.  They are being transferred to the Curragh Camp.  They are being transferred to Tintown with all its sinister and repressive connotations.  It is a serious matter that we are giving responsibility to the Minister for Defence and placing these prisoners under the charge of the military.  Here is where the negation of justice and democracy enters into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister let the cat out of the bag somewhat this morning when he <Col N="212" /> talked about the state of the country and the need to hold certain classes of criminals for an indefinite period of time, or words to that effect.  I am very fearful of this measure.  I believe the Minister is bringing into this House internment, and internment without trial if necessary, because most of these men are being kept on remand indefinitely.  This has all the sinister implications of a Bill of a long-term nature which will be used by the Government to intern whom they like, when they like, where they like, for indefinite periods of time.</P>
    <P>This is what the Government have wanted in recent years.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice are known to want internment.  They flew many a kite on this subject and they were shot down on each occasion by an outcry of public indignation.  We all saw what internment without trial brought about in North-East Ulster.  I would ask the Minister to hesitate on the brink of the implementation of this measure lest it might bring about like tragic repercussions in this part of Ireland as well.  We are not ungrateful for the intention to include a specific period of time in the measure but we in this party suggest six months.  We believe that is adequate for the purpose of restoring Mountjoy.  If this is not conceded we can only conclude that the longer period of time and the openended nature of the section which the Minister has introduced have an ulterior motive.  I have already spelled out the ulterior motive: internment in another guise.</P>
    <P>I believe that the House is being used and abused in being asked to condone and support this measure involving internment without trial, the use of the military, and the utilisation of the Curragh Camp which bring up so many sad memories in the minds of many people and have been responsible for the scars on many minds and hearts in the recent past.  I oppose outrightly any suggestion of a period of time longer than that necessary to restore Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were sincere he could utilise the services of the Office of Public Works, the NBA and the <Col N="213" /> large building contractors in this city who can build high-rise skyscrapers and massive office blocks in a relatively short period of time.  There is no justification, in my opinion, for seeking a two-year period for this purpose. Therefore I must look with the utmost suspicion and distrust on this measure. I am more convinced this morning than ever before that I did the right thing in the interests of democracy, in the interests of fundamental rights and in the interests of the maintenance of our legal system and the separation of the judiciary from the Executive, in going into the Lobby with a few of my colleagues in the small hours of this morning and voting against this sinister measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. J. Lenehan Mr. J. Lenehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lenehan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had some very interesting talk here for the past half-hour but if anybody here is so simple as to ask me to believe that Mountjoy is going to be repaired in 12 months, he must be very innocent indeed if he believes that these building contractors who build these places so quickly are prepared to do that work, considering that it took 12 years to repair this House and it was an urgent task.  I know what Dublin contractors are.  They build these places and let, sub-let or get rid of them to the Government or to somebody else at colossal prices but ask them to repair Mountjoy and we will see.  In my view, this section will have to be repeated in 1974 instead of being deleted now as is sought.  I do not believe it will be repaired on the date mentioned by the Minister.  I admit that if you got the paint brigade who dealt with O'Connell Bridge and various bridges around the country in the past month, they might do something with it but certainly not Dublin contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see how it will be repaired by that date and I believe that most of the people here who have made speeches have made them merely for the sake of being anti-something.  I do not want to see anybody locked up anywhere, and if I happened to be Minister for Justice, I would employ somebody to blow up Mountjoy because any place connected with a crowd like the Mountjoys should not <Col N="214" /> be in the country.  They should get some Irish or some other name for it.  I presume it is called after Lord Mountjoy and it is a nice tribute to us if we have to lock our people up under Lord Mountjoy.  A good many of us are getting a bit sick of this.  I am supporting the Minister on the time limit because I know Dublin contractors.  In many cases houses and other buildings have to be gone over again within a month of going up.  I saw a firm in my hotel painting with the doors closed and when the doors were opened it was found that they had to get another firm to do the job again.  They were probably the crowd who were on the bridges during the Referendum.</P>
    <P>It is doubtful if this section or any of the amendments will be relevant at all because if we are going to enter EEC I doubt if this Bill will have any validity.  I do not think there is any such legislation in any of the Common Market countries and, if that is so, the Bill will become totally irrelevant early next year anyhow, so that there is not much point in disputing the Minister's attitude at this stage.  The real reason I am not opposing it is that I personally do not believe that Mountjoy Prison will be properly repaired within two years.  I cannot see it being done and knowing the kind of contractors we have, whom I have seen operating around the city and elsewhere, I am quite convinced that what I am saying is right.</P>

      <P>It is Christian charity to defend Deputies and Ministers on this side of the House who are smeared.  Not one member of my party from the Taoiseach down wishes to see anybody in jail, to have any trouble in the country, to do anything in an undemocratic way, but we hear about the sinister motives of the <Col N="216" /> Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;this tripe we have to listen to here and with which I am fed up.  This is our country and anything we can do it is our right to do to defend the right of every free man to walk the streets of Dublin or any other city, county or parish in this country.</P>
      <P>When we try to have law and order maintained we are accused of having sinister motives.  It is time the people realised the type of representatives they are sending to this House.  I shall not refer to anyone in particular, and I wish everyone well, but from the national point of view it is about time that we should stand up and be counted. Do we or do we not want law and order?  This Bill is forced on our party and on the Minister for Justice by people who want to tear down this democracy that has been built up during the years.  Again, we are told that the Minister has sinister motives in asking for a little time to have Mountjoy Jail repaired.  The rehabilitation of prisoners has been going on successfully at Mountjoy and I have sufficient confidence in the Minister for Justice to believe that as soon as the prison is repaired, that rehabilitation work will be continued.</P>

      <P>We are discussing the nature of the duration of a time limit that might be put on this legislation. It will be recalled that yesterday evening the Minister agreed in principle to move an amendment this morning incorporating a time limit on legislation.  The real debate is as to whether his proposal or our proposal or the proposal of the Labour Party is adequate in the view of this House but in this discussion it is quite clear that the real purpose of the Bill has come into debate.  I want to make it clear this morning on behalf of this party, as I made it clear yesterday also, that we accepted the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government as expressed by the Minister for Justice and that when the Minister stated that this was a piece of legislation designed merely to deal with a crisis situation created by the unfortunate rioting in Mountjoy on Thursday last, that was accepted by us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that <Col N="217" /> this is not so and that in fact this is a curtain-raiser to some kind of military detention in military camps or barracks or internment camps for people who seek to act outside the law.  If that is the Government's intention I would expect them to put that forward clearly in this House so that it could be considered honestly and objectively by all the Deputies here. If we are going to discuss that problem let us do it openly and honestly and with full regard to our responsibility as Members of this House and as citizens.</P>
    <P>I do not like humbug and I do not tolerate hypocrisy.  I want to know clearly where are we going.  Is this legislation designed for the purpose mentioned yesterday by the Minister? Is that purely the motive which brought it about or is it, as has been suggested clearly by commentators in the newspapers this morning, a Lynchian way of making a virtue out of a necessity and of inching towards another purpose?  I expect a clear statement from the Government on this because I observe in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning, under a most unlikely heading, a rather significant remark in relation to this Bill.  The heading is: &ldquo;Childers Denies Leaving in Huff.&rdquo;  There is a story with reference to the Minister for Health having to leave a meeting in the Hibernian Hotel some minutes after 4 p.m. yesterday without having been called on to speak and the question was whether he was angry because he was not recognised or whether he had to leave for another reason.  The Minister is reported as explaining his leaving in these terms:</P>
    <P>I told the committee that I would be late.  Then I had to leave before 4 o'clock in case the first reading of the Curragh detention Bill took place in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Can we have an explanation of that? Is this a Curragh detention Bill as the Deputy Leader of the Government so described it yesterday and if so where are the <i>bona fides</i> of the Government? There should be a clear explanation in matters of this kind.  There are responsible Opposition parties <Col N="218" /> here who, unlike the Government, are prepared to grasp the nettle danger firmly and in so far as we are concerned I do not believe that any Deputy on this side of the House has any doubt as to where he would stand if the security of this nation was jeopardised or in danger.</P>

      <P>The longer the time the Minister seeks, in view of this kind of background, the more the suspicion on this side of the House must be aroused.  In introducing the Second Stage yesterday the Minister said that it would take 12 months to repair Mountjoy but he comes here now asking for two years to have it repaired&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or such later time as the House might decide by resolution.  Why is an estimate of 12 months doubled overnight?  If, as described by the Deputy Leader of the Government, this Bill is to be a Curragh detention Bill, let us introduce it as such.  Let us debate it as such.  Let us see where we stand on that kind of issue but let Deputies not be asked to vote in blinkers.  That is an insult to our intelligence.  It is not a responsible way of dealing with Deputies on any side of the House as representatives of the people and it is not the kind of leadership this country requires now.  If issues are to be faced they should be faced openly, honestly and responsibly.  For how long this legislation should operate is highly relevant to the issue we are discussing, as is also whether it is purely crisis legislation, <i>ad hoc</i> legislation, to deal with the tearing down of cell doors, the breaking of windows and the destruction of the roof of Mountjoy, <Col N="219" /> estimated yesterday to be repairable in 12 months.  Why does the Minister not come in now and, having agreed in principle to a time limit, agree to a time limit more proximate to 12 months?  Why does he seek two years or such later date as may be specified? Why does the Deputy Leader describe the Bill as a Curragh detention Bill?</P>
      <P>These are questions which ought to be answered.  I say that without, in the slightest way, wavering in the policy of this party, that is, that if there is a danger and if there is disorder and if there are people endeavouring to interfere with our democratic institutions, we should deal with them but do not let us use one excuse to adopt an entirely different position.  It is an honest and clear-sighted Government that we require in this country now but we are not getting that sort of Government.</P>

      <P>I am one of those who had very serious difficulty last night in supporting this Bill.  Nevertheless, I did so when the Minister gave an indication that he intended to impose a time limit.  My difficulty arose in relation to section 2, the section dealing with military custody, with all its implications and overtones. However, when I believed the Bill would be of short duration and confined to making arrangements for the provision of additional accommodation as a result of the riot in Mountjoy last week, I went along with it.  I had in mind, too, the type of individuals who caused the riot, individuals who must necessarily be kept in a secure place.  In my constituency in the last couple of years there have been four serious bank raids and other happenings which have left the people there in a very worried frame of mind.  We do not want these individuals in an institution or place in which they could again impose their will or do the things that have been done in my constituency.  I found myself, then, having to support the Bill, with the reservation I have made and in the light of the promise made by the Minister that he intended to impose a time limit on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning I find the time limit is <Col N="220" /> two years plus.  That seems to me a ridiculously long period in which to carry out repairs or alterations to Mountjoy.  Anybody who has any experience of building knows that one could build a new prison in that length of time.  For me, the period is far too long and, because of that, I could not support the Minister's amendment.  The Labour Party amendment of six months is reasonable.  Even a few extra months might be acceptable, but two years goes beyond all that is necessary, in my opinion, for repairs and alterations.</P>
    <P>Another matter that worries me is the Minister's remark this morning that additional accommodation would probably have been necessary because of the state of the country, both north and south, and arrangements would have had to be made for an increase in the numbers taken in over the next two years.  The Minister dealt rather cursorily with that.  I think he should have spent more time explaining what he expected would happen here in the next two years and under what circumstances people would be apprehended, or &ldquo;lifted&rdquo;, in that period.  I am much more worried now than I was last night at the implications of the Minister's amendment.  The amendment reads:</P>
    <P>This section shall continue in operation until the 31st day of May, 1974, or such later date (if any) as may for the time being stand specified by resolution of Dáil Éireann passed at a time when this section is in operation, and it shall then expire.</P>
    <P>A simple statement of a specific period would have sufficed for us in the Labour Party and we would have accepted that.  This addition makes us suspicious of the real intentions.  I had, as I said, reservations last night but, because the Minister gave his word, and this was accepted by the press commentators this morning as is evidenced by the <i>Irish Press</i> heading, I supported the Bill.  Those listening to the debate here understood the Minister to give his word.  I do not think he has kept his word in this amendment. The addition of these words means that the period can be extended to any period he thinks necessary for one <Col N="221" /> reason or another.  Indeed, the reasons advanced in his final remarks make me even more suspicious.  When he speaks again I hope he will explain his remarks and give a clear indication to the House of the additional accommodation required and tell us if this additional accommodation would have been required had there been no riot.  Will he also tell us if the Curragh would have been necessary as a detention centre if there had been no riot?  The Minister will have to answer these questions in order to put a great many people's minds at rest.  The period specified in his amendment is far too long.  I will oppose the Minister's amendment and support the Labour Party amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to get in while we had the Minister for Transport and Power with us because there are a few things I want to clear up and the Minister for Transport and Power could have cleared up one of them.  We had what I describe as a rather foolish contribution from Deputy Briscoe this morning on these amendments.  He implied that the Labour Party just were not interested in security and, for that reason, they did not want this legislation at all. The Labour Party are well able to answer for themselves.  He went on to say that if we were serious we would have taken the trouble of going to see Mountjoy.  I interjected that we would not be let in.  I understand this argument was also made last night. The Minister said that I was allowed to visit, but did not do so, or something to that effect.  Photographs in the papers prove that this is wrong. I went there on one occasion and I was told they would have to ring the Minister for Justice&mdash;he is now Minister for Transport and Power&mdash; and the message came back: &ldquo;Do not let him in.&rdquo;  I was not let in.  As a public representative I was concerned about people from my own constituency who were in Mountjoy and I believed I should be allowed to see the conditions for myself.  I do not think there was anything unreasonable in that and the Minister in question should have known that I was not going in for the purpose of causing a <Col N="222" /> serious disturbance but simply because I was concerned about the conditions.</P>
      <P>I understood that the section set aside in Collins Barracks, Cork, was to be passed over to the Department of Justice.  Is that so or is it not?  Does this legislation apply only to the Curragh? We should be told to what it does apply.  There is no reason why the section in Collins Barracks, Cork, which is on the perimeter of the camp, should not be handed over to the Department of Justice and staffed by people under the Department of Justice.  I appreciate that there is a serious problem for the Minister in the Curragh.  The detention centre is right in the centre of the Camp and it could not be manned by people from the Department of Justice.  That is understandable.  The Minister will have to clear up the position and tell us to what establishments this will apply.</P>

      <P>I want to make my position perfectly clear with regard to the action I took last night.  I had my mind clearly made up as to what stand I would take on this issue because I knew that these incidents in Mountjoy were not accidental.  They were forced upon these men, men of conviction, men who believe that what they are doing is the right thing, and we must respect them for their convictions.  This position was brought about because of the arrogance, and nothing else, of the Minister for Justice. These men had been complaining for quite some time and if the Minister had even a modicum of maturity he would understand what it means to be locked up as a political prisoner. Some of us have had that experience. He, unfortunately, has not had that experience.  These men who are charged with political offences because of their political convictions have been detained in a prison where they got treatment completely and utterly divorced from the treatment political prisoners should get.  They were in overcrowded conditions; they were ill-treated and badly fed and the general aspect of their conditions in Mountjoy was absolutely deplorable. We had experience of that in the past <Col N="223" /> from Fianna Fáil when a colleague of mine, the late Seán McCaughey, was allowed to die on hunger strike, wrapped in an old blanket&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is military law, not civil law.  Fianna Fáil have typified what military law is down through the years.  I shall never subscribe to it.

      <P>The Minister stepped back and said he would put a limit on the reconstruction of Mountjoy. There and then my mind changed because I thought he spoke honestly.  I <Col N="224" /> doubt that now.  I thought he was <i>bona fide</i> in what he said but having listened to him this morning doubling his statement of last night from one year to two or more I must now again put the rule to the Minister's statement and approach.  I want to know what steps he has taken to find out from the contractors, builders or reconstruction firm how long the reconstruction will take.  There is a time clause included in every public contract.  The Minister has not told us how long this job will take.  I expected to hear it this morning. Any businessman or any public man with experience at local authority or national level would know it is fundamental in all contracts to have a time clause.  But the Minister knows nothing about it.  That does not surprise me because of his immaturity and arrogance.</P>
      <P>Why is it not possible to retain the men who are now in charge at the Curragh, the prison warders and jail warders?  There is a difference between a prison and a jail, whether the Minister knows this or not.  I want to know why the seven prison warders now in the Curragh cannot be retained there in a supervisory capacity.  As our leader said last night, let them be held under the Department of Justice.  The Minister says he has not staff but they are there at the moment, to my knowledge.</P>

      <P>In his introductory speech to the Bill last night, the Minister said that it would take at least 12 months to repair Mountjoy Jail.  Some of us said that this was a fiction.  A lie is too strong a word to use in Parliament. The repairing of Mountjoy Jail is mentioned in the <i>Irish Press</i> this morning&mdash;the truth in the news as ex-Deputy James Dillon used to say. Under the heading &ldquo;Prison Bill Time Limit&rdquo; it is said that Deputy O'Malley agrees to an amendment, but we come in here and find that the amendment which Deputy O'Malley agrees to is to extend the time he mentioned yesterday from one year to two years.</P>

      <P>All I can say&mdash;and I am being extremely brief&mdash;to my colleagues of both parties who did not walk with that tiny minority last night is that if they were taken in by the assurance of the Minister for Justice 12 hours ago&mdash;assurances headlined in the <i>Irish Press</i> today&mdash;they have demonstrated their political gullibility and naïvety to a degree that I did not think possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins referred to the quotation, as yet not denied, by the Tanaiste that this Bill was the Curragh detention Bill.  Never in this House before <Col N="228" /> have I risen and said &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;, but the ritual of Deputies from both the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party of standing up in this House and expressing bewilderment at the Minister's so-called amendment reduces me to mirth, if it were not so tragic.  One after another the Deputies are saying that they believed Deputy O'Malley when he said he would put a terminal point in this Bill.  They have got their answer and they have been shown the degree of credence and credibility which they can put on the statements of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan said that he asked for certain assurances from the Minister for Justice.  I ask for no assurances from the Minister for Justice because I know what I am dealing with in the Minister for Justice.  I knew last night when I walked through the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; lobby what I was dealing with in the Minister for Justice.  The amendment introduced by the Minister for Justice today in implementation of the pledge he made in this House that there would be a time limit on the operation of this Bill is in the first place an insult to the intelligence of this House and, secondly, it reflects the political gullibility of the lawyers on the Fine Gael benches who, 12 hours ago, took his word.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> One thing is clear and that is that Mountjoy Prison is not at the present time suitable for the detention of a full complement of prisoners, either prisoners on remand or sentenced prisoners.  If I were to deal at length with the circumstances under which it became unsuitable I might not be in order.  I do not propose to do that, beyond saying that it amazes me how a situation was allowed to develop where unarmed prisoners were able to wreck a prison to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds.  On an Estimate or on some other occasion, serious words will have to be spoken and blame put where it rightly lies for that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must deal with the position as we find it now.  Mountjoy Prison is not suitable at the present time for its purpose. Unfortunately, it is also a fact that we must have prisoners and that <Col N="229" /> we must be able to detain people who are determined to break the law, or to take the law into their own hands, and who disregard completely the rights of other citizens.  If I were to try to work myself into a frenzy or become emotional, I would find it easier to do so if I were to think of the rights of ordinary, law-abiding citizens who are prepared to go about their everyday work and business without interfering with anybody else, and who have their lives disrupted and property damaged by people who have no regard for the law or for the rights of other citizens.</P>
    <P>In so far as I am concerned, so long as Mountjoy Prison is unsuitable and so long as there is necessity for having a prison, I am prepared to give the Minister reasonable powers to house these people elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The question has been raised, and I think rightly so, as to whether this Bill is a temporary measure to deal with prisoners during the repair of Mountjoy or the thin end of the wedge in dealing with the political situation in this country.  This Government have shown over the last couple of years evidence of double thinking and double talk, and the statement of the Tánaiste which appears in today's <i>Irish Independent</i>, in which he is reported as having referred to this Bill last evening as the &ldquo;Curragh Detention Bill&rdquo;, does in fact raise the question in one's mind whether it is a temporary Bill or a permanent piece of legislation. The Government should, as Deputy O'Higgins said, clarify that beyond doubt.  I do not think that the Tánaiste got this phrase out of the sky. It is a phrase he must have heard used some place else.  I know discussions of the Cabinet are secret, but if a Bill is described by one title in one place, I suppose a man who has heard it so described can be pardoned if he describes it in similar terms elsewhere.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> What we want here is an honest discussion on this Bill.  We in this party are prepared to give the Minister for Justice and the Government reasonable measures to deal with an emergency situation, but we do not want to be discussing a detention Bill under the guise of a prisons Bill, and the people and the Members of this House can be pardoned for being alarmed at hearing the second most important man, in status, in the Government describe this Bill glibly as the Curragh detention Bill.  The Taoiseach has told me that it has never been so described at a Cabinet meeting.  I accept that, but it shows the sort of thinking that is going through the minds of some Ministers The word &ldquo;detention&rdquo; is not synonymous with &ldquo;remand&rdquo; and it is not synonymous with &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo;.  It is something else, and I suppose the nearest thing it comes to is &ldquo;internment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash; but when there is an association of &ldquo;the Curragh&rdquo; with &ldquo;detention&rdquo; in the mind of a senior Cabinet Minister, we are entitled to probe further. As I say, and as Deputy O'Higgins said, let us be honest.  Let us discuss what we mean.  If we do that I shall be satisfied.  Let us not have a continuance of making one speech today and another one tomorrow, saying: &ldquo;I have been incorrectly reported.  That is not what I said.&rdquo;  This sort of thing leads to misrepresentation.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I have outlined it is important that we should put a time limit on this Bill and I would like the Minister for Justice to tell us now if he has had sufficient time to make up his mind whether he intends to do what I would call an ordinary reconstruction job on Mountjoy or to avail of this bit of vandalism to redesign the whole place, to modernise it, if that can be done.  It would appear to be a waste of public money to replace an old building of 150 years, or whatever age it is, exactly as it was before.  That would be out of keeping with modern thinking.  The Minister's attitude could be understood if he were to say: &ldquo;I shall avail of this opportunity to have expert opinion on the whole set-up in Mountjoy and see whether it should be reinstated or demolished.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I do not like about the amendment that has been introduced by the Minister is that it is not an improvement on section 2.  It does not meet the points made by Opposition speakers last night.  Section 2, as it stands, proposes to enact that this Bill can be terminated at any time, next week, if the House so desires.  It could last for ten years or two months.  The House could at any time pass a resolution saying that the section was no longer necessary, and it would end then.  The amendment says the section must stand for approximately two years until 31st May, 1974, and that if no resolution is <Col N="232" /> passed it will cease to operate on that date, but the Minister takes power to fix a later date for its termination.  I think the least distance the Minister can go is to delete from his amendment the word &ldquo;later&rdquo;.  The amendment would then read:</P>
    <P>This section shall continue in operation until 31st May, 1974, or such date as may for the time being stand specified by resolution of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>The section would then mean that if nothing happened the Act would cease to remain in force on 31st May, 1974, but the House could terminate it at any time between now and 31st May, 1974. I do not know if that is what the Minister had in mind, but certainly he has, instead of improving the situation, worsened it by the amendment he has brought in.  Therefore, if the Minister can convince the House that, as he sees it now, the 31st May, 1974 is the minimum period required but gives the House power to terminate the section before that, he might have a stronger case.</P>
    <P>Those are points which have occured to me listening to the debate and reading the section and the amendment. I think the word &ldquo;later&rdquo;, instead of being an improvement, considerably worsens the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Not having had the opportunity to comment last evening on the Bill and having supported the Second Stage last night because of the serious custodial problems indicated by the Minister to the House and accepting the net balance of the arguments put forward by the Minister, notwithstanding reservations that many of us have on the Bill, I feel I should comment on the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment to me, at any rate, is quite unacceptable and I am quite sure that as drafted by the Minister it is most unacceptable to the overwhelming majority of responsible Opposition Deputies.  If the Minister presses the matter he will find that to be so.  As drafted, I certainly would oppose the amendment.  The Minister is in a rather weak position to amend his own amendment in view of his <Col N="233" /> performance last evening.  I certainly found it no pleasure, in view of the appallingly bad reply by the Minister to the Second Reading debate, when he indicated in a most vague manner the content of the amendment, which clearly showed the extent to which the Government were at sixes and sevens in drafting the amendment.  We have had further evidence here this morning of the Taoiseach dashing up and down to the Minister, trying to worry their way out of the impasse they have created in respect of the amendment. Therefore, I have no great confidence in the capacity of the Minister to bring forward acceptable amendments to the House which, if he were less petty, less vindictive and less temperamental, I am quite sure he could do.</P>
    <P>I would urge him strongly in relation to the amendment to rethink it quite substantially and to do so immediately. It should be pointed out that the time limit we are talking about is the extent to which we in this House will continue to accept the use of military custody detention centres for normal prison population.  The period proposed by the Minister is at least to the 31st May, 1974, and to a much later date if the Minister, in effect, so proposes.  I am quite sure that every Member of the House finds it abhorrent and unacceptable, in terms of the fundamental liberties of the citizens, that we should agree to such a period for the incarceration in military custody of citizens who have been convicted of criminal offences.  I would point out to the House that there seems to be an impression created by the Minister that the use of these centres until 31st May, 1974, will be specifically for, as he said, those who are causing trouble or those who would like to call themselves political prisoners, a term which we do not accept.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out, and the Minister is only too clearly aware, that any constituent of any Deputy, who gets three or four years for a criminal offence, can be dumped into military custody for a period up to 31st May, 1974, or a later date.  This is unacceptable, not just in principle. <Col N="234" /> We need much stronger safeguards in this legislation and they should be built in immediately by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I deplore and am vehemently opposed to the attempt by the Minister last evening, and even still, to play dirty party politics with this serious custodial issue that has arisen in the State.  I am talking on the merits of the proposal as a Deputy who vehemently opposed the IRA, and the murder of British troops as well, and have done so over three years.  I find the Minister is now cynically trying to stir up trouble in this House by the content of the amendment proposed by him.  The Taoiseach has been down to him in the last ten minutes, arguing with the Minister whether he will accept another variety of amendment. Quite frankly, I do not think that this is acceptable.  Being in Opposition, I have much greater faith in Deputy Cooney's capacity for rational law and order than I have in the Minister's interpretation that we have had here.</P>
    <P>I want to say in relation to Mount-joy&mdash;and this is the nub of the Minister's argument in relation to the amendment&mdash;the Minister seems to think that he is the only person who has ever visited Mountjoy.  May I inform the Minister that as a young trade union officer, six, seven or eight years ago, I had many occasions to visit Mountjoy before we had any upstart solicitors winning by-elections and becoming Ministers of State by default and suddenly discovering that they owned and controlled Mountjoy?</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the kind of blanket statement by the Minister in relation to 1974.  I want evidence and the evidence is available to us in this House.  It is disturbing and disgraceful that the Taoiseach this morning and the Minister should bandy around 30 or 40 photographs of the damage in Mountjoy, which they have in their possession, which the Special Branch took inside Mountjoy to show the extent of the damage and which have been shown to members of the Cabinet but no Member of this House has had the opportunity of seeing the extent of the damage.  There has been no formal indication in the opening statement by the Minister of the extent <Col N="235" /> of the damage.  The Prison Officers Association have not been permitted to make any statement in relation to the extent of the damage.  As a trade unionist I would remind the Minister that the Prison Officers Association are trade union members and they have my sympathy, loyalty and support in respect of the appalling situation they had to face during this riot and certainly they have the support of every responsible Member of the House.  As public representatives we cannot accept in good faith statements made by many members of the Cabinet, and particularly by the Minister for Justice, in relation to the time limit.  The Minister has already contradicted himself.  He said it would take 12 months to repair Mountjoy.  This morning he said it would take three years.  How long will it take?</P>
    <P>The Opposition quite legitimately may express serious concern about the content of this amendment.  I do not think it is good enough in any democracy simply to say we want military custody in operation for any one of the 1,017 civil prisoners.  I have no sympathy for persons caught with arms, ammunition or explosives who are serving sentences at the moment. As far as I am concerned they will serve out their full sentences under the due process of the civil prison institutions of this State and I certainly will not equivocate, as some Deputies have, in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister must make a far better case for the 31st May, 1974.  The Labour Party has put down an amendment to have the date 30th November, 1972, and Fine Gael proposed 1st September, 1973.  These in many respects must stand speculative. The Minister has not produced any real evidence to the House, such as a statement by the Board of Works.  We only have his own statement giving the actual damage done and the proposals laid out.  These are our views.</P>
    <P>We have the appalling situation that a few individuals who reject and detest the normal rule of democratic law in this country and who would use any means to disrupt that law go off halfcocked and a Minister and a Taoiseach <Col N="236" /> decide to take advantage of the situation and introduce military custody.  This is a typical Fianna Fáil attitude.  They take advantage of a situation instead of doing the work of the Minister for Justice in a different manner.  These are my views and, unless I hear substantial evidence to the contrary from the Minister I certainly will talk again and will strongly oppose the idea of the 31st May, 1974</P>

      <P>The first thing I want to make perfectly clear is that I am accused, as unfortunately seems to be a frequent occurrence on any debate in which I or my Department are involved, of misleading people and all this sort of thing.  I misled nobody. Last night I was asked by responsible members of the Opposition&mdash;I can see their point&mdash;to put some time limit on this Bill.  In fact, there was in effect a flexible time limit in subsections (1) and (2) of the Bill as it now stands either to continue it or to end it at the earliest possible moment.  However, I was pressed to put in a date and I did so.</P>
      <P>The draftsman added to it a provision that, if at the end of that two-year period it was still necessary to continue the provisions of this section, that could be done by a resolution of the Dáil which would have to be passed before the expiry of the period mentioned.  Before I deal further with the nature of the amendment I think I should deal with the situation that causes me and my advisers to feel that a two-year period was the appropriate period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, I was accused of misleading the House yesterday.  Almost every Deputy who spoke, alleged that I said yesterday that Mountjoy could be repaired within 12 months.  I did <Col N="237" /> not say that.  The only person who quoted me properly was Deputy Thornley, who read out what I actually said, which, of course, was very different to what everybody else attributed to me this morning.  What I said was, as Deputy Thornley read out, that the repair and so on at Mountjoy would take at least 12 months.</P>

      <P>We have heard a lot of talk today about how long it takes to carry out building jobs, and so on, that some builders build a house a day and therefore Mountjoy should be repaired in some short period of months.  This, of course, with all due respect to the Deputies who said these things, is arrant nonsense. The fact of the matter is that building in a prison, even the most trivial kind, is an exceptionally slow job.  The contractor cannot be tied to time because he has none of the normal facilities that a contractor on an ordinary outside site would have.</P>
      <P>He and his men are subject to all kinds of restriction for security purposes. One of the greatest security risks in a prison is building work going on within it.  This is so, even if that building work or repair work is being done by the internal staff of the prison but it is doubly and trebly so if an outside contractor is coming in. His employees have to be vetted and they have to be employed on such a basis that a limited number of them will come to work and that they and they only will come each day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On many occasions considerable security problems have arisen.  Towards the end of last year when we built a major new school in St. Patrick's Institution, which immediately adjoins Mountjoy, a detainee in St. Patrick's escaped in the course of that building because he succeeded in passing himself off as an employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty in relation to Mountjoy is much greater.  Outside contractors <Col N="238" /> will have to come in.  They will have to do the work in sections.  The work is exceptionally slow.  I am advised, and I have no reason to doubt, that the work will not alone take up to but will fully take two years.  When I say that the work which is necessary, and which will have to be done, will take that time I do not mean just patching up what was broken-up on last Thursday or Friday.  We have had, for some time, fairly elaborate plans for the reconstruction and redevelopment of Mountjoy with a view of modernising it and making it more suitable for the rehabilitation of prisoners and for the proper and safe custody of them.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department, together with officials of the Board of Works, visited a number of modern prisons and other similar institutions in the last few months in Britain, Holland and Denmark.  In particular they were struck by the advances made in Denmark. One of the most important factors they found in rehabilitation of prisoners in modern premises was to divide up the prisoners as much as possible into small and reasonably selfcontained units.</P>
    <P>This would entail in Mountjoy, which unfortunately is a very old prison, cutting off the floors separately and not leaving them open from floor to roof as they are at the moment and indeed, in some of the floors, subdividing a floor which might contain 50 cells into three different sections so that prisoners could be brought together in small groups where their interests or their problems were similar. They could be treated together in a much more effective way than when they are a small number of a very large crowd of prisoners as we have in Mountjoy.  All this work would have had to take place.  Our great problem was that we simply did not know when we could start it because Mountjoy was so full that to start on one wing would create a most serious accommodation difficulty.  It would mean that 100 or possibly more prisoners would simply have to be discharged from Mountjoy and sent somewhere else and we were not in a position to do it.  However, to some extent, and we might as well try to get some benefit for the <Col N="239" /> prisoners out of what happened last week, this opportunity has now been thrust upon us whether we like it or not.  We propose to do this work, we want to do this work but this is slow work, it must be done in sections and because of where it takes place it must be done exceptionally slowly and the ordinary time limits which might be reasonable to impose on a contractor on an outside job without any of these restrictions simply cannot apply in this instance.</P>
    <P>Apart from the very extensive work which is necessary for the modernisation of the prison for the better rehabilitation of the prisoners there is also, from the security point of view, the necessity to put four new roofs on the four wings and that, of course, in itself is a very major job and a difficult job to carry out physically because of the limitations that are necessarily imposed and because of the size of the wings.</P>
    <P>I go into this in some detail to show that before Mountjoy can be ready to receive again its full complement of prisoners a period of at least 12 months but, clearly, I think, in practice more than that but I would hope, although I cannot give any guarantee of it, a period of less than two years or of not exceeding two years will be required in order to do this.  Of course this is not the only factor.  Let the House not make that mistake.  I have to bear in mind also the disturbed state of this country, north and south, and the possibility that I may be inundated with further increasing numbers of prisoners because it has to be borne in mind that the prison population in this country over the last two years has increased by nearly 500.  This is an unprecedented increase and it is a factor that I have to continue to bear in mind.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to ensure that those who are disrupting our country and putting it and its people in such grave danger today will be curbed.</P>
      <P>This Bill is here simply to deal with the emergency situation that has arisen as a result of a large number of prisoners of a particular type being detained in our prisons. I cannot be certain that the number of prisoners of that type will decrease in the future.  The way things are going, and the activity of certain people being such, there is every likelihood that at least this large number will continue to be in custody in the foreseeable future.  These people are in custody because of the fact that we are prosecuting them to the best of our ability. I might mention that a significant proportion of them are in custody of their own volition, they need not be there. In quite a number of these cases, as I pointed out yesterday, they have been allowed bail by courts but they have in many cases refused to accept it. However, I have got these people now in custody and I have got to look after them.</P>
      <P>I have got to think of them but equally and, indeed, more important, I have got to think of the other prisoners and I have got to think of the situation in which life in our prisons will be made intolerable for the ordinary prisoner who is interested in his own rehabilitation unless I have somewhere to hold these disruptive elements who were the cause of this situation on last Thursday night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with this at sufficient length to show that we cannot return, accommodationwise to the situation that existed up to Thursday last for a period of two years from now.  I have explained in some detail why and I have shown that, at least some benefit has accrued from this unfortunate event last Thursday inasmuch as work which we wanted to do and which we had planned but which we could see no opportunity of doing can now be carried out.  For Deputies who are interested in this, or who are now expressing great interest in it, I would refer back to my Estimates speech here in the House only last month <Col N="242" /> when I devoted a high proportion of that speech to prisons.  In fact, it was pointed out to me by Deputy Fitzpatrick of Fine Gael that I had devoted 16 pages of my speech to prisons and that I seemed to be unduly interested in prisons and so on in setting out our proposals for new building and new planning in our prisons.</P>
    <P>I am glad that I did deal with that matter at such length at that time, and it was only last month, because if Deputies will refer to the Official Report of the 12th and 13th of April, 1972, they will see there at considerable length the many proposals for modernisation and rebuilding and new building which I described in such detail. The drawback about that at that time, as far as I was concerned, was that a good deal of that work could not be immediately undertaken because of the fact that we had such a large number in custody.  One of the things I mentioned, for example, in relation to Mountjoy was the building of a new corrective training unit which is going ahead this year at a cost of £500,000. It appears that every cloud has a silver lining because not alone can we build that now as a separate building but we can do all the work inside the main prison building that we wanted to do and I talked about last month but which I thought I would not get the opportunity of doing for quite some time.  I do think the House should be satisfied that the work which is necessary and which we now propose to carry out certainly has no great prospect of being completed in less than two years because of the particular working conditions under which contractors have to operate in Mountjoy or indeed in any other prison.</P>
    <P>If I might relate those remarks to the amendments we are discussing and refer to them in the context of what I have just said, I think any fairminded Deputy will agree that two years is a reasonable period.  Two years is the period proposed in my amendment.  The suggestion has been made that this could be extended indefinitely by this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the House why this situation must continue for two years.  I cannot foretell what it will be like after two years.  If it was necessary under this amendment to extend the period beyond two years it would be necessary to have a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann.  So far as I am concerned there is no great difference between having a resolution passed by the Dáil and having a one section Bill passed by the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The suggestion has been made that the word &ldquo;later&rdquo; should be excluded from the amendment but I think it would be a much neater and more effective method of putting a definite limitation if the House&mdash;which has accused me of endeavouring to mislead it, which I positively did not do&mdash; were to agree to my amendment simply ending with the words &ldquo;31st May, 1974&rdquo;.  I throw this out as a suggestion to the House.  If it were found necessary to extend this emergency situation beyond that time a one section Bill could be introduced in the House at that time.  This would give both the Dáil and Seanad an opportunity to discuss the situation.</P>
      <P>Far from misleading the House I have almost fallen over backwards to respond to any reasonable views which have been expressed here.  We have had a lot of rather silly rhetoric from speakers who are trying to justify their actions to people to whom I would never try to justify myself.  We have had a lot of that this morning but leaving that aside and having regard only to the reasonable views expressed here I think I have met them more than fully.</P>
      <P>It is now 12.35 p.m.  The Bill has to be through by 3 p.m. and we are still on the first group of amendments.  I think the gesture I have made is most reasonable, it shows my <i>bona fides</i> and it shows that I never made any attempt to mislead the House.  I would not wish to do so&mdash;I did not do so last night.  I think I have explained that fully and clearly to everyone except those who would wish to say I misled the House in any event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We often hear of people making a virtue of necessity but this is <Col N="244" /> the first time I have heard a Minister making a statement in the House to the effect that the riot which occurred in Mountjoy has allowed him to do things which he had hoped he would be able to do.  Are we to assume from that that if prisoners riot in other prisons certain much-needed improvements will be carried out?</P>
      <P>I have great respect for this House. My colleagues and I always weigh very carefully any legislation before the House because we consider that the decisions taken here are the decisions which should run in the country rather than decisions taken outside.  For that reason when there is a genuine difference of opinion on matters such as that before us last night we have a rule which was jeered at by the Minister last night.  It shows his idea of a democratic decision when he objected to the right of someone who could not, in conscience, vote for this Bill being allowed to vote against it.  This was an extraordinary attitude for a Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>The Minister has reiterated a statement made this morning that he did not try to mislead the House.  I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I do not think I am misled easily.  Against my better judgement I voted with the Minister because I was giving him the benefit of the doubt.  I am now perfectly satisfied that last night the Minister deliberately suggested that a time limit would be put&mdash;if he did not do it deliberately he was terribly confused himself.  The Minister has put down a time limit which is in excess of what is considered reasonable.  It is asking too much of us to believe this was not an attempt to cod those of us who voted with him last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody would accept the Minister's statement and I am sorry to have to say this.  I think Ministers must have a certain standing and we should normally accept that they are stating facts.  I cannot accept that this morning the Minister was stating a fact when he said he did not intend to mislead the House.  After stating it would take more than 12 months to repair Mountjoy, subsequently he put down an amendment <Col N="245" /> stipulating a minimum of two years. Maybe in some peculiar way he can consider that this was not misleading the House but I do not think anyone else in the House, even the members of his own party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fifteen months is only slightly more than 12 months&mdash;two years is a different matter.  Perhaps the Minister was confused about this matter.  If he was not confused then the Government's attitude to all of us has been very dishonest.  The Minister has been making a case here that it is necessary to segregate certain types of prisoners and to put them in military custody.  If that is the reason for the Bill it should be written into the Bill.  Let us know what we are voting for.  In case there is any doubt about it I want to make very clear that I am not a supporter of either wing of the IRA.  As a matter of fact, I would probably go further than many of my colleagues with regard to the suppression of people who want to overthrow not only the authority outside the State but the authority inside the State.  However, I will not agree in any circumstances that under any guise there should be a type of military detention introduced in this country.</P>
      <P>I believe that within the powers which he holds the Minister has authority not alone to arrest people breaks the law and is proved to have just trial and just punishment if they are proved to have committed the crime.  Certainly nobody on these benches will complain if somebody who breaks the law is proved to have broken it is punished, but we object, and will continue to object, if we find that any Minister brings a Bill into the House trying to set up military detention, in effect, for a particular type of prisoner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been careful in all his statements to avoid referring to anybody as a political prisoner.  Perhaps I would be at one with him in that.  If somebody is arrested for being in possession of arms, for robbing a bank or for assaulting somebody, he <Col N="246" /> is not charged with a political offence but the Minister attempts to try to segregate those people and to put them into military custody.  He wants to have them considered to be political prisoners.</P>
    <P>This group of amendments do not deal specifically with projected detention in the Curragh but I would object to the type of detention provided in the Bill for two reasons. First of all, I do not think anybody joined the Irish Army to become a prison warder.  If they wanted to be warders they would have joined the prison service.  Secondly, if we have a group of dangerous people who have to be kept in tight control, surely the wooden huts and the other buildings in the Curragh Camp are not the ideal place to keep them.  During the emergency I was a member of the Irish Army and part of my duties was to patrol the camps in which a number of airmen were interned.  It was not a very pleasant job, even if, I was quite sure, those men had a lot more freedom than is given to the people who are to be left in the Curragh.</P>
    <P>It is entirely wrong that we should be faced here with a situation in which the Government, through the Minister for Justice, have set up a whole new arrangement by which certain prisoners, not just those for whom there is not accommodation, will be put in military custody.  I would particularly object to the Minister for Defence being put in charge of prisoners who are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  Deputy Corish yesterday rightly said this would not be so bad if the Minister for Justice were in charge of these prisoners and if the civilian authorities were in control of the prison.  But the Minister is trying to create a situation where people will be shuttled backwards and forwards: in the courts they will be under the control of the Department of Justice, in detention camps they will be controlled by the Department of Defence; and if they come out for trial they will be back under the control of the Department of Justice.  That kind of thing cannot work.</P>
    <P>If he could only realise it, the Minister for Justice is in the position of a <Col N="247" /> kind of magician.  Under the provisions of this Bill, all he has to do is to look at a building and say, &ldquo;That building is a prison&rdquo;, and, hey presto, it is a prison.  All he has to do is to point to a man and say, &ldquo;You are a warder&rdquo;, and he is a warder.  He has said he has not any accommodation for those people except at the Curragh.  He also has said that he cannot get staff to act as warders during this period.  I suggest he should make the necessary arrangements to have buildings&mdash;there are plenty of them in the country including the building in Cork, which should be a prison, being used as a detention barracks&mdash;made available.</P>
    <P>On the length of time, it is ludicrous to suggest it will take two years to repair the prison from which those people were taken and in the same breath to say, as the Minister has said, that the reason why those prisoners are being taken out of it is because he believes they should be in military control.  The Minister should come before the House and say definitely whether he considers this to be a national emergency in which special powers have to be taken to deal with those people.  If that is so, we have an entirely new ball-game.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been saying on the one hand that there is not accommodation for those people in Mountjoy and, on the other, that they are dangerous and must be given special treatment. He should accept the amendment put down by the Labour Party and if he does not he should, before the debate finishes, state plainly whether if the riot had not occured in Mountjoy he would still have come before us with this Bill, and try to justify it.</P>
    <P>He attacked my colleague, Deputy Pattison.  Deputy Pattison's record, from the point of view of law and order, is as good as, if not better than, the Minister's.  That did not do his Bill any good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe in the due process of law.  If somebody is accused of breaking it he should be given a fair trial and if proved guilty, should be punished accordingly.  But <Col N="248" /> our jails are full of petty criminals who could be outside if a different attitude were taken.  For example, a fellow was fined a sum of money which he could not find immediately. If he had been allowed to pay it by instalments he would not have been put in prison and the State would have been saved that expense.</P>
      <P>If, as he appears to be, the Minister is saying to this House that it is not possible to have the due process of law carried out and that people will not be dealt with in the way they should be, then there is an onus on the Minister to come to this House and plainly say it.  This goes right back on him as Minister for Justice whose responsibility it is to see that the law is carried out by those who are paid to carry it out.  If it is not, the Minister knows what the remedy is.</P>
      <P>The Minister has complained that we are dealing only with the first set of amendments and that we must finish the Bill before 3 o'clock.  We made a point on that this morning.  We said that is not giving adequate time to us to discuss a matter like this.  He cannot blame us if the later amendments are not discussed adequately.  He will, however, give people outside the House who want to belittle it the opportunity to say: &ldquo;There is a very important Bill which has been rushed into the Dáil and rushed through it without adequate discussion because the Government have not the time&rdquo;. Will the Minister look at the Order Paper and what we will be discussing during the rest of the evening?  He will then realise that it is not nearly as important as this Bill which, I suppose, will be an Act in the morning.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach told us that the reason why he wanted to get the Bill through quickly was because he feared a number of those people would apply for orders of habeas corpus and would be released.  Both the Taoiseach and the Minister must know that this is not possible.  It is, therefore, unfair to treat the House in this way.  If that could have been done it would have been done.</P>

      <P>What we are discussing now is the time limit, the life of <Col N="249" /> this Bill, and we have three amendments. It is a question of trying to reconcile the three into something that would be acceptable to the House.  The Minister has suggested that the termination date be 31st May, 1974. As a compromise he has suggested that the second half of the amendment be dropped and that, if it was necessary to extend that, he could come back to the House in two years time and look for a further extension.  We suggested to him that if he dropped the word &ldquo;later&rdquo; from the second leg of his amendment everyone would be happy.  He would have the power to extend, if he wanted to, by bringing in a resolution and, if he achieved the happy state of ending earlier than 31st May, he could also bring in a resolution.</P>

      <P>We have an amendment down on this matter as well.  The Minister may be right about how long it will take to repair the broken walls and fittings in Mountjoy. There are not many qualified bricklayers in the House and he may be right.  I would have thought that this concerned coming to this House whenever this authority was needed.  I am concerned about the authority we are giving to the Minister to make the changes required to bring about military detention and military custody of people sentenced by civil courts.  In our amendment we propose that in a matter of six months time the Minister should come back to the House for extra authority, if it is necessary at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question before us is not how long it may take to repair Mountjoy. We are anxious that the Minister should come back to the House so that the Members of the House could see exactly at that stage what the experience was of the practice of holding people convicted by the civil courts in military custody.  Briefly that is the purpose of our amendment.  We are not concerned about the period it will take to repair Mountjoy Jail.  We are not qualified to say how long it <Col N="250" /> will take to repair the facilities in Mountjoy.  We think this House should be consulted at frequent intervals.  Our authority should be sought.  The Minister should be aware of the feelings of members of all parties when he comes back for the periodic extension of this authority, if it is necessary.  We all hope it will not be necessary but, if it is necessary, it is important that the Minister should come back to the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I that the Bill will be smeared, that those who consider that there is a state of emergency will be smeared, and that suggestions will be made that Deputies who accept that there is an emergency situation are preparing the way for internment without trial.  This I deny, but the Minister knows that a propaganda machine will be in full gear next week.</P>

In all honesty the Minister may say that the two year period is a practical necessity as he sees the conditions in Mountjoy.  I am not so much exercised by the conditions in Mountjoy as by the political considerations and the civil rights considerations involved in this measure.  That is why I say the Minister should come back to the House and that he has nothing to fear in coming back to the House and looking for extra authority each time.  It would be an impressive rebuttal of any smear tactics engaged in by people outside Parliament.</P>

      <P>I will get back to the amendment.  The burden of my remarks was this: The good name of this House is at issue in a discussion on any matter of such fundamental importance.  I am suggesting to the Minister, in a helpful spirit I hope, that <Col N="253" /> to ensure that no malicious propaganda is propagated as a result of this measure being passed he should repose confidence in the House.  This confidence would be amply repaid by the House.  He should not suggest that it is simply the sanitary arrangements in Mountjoy which compel us to provide a two-year period in a Bill which commits the House to a legislative change. This is not the matter at issue.</P>
      <P>What is at issue is whether the Minister for Justice has sufficient confidence in the House to come back after an interval of six months and listen to the viewpoints of the Members of the House.  This House should be seen to be the open democratic assembly which I believe it to be, and we should openly discuss our experience of the changes envisaged in this Bill.  That has been the burden of my remarks and the way we have given our support to the Bill.  The Minister did not enhance the standing of the House when he made allegations about Deputies in good standing who had legitimate objections to certain features of the Bill.</P>
      <P>It is a characteristic of the party to which I belong, and probably their glory, that in all matters affecting the civil rights of citizens, the members of my party will always be to the fore in mounting a defence of those rights.  A big lie has been propagated by members of the Government party, by the Minister last night and, I regret to say, by Members of Fine Gael last weekend, that somehow this party were connected with subversive organisations.

      <P>I will come to this conclusion, that this party and its spokesmen spoke out against the people who are attempting to ferment civil war now a long time before it became popular for members on either <Col N="254" /> side of the House, the main Opposition or the Government party, long before last Christmas, and we have no heads to hang in shame on this issue.  If some people have plucked up courage in the Government and Fine Gael Parties from the Referendum result and are now out defending democracy and law and order and condemning subversive organisations, right, left and centre, let them not rebuke the people who stood in the gap when nobody was saying anything about these matters, last Christmas, when these organisations were as openly plotting civil war as they are now.</P>
      <P>A six-months period is what we seek in our amendment and we do it in the best interests of democracy in this country and of the standing of this House.  The Minister may be right about the alterations in the structure of Mountjoy that are necessary.  As I say, I am no bricklayer, but I have been a Deputy for seven years and I say this, that it is my humble opinion that the standing of this House would be enhanced and the Minister's credibility in putting this Bill before the people&mdash;a Bill I see in consideration of the emergency situation before us&mdash; would be enhanced.  I accepted the Minister's statement on trust here yesterday, that, in fact, the changes envisaged in this Bill in detention are necessary in view of that emergency situation, but I ask the Minister to accept our <i>bona fide</i> feelings that he should come back to this House after a six-months period, and we ask him to accept the amendment in that spirit. I do not think he has anything to fear from the elected Members of this House, of whatever party, about giving him any additional power that may be necessary at that period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude on this point, <Col N="256" /> because again there was reiteration of this allegation that I misled the Dáil last night, by Deputy Tully, who spoke since I spoke last, I should say that as a result of it, I sent out for the unrevised script of what was said last night&mdash;that is all that is available at the moment&mdash;and in fairness to myself, I might be permitted to read the relevant sentences:</P>
    <P>Because the re-roofing of the wings will have to be done one by one, the work is going to take a fairly considerable period.  Certain rebuilding will have to be done inside the building from a security point of view.  Because Mountjoy will not be fully secure to the extent I would wish it to be for an appreciable period, over 12 months, the time limit which will be decided between now and tomorrow morning to insert into this Bill, in deference to the wishes of Deputies, will have to take these points into account.</P>
    <P>To suggest therefore that when I came along this morning with a two-year period, I had misled the House in any way, having said that so specifically last night, is in fact, in itself misleading the House.  This whole thing is getting a bit trivial, that these sort of allegations are being made, but they are continually being made, and in case anybody else is accused of misleading, because it seems to be the fashionable thing nowadays to accuse people of, I want to make this perfectly clear so that neither the Taoiseach nor I nor the Government can be accused of misleading the Dáil, the people or anyone else.  Anybody who read the Taoiseach's speech on Monday last can be in no doubt of our determination to take further measures against illegal organisations.</P>

The Taoiseach made it perfectly clear yesterday in response to a specific question that we had no intention of introducing military courts <Col N="257" /> in this country, but in order that neither he nor I nor anybody else can be accused of misleading anyone, I want, and I am authorised by him to say this, to say that the Government do not rule out the possible introduction of special criminal courts, and in fact the Government have under active, and very active, consideration at this moment the question as to whether or not to introduce special criminal courts, but if those special criminal courts are introduced, there will be no military officers on them and they will be staffed entirely by members of our judiciary.  I make this clear at this point so that neither the Taoiseach nor I can be accused of having misled the Dáil, the public or anyone else.  I want it to be accepted in that spirit, particularly in the light of the experience I have had here in the course of this debate this morning.</P>

      <P>May I say first that we appreciate the Minister's clarification of that point?  It is proper that he should inform the House of the possible imminence of such legislation <Col N="258" /> so that afterwards we could not think that we had been misled.  I am glad that he has come clean on that particular point anyway although we have not been too happy with the ambiguity of some other utterances of his.  The points that I raised earlier and on which I sought some assurances that would enable us to accept a form of amendment similar to the Minister's were, first, that the extra time involved would be used to make radical improvements in the prison. We have had an assurance from the Minister on this.  I asked him also that the word &ldquo;later&rdquo; should be deleted and he has agreed to that.  I said also, and I take it this is accepted, that we should be in a position to keep ourselves informed of the progress of the work and to satisfy ourselves that the work is going ahead expeditiously, that there is no question of its being held up in any contrived way.  I presume that the Minister would have no difficulty in enabling us to be kept informed of the progress of the work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am keen that Deputies would visit our prisons.  I made some reference to this last night, but, unfortunately, I wronged Deputy O'Connell who has visited Mountjoy but I wronged, even more grievously, Deputy Mrs. Lynch who has given long service on the visiting committee of Mountjoy and who, for many years, has shown a deep interest in the prison.  Now that the point has been raised by Deputy FitzGerald I take this opportunity of offering my apologies to Deputy Mrs. Lynch and of saying that, certainly, Deputies are welcome to visit Mountjoy.</P>

      <P>Having cleared up those points that the three conditions which I suggested earlier as a basis for agreeing to the form of this amendment would be met, we shall not oppose the amendment in its present form.  However, I am concerned on one aspect. The reason why so much suspicion has been aroused in our minds is because of a passage in the Minister's speech which, to me at any rate, carried the clear implication that he was intending to consider using military custody not merely because of the absence of accommodation but because in his view certain prisoners require different treatment. There is a serious constitutional issue raised here.  The passage is:</P>
      <P>Nevertheless I could not give a reasonable assurance of protection to prison officers and other prisoners against the background of the risk of a repetition of last week's disorders unless I have the authority, which I am asking the House to give me now, to transfer to military custody certain prisoners who are liable to cause trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid the Minister may have got himself into considerable difficulties with that statement because if that is really what is behind this Bill and if the Minister intends to operate it in that way and instead of simply selecting prisoners arbitrarily on the basis that they simply cannot be fitted into existing prisons, he intends to use military <Col N="260" /> custody selectively in the way suggested here that is, to pick particular prisoners who are liable to cause trouble, as I understand it, the Bill would be unconstitutional. This is a matter to which we must give attention.  As I understand from what was said last night on television by Senator John Kelly, who is a considerable authority on Irish constitutional law, it had been established in some case that if a Minister seeks in such a way to transfer prisoners to particular custody of a kind different from the normal kind and to discriminate against particular prisoners with the intention of so discriminating, such practice is unconstitutional.  In so far as this Bill in its present wording permits this and in so far as it only requires him to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the conditions of custody are not less favourable and in so far as he has specified that the intention is to pick on certain prisoners who are liable to cause trouble, I am afraid that all our efforts here today may be in vain and that the Bill may be unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What provision of the Constitution is the section of my speech alleged to contravene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to be very helpful on this because I only heard what Professor Kelly said on television but I think it is related to the separation of powers, that only the judiciary can sentence people and that the Minister cannot vary the sentence. It seems to me that to send certain prisoners to a form of custody that is different from that to which others are sent is varying the sentence and would be likely to be so held by our courts.  I am concerned that by that statement and by the inadequacy of the formulation of subsection (8) the Minister may have endangered this whole Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because I want to explain why our suspicions have been aroused and why we have been so concerned that I have mentioned this but I mention it also for another practical reason which I hope I am <Col N="261" /> in order in mentioning.  This practical reason is that we will not reach subsection (8) and I would suggest to the Minister that between now and 3 o'clock he considers very seriously the Fine Gael amendment which may help to retrieve the position.  I am not sure that in the light of the Minister's speech anything could retrieve the position but if anything can, it is the Fine Gael amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of amendments but the ones with which I am concerned particularly are either 19 or 20.  Number 20 is our preference but if not accepted it may be that No. 19 will save the situation.  At this stage I merely suggest to the Minister that he would have his advisers look at these amendments, that he would not reject them out of hand at 3 o'clock in a series of votes before we have had a chance to explain the reasons for them.  The acceptance of one or other of these amendments would result in saving the situation so that we would not be back here in a few days time with another Bill to overcome the problems created by the Minister's unfortunate reference and by the bad drafting of the Bill. I make that point at this stage because it is of vital importance.</P>
      <P>In conclusion I would like to make one point in reply to a reference by Deputy O'Leary to allegations from these benches as to the Labour Party having associations with subversives.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief.  The Minister has complained about the time being allocated to this debate but this has not been a waste of time.  The question of a time limit has been very important in the consideration of this Bill.  It is not often that I pay tribute here to this particular Minister but we should recognise that he has made a move in the direction in which his critics have urged him to move, that is, in accepting the dropping of the word &ldquo;later&rdquo; but we on these benches would like this to be made more concise.  I am not blaming the Minister for the wording because this was done in a hurry and did not, perhaps, get all the consideration it should have got, but I want to be quite clear that I understand the position aright.  If Deputy Pattison tables a resolution on 30th November next&mdash;I am not now asking the Minister to commit the Government on this&mdash;will the Minister pledge himself to recommend to the Government that Government time will be allowed for the consideration of such a resolution within one month of its being tabled?</P>

      <P>First and foremost, I should like to place on record <Col N="263" /> the fact that I wholeheartedly welcome the speech of the Taoiseach yesterday and the reinforcing of that speech by the undertaking given to this House this morning by the Minister for Justice that it is not intended to introduce detention without trial and that there will be no military courts.  The Minister has given that undertaking.  I welcome it.</P>
      <P>Every Member of this House has a very grave responsibility in relation to these amendments and in relation to the underlying principle of the Bill.  I am amazed that, despite the fact that it will take at least 12 months to repair and restore Mountjoy, we have this panic measure being rushed through Dáil Éireann, depriving the House of the opportunity of giving to the Bill the long and serious consideration legislation of this kind warrants.  The Minister says it will take 12 months to repair Mountjoy.  Is it not a fact that a considerable time will elapse during which the Office of Public Works will be engaged on inspecting and planning the premises?  All the Minister told us was that the prison is to be restored to normal conditions in a period of 12 months.  I fail then to understand the anxiety of the Minister to keep this Bill on the Statute Book for a period of two years.  I do not see anything wrong with the Fine Gael amendment.  To me it is a common-sense and logical amendment.  It gives the Minister several months after the prison has been restored to a proper state of repair and the amendment tabled by the Labour Party is also a reasonable amendment because it merely seeks an opportunity for the House to review the whole position at the end of that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time is long overdue for prison reform.  Perhaps the riot last week and this panic legislation will result in bringing home to all of us the importance of giving special attention and consideration to the whole subject of prison reform.  Many of us are deeply concerned about prison reform and there are those of us who devote a good deal of time to the submission of memoranda and the preparation of articles on prison reform.  In the event <Col N="264" /> of Mountjoy being fully restored at the end of the 12 months, what will be the purpose of detaining people in the Curragh under military supervision for a period longer than that?  I should like to point out, too, that prison officers are highly trained personnel.  That is more than can be said for the personnel of the Army.  It is no part of their training to supervise detention.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that it should be necessary to table these amendments. It is regrettable that it was necessary for the Minister to introduce a Bill of this kind.  There must be a place in which to detain those who break the law.  Those who damage property or person must be catered for in institutions in which they can be rehabilitated so that they will emerge as publicspirited citizens and not just law breakers.  With regard to the supervision by Army personnel of prisoners in the Curragh.</P>

      <P>We have a guarantee from the Minister that this will only be for the period during which Mountjoy is being repaired and reconstructed. I do not know why the Minister wants the legislation to operate for one hour longer than the time taken to complete that work.  The Government are not being honest in this matter because of the speed with which they are steamrolling this measure through because they want to have certain prisoners under military supervision for longer than is necessary.  These are the difficulties I find and the reason why I support the amendments tabled. Citizens have certain rights and it is our duty to protect these rights.  It may be said that a citizen loses his rights when he breaks the law and becomes a prisoner, but the law should be such as to give these people the rights to which they are entitled.  Any prisoner found guilty of breaking the law and sentenced should be sent to the ordinary State prison administered by State machinery and not under Army supervision. It has been argued that however desirable it may be to find immediate accommodation for prisoners it will now be left in the hands of the Minister for Justice to decide what type of prisoner will be under military supervision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my point and I can make any further points on the Final Stage but I want to go on record as saying that it is wrong for the Government to rush this Bill through the House, as they are doing, depriving Deputies of time to deal with a vitally important piece of legislation. It may have become necessary in unusual circumstances but if it will take over 12 months to restore Mountjoy why could we not have at least one week to discuss this measure in Parliament? Therefore, I want to express my disapproval of the hasty, panic fashion in which the legislation is being <Col N="266" /> put through the House.  At the same time I agree with and wholeheartedly support the idea that we must have law and order and that people who break the law must be put away.  This House must also ensure that there is justice and proper supervision and that prisoners will get whatever privileges the law entitles them to get.  This Bill is inclined to take away certain rights from those convicted as regards the manner in which they must pay the penalty for the duration of their sentences and the circumstances in which they are detained.</P>
      <P>The Minister says Deputies will be welcome to see what conditions are in Mountjoy.  Could he give an undertaking that during the operation of this period any Deputy who desires to inspect the conditions of prisoners detained at the Curragh will get the same facilities, not for the purpose of causing embarrassment but in order to see that justice is done to those who may be detained there, that there are proper conditions, that the sanitary arrangements are in order and that in general the conditions which would operate in either Portlaoise or Mountjoy are maintained?  To my knowledge prisoners' conditions in Portlaoise could not be improved. When we are detaining people for 12 or 15 months or two years in the Curragh in the absence of the experience of qualified prison governors such as we have in Mountjoy and Portlaoise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I completely disapprove of rushing this measure through the House.  There is an element of dishonesty associated with it and I want to go on record as having said that.  Finally, will the Minister agree that if Deputies feel it necessary to visit the Curragh dentention camp, where certain prisoners at the discretion of the Minister will be maintained, they will be given the Minister's co-operation in satisfying themselves that conditions are as they should be?</P>

      <P>The Minister is not here now and there is one point I should <Col N="267" /> like to have clarified.  Perhaps the Minister for Transport and Power might be able to clarify it.  I understand the Minister has suggested that in six months he is prepared to have this matter reconsidered if it is raised in the House, that is the termination issue.  In the Minister's amendment it is stated:</P>
      <P>This section shall continue in operation until 31st day of May, 1974.</P>
      <P>He is prepared to withdraw the remainder of that.  If that is so, would the Minister be able to say if he considers it is possible to terminate it at an earlier date without having amending legislation brought into it, in view of the fact that this is written into the existing Bill?  Would it not be preferable to have all the amendments withdrawn and the original text left with a guarantee from the Minister that he would be prepared to allow the matter to be raised after six months?  I should like to have that clarified before we make up our minds.</P>

      <P>May I point out that by deleting sections 1 and 2 in the original Bill we are taking out the power of resolution totally.  If we merely accept the first line of the Minister's amendment we are confining everything to the 31st May, 1974.  All we then have is an assurance, a very definite one, by the Minister that he would consider any resolution from the Labour Party in say six months time to change or terminate the operation of the Act.  There is a genuine difficulty. It may be, as Deputy Tully suggests, that if we delete the word &ldquo;later&rdquo; and leave in the question of the resolution as suggested by the Minister also, we could proceed on that line.</P>

      <P>We are aware of that. There is no point in talking of this afterwards.  Let us clear it now.  The amendment states:</P>
      <P>This section shall continue in operation until the 31st day of May, 1974, or such later date (if any) as may for the time being stand specified by resolution of Dáil Éireann passed at a time when this section is in operation, and it shall then expire.</P>
      <P>If the Bill is passed by this House and the Seanad and is signed and becomes law&mdash;although there may be a doubt about that and there could be a stormy passage if somebody decides to take it to the High Court&mdash;would the Minister be able to say there is no resolution required if we have a closing date?  If the date is 31st May, 1974, we will then have no resolution or no necessity of having a resolution passed.  Does the fact that a final date is specified mean that there is then no necessity for a resolution for a date?  Will somebody at a later stage, perhaps the present Minister, say &ldquo;that would only be if a resolution had been passed but no resolution was passed.  Therefore 31st May, 1974, must stand as a date&rdquo;.  It is only a matter for clarification.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3), page 2, line 20, to delete &ldquo;or prison staff&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to limit the operation of this section of the Bill to the problems arising from shortage of accommodation.  The reason for the Bill was the damage done to accommodation in Mountjoy Prison.  The words which I propose to delete are ones whose inclusion would justify the transfer to military custody of certain prisoners simply because the Minister had failed to ensure adequate prison staff.  This is a different issue.  Because the building has been damaged does not seem any reason for giving the Minister power to remedy inadequacies on his part in relation to the recruitment of prison staff by transferring people to military custody.  The stated object of the Bill is to deal with the situation at Mountjoy. The inclusion of these words widens the operation of the Bill unduly and introduces another principle altogether whereby the Minister can hive off his responsibility for not employing prison staff and then say: &ldquo;Take them away to the Curragh and put them in the charge of the Irish Army.&rdquo; This is objectionable and for that reason I put down this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree that this amendment is a reasonable one.  Possibly the Minister did not think of the situation in that way when the section was being written.  All of us agree that the prison staff have bewhich certainly were not usual.  While haved very well&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in circumstances <Col N="272" /> there was a slight suggestion made by Deputy FitzGerald, I am sure he did not mean to cast a slur on a certain official when he asked about the official going around with a master key of the prison in his possession.  I have never been in a prison in my life and I hope to stay out of it too, but we must all appreciate that in order to carry out his normal duty it would be necessary for a senior official to carry a key such as was in this man's possession. He as well as those who are under him deserve all credit for doing a tough job very well.</P>
      <P>One thing which the Minister, who is now present, might convey to the Minister for Justice is in connection with the recruitment of staff, which is effected by this section.  In my opinion, it is not being dealt with properly, because I understand some excellent people who have been interviewed have not been appointed because of their lack of knowledge of the Irish language.  While it is a grand thing to know Irish and everybody should make an effort to learn it, if a suitable person offers himself for a job such as this&mdash;and we know what we mean by a suitable person: good character, good physique and so on&mdash; it is ridiculous that because he has not brushed up his Irish before he goes in for the interview and because of a stupid requirement like this the Minister can say in this House: &ldquo;I am sorry, we cannot get the staff.&rdquo;  I would suggest that this amendment by Fine Gael should be accepted by the Minister, as it would improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am sure Deputy FitzGerald's amendment will have the wholehearted support of this House and I am convinced that it will be accepted by the Minister.  We should place on record that there are no more dedicated personnel in the Public Service than the staff of our prisons.  As a result of the passing of this legislation it may be possible for the Minister for Justice to use the circumstances at Mountjoy and the fact that certain prisoners will be detained in military custody as an excuse for not employing additional prison officers.  I have never been, I <Col N="273" /> am happy to announce, in the custody of these prison officers, but from my experience I know they are highly trained and devoted to the rehabilitation of those in their charge.</P>
      <P>I have known for over 30 years, certainly much longer than the Minister for Justice, the Governor of Mountjoy Prison.  It is only right that it should go on record that no single person in the Public Service has done more to reform and rehabilitate many of those who are in his charge.  This same governor has impressed on his staff the necessity to be human and sympathetic towards prisoners and do all in their power to rehabilitate those prisoners.  A few moments ago when I was speaking on the other amendments you, Sir, correctly advised me that I was not in order.  I feel I am in order now on this amendment in saying that the Army personnel would not have the same understanding or method of approach in dealing with prisoners or prison officers.  I would like to impress on the Government the necessity for continuance of recruitment of men of the very high standard of those who are in our prison service.  Many of them have entered on a career in which they feel they can do something useful and effective in life.  They are there not because it is a job but because they are devoted to their calling in the same way as a doctor or a nurse is devoted to his or her calling.  They feel that they have a contribution to make towards rehabilitating the less fortunate citizens who find themselves in conflict with the law.  Many of those who have served various sentences in our prisons are now rehabilitated in life and in employment and have never since broken the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one section of our Public Service of which we can be proud. These prison officers seldom come under notice or discussion but, by their humanity, sympathy and understanding, they have done great work in Portlaoise, Mountjoy, Cork and Limerick. I hope that recruitment will be continued and that some arrangement can be made between the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Defence so that there can be some form of <Col N="274" /> liaison between the prison officers and the military authorities in order to ensure that those who will be detained will not find themselves under the complete supervision of the military authorities. I do not know if Deputy FitzGerald and Deputy Tully have considered this matter, but since there is about to be detention at the Curragh, I am wondering if there could be a sharing of responsibility between the Army authorities and the prison officers staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support Deputy FitzGerald's reasoning on this amendment.  However, I believe that Members of the House are not being entirely honest in facing up to the implications of the section and the Bill itself.  It may be appropriate to pose the question: What if some of the prisoners are not amenable, in any circumstances, to supervision by prison staff?  If the accommodation were fully adequate, if the prisoners could not be kept in normal security in normal prison circumstances, what if they would not respond?  This is the nub of the Bill, the reason why the Bill was introduced.  It is fortuitous as far as the Government are concerned that there was a particular occurrence in Mountjoy which the Government have availed of to have a second form of detention&mdash;military and custodial. Therefore, I wonder as to real purpose or value of the amendment.  If one deletes the words &ldquo;prison staff&rdquo; there will remain the sole question of prison accommodation.  I believe that the words &ldquo;prison staff&rdquo; should be deleted. It is implied in the amendment that there is a security problem facing prison staff.  I do not think we should stress the point.  Therefore it would be as well to delete the words &ldquo;prison <Col N="275" /> staff&rdquo; and as soon as prison accommodation is adequate and is restored to normal the prisoners concerned would go back to normal prison life.</P>
      <P>I must confess that section 3 as it stands and as it is proposed to be amended raises the whole question of military custody and it is an issue which deserves to be thoroughly teased out.  The most remarkable feature of this debate has been the total absence of any contribution from the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>The next point I want to make is to support what Deputy Tully has said on the question of recruitment of prison staff.  There is nothing that would be more abhorrent than that the imposition of a condition in respect of the Irish language would be used as an excuse to lock people up in military custody rather than in civil custody.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that in the recruitment of prison staff, announced by the Minister for Justice, any inhibitions of that kind will not be allowed to stand in the way of recruiting sufficient staff and that if there are any provisions or regulations that they will be waived.  The emergency is much too serious for this.  We are not in the position where, when we recruit for the Army, we insist that they can speak Irish and allow the country to be defenceless because of people's inadequacy in that language.  I do not see why that should be so in the case of prison staff.  I would be glad if the Minister could offer me an assurance there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody is in doubt about that.  We are talking about any regulation which would say that nobody could be recruited who was not fluent in Irish.  Of course, every effort should be made to recruit people who are fluent in Irish.  Of course, the present staff have been recruited on that basis and, of course, therefore, the fact that some recruits in this emergency period might not have Irish would not mean that there would not be the great majority of the prison staff capable of conversing in Irish. That was implicit in what I said.  I am glad that Deputy Tunney has given me the opportunity of making it explicit.</P>
      <P>The third point I want to make is something which Deputy Tully raised. I am glad of the opportunity of making it clear that I did not intend last night any reflection on a particular officer because I was trying to pinpoint responsibility on the Minister and to inquire from him precisely what were the circumstances in which this riot happened.  If anything I said appeared to reflect on an officer, it was inadvertent and I would certainly like to withdraw it and I am glad that Deputy Tully has given me the opportunity to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the particular point of the wording here, &ldquo;prison staff&rdquo;, I want to press this point: Deputy Desmond <Col N="278" /> seems to suggest that the inclusion of this might in some way open it up to the Minister to transfer prisoners to military custody because it would be beyond the powers of the prison staff to control them.  My understanding of the word &ldquo;insufficient&rdquo; in this context is that it means numerically insufficient. The inclusion of &ldquo;prison staff&rdquo; therefore merely means that an insufficiency of number of prison staff would under this Bill justify a transfer. There is nothing in this Bill that would justify transfer of prisoners, as I understand it, on the basis that the prison staff were incapable, by virtue of some incapacity, of handling prisoners.  Transfer would only arise if they were incapable of doing so by virtue of inadequate numbers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to see that the Minister agrees with me on that point.  We are down then to the question as to whether the opportunity provided by this riot should be used to introduce legislation enabling the Minister for Justice to shrug off his responsibility for the recruitment of prison staff by transferring prisoners over to military custody because he has not recruited enough prison staff. It is suggested that if the riot had not occurred the Minister would not have been coming in here seeking this power.  There is no reason why he should take advantage of it to get this power now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I do not think I can.  I am concerned about the reality of the situation.  I think Deputy FitzGerald at the end of his contribution got to the nub of it.  It is quite clearly included in subsection (3) to accommodate a situation that could arise very easily.  Once we are bringing in a measure of this kind it is important that all the eventualities should be covered.  One of the realities of the situation may be that there <Col N="279" /> may be an insufficiency of prison staff and if that is the case then the subsection covers it.  It is designed entirely to cover eventualities.  Prison staff recruitment is being accelerated.  There have been a number of interviews very recently for this purpose.  The personnel are being increased.  The main purpose of the subsection&mdash;and it does not seem to me to make very much point to delete by way of amendment, as suggested, &ldquo;or prison staff&rdquo;&mdash;is to cover eventualities, to cover situations that may arise.  It is a perfectly practical coverage envisaged in the subsection and in my view the proposed amendment would delimit the subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>

Whenever the Minister is of opinion that neither is suitable to do the particular job that is envisaged here, we transfer the powers and so on as set out in the remainder of the Bill.  It all fits in and it would be an unnecessary minimisation of the effect of the Bill to have this amendment accepted.  I am certainly against it.</P>

      <P>In subsection (3), page 2, line 29, after &ldquo;him&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that only that number of persons who cannot be accommodated in prisons in reasonable conditions of custody without serious detriment to the maintenance in prisons of the normal arrangements for the rehabilitative treatment and welfare of prisoners, shall be so transferred&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one of the most important amendments to the Bill because, as drafted, the Bill imposes no limits on the number of persons who can be transferred to military custody.  It does not require that those numbers should be limited to the number for whom no accommodation, or as the Bill now exists, inadequate staff exist to look after them and to accommodate them. What this amendment seeks to do is to ensure in so far as, but only in so far as, the accommodation and staff is inadequate to cope with prisoners in civil prisons then whatever surplus of prisoners who cannot be so coped with <Col N="281" /> can be transferred to military custody. As the stated purpose of the Bill is to deal with this emergency problem, this surplus of prisoners who cannot be catered for within the existing system because of what has happened in Mountjoy, it is entirely logical, entirely in concert with the spirit and the intent of the Bill, to delimit the provisions of the Bill in this way.  It seems to me there can be no objection to this amendment if the Minister in his opening statement was being honest with us.  He has protested that he was being honest in giving us the full picture.  If that is the case, and I am prepared to accept that from him, then this amendment must be accepted. There may be some drafting problems but we gave a good deal of thought to drafting and the wording of the conditions has been drawn from the Bill itself.  We say:</P>
    <P>Provided that only that number of persons who cannot be accommodated in prisons in reasonable conditions of custody without serious detriment to the maintenance in prisons of normal arrangements for the rehabilitative treatment and welfare of prisoners, shall be so transferred.</P>
    <P>These are precisely the conditions laid down in the Bill and this simply says that the Bill shall be used only for the purpose stated in the Bill and that there shall be no question of using the Bill to hive off responsibility and to transfer prisoners who can be accommodated in civil prisons.  I think there can be no opposition to this so I shall not waste the time of the House any further on this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  We are not talking about socalled political prisoners and the rest. We are talking about vital constitutional points on which the survival of this Bill may depend.  The Minister seems to be imperilling it every time he speaks on the subject.  Will the Minister not accept that in so far as he describes military custody as being different from normal custody, as being a custody which is more secure involving conditions which will create greater security, arguably this means different conditions for the prisoners? In this case any attempt by him to select prisoners on a basis of what he regards as their recalcitrance or their liability to cause trouble and to send them to a different kind of custody is, <Col N="284" /> of its nature, unconstitutional.  The more the Minister introduces that principle the more trouble he is in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That principle does not necessarily arise here.  The Deputy should remember that at the moment the Minister for Justice has considerable discretion in his treatment of sentenced people.  For example, I am empowered to transfer them from one prison to another&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>From one civil prison to another civil prison with similar conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.  For example, the conditions in Portlaoise prison, which was formerly known as our convict prison, clearly are different from conditions in the Limerick or the new Cork prisons which are prisons for persons serving short terms of imprisonment. One must differentiate even within Mountjoy itself&mdash;there are different classes there.  There are people who after a time are entitled to be treated in the corrective training unit and the treatment in that unit is different from that in the division for what might be described as ordinary convicted prisoners.  In turn, the conditions there are significantly different from what remand prisoners are subject to; one might say each class has a different category of rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We accept that. When a judge sentences a person to prison he is sentencing him to a condition of confinement which may vary in detail from prison to prison, even within a prison, depending on a prisoner's behaviour.  We are talking here of the handing over of prisoners to military custody, specified by the Minister in his opening speech and in what he has said just now, designed to be so much more onerous in terms of security arrangements as to be likely to create a more disciplined situation among those concerned.  This appears to me to be varying the sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might succeed in getting away with this in the courts on the basis that this Bill simply tries to deal with a situation where there is a surplus of prisoners who cannot be accommodated and that all he is doing is selecting <Col N="285" /> on a non-selective basis a number who have to be temporarily held in military custody.  However, once he starts speaking about selecting recalcitrant prisoners or prisoners liable to cause trouble and putting them in different conditions outside the civil prison, he is probably doing something which could be described as varying the sentence.  The more the Minister speaks about his selecting people on this basis and on the need to be able to put into military custody more than that number that is necessitated by the lack of accommodation in the civil prison, by definition he is estopped from arguing that this is simply an emergency and temporary provision.  The Minister has spoken about recalcitrant people and those liable to cause trouble.  If he is selecting people for different kinds of treatment the constitutional issue could be brought in here.  If the Minister accepts my amendment I hope it will help in some way to protect him from the constitutional consequences of certain aspects of the Bill and of his whole approach to this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy is getting at but, although his point might appear very well in theory, I do not think the Deputy appreciates the practicalities of the matter.  If I pick X number of prisoners and send them into military custody for the reasons set out here, because their retention in ordinary custody would be seriously detrimental to the maintenance in prisons of the normal arrangements for the rehabilitative treatment and welfare of prisoners, I can well be faced immediately afterwards with an action in the High Court looking for a <i>certiorari</i> or possibly habeas corpus on the grounds that I was not right in my judgement.  It might be stated that to transfer 40 prisoners was excessive, that under this section, if this amendment were accepted, I should have transferred only 35 persons.  Evidence would be called to prove that 35 was the correct number to transfer, not 40.  One would have an intolerable situation because no Minister could safely transfer anyone. What the Deputy says may have a certain validity in theory but he must face up to practicalities.  In fact, the <Col N="286" /> provision would introduce a degree of rigidity into the operation of the section which unquestionably would leave the Minister open to vexatious and frivolous actions.</P>
      <P>The Minister frequently may have to make up his mind very quickly when a particular situation arises. Such a situation could arise in an afternoon if a large number of people were arrested and remanded in custody.  I do not think any Minister could reasonably operate under a provision such as this where there would be a solemn finding in the High Court, possibly several months afterwards, by a judge that the transfer of 40 persons to military custody was excessive and that under the provisions of this section 35 should have been sufficient.  I do not think it would be fair to a Minister to bind him to that extent, that a perfectly valid and <i>bona fide</i> transfer order, or series of orders, could be upset afterwards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is concerned with not getting into a position where he can be dragged into the courts on an argument as to whether there were two cells available on a certain night and whether people could have been transferred over to the prison that night.  This seems reasonable and we should like to accommodate him on it.  If we have an assurance that he will operate the Bill in that way we will accept it.  If at some stage it transpires that for prolonged periods there were 12 cells empty in Portlaoise naturally we would come back and take it up with him to find out whether it was in accordance with his assurance.  That is the duty of an Opposition.</P>
      <P>I am asking him if he will give an assurance that this is the way the Bill will be operated.  Of course, we have to be reasonable.  Of course, if there is a spare cell somewhere for a couple of nights we will not complain that somebody was not shifted from the Curragh that night.  Is it the intention broadly that it will be operated in that way?</P>

If the Deputy would come down out of the clouds of theory and put his feet on the ground and see reality, he would realise that you could have ten vacant cells for a long time in a prison but if I were to fill those ten cells with ten people who would wreck that prison, and the whole organisation of it, I would not feel myself bound to bring them back.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now talking in terms which are not warranted by the wording in the Bill.  He is not entitled to talk in terms of certain individuals who may cause trouble. The point is whether the number of persons&mdash;not the number, and quality, or calibre, or political attitudes, or aggressiveness&mdash;would be such that it would be impossible to provide reasonable conditions of custody and secure the maintenance of normal arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that&mdash;insufficient for this purpose.  The Minister is seeking to suggest that the Bill, as drafted, enables him not merely to operate on the basis of the sufficiency in terms of numbers of staff and amount of accommodation but also whether particular individuals put into a prison will cause trouble.  I do not think the Bill justifies that and if it does, it is unconstitutional, I think.  I wish the Minister would not press that point.  It seems to be a very weak argument, indeed.  If he intends to use this Bill selectively and to take people out because he does not fancy the way they might behave, and shove them into military custody, and keep them there while there is accommodation in the prisons, and staff, I do not accept that. I do not believe it is what the Bill gives effect to.  If the Bill does mean that, it is unconstitutional; and I cannot accept it.  If the Minister cannot give the assurance I am looking for, the amendment will have to be pressed.</P>

      <P>I have given the assurance that the sort of people who will be transferred are those who cannot be held in civil prison without serious detriment to the maintenance in prison of the normal arrangements for the rehabilitative treatment and welfare of prisoners.  They are the words in the amendment.  I can give an undertaking to that extent, subject to the point I am making, because I do not want the Deputy to come back afterwards and say, if there are a few vacant cells in a prison, I did not fulfil this undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="289" /> With all respect, the Deputy is a very good arguer in theory, one might say <i>in vacuo</i>, but you must have your feet on the ground and see what the situation is and realise the sort of situation a governor is faced with in an emergency and what that governor can do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is talking himself into a corner.  He will not get away with that.  If he starts transferring people simply because of the way he thinks they will behave and he is taken to court on that, even with the Bill as it stands never mind my amendment, no court will sustain him on that. The wording of the Bill does not relate to how the person behaves or might behave, but to the sufficiency of accommodation and staff.  These are the only criteria in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not tie down how many people the Minister transfers.  It makes it perfectly clear that the only criterion for having a transfer of some kind and some number is sufficiency of staff and accommodation.  If the Minister is brought to court and starts arguing that these people are recalcitrant and he has to keep them in military custody, even though there is accommodation in the prison, the Bill will not support him.  If that is what he wants he had better draft a different Bill and see if he can get it past the Constitution which I doubt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is now playing a very difficult and foolish game of using a Bill designed to deal with the Mountjoy situation, and the lack of accommodation as a result of the Mountjoy situation, to try to get around the Constitution by setting criteria in the Bill while he intends to operate totally different criteria contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. The more he says that, the less will the Bill stand up on any grounds. We are concerned not that the Minister can discriminate amongst prisoners and lock up particular groups of prisoners in the Curragh because he thinks they will cause trouble, but with getting over the problem created by Mountjoy being destroyed effectively, and to ensure that, as from now, prisoners cannot take a habeas corpus action because they are in military custody and get out.  We are trying to help the Minister <Col N="290" /> towards that, but he is playing a different game altogether.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Deputy who cannot, I think, envisage the practicalities of it, the amendment as part of this Bill will not get over the problem of habeas corpus with which I am faced.  It will involve me as defendant in a large number of frivolous actions by people who will say: &ldquo;There are 40 people in the Curragh today; there should be only 35,&rdquo; and start subpoenaing governors to say how many vacant cells they had on the night of 22nd May, or whatever it is, and try then by a process of addition and subtraction to say: &ldquo;There were 40 of us in the Curragh that night but the Minister could have accommodated five of us, if he put two in Cork, and one in Limerick, and one in St. Patrick's, or somewhere else.&rdquo;  The court would then find itself bound to make a nominal finding, at any rate, for the plaintiff in such an action against me.  I would be tied up in knots.</P>
      <P>It would mean that any time you wanted to make a transfer you would have to make all kinds of elaborate calculations as to whether or not it was justified.  I am prepared to operate this reasonably but I cannot be tied down to the sheer mathematical accuracy of one vacant cell which may become vacant at very short notice in Cork.  If a man is in Cork prison for non-payment of a fine and his wife or brother arrives in with the money and hands it to the governor, there and then the governor discharges that man.  That vacancy may occur at 5 o'clock in the evening.  The governor may have reported to the Department at 10 o'clock that morning that he did not have any vacancies.  One could find oneself tied up in the courts in all this kind of trivia.  It would become impossible to operate the section if this amendment were put in.  I see what the Deputy is getting at.  I do not disagree with him in theory but I ask him not to bind me so precisely in words that I would find myself in that situation.</P>

I can see that he does not want to provide a sort of bed bureau such as is operated <Col N="291" /> by Bord Fáilte or the tourist organisations. I was a little alarmed at a statement by the Minister since he came in here.  He said that if he had ten vacant cells in a prison it would not be reasonable for him to transfer to that prison ten prisoners he thought might wreck the place.</P>
      <P>That suggests to me that the Minister, or somebody under his authority, will decide on the type of prisoner who will be detained in the ordinary prisons, and the type of prisoner who will be detained in military custody.  If that is what we are doing, we should say so. If we are providing a political prison let us stop shadow-boxing.  If IRA prisoners who started the rumpus in Mountjoy are to be transferred to the Curragh Camp the Minister should tell the House that.  So far as I know he has not said that, or anything like it, when introducing the Bill.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> I can appreciate that the Minister might be in trouble in discussing existing prisoners but there is nothing to prevent him discussing prisoners who may come into custody months ahead. I get the impression from what the Minister says that he intends to transfer political prisoners, IRA prisoners, to the Curragh.  That may be necessary and it may not be necessary&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but it certainly appears to me that the security was grossly inadequate in Mountjoy Prison, and if it had not been grossly inadequate and if the staff had not been ridiculously inadequate in numbers, what happened last week should not have happened and certainly could not have developed into the riot into which it did develop.  I believe in calling a <Col N="292" /> spade a spade and I believe the Minister has come to the House to introduce a Bill in the terms in which it is, knowing he will have power to be selective under it, to select the prisoners he will send to a certain detention centre.  I think he should tell the House that because it is only a continuation of the sort of shadow-boxing the Taoiseach has been going on with for the past two or three years, in not calling a spade a spade and making a statement today that could mean anything and contradicting it tomorrow.  I am as certain as I can be on anything that the Minister thinks that he has now, or will have in the future, a type of prisoner he cannot either contain or control in a civilian prison and is going to transfer them into military custody. He should say that and ask the House for the necessary powers to enable him to do that.  He should make the case.</P>

      <P>What I am at, and I have said it many times, is endeavouring to solve over the next two years the accommodation problem created by recent events in Mountjoy, bearing in mind, and I must bear it in mind as a result of what happened last Thursday night, that there is a certain type of prisoner in our prisons who is more liable than another type, shall we say, to cause this trouble.  I must bear that in mind, but that is only a factor I keep in the back of my mind.  The problem I have is that I have not enough accommodation and if I did not get the Curragh the other day, I would have had to release 40 people. <Col N="295" /> I would not want to release 40 people and particularly if the reason I was releasing them would in effect have been their own criminal actions last Thursday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to help the Minister because I can see that the amendment as drafted could pose problems for him because of a certain rigidity and get him into difficulties in the courts, even where he was doing his best to operate it but where a cell happened to be free on a particular night, but to drop it we need an assurance which is adequate and unfortunately the form of assurance given by the Minister is that he talks selectively about recalcitrant prisoners and it makes it very difficult to accept it when the Bill never contemplates this category. The Bill is concerned with lack of accommodation and staff and I have to repeat my question to the Minister: could he not find some way to say to us that if we do not press the amendment, it is his intention that in so far as accommodation and staff are adequate to provide secure and reasonable conditions of custody and adequate rehabilitative treatment of prisoners, to the extent and only to the extent that accommodation is inadequate for that purpose, he will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed, over quite a period and I did not make transfers back to civil custody at that time.  I would only refuse to make those transfers back to those ten cells if the staff were inadequate in numbers to maintain proper order and to carry out proper rehabilitation and welfare duties.  That covers the point adequately. What I wished to make very clear was that the fact of there being <Col N="296" /> a few vacant cells on a particular night or over a period would not, <i>ipso facto</i>, bind me to withdrawing people from military custody.  I will keep full every civil cell I have provided I have enough civil staff to ensure not only safe custody but proper rehabilitation and welfare work.</P>

      <P>Cork has been in operation since about the middle of February.  There are about 90 prisoners in Cork as a result of the recent transfer which number is much higher than we intended to have there at this stage. However, the governor and staff there are doing remarkably well in the emergency in which we find ourselves.  Cork is entirely a civil prison and the situation is different entirely to the Curragh situation.  At the Curragh the premises we are using are in the centre of a large military complex and it is an impossible situation to try to operate together a civil and a military authority. It is in a military camp so the military must run it.</P>

That is being done since February and will continue to be done notwithstanding the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I wonder if it would be in order for me at this moment to make a suggestion to the Minister? I think the Minister will agree that the debate, especially in the last couple of hours, has become very constructive, that a number of useful amendments have been accepted and that there are very important matters to come.  If on our side of the House we are prepared to agree to expedite amendments as much as possible and to minimise discussion on them, would the Minister be prepared to permit discussion to continue from, say, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.? There is a danger for the Minister as well as for all of us that the Bill might have some defect because of inadequate <Col N="298" /> attention in this House.  I put this proposition to him now and I think we have shown the goodwill that would justify the acceptance of it.</P>

Is he aware that this regulation is now changed and that, irrespective of the number of contributions over the three year period, applicants have to comply with a means test?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that if the school at Mallow is extended with the help of State funds, the burden on the four schools in Cork will be correspondingly reduced <Col N="312" /> and as a result the intake of children there will increase?  Is the Minister not aware that it is exceptionally difficult to get accommodation for mentally handicapped children in Cork at the present time and that parents travel around from both bishops down to the humblest public representative in an effort to influence the school authorities to accept mentally retarded children? This is a disgraceful position. If Mallow is prepared to help to solve the position in Cork county, why not allow them to do so because that would have beneficial repercussions throughout the county and city?</P>

I admit that progress has been made but progress is one thing and demand is another. You have not supplied 25 per cent of the demand for education of mentally handicapped children.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that adequate funds for this purpose are already available.  For example, in the current financial year provision has been made in the Estimates for expenditure of £7,650,000 on ground limestone transport, phosphatic and potash fertiliser subsidies.  Also ground limestone and fertilisers can be obtained on credit at a low interest rate under the land project fertiliser credit scheme. In addition credit is available through the Agricultural Credit Corporation who also operate a special credit scheme for the purchase of fertilisers in collaboration with the commercial banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Hara</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that, for a number of reasons, one of which, of course, is that the fertiliser season is pretty well expired now.  It is worth the Deputy's while to consider that in the recent British price review the subsidies on fertilisers in that country were reduced by 60 per <Col N="314" /> cent.  Ours have not been reduced at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I think, is comparing the total expenditure on fertiliser subsidies last year with the estimates for the coming year. He will, of course, recall that there was a Supplementary Estimate introduced for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries last year.

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware that on the instructions of his Department bacon factories are withholding a sum of £6 per pig from farmers and pig dealers in respect of pigs supplied to them; if he will take steps to have these suppliers paid for their pigs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that, as part of measures to counter serious <Col N="315" /> smuggling of pigs from the Six Counties, my Department has required bacon curers to keep detailed daily records of the sources of all pigs delivered to them; and that, where checks by my Department show the details of origin supplied not to be reliable, appropriate deductions of subsidy are made in respect of curers' pigmeat exports.  The bacon curers have accordingly made it a condition of purchase of all pigs that any export payments disallowed to them will be passed on by them for the account of the pig suppliers concerned.</P>
      <P>These anti-smuggling measures have the support of producers' and curers' organisations and of the Pigs and Bacon Commission and I am glad to say that they have been proving effective as a safeguard for pig producers here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <P>They have nothing to fear at all.  The mechanisms that have been agreed between the farmer organisations and the Pigs and Bacon Commission for the control of the very serious situation that previously existed are working very satisfactorily and if an individual pig producer can demonstrate, as he readily can, that the sources of his supplies are legal and satisfactory he will be paid in full for his pigs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>No positive information as to the financial state of the newspaper industry is available to my Department. The Committee on Industrial Progress in the course of its survey of the Paper Products, Printing and Publishing Industry, examined the position in the national and provincial newspaper sectors and recommended that these sectors should be eligible for re-equipment grants.  The Industrial Development Authority have accepted the committee's recommendation as far as provincial newspapers are concerned and I am informed that a number of firms have applied for these grants.  The question of extending the re-equipment grants scheme to daily newspapers is under consideration.</P>

      <P>The Minister is treating this matter seriously.  In fact, we regarded the matter as so serious that we had a complete investigation carried out into the newspaper industry, both from the provincial and national point of view.  Arising from the recommendations made, the IDA are assisting provincial newspapers with re-equipment grants and are considering the possibility of assisting the national papers in a similar way.  In addition, the report made recommendations to the newspaper industry regarding how they could help themselves.  This is a twoway business.  The recommendations could also be looked at from the point of view of the newspapers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

      <P>The regional industrial plans of the Industrial Development Authority propose as a target, the creation of a total of 600 new jobs in manufacturing industry in Ballina, Killala, Crossmolina and Foxford during the five years 1973-77 inclusive.</P>
      <P>Swinford, Charlestown and Kiltimagh are included in a group of towns with a corresponding target of 650 jobs and Claremorris and Ballyhaunis are included in a group with a target of 300 jobs.</P>

Is the Minister aware that there is a lot of goodwill available to us from people who left these regions and who have prospered in other countries?  Many of them might be inclined to come back to the west of Ireland, particularly to my own constituency, to set up industries.  Something should be done now to enlist the support of these people, to give them an opportunity of using what we might call a &ldquo;back door&rdquo; into Europe.</P>

I am chairman of the South-West Regional Development Organisation where we hear a lot about paper jobs.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In pages 2 and 3, subsection (3), to delete paragraphs (i) and (ii) and to substitute the following paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) in the case of persons on remand, they are brought before the court to which they were remanded,</P>
      <P>( ) in the case of persons sent forward for trial or sentence, they are brought before the court to which they were sent forward and the proceedings in relation to the trial or sentence have concluded, and&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 is related and perhaps we could discuss amendments Nos. 10 and 12 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The basic purpose of these two amendments is to avoid a situation which could potentially exist under the subsection as drafted, whereby if somebody in military custody is brought before a court and further remanded in custody, it might be that the court would have to remand him to a civil prison in the first instance and that <Col N="331" /> a transfer order would have to be made.  His presence in the civil prison would be purely nominal because within a few minutes of his going in, the order would be made to send him back to where he came from and in order to avoid administrative difficulties and possible considerable additional expense in taking a prisoner to the nearest civil prison, we re-worded these two subsections to make that clear.</P>
      <P>So far as the first amendment is concerned, the object is to spell out the cases contemplated in the existing provisions at paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (3) of section 2.  A person brought before a court may be a person brought there on remand or a person sent forward there for trial or on sentence, and in this amendment and the other, the wording we have used is that of section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 12, the amendment proposes to authorise and at the same time require a court before whom a person already in military custody is brought to commit that person to military custody for the period of any further remand in custody or for the period of any sentence of imprisonment imposed by the court.  The amendment also covers the case where a person already in military custody is sent forward in custody for trial or sentence.  Here again the wording follows the wording of section 22 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967. The amendment will avoid the situation that would otherwise arise if the court in any of these cases mentioned were to commit the person concerned to prison, thus making it necessary for the Minister for Justice to direct that the person concerned be again transferred to military custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the common sense of the change in drafting but I wonder is the Minister getting into a constitutional difficulty in regard to amendment No. 12.  It is for the courts to sentence a prisoner to detention and for the courts to impose the penalty, and it is then for the Executive to specify where the sentence shall be served and a matter for the Executive <Col N="332" /> to arrange the transfer within legal limits from one place of detention to another.  The Minister is aware of the constitutional habeas corpus actions arising from wrongful detention, due to technical difficulties and the mechanics of the transfer of a prisoner from place to place.  It is essentially a matter for the Executive, that is, when the court has finished with the prisoner, but what this amendment seems to imply is that the Executive, or Parliament, through this statute, is giving a direction to the court as to where a person being dealt with by the court is to be sent by that court.  In other words, there is a suggestion here that the absolute jurisdiction of the court to order its own affairs is being interfered with, in the sense of the courts being told, &ldquo;When you get AB, he can only be sent back to military custody&rdquo; and this to me seems to be dangerous from the constitutional point of view.  While I see the common sense in it, to save the Minister subsequently having to make an order and effect a physical transfer, something that could be done if this direction were there, I nevertheless think the Minister would be on safer grounds to let the court make its order as heretofore, the Minister then exercising his administrative powers to make the transfer to the different type of custody.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that when a person was further remanded, he would be momentarily brought to a civil court and then this Act would apply to transfer him to military custody.  I would much prefer that the court would facilitate the Government by designating the place of detention for further remand to the only available area.  If this is the justification for the military custody in the Curragh, that there is no other place for these prisoners to be sent on remand, surely the courts&mdash;I am not certain of the technicalities&mdash;would appreciate this point too, if it is to be so.  Could not the courts designate further remand to the Curragh?  Why must it be the Minister and he alone who is to designate persons to military custody at the Curragh?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The objection that we have and which is affected by a later amendment is that we believe the Minister could have got out of this very easily by designating the prison in which these people are being kept as being a prison under the Prisons Acts, 1826 to 1970.  If there is an objection to this being done I would like the Minister to spell out what is this objection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If I did that it would not be military custody because the military could not take control of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>This brings us back to the kernel of the matter.  Does the Minister want military custody?  If he wants a military detention camp, as the Tánaiste referred to it yesterday, let us hear that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I can shorten that for the Deputy.  I wish to put them somewhere and the only place that I can lay my hands on as of now and in the foreseeable future is the military detention barracks in the middle of the Curragh Camp.  I cannot establish it as a civil prison for two reasons: one is that I have not enough staff to cover all the prisons and it at the moment although I am recruiting staff and have been doing so for some months.  The second reason is that the Army authorities would find it impossible to operate in a situation in which there was a different authority in the middle of their property.  To demonstrate the correctness of the point I am endeavouring to make, I would refer Deputy Tully to what I said earlier in reply to Deputy Clinton regarding the position in Cork where the premises are basically the same as those at the <Col N="334" /> Curragh but these physical and staff difficulties did not arise in the case of Cork because the Cork premises are separate and away from the barracks.  In Cork there is only one military barracks while at the Curragh, I understand, there may be as many as half a dozen. There is a sort of general complex of military buildings there and this detention camp is somewhere among those.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the mistake of not going to the Curragh and finding out if the position is as he says.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, they will put forward their side of the story.  While I am not prepared to challenge what the Army have told the Minister, I do not believe he is correct when he says it would not be possible to have a civil prison inside the camp which is not controlled by the military.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton made the point quite strongly this morning that to do so would put the military in an impossible situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Clinton and I come from the same part of the country but that does not mean that I am his keeper or that he is my keeper. I believe it is possible to have a civil prison within a military camp and perhaps I have more experience of military camps than has either Deputy Clinton or the Minister.  The Minister is aware that there are civilians living within these camps but that this does not seem to upset the running of the camps and the overall control remains with the military.  I hope I am wrong in this but I have a suspicion that from the beginning the whole idea in this is to make an effort to put certain people into military custody, in other words, this is a matter of internment under a different heading.  That is our only objection to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole terms of the Bill set out clearly that a person can be held in military custody only if he has been sentenced or remanded in custody or sent forward for trial in <Col N="335" /> custody by a court of competent jurisdiction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister might answer them when I have finished.  I shall be very brief.  So far as we are concerned we want to see law and order in the country but we do not wish to allow the Minister or the Government to introduce under any guise a type of imprisonment that would be objectionable to the vast majority of people.  So far the Minister has not convinced me that this is not what he wants to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, if I interpreted correctly what the Minister said in concluding Second Stage, he indicated that the 40 persons now at the Curragh were those persons who in the opinion of the authorities were responsible for the trouble at Mountjoy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is treading on dangerous ground because there are certain people, I am not saying where they are now, who will be prosecuted as a result of what happened and the Deputy is going the best way possible about having a certain effect on those prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did not the Minister indicate that it was his anxiety to <Col N="336" /> place those persons responsible for the acts at Mountjoy in a place where they, perhaps, would not be in a position to commit such acts again and that, therefore, if 40 persons named by him were sent to the Curragh, is it not only reasonable that anyone would interpret that the majority of those 40 persons are those that the Minister wishes to have removed from the ordinary civil prisons?  What I am suggesting is that these people who will be transferred and others who will be charged by the civil authorities and put on remand would be designated by the Minister to be transferred to the military camp as distinct from any other prison because of their particular affiliations?  Is not this the power that the Government are seeking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>So that this point can be clarified may I inquire from the Minister whether it is a fact that the reason he is now transferring a number of prisoners to where they will be under military supervision is because there is no accommodation for them in any other place?  In view of that would not the Minister consider sympathetically the question of having supervision at the Curragh carried out by ordinary prison officers?  I am sure that the Minister can ascertain from the Minister for Defence that ample living accommodation can be had at the Curragh and that if such accommodation is not available now that it can be made available readily so that the officers concerned could be housed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a very serious objection to prisoners of any kind being under the supervision of the military authorities. I have already expressed that view today. It would be a considerable easement if the general public could be reassured on this point.  Every Member of this House advocates the maintenance of law and order and, if laws are broken, then we all agree there must be a place of detention for law-breakers. My argument is that that place of detention should be under the civil authority and under civil supervision, not the military authority and military supervision.  If the Minister will ensure that prisoners are supervised <Col N="337" /> and catered for by the civil prison personnel that will go a long way towards alleviating public unease. There is a feeling that this is the thin end of the wedge to the opening of internment camps.  It is not the responsibility of the military to be in charge of prisoners.  The Minister should really take another look at this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>According to the Government, this legislation is designed to cater for an emergency situation.  Line 26 stipulates that references to the Minister shall be construed as references to the Minister for Defence. Under subsection (3) the Minister can certify and can direct the transfer to miltary custody of such persons as are specified by him.  That action of the Minister applies only to persons presently in custody and not to persons who may be in custody at some future date.  Is that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanSherwin" hpid="Mr. Sherwin Mr. Sherwin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Then if, in the opinion of the Minister, such person should be transferred to military custody as distinct from the direction of the courts that the person should be transferred to civilian custody, the Minister will change that direction of the courts and direct that that person be transferred to military custody.  There must be some reason for transferring that person to military custody.  The point I made earlier that only certain selected people, because of their affiliations, will be transferred to military custody is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputy Sherwin said is correct.  With regard to the point made by Deputy Cooney, at the moment the court usually sentences people to some form of detention.  It has no option and to that extent there is compulsion on the courts.  I do not think this is any different.  The purpose is not so much to compel the sentencing of people to military custody as to avoid unnecessary administrative work in physical transfers.  I do not think the House need have any concern on that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that, if the court is put in this position, <Col N="338" /> the court will also want to be satisfied that the type of incarceration which will follow will be the same as that which the court can direct at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The conditions will be similar.  If the powers of the court to send someone to a particular institution are limited to that institution the court can make recommendations to me for the removal of the prisoner elsewhere.  That happens frequently.  There was a recent case in which a prisoner on the suggestion of the court was actually committed before the governor took formal custody and the result was the fellow got away with it; he was able to serve almost his entire sentence in an ordinary hospital.  The same thing would apply here.  For that reason I do not think there would be the type of restraint or compulsion that Deputy Cooney fears.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It could happen that a person in military custody would be in a less beneficial atmosphere than a person in civil custody and to that extent his position might be prejudiced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (3) a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) specify the place at which such of the persons aforesaid as are specified by him shall be kept in custody and each place so specified shall be a prison to which the Prisons Acts, 1926 to 1970, apply.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments for this amendment have already been made a number of <Col N="339" /> times.  Of course the arguments against it have also been made.  Nevertheless I still think this amendment should be accepted because it will eliminate most of the problems with which we have been concerned.  It should be possible for the Minister to specify the places and to take control and responsibility for those in charge of them.  The possibility of two kinds of prisons, civil and military, has been well established. I think what the Minister has in mind is that there should be no difference between the two, but these titles have now been given to them and it would be very difficult to get them removed.</P>
    <P>It is not so much the title I am worried about: it is the actual Department and the Minister who will be responsible.  It should be the one Minister. If the difficulties mentioned by the Minister already can be overcome this can be achieved.  I agree there are certain difficulties but where there is a will there is a way.  If we have two kinds of prisons we shall have two kinds of prisoners and there will be an unconscious prejudice in regard to prisoners who may come to the courts on remand from military prisons.  I think the Minister has admitted this and I think he has also admitted that he has in mind specific types of prisoners to be sent to military custody and specific types to be sent to civil custody.  Already we have this prejudging of people and the only way out of it is to have the places of imprisonment all under the Prisons Acts. From time to time prisoners will, of necessity, have to be referred to military custody under this provision, prisoners that the Minister does not intend to place in military custody but because of lack of accommodation in the civil prisons he will possibly have to refer a person sentenced perhaps on a very minor offence to military custody.  The prisoner will then have this label on him.  This situation could also happen in reverse.  I do not think the Minister will be able to adhere to his intention of keeping military custody for a specific type of offender and civil prisons for another type.</P>
    <P>This is a dangerous precedent.  It will <Col N="340" /> prove unworkable and will make people sent to different prisons un-equal in the eyes of the law.  I ask the Minister to accept the spirit of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One brief point: we have our reservations about the Minister's <i>bona fides</i>&mdash;not his personal <i>bona fides</i>, may I say&mdash;in regard to the selectivity of the persons to undergo military custody but we are coerced by the exigencies of the situation to go along with this Bill.  I am personally prepared to do so because I have in mind the provisions in section 1 which allow the House to debate a resolution earlier than 31st May, 1974 if in the meantime evidence of the exercise of selectivity comes to light.  To that extent we are happy in that we can come back for a second look at the measure should the need arise.  So, while we have reservations at present we find ourselves coerced to support it.</P>

      <P>Is there any likelihood that the prisoner convicted of manslaughter and given a term of imprisonment will be imprisoned in the Curragh?  Or will there be selection of prisoners for various institutions?  I do not know any more than the Minister what a political prisoner is.  Certain defendants claim in court in presenting their cases that they are being charged with what are political offences. To me every offence against the law is an offence and contrary to good citizenship. If we are to have a situation in which the Curragh military detention camp will be used for a selected type of prisoner and the Minister will have discretion to send a prisoner to such detention, he should tell the House if he will send a prisoner convicted of drunken driving into military custody at the Curragh?  Or is this military custody only for a special type of prisoner on which the Minister will decide?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong in my opinion to have any prisoner in military custody.  It may <Col N="341" /> be unlikely but it is possible that the Minister may find himself sending a person convicted of drunken driving to the Curragh.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know if that is a possibility. We are not embarrassing the Minister but seeking information.  This is a most serious matter which affects the citizens very much and one on which the House should get all possible information from the Minister to clear the air of uneasiness which may prevail outside the House as a result of this panic legislation.</P>

      <P>I am in the difficulty that perhaps some of the Opposition are at cross-purposes with one another because, while I suspect that some members would like me to exercise a high degree of selectivity of a very special kind, on the other hand the more theoretical Opposition Members would clearly seek to ensure that I should not be selective and would point out that when this matter comes to be discussed in six months time they will make a point of examining whether I was selective in my administration of it.  All I shall say is that there could be no question of prisoners being picked, as it were, by lot for remand in or to serve their sentences in military custody. The principal factors involved would be the state of security and so on in the other prisons and in the military prison.  I could not commit myself to picking types of offenders nor could I commit myself to excluding certain types either.  That is as far as I can put it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The security that existed in the prisons up to Thursday last was more than adequate for any normal <Col N="342" /> type of prisoner or even groups of prisoners such as we have seen in our prisons in the last few decades but where there is a group of 40 determined men whose sole objective is to create havoc in a prison no security except the most severe will ensure with certainty that they will not create that havoc.</P>
    <P>I took the whole paragraph so that it would not be out of context.  The Minister quoted a figure of 40.  There are 40 persons in the Curragh.  He goes on then to speak in relation to remand and the whole question of remand.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but this is very relevant to the first paragraph that I have just read.  The Miniser says:</P>
      <P>The first point in regard to this is that a very high proportion of them&mdash;</P>
      <P>meaning those who are in the Curragh</P>
      <P>&mdash;were in custody on remand of their own volition.  They were there because they chose not to take bail which was offered to them, not because the bail was unobtainable but because as a matter of principle they decided that they did not want to do it.</P>
      <P>I do not see, in retrospect, that I misquoted the Minister.  I understood that the majority of those in the Curragh were persons involved in the disturbances and the majority of those were persons who were in prison because of political offences.</P>

It means no such thing.  It means what it says and that is that.  It does not matter tuppence to me but Deputy Sherwin is acting most improperly <i>vis-à-vis</i> the courts and <i>vis-à-vis</i> people who are now being charged with offences allegedly committed last Thursday in making the sort of statements he is making here and, having read out what <Col N="343" /> I said, going on to say that that means such a thing.

      <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that there is a particular named person who is responsible for the persons kept in military custody.  I understand that in a civil prison the governor is responsible and when there is a question of habeas corpus the courts know who to turn to.  It is obviously important that here also there should be some defined person, perhaps a camp commandant, the commanding officer of the military unit involved, perhaps, as we would hope, a governor appointed from the civil prison service but, at least, some named person who is in charge and known to be in charge and to whom the court can go if there is a habeas corpus issue.

      <P>To add to subsection (7) a new paragraph as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Places in which persons are kept in military custody pursuant to this section shall be open to inspection by a Committee of the Oireachtas to be established in accordance with the procedures of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ease some of the apprehension there might be about this particular type of custody in that such a committee of this House would be in addition to the visiting committee provided under the Prisons Visiting Committees Act.  The Minister will agree that this is an unusual piece of legislation and, as I say, it has implications which make some people apprehensive and it would go some distance towards removing this apprehension if the Minister would agree to a Special Committee of the Oireachtas <Col N="347" /> being established to make periodic visits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, there will be a visiting committee established, in the same way as there is a visiting committee for each of our ordinary civil prisons.  The authority and standing of that visiting committee would be undermined if it were simply a residuary body to a committee of the Oireachtas which would visit occasionally.  I do not think you would get the right type of person to serve on a visiting committee in those circumstances and I do not think that they would exercise the proper independence which a visiting committee should exercise, if they were placed in this subsidiary position. The rules which will be made will establish a visiting committee and will give them all the powers which civil prison visiting committees have and will give the prisoner, through them, all the safeguards which a prisoner in a civil prison would have. I do not think a committee of the type suggested in the amendment would be warranted.  In fact it would not be desirable at all.</P>

He must show some relationship, some connection or some friendship.  So far as inspecting the prison, as such, is concerned that would be a matter for the Minister for Defence and it has been our practice to allow Deputies to inspect when we would not perhaps allow an ordinary member of the public.  I presume the same would apply in a military installation but I do not want to bind the Minister for Defence to that.</P>

In view of the fact that the legalising of military custody is a responsibility of this House, Members of the House, to allay their own or their constituents' fears that things were or were not happening in the Curragh, might want to do this.

      <P>One of these amendments is in my name but I might be able to assist in relation to the others by saying that in view of doubts mentioned by Deputy FitzGerald this morning, though they were not substantiated other than by quoting Senator Kelly, but in case there is anything in those possible doubts I took a look at No. 17 and I consulted the Minister for Defence and the Army about it.  My initial reaction was, with their agreement, to accept amendment No. 17 down as far as the words &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo;.  The Army would not agree to the exclusion of the provisions of the Defence Act, not because it related to prisoners but because it related to other civilian employees and also that it would have hindered their ability to deal with trespassers in the vicinity of the place.  I was going to suggest to Deputies opposite that I would accept amendment No. 17 down to the words &ldquo;Minister for Justice&rdquo; which I think would meet their point because the remainder of the amendment is purely a removal of doubts clause which really is not necessary.</P>

      <P>It sets it out somewhat more fully and explicitly than Deputy Cooney's amendment, as amended, would and for that reason I suggest to the House, particularly as this has been agreed by the military authorities also, that we might use my amendment which I would call 17 (a).</P>

      <P>...such regulations shall correspond as closely as practicable to the rules for the time being in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="351" /> That is not the same as our amendment which was much more specific. I would be worried that the suggestion there that they might not correspond totally might be disadvantageous from the point of view of the constitutional issue which I raised.  Would the Minister be willing to agree to delete the words &ldquo;as closely as practicable&rdquo; and simply state &ldquo;the regulations shall correspond to the rules for the time being in force&rdquo;?  If that were the case I would be happy to accept his amendment and this might make it easier for Deputy Pattison to accept it also.</P>

If that is his view I should prefer to go back to our own amendment and keep the first three lines which cover the point adequately and leave the Minister's amendment. The Minister's amendment may be preferable from other points of view, and in dropping these words which do not exist in ours and which in view of his acceptance of ours cannot be essential, it might be better to accept his amendment with these four words out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>To add to subsection (8) new sub-sections as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Any place in which persons are kept in military custody pursuant to this section, and the staff of such place whether members of the defence forces or of the prison service, shall be under the direct control of a governor who shall be a member of the prison service and all prisoners in military custody shall be deemed to be in the legal custody of the governor.</P>
      <P>All persons in military custody shall be deemed to be in the custody of the officer in charge of the place of military custody.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This goes back to the difficulty we have had all along.  Many people consider it was not entirely necessary to have such a clear distinction between the civil and military parts.  To emphasise the temporary nature of the change and to further emphasise the Government's desire not to introduce military detention <i>per se</i> in tabling this amendment we felt that if the person in control of the military prison establishment were to be an officer of the prison service it would help to clear <Col N="354" /> the air and remove many of the doubts.  Our amendment also states that persons in military custody shall be deemed to be in the legal custody of the governor.</P>
    <P>If a prisoner in a civil prison suffers an accident in the course of his work, if he is doing rehabilitative work, the person he would sue would be the governor.  I do not know who would be responsible for any liability he might be entitled to avail of.  I understood there was a decision that the governor was in the same position as the occupier of a factory and had the various statutory obligations to provide safe systems and so on&mdash;I am subject to correction on this.  If this is to be a prison in which normal treatment, employment and control are to prevail this will involve some kind of employment or rehabilitation. Should a prisoner be injured through the negligence of a fellow-prisoner, through faulty machinery or in such a way that would give rise to a common law action for damages, it would be clear whom he should sue.  I understood that the person who had the legal liability to him was the governor, although I am subject to correction on this point.  That is why we have included in the amendment the statement that the prisoner is in the legal custody of the governor.  That is why we drafted the amendment to provide that the person in charge shall be a civilian.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that under a recent decision of the Supreme Court&mdash;unfortunately I do not have the name&mdash;the proper person to be sued by a prisoner in respect of a tort in a civil prison would be the Minister for Justice.  Accordingly, the proper defendant to be named in a military prison would be the Minister for Defence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, because the relationship of the Minister for Defence to a prisoner in his custody is the same as mine to a prisoner in mine. The amendment seeks to have a civil governor and, unfortunately, that is <Col N="355" /> not a practical proposition.  You either have one thing or the other.  I am afraid it is impossible to mix them. The Army are quite adamant on this. It must be either one or the other.  We cannot have a civilian involved in military administration, nor can we have military under a civilian, particularly when the premises concerned are in the middle of a military complex.</P>
      <P>With reference to the second paragraph of the amendment, all persons in military custody will, of course, be in the custody of the governor as designated in accordance with the rules by the officer commanding the barracks or the camp.  The question of liability to a prisoner for a tort, for example, will be covered in the prison rules made for the military prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We strongly urge the Minister to accept the amendment proposed by Deputy Cooney and his colleagues.  The precise procedure whereby individual persons convicted on criminal charges will finish up in military custody is still unclear to us. If a person goes before the criminal courts or, as we may now anticipate before the special courts to be estabished, as indicated by the Minister this morning, on his appearance before such courts will there be a special file and will he be immediately transferred to military custody, or will he go to the normal prison and then into military custody if that is specified by the Minister?</P>
      <P>The issue of committal into the prison system arises.  While there can be a legitimate and valid argument for military custody for certain individuals, that does not necessarily mean that the custodial and legal care of such prisoners should lie exclusively with the Army authorities.  It is manifestly fair and entirely legitimate that an amendment should be suggested in this House to provide for a regular prison governor from the regular prison officers staff with an overall legal watch dog effect on the care of prisoners in military custody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is as concerned as he says he is about lack of adequate prison accommodation and lack of adequate prison staff&mdash;and after all <Col N="356" /> these are the two reasons why persons are to be committed into military custody&mdash;since there is an abundance of governor calibre staff available within the service, there is no good reason why the Minister could not appoint or promote some acting governors and designate them as governors of the military custodial establishments.  This can be done. There is no great difficulty in it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will not have any great legal difficulty in dealing with the Department of Defence on the matter.  At least there should be in each what one might call military detention centre, which in effect is what is being opened, a resident civilian governor who could be entrusted with some supervisory control over prisoners in military custody.  Such prisoners may well be handed back to him at any point in time for transfer back into a normal prison.  Therefore, it is entirely legitimate that such a prisoner should have the benefit of the normal prison service.  Otherwise we will be establishing in a very regular and orthodox manner military detention centres for selected groups of prisoners.  While I think this is the intent behind the Bill, it would be highly undesirable that we should formally legalise it without the safeguard of a civilian governor in charge of such institutions.</P>

This Party indicated that our support would be conditional on the Bill being of limited duration and I am happy to say that the Minister, in regard to that particular point, has met us by putting a time limit on it, albeit slightly longer than we would have liked, and in addition, there is provision for the House to pass a resolution terminating the Bill at an earlier date, or should the emergency still exist after two years&mdash;I hope it will not be the case&mdash;to allow the Bill to continue beyond the termination date.

    <P>In addition, he has accepted further amendments from us, particularly amendment No. 17, the effect of which is to delete subsection (8) of Section 2 and to substitute a new subsection drafted by the Minister on the lines of our amendment.  This subsection has the effect of providing that the regulations which cover the custody, employment and treatment of persons in temporary military custody will correspond to those which govern prisoners in ordinary prisons.  This again goes a long way towards removing the taint of military internment from the Bill.  I can say too that it has <Col N="360" /> been a very worthwhile exercise to have had this debate.  It emphasises the importance of always leaving sufficient time to enable legislation to be adequately debated.</P>

      <P>We are not happy even with the final product as we see it now but we do have regard to the necessity to provide some alternative space for the time being.  We were not happy with the open-ended nature of the Bill as it was introduced yesterday and we accept the Minister's guarantee that the provisions of the measure will be open to scrutiny, to full debate and examination, in this House in six months time and that we can seek at that time a repeal of its provisions and that if the Minister wishes to continue it after that time, he will have to justify continuing it after six months. For that reason we feel that there is a certain safeguard in the Bill which will tend to take from it some of the more objectionable parts which it originally contained.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cooney in his comment that this exercise has been a good one.  We managed to make the Bill a little less unacceptable anyway and we would hope that when we come to the special resolution which we will be putting in in six months time, we will be able to say that our worst fears have not come true and that the Minister will be able in return to tell us that good progress has been made on Mountjoy, and at that stage that he feels he can set even a much earlier date than 13th May, 1974, which he has included in the amended version of the Bill.  We do not like this rushed form of legislation and it really was not necessary, I still think, to rush it in this manner, but even in this rushed manner, we have succeeded in improving the Bill quite a lot and if we had had more time to consider it and even to debate the various Stages, we would possibly have succeeded in making it much less objectionable still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind the Minister of his guarantee of a review of the provision in six months and that we certainly will be very much on the ball when that period comes.  We would hope that there will never again be a necessity to introduce legislation like this, which <Col N="361" /> can give rise to very legitimate fears and suspicions, and we feel that the reasons for it should never have arisen if the necessary steps had been taken by the Government.  We would hope to see the administration of justice carried out far better in future so as to avoid this type of very objectionable legislation, but we feel that we cannot deny, in the circumstances of the destruction of Mountjoy, that some provision like this is necessary and this unfortunately appears to be the only means available to fill the gap while Mountjoy is partially out of use.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, in the Third Schedule under (d) dealing with unfair practices, could the Minister give us an instance where a person might unjustly enhance prices of goods or charges for services or promote unfairly at the expense of the public the advantage of suppliers or <Col N="365" /> distributors of goods or of persons providing services?  At Question Time today we asked the Minister for a hypothetical case and the Minister was unable to give us a hypothetical case. Surely, if you enact legislation either to stop a gap or open a gap, the very least we should know is what gap we are opening or closing, as the case may be.  We should know what gap we are opening or closing.  Can we have a hypothetical case where this unfair practice might occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy asks what potential fault can be found with unjust pricing of goods.  One reads into that that prices of goods or services are enhanced.  That could happen arising out of a monopoly situation where one, being the only one to provide a service in a given area, would charge too much for it.  In the same way, in the unlikely event of there being only one person producing some goods they could overcharge for those goods on the basis that none would otherwise be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not true that in the case of only one person producing a certain type of goods or a certain branded article, the Minister always intervenes and fixes a maximum price? The only case I can think of where the Minister did not do this was in the case of beer, wine and spirits as sold in lounges and public bars.  The Minister did not fix an actual price.  It might vary from one place to another as in that trade it would be proper for it to do.  But could the Minister tell me where he has not acted with other legislation to provide for a maximum price for one particular article where there was a monopoly situation or only one provider or producer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has instanced a specific field or range where I found it necessary to take specific action in the licensed trade arising from a collective announcement of the fact that they were going to charge what I felt was an excessive price for drink.  I was in a position to take steps to deal, as I saw it, effectively with that situation then.  On the other hand, you can have a situation where a group of people can get together and <Col N="366" /> arrange an exorbitant price for a given article.  Perhaps the facilities available in the prices section might not be sufficient to establish the fact that this was a co-ordinated practice and one could then pass the matter to the examiner under the Restrictive Practices Bill.  If the Deputy devoted time to the matter he could visualise quite a wide field where the possibility would arise of prices for goods or services being unjustly enhanced.  It would nearly be more likely to occur in that field where a group of people giving a particular service could charge an exorbitant price.  It might not be so easy to determine the basis on which one could substantiate the allegation of an exorbitant charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If, for instance, a profession decided that there were certain areas in which a person who resided or practised in another area should not practise, would this be regarded as unfair?  For instance, if the town agent of a professional man would not act in respect of property or services to be provided in a country area and one would have to go to a country agent, would the Minister regard that as an unfair practice?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If I reside in Cork and wished to have certain professional services in Louth and if I went to a professional man in Cork, the proper procedure would be for the man in Cork to do his business for me through the ordinary channels without reference to an agent in Louth.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the fair practice rules under subsection (2) there is an opportunity for citizens to make representations.  I take it that is all a citizen can do.  There is no provision for recourse to a parliamentary agent to try to get a private citizen's Bill into the Dáil or Seanad? He has no other recourse except to let the commission know his views? That is really all he can do?  As in the case of the President and the Council of State, he consults them but after that, he may, if he wishes, do the exact opposite of what they advise.  He is free to do this under the Constitution.  In this case the commission is free to do the exact opposite to what a person or group of persons might advise?  The commission is all-powerful in regard to fair trade rules?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the fair trade rules create a code of practice which is recommended.  The rules devised by the commission are not mandatory unless, arising from complaints coming through the examiner subsequently as a result of non-adherence to the rules, an inquiry results in the commission making a recommendation to the Minister and an order being made which is confirmed by the Oireachtas.  The fair practice rules of the commission are recommended rather than mandatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a person takes note of the fair trade rules in regard to a certain trade or profession he does not break the law if he does not operate these rules but if there comes to the examiner a volume of complaints, he might then find himself on the wrong side of the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the exercise, first, as far as the former Fair Trade Commission was concerned and the Restrictive Practices Commission under this Bill would be, having examined a situation, to make those fair practice rules which they would hope would be adhered to by people in the particular business or profession for which the rules would be designed.  Those rules are there by way of recommendation.  The Deputy asked did I think it right that the rules should not be made mandatory so that any group that had to abide by the rules would commit an offence in breaking them.  I do not want the Restrictive Practices Commission to be committed to making a whole set of fair trading or fair servicing rules for every section of the community. That would mean that we would develop a robot-like society.  What I visualise is that if the commission make fair practice rules and a series of complaints come to be examined, the examiner, on being satisfied that there was a breach of the rules, would refer the case to the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is spelt out in the Bill.  The publication comes when, arising from the submission of the complaint, the commission before holding an inquiry must publicise the fact that they are doing so.  So that affected parties not alone have the opportunity of being heard but they must also be supplied with a copy of the examiner's submission to the commission. They will be fully equipped to give a full account of their stewardship to the commission and to defend themselves against any allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can take the fair trading rules as being the first barrel over their head, as a warning.  The <Col N="369" /> second barrel is a second warning.  If a set of fair trading rules are made for an industry, trade or profession, the person concerned can take that as a warning light and should consider whether or not he is abiding by the rules.  At a given stage, as a result of the inquiry, a more concrete situation develops.  Take the case of a person who having seen the rules and not having abided by them but over a given period of time does not break the law.  Could that person find himself in the position of having retrospectively broken the law? He may consider that he has not broken the law but the inquiry finds that he has broken the law.  Could this man find himself on the wrong side?  I think he could and this is what worries me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister if he intends to be absolutely specific in relation to section 8.  The Minister and I are in trade. The other persons involved in drafting this Bill are civil servants.  I am sure the Minister did not draft every line of the Bill.  I should like that persons engaged in trade or commerce or manufacturers would be clearly defined and <Col N="370" /> that there would be no question of a person finding himself in the grey area between black and white.</P>
      <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether or not it is his intention to safeguard decent people from prosecution or from the danger of finding themselves on the wrong side of the law.  I would ask him to be utterly specific in his orders in relation to restrictive practices so that a person would not find himself wondering whether or not an action he took in respect of the provision of goods or services was in breach of the Minister's order.  I should like to be absolutely sure that those engaged in trade and commerce will get a chance to be right or wrong.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> In the context of unfair practices and unfair competition, I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the merger of two supermarkets recently. In last night's paper there was an advertisement indicating that no turnover tax would be charged by these firms.  I am not altogether sure that this is not an unfair practice.  I understood that turnover tax must be charged.  This type of advertisement is misleading to the public.  There might be certain discounts given, but I understand that everyone must pay turnover tax.  Does this come within the category of unfair practice?</P>

      <P>Any order that I would make arising out of a recommendation made to me by the commission cannot be vague.  Our experience of Fair Trade Commission reports down through the years has been that they are pretty exhaustive.  They go into a great deal of detail in the reports saying why they are making specific recommendations, and up to now I do not think we have run into any difficulties with regard to <Col N="371" /> the orders which I or my predecessors made arising out of the 1953 Act.  I do not think the Deputy has any reason to fear that there would be ambiguity in an order.  I thought at first that maybe one of the things that was worrying the Deputy was that this section leaves it optional for the Minister to make an order arising out of the commission's recommendations.</P>

      <P>This subsection in itself re-enacts subsection 9 (1) of the 1953 Act, suitably amended, to provide for a service, but, in addition, drafting changes have been made to tighten the text and 8 (1) (b) extends the Minister's power in line with section 7 to prohibit practices and methods of competition which, while not being restrictive, are unfair.  This endeavours to enable the new commission to have a little bit more power than the previous one.  We have always looked upon restrictive practices in the trade as practices whereby a group of people or a cartel get together and fix a high price.  On the other hand, unfair trading can be done with too low a price in the very same way as too high a price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked at Question Time to define &ldquo;unfair trade&rdquo;.  Of course, a convenient definition would be anything that is not fair.  There can be unfair trading in many ways.  One of the difficulties is a high percentage of the distribution of any line being done through one or two channels.  It <Col N="372" /> is quite possible that if there is a sufficient amount of money behind a channel a loss situation can be allowed to continue over a period which that particular firm can stand up to but which other firms cannot stand up to and they find themselves going out of business.  This section, by tightening up the text here and extending it to prohibit unfair practices or unfair methods of competition, would enable this commission to look more deeply into this type of trading than they have been in a position to do.</P>

      <P>I wonder could the Minister be more explicit, in fairness to Deputy Fitzpatrick.  It is suggested that there may be a <i>prima facie</i> case of restrictive practice or a case for investigation where a firm or a particular consortium in the retail trade repeatedly advertises that customers may allegedly purchase their retail products without paying turnover tax. The public are presumably expected to believe the words of the advertisement. Would the Minister not accept that within the context of the Bill there would be a <i>prima facie</i> case for the reference to the commission of such an advertisement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We read a lot about amalgamation at present.  If one of these big firms were to, as has happened in England, go to manufacturers here and say: &ldquo;We will not buy from you unless we can get the goods at a certain price&rdquo; it would mean that Irish industries would be put out of business.  You could also get a continental or an English company with retail outlets in Ireland. They could buy for a period 50/50 Irish goods and the goods of their own country but gradually give better shelf space to their own goods and in that way beat the Irish goods in the long run.  They would do this because they would probably own the manufacturing company in England, France or wherever it was.  The money they would pay to purchase or rent premises in Ireland would be negligible compared with what they would make in their own manufacturing companies. <Col N="373" /> I know that when we enter Europe we must give European, English and our own goods the same chance of being sold, but if these firms own the retail outlets they can push their own goods rather than Irish goods, which would mean a loss of jobs in Ireland. It has happened in England that when retailers get very big they can go along and say: &ldquo;We want a coat made in this particular way.&rdquo;  The manufacturer gives up manufacturing everything else but this coat.  When they get him in that position they can say: &ldquo;We want it at a certain price.&rdquo;  If he does not agree, he is out of business. They gradually squeeze him into the ground.  This could happen here. They could go to, say, Jacobs and say: &ldquo;We want biscuits at a certain price and we have 80 per cent of the outlets.&rdquo;  They could keep coming down in price until eventually Jacobs goes out of business.  Does the Minister follow me?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do.  I am very conscious of this problem.  Perhaps the Deputy was being charitable when he said he knew this was happening in England.  Unfortunately, I am aware that it is happening in Ireland.  This is where the overall strength of the big retail distributor can reach the stage where the use of his power and of the market which he has and the value of his orders to the manufacturer is such that he can put him at a great disadvantage.  If any Minister for Industry and Commerce were to say that the time was nearly nigh when he must start thinking in terms of introducing minimum resale prices rather than maximum ones he would be saying something that would be politically dangerous.  In the grocery trade in particular there is the business advantage of the &ldquo;loss leader&rdquo; and this has created a major problem.  At the present time there is no legislation to prevent anyone from selling an article at a very low price.  From the housewife's point of view quite obviously it would not be popular legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Throughout this Bill the term &ldquo;the common good&rdquo; has been used to a considerable extent.  Essentially what is meant is that the examiner or I can refer to the commission the investigation <Col N="374" /> of certain practices that are developing where the common good might be affected and where it might not be to the advantage of the consumer in the long term.  I am glad to say that the chairman of the Consumers' Association saw the point in this connection with regard to a statement I made recently.</P>
    <P>The general public are becoming aware of the overall danger to the welfare of the community with regard to the practice adopted by distributors of using the &ldquo;loss leader&rdquo; line.  The public are aware that this is not always in the best interests of the consumer. I realise that it will be necessary to introduce a considerable amount of legislation.  I have been speaking for some time about consumer protection. Deputy Fitzpatrick and Deputy Belton drew attention to the problem of the impression created in recent advertisements that turnover tax is not being charged.  There is no doubt that turnover tax must be paid.  The impression may be created that turnover tax is not being charged because it is not being added at the check-out point but the fact is that all distributors must pay this tax.  It is one of my proposals to introduce legislation and make orders indicating that the selling price of articles must be displayed and that the prices indicated must include the taxation element, whether turnover or value-added tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">

      <P>A number of years ago a number of retailers set up in Ireland.  They imported cheap furniture and, in fact, they bought as little as <Col N="375" /> possible from the Irish furniture manufacturers. I am frightened that big companies might come in here when the tariffs go and that they will buy only from the manufacturing companies in England.  In this way they can squeeze out the Irish manufacturer.  Is there any way that the Minister can prevent this happening?  A situation could arise where a firm would approach a manufacturing company for, say, a consignment of chairs.  They might tell the Irish company that instead of paying the normal price of £6 they would only pay £4.  If this were not acceptable to the Irish company the firm might refuse to sell any of the Irish-made goods in their premises.  Is there any way the Minister can control this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is asking a lot here.  We must accept the straightforward fairness of trading. Even though a firm might come here and sell only imported articles which they might sell at a cheaper price, I cannot see myself bringing in legislation to prevent that.  On the other hand, I have enough confidence in the Irish housewife to put her money where her husband's job is although I realise that this is not being done to the extent I would wish.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned an example of a firm telling a manufacturer that they would only pay £4 for an article for which the manufacturer wanted £6&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <P>I am worried about the big power salesman, the man with a monopoly in the distributive business, <Col N="376" /> misusing that monopoly in order to squeeze out the manufacturer, but I think the Deputy is stretching the overall possibilities too far.  I know there will be more and more competition from outside in the EEC but I am mindful of the fact that the overall national spirit of the average man and woman will combat that to a considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister has said is happening at the moment. If a person has a big group of retail outlets here and a manufacturing company in England he can sell his own goods in his outlets here.  He can push the Irish goods to the back of the shelves, cut the price of his own goods and run down the Irish company.  This is happening in the company to which I referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a very fine contribution in suggesting that he might make an order&mdash;at all sales, I presume, in the country under the supermarket system, or the system whereby you serve yourself and pay at a check-out&mdash;whereby the 5 per cent turnover tax would be included in the price displayed on the article on the shelf and not charged as extra at the check-out.</P>
      <P>I do not think that the entrepreneur or the person who is a bit smarter than his neighbour and produces a gimmick should not get the reward for the gimmick. This is a natural sequence of events.  We ought have a look at the supermarkets versus the small shops in a general way.  I would venture to suggest that it is true that the advent of supermarkets resulted, broadly speaking, in a wider variety of goods being available not only in supermarkets but in small shops, and in a reduction in price.  Some of the moneys which were squeezed from manufacturers by the great purchasing power of supermarkets and chains were passed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as that, the supermarket proprietor who was such a large buyer could provide a standard of goods and a variety of goods which placed the small shopkeeper very much on his or her mettle to compete with him.  The small shopkeeper may have benefited <Col N="377" /> to a great extent because, if the supermarket proprietor with his colossal purchasing power and colossal directing power to the manufacturer, could demand what he wanted, it was likely that the same article would be available to the small shopkeeper as well.</P>
    <P>I could not agree more that there is a grave danger of unfair trading in the case of the supermarkets versus the small shops.  The Minister mentioned the loss leader.  The loss leader is something we must take note of under this section.  It might be bananas today, soap tomorrow, and easy chairs the following day.  It is an elusive will-o'the-wisp like Proteus who had the power to change himself into something else at will.</P>
    <P>There will be the discerning housewife who will use her discretion if she has time.  If she has seven or eight children at home and a hungry husband coming home at 1 o'clock she will not have time.  If she has two or three supermarkets within a few hundred yards of each other in the vicinity she will buy the loss leader, if she wants it, and go over to another supermarket for the rest of her goods at a slightly smaller price than she would have to pay in the supermarket with the spectacular loss leader.  She might even buy the loss leader in the other supermarket.</P>
    <P>This percentage of housewives would be a very small fraction of the total number.  The housewife is, perhaps, the person most pressed for time.  She has to get the children out to school, clean up the house and prepare the lunch, so she has not much time to make her purchases and get home again.  Therefore, she is more or less at the mercy of the purveyor of goods if he is powerful enough.</P>
    <P>It would be unfair to the supermarket proprietors to say that no good came from their operations.  Good did come in the variety of goods and prices.  I wonder can the question of the small shopkeepers versus the supermarkets ever be solved properly, fairly and humanely?  The purchasing departments of the supermarkets can do a lot of good.  Many of them have laboratories in which they test the quality of articles such as woollen <Col N="378" /> garments to see whether they will shrink, or whether they will stand up to wear, and to see whether they are, in fact, what they are meant to be. This is a good thing and it could never be done by the small shopkeeper who probably benefits from it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton mentioned the easy chair for £6 or £4.  It is quite obvious that, unless there was complete automation as against very old-fashioned production, a difference of 50 per cent in the cost of an article could not arise.  Most of the articles sold in supermarkets are ordinary articles used in most houses.  They are not the sort of thing you might buy in certain exclusive stores in Grafton Street. They are the type of thing you might buy in any furniture store.  Deputy Belton's example showing such a wide discrepancy in cost is a clear example of how a furniture manufacturer might be put out of business, or severely handicapped if he had the money to carry on until he could produce sales outlets for himself.</P>
    <P>Twenty years ago the man who produced the industrial goods was the boss and the shopkeeper was very much the small boy.  He was less of a small boy if he had a large shop and more of a small boy if he had a small shop.  This has now turned full cycle. The cost of production is less.  There is ease of production more than there is ease of selling.  The man who has got his hands on a large slice of the retail outlets&mdash;and I say this in a most measured way; I have been extremely measured in what I have been saying in relation to small shopkeepers and supermarkets but I think neither of them will like me when I sit down&mdash;can put the small producer out of business.  I do not suggest that any supermarket operating in this country ever used that power but it could be used if a small producer was foolish enough to let all his produce go to one supermarket chain.  It is a very difficult problem for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill in broad principle. It is our job to examine it on Committee Stage.  I know it will not produce a perfect solution but it is necessary.  I am glad the Minister had <Col N="379" /> the courage to say that this is so, having said that it would be very dangerous politically to say there should be minimum prices for grocery goods.  When he said that, I thought back in history to some fellow who once said: &ldquo;I have said it,&rdquo; and the Minister did say just that.  I think it will be a difficult path for the Minister, but I accept completely that there was some necessity as between the three sections&mdash;the supermarket operator, the small shop and the consumer&mdash;for what one would almost term interference to see that there is fair play for all concerned.  I think this section does as much as it can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I would like to comment on subparagraph (c) which enables the Minister to make such provision as he thinks necessary to ensure the equitable treatment of all persons in regard to the supply or distribution of goods or the provision of services.  What I have in mind is the big purchaser who can go to a manufacturer and get a 25 per cent discount and the small retail outlet going to the same manufacturer who can only succeed in getting 2 per cent.  I am wondering whether under this provision the Minister will have power to see that some equitable treatment is given to the small retail outlet in relation to its small purchasing as against the larger retail outlets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the large purchaser who gets the 25 per cent discount is automatically affecting the list price of goods, because a manufacturer who gives the large retail outlet this kind of discount must rethink his manufacturing costs and there is every possibility that when he is going over his costings, the list price will have to be increased, if he is to give this large discount to the big retail outlets.  I was wondering if the Minister can regulate this in any way because I believe there is a terrible discrepancy between the discounts which the large retail outlets are getting as against the small retail outlets.  Under this section, will the Minister have any power or does he intend to look at this particular <Col N="380" /> aspect of the wholesale or manufacturing trade?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, clarified it in principle by so doing.  This is a matter which it is absolutely essential for the law to deal with.  It may be cumbersome and it may be impossible in certain cases, and for a person like me who is not intimate with the details of business, it is very hard to provide a reasonable answer, but it strikes me that if a supermarket makes such an approach to a manufacturer, the documentation should be sent to the Department of Industry and Commerce and kept there for future reference.  If the unfortunate man has to go out of business, he notifies the Department that he has gone out of business and believes that it is this marketing activity of the supermarket which was responsible for it, and at this stage the Department keep a very close eye on the supermarket to see that they do not boost their subsequent prices when they have no competitor.</P>
      <P>This may be a cumbersome way of doing it and I expect that some people who know business much better than I do would say that it is impossible to work, but I think the problem is so important that legislation should not be concluded without some answer being provided.  It may not work, but with the experience got from it some other method might be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised another point and I do not think it necessary to remind the Minister that I was in his presence when a certain Member of the House told him that when purchasing certain goods from a manufacturer, it was pointed out that he would get those from a distributor, provided he made up the goods in the interests of the <Col N="381" /> distributor.  This is another situation which should be dealt with.  It was a restrictive trade practice, to my mind, that when making up the goods they could only make them up for a particular person.  This was imposed on them, not alone by the person for whom they were making up the goods but by the maker of the actual material.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking still about this section 8 which deals specifically with all the orders I may make after getting a report from the Restrictive Practices Commission.  All the matters raised here by the various Deputies are in themselves matters which can be considered by the Restrictive Practices Commission in relation to distribution. The practices to which Deputy Belton in general referred, and to which Deputy Gibbons also referred, are certainly practices which can be investigated under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the question in general of discounts to traders as such and talked about what we call bulk purchase which qualifies for the greater rate of discount, the sizeable bulk purchase.  This is something that has been there for years.  It has developed, and it is something which it seems logical to see, say, in the jam trade, that 50 gross of jam qualify for a certain rate of discount, where ten gross qualify only for so much, and then five gross and down to one gross. Certainly from the manufacturer's point of view, there are far less transport costs maybe, far less organisation and far less overheads if he is able to sell an amount of 50 gross orders rather than to have the equivalent amount in ten gross lots distributed all over the country.  There is a limit and I think this is what Deputy Fitzpatrick may have been speaking of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot have bulk buying picking up a discount rate to the extent that eventually the manufacturer has to give more discount than the profit enables him to give.  This is the subject we have been discussing at length here &mdash;the volume of the order developing to such an extent that the manufacturer is working for very little and eventually finds himself working at a loss or going out of business.  This, in <Col N="382" /> fact, is what this whole section is about, enabling me to make orders prohibiting or regulating practices in relation to the subject matter of any recommendation made to me by the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>I might point out, in view of the problems that have arisen in this regard and lest the House might feel that nothing has been done in the light of the problems that have developed in the distribution trade, and especially in the grocery distribution business over the past few years, that I have already told the House today in reply to a question, and I have been pointing it out for some time, that I am as of now awaiting a comprehensive report from the present Fair Trade Commission arising out of a pretty thorough and detailed investigation which they conducted into the grocery trade last year.  I indicated in the House at Question Time today that I expect to have this report to hand before the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The investigation was so exhaustive that I expect to receive a comprehensive report and as I have indicated I will exercise my power as Minister to make orders arising from the recommendations that may be made, bearing in mind what is best in the common good.  Of course, I do not know what may be the recommendations but from normal reports that have come to hand arising from the exhaustive inquiry that was held and in line with the solid and sensible recommendations that the existing Free Trade Commission have been making to me and have made to my predecessors I expect there will be some sound recommendation in relation to fair trading.  Again, this is an extension of the existing arrangement under the 1953 Act for the purpose of improving existing legislation to deal with the prohibition of practices and methods of competition which are unfair, without specific reference to prices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding a point made by Deputy Fitzpatrick and supported by Deputy Donegan here, again, we have the big groups becoming involved so that it is a case of the <Col N="383" /> tail swinging the dog.  The Minister has said that, in respect of jam, discount can range from 20 to 2½ per cent.  If one considers this he will find that the discount may be 5 per cent on the first gross or that, perhaps, 7½ per cent would be the discount instead of 2½ per cent.  Because of the pressure brought to bear by the supermarkets, this profit is cut.  In other words, they might be giving 7½ per cent as against 2½ per cent only to give 5 per cent to the big groups who would cause trouble if they were to stop an order for one month.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is cheaper to leave six gross at one place rather than to distribute one gross in each of six places all over the country, but if they gave less discount to the big groups they could still make a good overall profit.  This is where the big man is squeezing out the small one.</P>
      <P>Take the case of a person I knew, in England, who was manufacturing women's dresses; he was getting orders from many retailers but gradually he let these go and took only very big orders.  The big groups from whom he was getting these orders then began to request him to reduce the prices.  He complied with their requests until he realised that is was no longer economical for him to supply them so that he recommenced supplying the retailers whom he had been supplying originally.  That was not so bad in England because there were other outlets but if a manufacturing company here were to find themselves in the same situation where they would be caught by the three big supermarkets and if they were to reduce their prices until it could be no longer viable for them to continue in business, they would go out of business altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister is doing here, which is basically to save Irish industry against foreign industry. I am against big business chains in Ireland who, in the interests of shortterm competitiveness, are inclined to keep down prices of goods manufactured by small industries.  The big groups have the advantage of selling in bulk and it is as good for them to sell 6,000 articles at 5p as to sell 3,000 <Col N="384" /> articles at 10p.  They do not have to worry because they can buy in England or elsewhere.  I do not know how this can be covered completely unless, perhaps, there could be some legality introduced now.  By the time such practices are reported it is too late to take any action.  This will happen here as it has happened in England and in other countries.  The small concerns can be squeezed out to the detriment of Irish workers.</P>

      <P>The only point I would like to make at this stage is that so far as the question of quantity discount arises, I do not think there is anything wrong in this.  One of the things that the small shopkeepers have done is to group themselves into cooperatives for the purpose of bulk buying so that they can avail themselves of the larger discount.</P>

      <P>Yes, but they are their own shareholders so that this cost should balance out.  Some of these groups are registered under a name containing three letters.  The benefits that accrue to them from bulk buying enable them to be competitive in so far as they can advertise to advantage. This is a natural result of what has happened here.  That is all right but what would be wrong would be if the small man was suffering reduced discount because of the bigger concerns being able to avail of increased discount.  If the prices are fair that situation should not arise and the position should be that the manufacturer would begin to look at the level of discount he was giving.  It would be wrong if this House were to create dissatisfaction with regard to quantity discounts because the small shopkeeper also has utilised these to help him compete.  He would never have had to do that if the very large buyers had not appeared on the scene. However, we cannot turn the clock back.  This has happened.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I did not want to give the impression that I was against this.  What I am saying is that the manufacturer is <Col N="385" /> pressurised to such an extent that he gives discount below the profitable price.  This is the danger that I see. When it comes down to that level I believe the manufacturer must have a look again at his costings and, having had a look, he will probably have to increase the list price and that increase will affect the small purchaser as well as the large purchaser.  We must protect the small retail outlets.  Efforts are being made to protect the small farmer.  We will have to protect the small retailer.  Every week small retailers are closing down because they are not able to compete against the big supermarkets.  The advertisement in last night's paper says that no turnover tax is charged.  This is utterly misleading. It gives the impression that large combines are exempt from turnover tax.  This is what I object to in this kind of advertising.</P>

      <P>I am in a difficulty here. This subsection is a re-enactment of subsection (4) (1) of the 1959 Act.  The reason for this provision in the 1959 Act was that the restrictive practices relating to the use of particular material or particular methods for manufacturing or construction purposes might prevent the reasonable development of trade and business and might inflate costs.  It was not the intention that, following the holding of an investigation, orders would be made, but it was felt that it would serve a useful purpose if restrictive practices of this kind were inquired into and reported on by an impartial body, such as the commission.  It transpired that the necessity to use this power of inquiry was happily never realised but, in reviewing the situation, I decided to retain that power and that is the reason why it is there.  We had the original Act of 1953.  Then this was included in the 1959 Act, but the occasion to use it never arose.  It is no harm, I think, to have it in the Bill.</P>

This Bill extends the field from trading into services and any inquiry might involve some of the professions.  I think it would be impossible at this stage to spell out the type of people who would constitute the commission.  At any stage the Minister may nominate temporary members for a particular inquiry.  He would not, however, nominate two temporary members for one inquiry.  For a threeman inquiry it would be necessary to have two permanent members and one who would be drafted in with perhaps particular expertise for that particular matter.  He might not be suitable for <Col N="389" /> the following inquiry and it is rather unlikely that he would.

I have indicated one that I thought might possibly be an unfair practice and the Minister agreed that in certain circumstances it might be.  For instance what would the Minister think, in regard to the supply of goods by chemists, would be an unfair practice? Would he consider the absolute fixing of the price of goods by a pharmaceutical association, for instance, an unfair practice?  I am not criticising chemists but the practice is that every chemist has a large book including every item it is possible to price in a chemist's shop, whether it is a proprietary toothpaste or a medicine prescribed by a doctor.  Apart from the normal prescription fee this book fixes the price.  Perhaps it is a bit difficult to ask this across the House at this stage.</P>

    <P>I should also like to know in regard to services if certain things are laid down that must be adhered to by the customer or by the purveyor of services, is that an unfair practice?

This is where the Deputy feels he may be unfair and it might be unfair if he wanted me to go down through the full Schedule and say that this, that or the other is an unfair practice or unfair operation of a service.  The whole object of the exercise here is to give instances of practices that the examiner can look into. If he decides that there is a <i>prima facie</i> case of unfair service or unfair practice then he goes to the commission and reports to them that in his view a group of traders or professional persons have been guilty of unfair practice and he must be in a position to substantiate that allegation by evidence. The Deputy asks me at this stage to determine what is or what is not an unfair practice.  I might have a view. The Deputy might have a view.</P>

      <P>The Deputy put a question earlier on as to whether I thought a certain practice was unfair.  I might say, off the cuff, that a certain practice would be unfair.  There is conduct which I as a man in the street might consider unfair but which is regarded within the profession as fair practice. Probably the profession that people criticise most is the legal profession. As a Deputy I meet people who complain that their solicitor, A, is not conducting their affairs properly but that solicitor B will not take the case. In some cases B would be very foolish to take the business from A because the reason why A is not doing the business is that the client is not the sort of person anybody would want to do business with.  There would be background reasons for A not taking the case.  If, on the other hand, B refuses to take the case, he might be regarded as being guilty of refusing to give professional advice to a client.  I would <Col N="391" /> much prefer to determine what is a restrictive practice on the basis of a recommendation made to me by the commission following full-scale examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that Deputy Fitzpatrick has raised this point.  I had just been checking back on my file because on Second Reading I passed over it rather rapidly.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cooney, on Second Reading, suggested that an inquiry in a specialised field might involve the production of expert witnesses, even witnesses from abroad, and would almost certainly entail the employment of professional advocates.  I said that I would look at this matter.  It arises under section 5.  I said that to my knowledge there had been no demand for compensation or financial aid in such circumstances in the past and that I did not consider the granting of such compensation would be desirable.  Having regard to the fact that the operations of the examiner could give rise to increased activity, I did promise to look into the matter and I have done so.</P>
      <P>At every inquiry held by the Fair Trade Commission there have been expert witnesses.  These experts came from the trades or businesses involved. In inquiries involving the professions I presume the experts would come from those professions.  The suggestion that experts would have to be brought from abroad carries with it the implication that the professional people in this country would not be fully capable of managing their own affairs.  The Deputy probably did not intend it to be taken in that way.  Deputy Fitzpatrick makes the point that counsel might have to be engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inquiry held by the Fair Trade Commission or the Restrictive Practices Commission, as it will be now, is not the same as a trial in a court of law.  The manner of the presentation of the case is of very little importance at an inquiry because the commission is not concerned with establishing the guilt of any person but with the economic issues arising out of the restrictive practices in a trade or service.  I think Deputy Donegan spoke earlier of a man committing <Col N="393" /> an offence unknown to himself. There is no offence at all.  Perhaps wrong methods have developed. We are having a look at those wrong methods to see if we could call those wrong methods unfair practices with a view to doing away with those unfair practices.  If, arising from the inquiry, the Restrictive Practices Commission make a recommendation to the Minister that he should do something about it and if arising from the recommendation he does something about it, then to commit the offence subsequently would constitute an offence.  There is nobody there defending themselves and in danger of being found guilty.</P>
    <P>I think if I were to undertake to write into the Bill a question of compensation for witnesses called or for legal advice sought by people who would consider themselves defendants in this sort of case it would only increase the cost and would encourage groups&mdash;generally it would be groups or associations&mdash;and induce them to incur what I feel would be unnecessary expenditure on the employment of expert witnesses or on the engagement of professional advocates in the expectation that such expenditure would be recouped by the State. Having given the fullest consideration to the points made by Deputy Cooney and by Deputy Fitzpatrick I am not disposed to do this.  In fact, I am totally opposed to it.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I am sure the examiner will be a very competent man and he will initiate the inquiry.  The commission will depend a lot on his investigation and on the evidence he will supply.  I believe there will have to be expert people to present the case to the commission from the other side if the commissioners are to form a balanced opinion.  I think it would be a bad idea if the examiner had no defence put up against him.  To give the commission a fair picture and enable them to form a right judgment the other side of the case will have to be put forward properly.  Irrespective of whether there are costs or not, I believe you will have to have experts on the other side to put the evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully agree with <Col N="394" /> Deputy Fitzpatrick in this.  If the examiner is not an expert at the beginning he will become an expert.  He is setting out to establish that a group or firm have been pursuing unfair practices. He will be an expert and the people he will have with him and who will examine every detail will be professional people.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that you must meet this with some sort of professionalism if you are to put the case of the people in business.  You have this in every walk of life today.  You have it in planning appeals.  You have expensive experts being employed by people who have to defend themselves and it pays them to do it.  I think what Deputy Fitzpatrick is looking for is compensation where eventually it is shown that a firm or group have been unreasonably put to the expense of proving that they were right and that the commission were wrong.  He is not looking for expenses if they are beaten.  If they are beaten they are not entitled to expenses but if the commission are beaten they should pay the expenses of the other side.  That is a fair enough thing to look for.</P>

The situation that has obtained since the passing of the 1953 Act has been that the Fair Trade Commission themselves were able to set up an inquiry. They would perhaps get a complaint from somebody.  This would be examined and arising from a pretty exhaustive examination, as they saw it, they decided to hold a public inquiry. When the Fair Trade Commission decided to set up this public inquiry one would logically have to assume that they were prosecutors and judges at the same time.  This meant that the particular sector being examined <Col N="395" /> had to be found guilty before an inquiry was started at all.</P>

      <P>Under this Bill the commission consider nothing.  This examiner, whom Deputy Clinton anticipates will become an expert at prosecuting in due course, brings the case to them. The commission are now approaching the job quite objectively.  They have no preconceived ideas.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the question of the advocates on behalf of the defence.  Let us take an inquiry into the grocery trade.  The examiner decides there should be an inquiry into distribution.  He has already had complaints from the man in the street.  He would also have taken up the complaints with various distributors, various manufacturers and other people.  Arising from all this he feels there is something wrong.  He asks permission to investigate and the commission put a notice in the paper saying they are going to hold a public inquiry on a certain date and asking all people interested to indicate their interest so that they can be heard at the inquiry.  This is held.  The question arises as to who is the defendant.  This is a straightforward open inquiry into the distribution of groceries or petrol. We had a recent one about the electrical industry.</P>

      <P>The Electrical Appliances Order was in operation.  At the time there was an organisation called the Federation of Electrical Industries &mdash;I think they are a different group now.  They went to the inquiry on behalf of their members.  The commission found that this organisation were guilty of restrictive practices.  As far as I know they came and voluntarily gave their evidence and endeavoured to justify their reasons for preventing the development of new outlets. Having heard all the evidence, the commission decided that there should be better distribution and that some of the practices were unfair. <Col N="396" /> However, that did not mean that the Federation of Electrical Industries were people who should be sent to jail or put into custody.  What was condemned was the practice that had evolved.</P>
      <P>The situation that obtains is that a group in answer to an advertisement in the newspapers contact the commission and attend a hearing.  Frequently, those people who attend the hearing offer evidence on their own behalf.  It may be found subsequently by the Fair Trade Commission that a practice has developed which may be unfair and should not be encouraged. In that context there should not be an arrangement whereby the State would be committed to paying the legal or other expenses of that group.</P>
      <P>It is not the people who are charged in this matter&mdash;it is the practices that have developed that are being investigated.  I do not visualise the type of situation mentioned by Deputy Fitzpatrick of some person being found guilty.  There is no question of his being found guilty; what might be established is that a certain practice should be discontinued.</P>

      <P>I do not think that there is anything the Minister can do on this.  We should not disguise the fact that there will be expenses.  The Minister has correctly pointed out that it is the practices rather than the people involved which are being investigated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago there was an inquiry into the flour and bread industry. The flour millers indicated they were losing £26,000 per week and the Government instituted an inquiry to see if this was true.  There was a delay of from 15 to 18 months. I was present at the private session as a witness and I know that very many professional people were involved. The Irish Grain and Agricultural Merchants' Association had senior counsel and the second biggest firm of auditors and accountants in the country to act for them.  They had a firm of solicitors which deals with the Road Haulage Association to give expert evidence regarding the cost of haulage. <Col N="397" /> I shall not disclose the amount involved but as the inquiry continued for more than a week there was a considerable amount of money involved. Apart from their own staff, the Flour Millers' Association had the biggest firm of auditors in the country acting for them in addition to senior counsel and other professional advice The bakers also had professional advice.  People from the various trades attended the inquiry at their own expense, they absented themselves from their businesses and provided their services. In due course awards were made. The Minister might say that absolute justice was done, but one must take into account the cost involved for all concerned.  The Minister might regard this as part of the cost of producing the goods and say that when he would come to talk with those people in 18 months time the costs involved would be written in.  This is such a &ldquo;grey area&rdquo; that I do not think the Minister can do anything about it.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that there is some case here, but I do not think the Minister can do anything about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment which should be considered together with the amendment to section 6 (4) is to make assurance linked unit trust schemes eligible to register under the Bill.  These schemes were completely excluded from the scope of the Bill as a result of amendments introduced by me on Report Stage in the Seanad in response to representations by the insurance companies at that time.  It is now proposed to allow them the option of either registering or remaining free from control under the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is believed that some schemes will see advantage in having the status of a registered unit trust scheme on the basis that the public would have confidence in any scheme which was authorised by the Minister and subject to regulation by him.  Clearly it would be undesirable that anyone wishing to register a scheme and have it subject to regulation under the Bill should be prevented from doing so. <Col N="400" /> Therefore this amendment arises from the arrangement I made previously in the Seanad to enable unit trust schemes linked with assurance companies to remain excluded from the umbrella of the Bill but to enable them to register if they so desire and get, if you like, the imprimatur of being declared a registered unit trust scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is on its way to 80 per cent now of Irish investment, by arrangement.  This is one of the reasons why we felt it would be wrong to tie them in.  One of the main objects was to ensure that we would have this home investment in Irish securities.  We have this commitment and this is why we have this relaxation for Irish assurance linked unit trust schemes.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), page 3, line 42, after &ldquo;State&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the amount of the capital of which that is paid up in cash is not less than £25,000 and the assets of which are sufficient to meet its liabilities (including liabilities in respect of its paid up capital)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the managing company is financially sound.  This is particularly important when a new scheme is being launched.  A managing company should have resources to cover the initial cost of getting the scheme into operation.  If the company had little capital it would be depending upon <Col N="401" /> the subscriptions of the unit holders to launch the scheme and the risk of failure involving the loss of money by subscribers would be great.</P>

      <P>Provision of this kind is included in the draft rules on investment funds of the Council of Europe. We have been in touch with them constantly in negotiations on this legislation. We have been studying the situation that operates in the US, the UK and in Europe.  This amendment is necessary because, to ensure that the scheme can be got off the ground, £25,000 must be paid up.  It would be very wrong to think that any worthwhile unit trust scheme could be got off the ground without having that volume of money involved in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that if Deputy Tully, the Minister, Deputy Clinton and I were private persons outside this House and we came together <Col N="402" /> with the idea of starting a unit trust scheme, we would have to be able to say: &ldquo;Between the four of us we have £25,000 to put into this scheme.  We will underwrite it.&rdquo;  The issue of shares in a public company is underwritten by a commercial bank or another financial institution so that, if the public do not put up the money, it is put up, minus a fairly large commission, by the people who underwrite it. It would seem to me that if some institution or some persons decided to set up a unit trust scheme they would either have to find £25,000 or have it themselves.</P>
      <P>I am wondering if this amendment might stop unit trusts from being formed.  They have helped the small investor because they give him the spread of investments right across a number of companies that he could not possibly have himself because he has not got enough money to go around them all.  He can have a smaller slice of each one of them by participating in a unit trust investment.  I am wondering whether, in our situation, £25,000 is too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of things like a credit union.  Credit unions have now reached the stage where I am sure that if the credit union central body in Ireland decided to set up a unit trust for the benefit of its members it could easily provide £25,000.  Getting subscriptions for that amount would be a very easy matter when you go around all the credit unions in the country.  I am sure the Minister will agree that there was a time not too long ago when the credit unions would consider £25,000 quite a large sum to set up a unit trust for the benefit of its members.  I do not want in any way to express strong views about this because if the Minister and his Department are at the moment in contact, as he says they are. with the Council of Europe and various other sources of information on unit trusts and if this is the view widely held.  I suppose we should stick by it. At the same time, it does pose a question mark in my mind whether, in our conditions, £25,000 is not too large a sum, and if the truth is that other financial safeguards should be built into the Bill, to make sure that the investors <Col N="403" /> do not lose their money except in the bad luck of ordinary non-giltedged investments going down on the market.  I wonder is a sum of £25,000 too much?  In most cases it is not, I agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>If you look at it in the general overall, the situation is that further down in that section, you will see that the trustee company itself must have at least £250,000 paid up by its shareholders.  We accept this is for the trustee company but here we have the managing company which I am suggesting must have at least £25,000 paid up by the shareholders &mdash;only one-tenth of the sum required for the trustee company.  You may suggest that there are so many built-in protections later on, but I still think that in the context of this, the demand I make on the trustee company in relation to what the trustee company must have, spelling out that the managing company must have at least £25,000 paid up by its shareholders who may not purchase units at all is a small sum and from that point of view is pretty well justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had an amendment down for Report Stage to this section and it was really to make the point that in considering what papers or publications the Minister may grant exemption and allow foreign unit trusts to advertise in, he should have regard to the general content of the publication, with particular reference to papers dealing mainly with financial matters. I feel that we may get through with this Bill tonight and my amendment is not within the statutory two-day period.  In that situation, could the Minister give an assurance that in deciding on exemption in this regard, he will consider papers distributed here which have a content related to financial matters?  I am thinking of the <i>Financial Times.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conscious of the Deputy's worry in this regard, and in fact I took the liberty of endeavouring to get a copy of his amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only asking the Minister to have regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing so and am anxious to have regard, but the peculiar thing about it is that the amendment would tie my hands more than the exemption I propose to make here.  I take it we are referring specifically <Col N="406" /> now to section 7 (2) relating to the prohibition of certain advertising in relation to unregistered unit trust schemes.  This paragraph set out</P>
      <P>Whenever it is shown to the satisfaction of the Minister, in the case of a newspaper or magazine printed outside the State, that compliance with this section would necessitate the production for circulation in the State of a special edition of the newspaper or magazine and that the cost of such production would impose a burden on the owner of the newspaper or magazine that would be unreasonably heavy in all the circumstances, the Minister may exempt from the application of this section advertisements published in the newspaper or magazine.</P>
      <P>The Deputy was asking to insert after that &ldquo;In considering the kind of exemption, the Minister shall have regard to the general context of the publication exempted, with particular reference to publications dealing mainly with financial matters&rdquo;.  I am conscious of the fact that it is basically in financial matters that I do not want to deprive business interests of getting what we call financial expertise and industrial and business information.  I did say in introducing the Bill&mdash;certainly when speaking in the Seanad on this Bill&mdash;that it was my intention where magazines and papers with specialised information for business people were coming in and where a special arrangement could not be made economically to have an Irish edition, I would make special provisions to enable those to come in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, I did also say that I would be rather strict in regard to the application of this.  I know that the Deputy mentioned specific papers. In relation to giving exemptions I am anxious that the papers would make application for the exemption and endeavour to justify it on the basis that it would be economically impossible for them to get out a special Irish edition, that it would be imposing a hardship on them to have a special Irish edition which would exclude advertisements for unit trusts.  Therefore, I do not want specifically to spell out here that I propose to give exemption to paper A or <Col N="407" /> magazine B, but certainly I can say that in relation to what the Deputy is endeavouring to achieve in his amendment, that I would be hoping to meet this.  However, the amendment would restrict me specifically to publications dealing mainly with financial matters and one could pick out a paper such as the <i>Financial Times</i>.  If I were to accept this amendment and find that the <i>Financial Times</i> had a literary section and an arty part, and did not deal mainly with finance, I might find myself forced to exclude it.  I am far better off with the provision I have made in section 7 (2) (a) in dealing with the problem than by accepting the amendment. However, if I thought the amendment would be helpful, I would try to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> In page 11, before section 9, to insert the following section:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The proceeds of the sale by the manager of a unit trust scheme of any units of the scheme and any income in respect of the assets of the scheme that is not distributed to the holders of those units shall be assets of the scheme and be subject to and be dealt with by the manager in accordance with the trusts created under the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>[Acceptance of this amendment involves the deletion of section 9 of the Bill.]</P>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is that in the Seanad some Senators had difficulty in understanding section 9 and the amendment was designed to improve the wording of the section.  The section states that the first principle of the unit trust scheme is that money subscribed should be used for the purpose for which it is subscribed and not for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deleted.</P>
    <P>Section 10 agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 30, before &ldquo;buy&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, as soon as maybe,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that section 11 does not expose the manager of a scheme to unreasonable demands from unit holders.  When the Bill was being debated in the Seanad some Senators were of the opinion that a manager would be committing an offence if he was unable to pay unit holders immediately even if circumstances rendered this course impossible.  It is not agreed that this section should have the effect of putting a manager in that position but the amendment is expected to satisfy any Deputy who might hold that view.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Section 11, as amended, agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12.</P>
      <P>In page 12, after line 38, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A body corporate that is a manager under a unit trust scheme or is a subsidiary or a holding company of the manager shall not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) borrow money on behalf of the scheme for the purpose of acquiring securities or other property for the scheme, or</P>
      <P>(b) lend money that is subject to the trusts of the scheme to a person to enable him to purchase units of the scheme, or</P>
      <P>(c) mortgage or charge, or impose any other incumbrance on, any securities or other property subject to the trusts of the scheme.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment provides that the manager of a unit trust scheme will not be allowed to float loans on behalf of the scheme in order to acquire securities to increase the scheme's portfolio or to advance to participants the price of units.  It provides also that there should be no charges of any kind on the fund.  These restrictions are considered necessary to prevent a speculative investment policy by managers. A rule on these lines is included in the draft rules on investment funds which are being considered by the Council of Europe at present.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;( ) A person who contravenes subsection (1) of this section shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Originally only the manager was referred to in this section.  Section 19 provided that if he contravened section 12 he would be guilty of an offence.  Subsequently, section 12 was expanded by amendments in the Seanad and the present amendment covers contravention by all of the persons now <Col N="411" /> mentioned.

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 17, lines 8 to 12, to delete subsections (1) and (2) and to substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Where, in relation to a unit trust scheme, there is a contravention of section * of this Act, the manager under the scheme shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>(2) Where, in relation to a unit trust scheme, there is a contravention of section 9 or 10 of this Act, the manager and (except where the contravention consists of sending a copy of a document of the kind referred to in the said section 10 to the registrar without its having been signed by a director or the secretary of the trustee or sending a copy of such a document to a person specified in the said section 10 without having obtained the approval of the trustee for the document) the trustee under the scheme shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>(3) Where the manager under a unit trust scheme contravenes section 11 or 15 of this Act, he shall be guilty of an offence.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>(This is the section proposed to be inserted by amendment No. 8.)</P>
      <P>The first subsection is new and is necessary because of the insertion of the new section before section 8.  The second subsection incorporates an amendment that was suggested in the Seanad but not accepted at the time. It absolves a trustee from liability for an offence under section 10 in a case where a manager issues a document without the trustees' knowledge or approval.  The third subsection is an amendment of the existing subsection (2) which removes a reference to section 12.  Offences under that section are covered now by a new subsection of that section.</P>
