      <P>We have had discussions. I do not think the Taoiseach would object if I made reference to these discussions.  Frankly, the terms of reference have still to be agreed on.  As I said to the Taoiseach personally, would it not be better, for fear this committee would not get off the ground at all, if the nominees to the committee were to get together and try to agree on terms of reference rather than have it a non-starter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did make that suggestion last week but, perhaps, this is not the place in which we can discuss these matters.  It would be better that we discussed them together first, as the Deputy has done so far.  I put forward the proposed terms of reference last week, and the week <Col N="811" /> before that, for that matter.  The Deputy put forward different terms of reference.  Deputy Cosgrave put forward a slight extension of my terms of reference.  Let me be quite open and frank: I am prepared to agree to this slight extension and perhaps Deputy Corish and I can have a word together afterwards about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will make a comprehensive statement on the dispute between the Southern Health Board and his Department over hospital services in Mallow; and if he will state why he rejected the Southern Health Board's proposal for a general hospital in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the reply is in the form of a rather lengthy statement, I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>The following is the statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November, 1967, the then Minister for Health appointed a consultative <Col N="813" /> council to examine the position in regard to general hospital in-patient and out-patient services in the country and to report in outline on the future organisation, extent and location of these services taking all relevant matters into consideration.  The council submitted its report to the Minister in June, 1968.  The following is an extract from that report in regard to Mallow Hospital:</P>
    <P>Mallow County Hospital is a 98 bed hospital in a modern building providing a general medical, surgical and maternity service, and staffed at consultant level by one surgeon and one physician.  This hospital is 23 miles from Cork and is serving an area from which access to Cork is easy.  The area north of it, around Rathluric, is convenient to Limerick. We recommend that the role of this hospital be changed to that of a Community Health Centre and that its acute hospital functions be transferred to Cork and Limerick hospital centres as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Arising out of this report a campaign developed in North Cork to prevent a change in the function of Mallow County Hospital.  Strong representations were made to the Minister from many public bodies and voluntary organisations and a public petition asked the Minister to disregard the recommendations in the consultative council's report and to consider instead an expanded role for Mallow County Hospital in the future hospital services in County Cork.  It was pointed out in reply that the implementation of the consultative council's report did not necessarily involve a lowering of the status of Mallow Hospital.  In fact one of the main features of the new hospital services would be a close association with the major centre in Cork.  Various specialists from Cork would visit Mallow regularly to provide a wide range of out-patient services at consultant level.  The effect of the proposed changes was explained by the Minister at a meeting with interested groups at Mallow early in June, 1969.  In the course of the discussion the Minister conveyed that it was not the intention to transfer surgery to Cork until the proposed Cork Regional Hospital <Col N="814" /> was built.  This was a major 600 bed development and it would transform the hospital position in the Cork area.  The reaction at the meeting was not, however, favourable to the Minister's outline of the proposals.</P>
    <P>In May, 1971, two developments occurred which affected the hospital position in the Mallow area.  Firstly, the permanent county surgeon, Mallow, successfully competed for an appointment in Tralee which he subsequently accepted.  Secondly, the proprietors of St. Patrick's Hospital at Mount Alvernia near Mallow&mdash;a modern hospital with 60 beds&mdash;offered to sell the hospital to the Southern Health Board.  In November, 1971, the chief executive officer recommended to the board that he negotiate for the purchase of the hospital or alternatively for an agreement by which the order of runs would on agreed terms continue to run it on behalf of the board.  He recommended that the hospital with some extensions and part of the land be used as a centre to accommodate psychiatric long stay patients from the North Cork area thereby helping to make further substantial permanent reduction in the number of long stay patients in the large complex of buildings at Our Lady's Hospital in Cork. He also recommended a change of function for Mallow County Hospital involving the transfer of surgery to the Cork city hospitals.</P>
    <P>The general institutional care committee of the Southern Health Board considered the recommendations at meetings extending over a protracted period.  The chief executive officer submitted a comprehensive report on the 18th November, 1971, and at a meeting held on the 1st December, 1971, the committee decided to recommend to the board that Mallow County Hospital and Mount Alvernia Hospital be integrated and upgraded.  On the 6th December the Southern Health Board approved of this recommendation and sought the approval of the Minister to the proposal.</P>
    <P>The following reply was sent to this proposal on the 16th February, 1972:</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for <Col N="815" /> Health to refer to Mr. Long's letter of the 8th December last and enclosures regarding the decision of the Southern Health Board to adopt, subject to the Minister's approval, the recommendation of the General Institutional Care Committee that Mallow Hospital and Mount Alvernia Hospital be &ldquo;integrated and upgraded&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister has considered carefully the information supplied by the Chief Executive Officer to the General Institutional Care Committee in his comprehensive report of the 18th November, 1971.  In that report the Chief Executive Officer emphasised that the need to improve the psychiatric services is the outstanding priority in relation to institutional services in the Cork area.  This applies with special emphasis to the extermely poor conditions in a great part of Our Lady's Hospital complex. The alleviation of these seriously sub-standard conditions urgently calls for a reduction in the number of patients being accommodated in that hospital.  The Minister shares the concern expressed by the Chief Executive Officer about this situation and he accepts that steps to reduce overcrowding by transfer of patients would represent a major improvement and should be accorded a high degree of priority.</P>
    <P>As regards the undoubted need in the Cork area for extensive modern general hospital facilities, the position now is that the Regional Hospital project it at a point near to the start of construction.  When this major hospital is available for the treatment of patients it will transform the situation in the area as regards the extent and range of the most modern facilities provided for acute hospital care.  As it is anticipated that the construction work will require less than five years to complete, these new facilities should be available in a comparatively short time.</P>
    <P>Taking these two considerations together it is clear to the Minister that the proposal of the Board in regard to the development of general hospital services in Mallow runs <Col N="816" /> counter to the true priority needs for institutional care in the area on any reasonable overall view.  The idea of acquiring Mount Alvernia hospital and associating it with the County Hospital, about three miles distant, to be worked as a single hospital complex presents obvious difficulties.  Apart from this, there is the fundamental question as to whether the needs of the population to be served, now or in the foreseeable future, would justify the expansion of in-patient accommodation proposed.  On that issue, as the Chief Executive Officer pointed out at the meeting of the Committee on 1st December, 1971, while the population of the North Cork health district was in the region of 70,000, the population actually being served by the County Hospital now was in the region of 40,000 to 50,000 about one-third of the admissions being from in and around the town of Mallow.  It is quite clear from this assessment and from the actual experience of the demand on the two hospitals working separately that the proposed &ldquo;merger&rdquo; of the two hospital units would entail over-provision of expensive general hospital services for the effective population to be served.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of the psychiatric services, it is the Minister's unalterable policy to press on towards proper segregation of in-patients, acute patients, in particular the younger ones, on the one hand and long stay on the other.  Such segregation is essential if effective therapy and rehabilitation is to be applied to those patients who can and should be restored to their place in the community in the shortest possible time. At this stage in the Cork situation the decentralisation of long stay patients so as to permit an improvement of the organisation of patient care at Our Lady's Hospital offers the most effective contribution.  In these circumstances the Minister could only see his way to sanction the purchase of Mount Alverna Hospital if it were agreed that it would be used to accommodate psychiatric patients.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> Bearing in mind the views of the Minister, the Board will no doubt wish to reconsider the proposals of the Chief Executive Officer and the alternative course to maintain the status quo until the Cork Regional Hospital is ready for occupation when undoubtedly the Board as of that date will be obliged to examine the position again in the light of the then prevailing conditions.</P>

    <P>The Chief Executive Officer,</P>
    <P>Southern Health Board,</P>
    <P>County Hall,</P>
    <P>Cork.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board considered this reply on the 6th March, 1972, and resolved that the whole matter of the hospital services in Mallow be referred back to the Minister for further consideration.  It was also decided that the Minister be requested to send to the Local Appointments Commissioners the particulars of office necessary to enable the commissioners to proceed with the appointment of a permanent surgeon at Mallow County Hospital.</P>
    <P>On 28th March, 1972, a reply was sent as follows:</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Health to refer to Mr. Long's letter of the 9th March regarding the board's proposals about the hospital services in Mallow.</P>
    <P>I am to state that the Minister has given the most earnest consideration to this problem and, as he made clear in the course of the recent discussion in the Dáil on the Estimate for this Department, he could not possibly agree to the Board's proposals which would entail going in the reverse direction to the lines of development recommended in the report of the Consultative Council on the general hospital services.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the most the Minister feels able to do to meet the wishes of the Board is to agree to the making of a permanent appointment of a consultant surgeon in Mallow in replacement of Mr. <Col N="818" /> Henley.  This would enable the status quo to be maintained until the Cork Regional Hospital comes into operation.</P>
    <P>The necessary documentation in connection with the replacement appointment has now been transmitted to the Local Appointments Commission so that they may proceed with advertisement of the post and the selection of a suitable candidate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. B. Lenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>During recent months I have given the House detailed information on the promotional and marketing activities being carried out by Bord Fáilte, in association with other State companies involved in tourism, the regional tourism organisations and private tourist interests for the promotion of holidays in Ireland in 1972.</P>
      <P>The situation is that they have been concentrating on the ethnic market in Britain while in North America special attention has been given to the development of ethnic, conference and incentive travel business.  In Europe, marketing has been directed at the development of additional traffic in existing markets and in new areas with good growth potential.  Since October last, a special home holidays campaign has been conducted throughout the country.  The general approach of Bord Fáilte and the other tourism interests has been to concentrate their efforts where they are likely to prove most productive.</P>
      <P>Regarding the question of increased funds for Bord Fáilte in 1972-73, the Government, in recognition of the importance of the industry, are providing £8.35m. during the coming year. This represents an increase of more than £2 million on the amount originally allocated for 1971-72 and includes a special additional £250,000 to be used for promotional and development work in marketing.  I am satisfied that there is a need to spend as much as possible on promotional and marketing work during this difficult period as any slackening of effort might be detrimental to the long term growth of the industry.</P>

The board has informed me that the rail sale resulted in a significant increase&mdash;approximately 70 per cent&mdash;in the number of passengers carried and in a small improvement in the net revenue position.

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a previous question on this subject in Dáil Éireann on 7th March, 1972, the B &amp; I Company, like other transport undertakings, are seriously affected by the present difficulties facing the tourist trade.  I am informed by the company that advance car-ferry bookings for 1972 are down on the comparable figures for 1971.  The company's present estimate is that this decline in bookings will produce an operating loss of over £400,000 for the year.</P>
      <P>In the light of this situation the company have carried out a review of their position and have adopted certain measures to reduce costs.  These include the reduction of sailing schedules and of advertising and promotion expenditure.</P>
      <P>At the same time a re-direction and intensification of marketing efforts is taking place.  This involves a concentration on the Irish ethnic market in Britain, and the offering of package auto-holidays in conjunction with Irish hotel chains.</P>

      <P>It is a statutory condition for the receipt of either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance that the claimant be available for employment.  I am advised that an interned person could not be regarded as satisfying this fundamental requirement and could not therefore establish title to receipt of unemployment payments. The fact that the basic contribution conditions for title to unemployment benefit were satisfied would not alter this position.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, I must point out that the determination of title to unemployment payments is a matter for the statutory deciding authorities and not for me.  The insured person in question has not in fact lodged a claim for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance but persons who have made inquiry from my Department on his behalf in this respect have been fully advised as to the position.  I must also say that my information is that the man concerned is unmarried and that a relative who is stated to be dependent on him, and who lives in Northern Ireland, would not be a dependant of his within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts or the Unemployment Assistance Acts.</P>

In two key respects these views are in agreement with those of the OECD Annual Economic Survey.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will outline the major factors responsible for the failure of the Third Programme of Economic Expansion to reach its projected targets; and why this programme was not aborted when its failure became apparent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>To suggest that the Third Programme has failed is to misunderstand the process and purpose of planning.  A programme is a statement of the best combination of community preference, effort and discipline as well as of Government policy for the purposes of maximising welfare and employment over a period.  The prospect for this combined effort is always constrained by the abiding uncertainty about the future, including the force of external factors over which we have no control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in so far as the divergence from the targets is a symptom of failure <Col N="828" /> in community response, in effort and in income restraint, the solution lies in achieving a greater awareness of the direct relationship between these factors and increased welfare and employment.</P>
    <P>What is required, therefore, is not a change of programme but rather an improved community attitude.  I am continuously reviewing Government policy and am making every effort, by budgetary means and otherwise, to ensure that policy is fully geared to the needs of maximising welfare and employment, but these measures must be matched by a community response, if their success is to be sustained.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not admit now that the Third Programme is a failure in so far as he stated that the Government policy must be improved?  I should have thought that a programme would aim to reach certain targets and would state how they could be achieved.  If the targets were not reached, it would indicate to me that the measures employed were not the right ones and that something should be done.  It has been said that the Third Programme has had to be abandoned, that it has not been a success.</P>

Non-agricultural employment increased by 35,000 since 1968; investment increased by 27 per cent in real terms in the same period; public expenditure on social services increased by more than 21 per cent since 1968.  In addition, growth in the gross domestic product since 1968 at over 9 per cent is above that of the United Kingdom for the same period.</P>

      <P>The reason for what the Deputy calls &ldquo;failure&rdquo;&mdash;what might be called &ldquo;divergences&rdquo;&mdash;was the decreased competitiveness of the home and foreign markets due to the rapid rise in unit wage costs, the effect on tourism having regard to the situation in the North of Ireland, the low growth in industrial exports because of the depressed market and the effects of strikes, particularly the cement strike in 1970.</P>

Would the Parliamentary Secretary like to comment on the failure of the Government to reach any of the targets set in regard to expenditure in the social sphere?  Some were overspent and some underspent, and there was a lack of any relationship between the targets and performance. How does the Parliamentary Secretary blame that on the community, other than that the community elected Fianna Fáil in 1969?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The capital and current budgets and other reflationary measures taken recently have been designed to stimulate economic growth, increase employment and prevent as far as possible the occurrence of redundancies. In my budget speech I pointed out that the additional £35 million released through the current budget would raise the national growth rate by about 1¾ per cent in a full year. There should also be a substantial stimulus to growth as a result of the increase of more than £37 million in expenditure on the public capital programme in 1972-73 as compared with the previous financial year.  It is not possible at this stage to quantify the effects of the stimulatory measures on unemployment by the date mentioned by the Deputy but the acceleration in growth envisaged should have favourable implications for employment at an early date.</P>

It should be possible for the Department to state that a certain number will be able to obtain employment and thereby give some hope to the people.

There were 9,000 more at the end of December.  This injection is taking some effect.  The current budget, by providing an excess of £35 million in expenditure over revenue and a public capital programme which is pitched at £251 million for 1972-73 as compared with £214 million in 1971-72, should provide further substantial improvements to domestic economic activity and employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that the reduction in reactors purchased over the past few months has been a direct result of the <Col N="839" /> fact that the compensation offered, namely, a maximum of £140, was inadequate and that people were reluctant to sell at that money and that in fact a calved heifer without her calf can cost at present as much as £160 or £170 and commonly £180 in any market?

The average prices paid for reactors have risen considerably in the past 12 months.  The Deputy will recall that the ceiling price has been lifted since July, 1970, on two occasions, from £100 to £140 in the case of ordinary reactors.  As I told the Deputy, this general question is under review.  The farmer selling the reactor is entitled to the market price of his animal but not to the replacement price of the animal.  If there is any marked and discernible unsatisfactory situation arising out of this in which it is clear that the farmer is not getting what he is entitled to, we shall certainly take corrective measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stressed repeatedly the need for a speeding up of creamery rationalisation and at my <Col N="842" /> instigation legislation has been enacted to enable amalgamations of co-operative creameries to be effected by a simple majority of members instead of the 75 per cent majority previously required.  In the case of the Dairy Disposal Company I have approved of the transfer of a number of the company's creamery groups to co-operative ownership in furtherance of rationalisation plans.</P>
      <P>Rationalisation of the creamery industry is, however, primarily a matter for the co-operative movement itself and in order to encourage progress in that direction I recently had a discussion with a number of the larger societies in the southern area and the IAOS. The societies concerned and the IAOS are now considering further how best rationalisation might be expedited in present circumstances and they are to have another meeting with me.</P>
      <P>As regards the position of creamery managers I understand that where rationalisation takes place those responsible for the interests of managers and workers ensure that their interests are protected in any amalgamation of co-operative societies.  Where the Dairy Disposal Company are involved it is a condition of any transfer to co-operative ownership that the position of managers and workers is safeguarded adequately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the document referred to by the Deputy.  The main aim of the authors is said to be the nationalisation of the mining industry without compensation and the establishment of a State company or companies to locate, extract, process and market all mineral resources including gas and oil.  In support of this aim the document presents a distorted and misleading picture of the exploration and development of our mineral resources and Government policy in relation thereto.</P>
      <P>Nationalisation of industry without compensation is not a policy of this Government nor I think is it a policy that would be supported by many of our people.</P>
      <P>With regard to the establishment of State companies to search for and develop mineral resources I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a Dáil question on this matter on 19th April when I said the State had at one stage participated directly in mineral exploration and development with marked lack of success and as a result of which the operations of the State companies were brought to an end.</P>
      <P>The Government are, of course, most anxious that the State should get an adequate return from mining and as I stated also on the 19th April, I am having a review carried out of royalty and taxation arrangements in the light of which I will consider what long-term fiscal policy for mining would be best suited for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear that such a policy should give the State an equitable share of increasing profits while, at <Col N="846" /> the same time, being sufficiently attractive to the mining companies to ensure the continued development of the country's mineral resources in an efficient manner and lead to the establishment of a smelter and other associated industries.</P>
    <P>It is, I think, necessary to stress again, in view of the content of the pamphlet, that no decision has been made about royalty payments to the State from the operation of the prospective mine at Navan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that a book entitled <i>The Little Red School-book</i> which was banned in Britain is currently on sale in Dublin; and if its continuing availability is in the public interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function of any kind in this matter.  There is no power vested in me or in any other person or body to prohibit the circulation of a publication on the grounds that it is not in the public interest.</P>
      <P>The grounds on which the circulation of a publication may be prohibited are set out in the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, but a decision as to whether a particular publication should be prohibited is a matter for the board, not for me. Moreover, any Deputy&mdash;or indeed any citizen&mdash;is entitled to make a complaint to the board about a particular publication.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>Could the Minister state why the publication was banned in Britain?  Did he inquire into that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, I have no function in regard to the matter at all, but without prejudice to that fact and out of courtesy to the Deputy, I understand that the publication in question was not banned in Britain and is on sale there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether there is not legislation dealing with obscenity, seditious matters and various things of that <Col N="853" /> kind over and above the Censorship of Publications legislation, and is it not open to the police to prosecute in certain cases, or has that been completely replaced by the Censorship of Publications legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>What would have been the relevant part of the old legislation on obscene publications, which would cover a situation such as this if the publication were to be regarded as obscene, was repealed in the 1929 Censorship of Publications legislation. That Act was the Obscene Publications Act of 1857.  The powers of the Garda at the moment derive from section 19 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, which provides for the search for and seizure of indecent pictures under warrant, and section 17 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946, which has a similar provision in relation to prohibited publications, but there is no power to seize publications merely because they are thought by the Garda or by any other person to be indecent in their content.  That power was in the 1857 Act but it is now repealed.</P>

      <P>On the question as to whether the House should give time for the discussion of the Health initiatives, the House has given time recently to discuss the Northern situation.  Because of the Health initiatives we are virtually back to the 1920 situation, in that Britain controls what happens in the Six Counties.  Surely this House should be given an adequate opportunity to consider this question, and I would urge the Tánaiste, in speaking to the Taoiseach, to make this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was dealing with the question of employment and the situation we are passing through at the present time.  It has always been accepted by political parties in this House that one of the best yardsticks by which one may judge the performance of a Government is that of employment, the amount of job opportunities which a Government can make available for the people.  This test has never been too rigidly applied in this country, because we have always had the safety valve of emigration.  If we did not have that safety valve we could possibly have had a revolution on our hands by now.  Our total working population is always something over one million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At mid-April, 1971, we had 1,071,000 at work which is, mark you, 54,000 less than the number at work in 1956, the last year of inter-Party Government.  In other words, we have not measured up to the provision of an increasing number of job opportunities to balance the demand arising in our society.  From 1966 to April 1971 we <Col N="858" /> have been creating on average 11,000 non-agricultural new jobs per year and we have been losing 10,000 agricultural jobs per year.  This pattern has continued up to the present and may continue into 1973.</P>
    <P>My difficulty here is the acceptance of projections which have been made. We have become accustomed to those projections in the three programmes for economic expansion which have been produced here.  It is safe to say that the hopeful prognostications we have been making as regards what we would be able to do in the field of employment have not materialised.  It is one field in which we have failed. Are we in any better position now? Are the projections being made for us now any better?  I accept that our economic forecasters and soothsayers have become a little cagey and the Third Programme does not attempt to quantify to the same degree as the First and Second Programmes did.  I suppose they have burned their fingers so much that they have learned and are more cautious about giving firm figures.  However, the White Paper which has been prepared for the Government in respect of our entry into Europe projects that during the transitional period, 1973 to 1978, non-agricultural employment will increase to an average of 14,000 extra jobs per year and the flight from the land will drop to an average of 7,000 a year. One is hesitant, in view of our present situation, to accept that the increase in job opportunities of 1,000 per year which obtained during the sixties will average 6,000 per year from 1973 to 1978.  It seems rather too good to expect.  I am not saying that in any spirit of opposing entry into the Common Market on the basis of employment because I believe that if we stay out our position will be worse but we should be realistic about these things and this six-fold increase seems rather optimistic in view of our present unemployment tendencies.</P>
    <P>Even if we accept this projection of extra job creation and, of course, it will have to come in the latter part of the transitional period&mdash;it would have to arise more in the years 1976, 1977 and 1978&mdash;we will still have with <Col N="859" /> us a good amount of our 77,000 unemployed, our 4,500 redundancies and, I suppose, 6,000 or 7,000 school leavers, less retirements, every year clamouring on the market.  The Minister for Social Welfare is here now. If he is speaking later I should like him to elaborate on these figures in the White Paper, which have not been elaborated on, because they have been questioned.</P>
    <P>The safety valve of emigration has been pretty well closed against us. According to the figures I have, emigration has come down from 10,000 in 1969 to 5,000 in 1970 and to 1,000 in 1971.  That, with a million unemployed in Britain, is a serious problem which will continue into next year.  Even allowing for the expansionist budget introduced by Mr. Barber in Britain I cannot see that there will be sufficient easing of the British economy to hold out great hopes for an improvement in our unemployment position by next winter. I think we will have a position pretty similar to what we had in the winter just past.</P>
    <P>There is one thing which I must confess is difficult for me to comprehend. In the &ldquo;Review of 1971 and Outlook for 1972&rdquo; which we got before the budget, there is, on page 86, a table which gives indices of output and earnings per hour and of wage costs per unit of output in manufacturing industry.  It covers the USA, Japan, West Germany, France, Italy, the UK and Ireland.  For a number of years it has been pointed out that we are head of the league as far as wage costs per unit of output are concerned.  It has been mounting at a higher rate here than in all of the other countries.  I do not know how that figure is calculated.  On the face of it it looks very impressive.  It gives the base at 1963 as 100 but we would need to know more about what the starting point was like before we could reach a full judgment merely on these figures.  Perhaps the Minister could explain that to us.  I certainly do not understand it.</P>
    <P>I am again at a loss to understand why such emphasis is placed on this <Col N="860" /> unit wage cost.  Nobody seems to question it.  Everybody accepts it.  I am not saying that it is without validity.  It certainly has validity but in our particular society is it as important as in other societies?  We make a comparison and then the conclusion is drawn that our workers are the people who are responsible for all the trouble, that their demands for higher wages have upset our economy.  We must look at it from the point of view of exports.  Half our exports are agricultural and unit wage costs do not impinge very directly on the costings of agricultural exports.  There is very little of an import side to it.  Most of the people employed in agricultural production are self-employed.</P>
    <P>There is the industrial aspect of it. Here one wonders also is it so important. Take, for example, our labour force engaged in exports.  I understand that most of our exports now are capital intensive exports with a low labour content and that as a consequence the question of unit labour costs would not project so much into the argument as it otherwise would.  I put these two points to the Minister for Labour. When he is dealing with these particular problems he may be able to explain to me whether the points I am making about unit wage costs are valid.</P>
    <P>I am rather disappointed in the financial statement by the Minister for Finance because of an omission of something which has got a good deal of publicity in recent years, that is, the question of speculation on property and particularly on building sites. If the building site amounts to 20 per cent of the cost of a house, it is a serious matter in a country where land should be reasonably accessible for that purpose.  The only effort made so far by the Government to help society in this respect is the making of a pool of land available and that was practically confined to the Dublin area.  I think £3 million was set aside.  Otherwise local authorities are allowed to invest in property if they can, at their own expense and at their own risk.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there should be some constitutional amendment made in order to nationalise building land.  Here, again, I understand <Col N="861" /> that there is a committee that has been set up under the chairmanship of Justice Kenny to investigate the constitutional aspect.</P>
    <P>This speculation which I have mentioned arises from three factors.  It arises from the fact that there are not enough houses being built by local authorities to provide for the people and, consequently, a number of middle class or lower middle class income groups are being forced into the market to buy houses.  The second factor, of course, is inflation, which the Government have failed to control.  You will not find speculation in the absence of inflation, or very little, because the old doctrine is that in an inflationary period property mounts in value.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is this question of planning.  The ordinary person does not know how planning arrangements will go.  Others apparently do know. Our planning administration does not make decisions openly, as we on this side of the House have been advocating for years.  It is done behind closed doors by the political head of the Department and raises serious doubts in the public mind.</P>
    <P>Again, one misses from this budget any reference to a capital gains tax. A capital gains tax operates in Britain. There may be reasons for not imposing it here.  If, for example, this question of speculation on property, particularly on housing sites, cannot be controlled, if it is unconstitutional to nationalise land for housing purposes, if there are difficulties in acquiring a pool of land, would there be any great difficulty, for example, in introducing a selective gains tax to deal with that particular situation as it affects us at the present time?  I mention these points to the Minister for his observations and comment, if he cares to give them, when he is replying.</P>
    <P>There is another matter on which I want to say a few words, that is, the question of regional development. This matter is dealt with slightly in the review of 1971 but I do not think it is covered in the financial statement. I raise it because it is of topical interest at the moment and is of great importance to us.  It is one of <Col N="862" /> the most important aspects of our proposed entry to the Common Market. I raise it because I feel the Government have not done their homework in regard to this line of country.  The Buchanan Report was issued in May, 1969.  I do not know whether that was one of the expensive reports or not.  They are all expensive but some of them are extraordinarily expensive.  The Government stated at that time that the report would be considered in the context of proposals for regional development organisations. Many organisations have made many reports.  We have had a planning study of Cork city and county by An Foras Forbartha.  Planning proposals have been commissioned in the past for Dublin&mdash;the Wright Report and others.  The Industrial Development Authority has prepared regional industrial plans.  There is an interdepartmental regional development committee which has been coordinating this material.  One Mr. Scully has presented a comprehensive report on western conditions.  Mr. Kinsey&mdash;I think it is&mdash;has presented so many reports that I could not possibly enumerate them.  There has been a small pilot farms scheme in operation, particularly in western areas.  The Land Commission has been operating its resettlement, retirement schemes, particularly the 1966 scheme, particularly for small western holders. It has been very unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Every day we are being promised that we will eventually have a formulated regional development policy put before us but so far nothing has happened. If we are to get the full benefit from our entry to the EEC it is important that we should have a regional policy properly prepared, properly tailored, before we are in. The Regional Development Commissioners of the EEC will not do that for us.  They will merely examine the proposals that we put to them and will accept or reject them.  They will fund much of the expenditure involved but the actual planning and the ground work must be done by each country concerned.  I submit that we have so far failed here beyond this spurious activity of setting up a whole host of <Col N="863" /> committees and have not produced anything tangible.  We have promises. I hope these promises will materialise fairly soon.  This is given some urgency by the fact that now Britain also is taking an interest in regional development. The people in the west would be well pleased with our application for funds for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Britain is now moving in for the first time to try to secure that urban areas should also be concerned in regional development.  There are numerous depressed areas in the North of England.  Britain can put in her claim very quickly for money for such development.  These funds are very limited and 90 per cent of the money so far distributed has gone for rural agricultural development.  This is the first time such a movement has been put afoot.  It has been begun by Britain, who are not yet members, and it has received sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason that I raise this point and urge on the Minister and the Government to try to speed up preparation of our regional development plan so that we will be ready not next year but next month or the month after to submit our proposals for our undeveloped areas before Britain and other countries get in before us and perhaps make it more difficult for us.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not deal with particular sectors of our economy which are now facing difficulties.  We understood that these sectors were mostly the older ones which were developed here under protective conditions.  Is it too much to hope that at a later stage in the debate we will hear something, perhaps from the Minister for Industry and Commerce, on the sectors of our economy which are in difficulties, how they stand at the present time and what the hopes are?</P>
    <P>For example, there is the woollen and worsted industry.  The difficulties there have been highlighted in the last 12 months and the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposed the establishment of an in-depth examination by consultants.  So far, we have <Col N="864" /> had no result of such an in-depth examination and if the Minister has information he should make it available to us for the benefit of these industries.  The footwear industry is in real difficulties and our clothing industry is also in trouble.  People in the furniture industry are complaining and those in the tanning industry&mdash;there is a factory in Carrick-on-Suir in my constituency&mdash;are getting restive.  They fear a shortage of hides.  That should not be so if the Government looked after the hide infestation schemes which were in existence and which were so successful.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious problems facing us is the position of our meat factories.  Here again the Government have been rather dilatory.  Our processed meat industry is one of the most important, involving £65 million a year.  It is passing through difficult times because our best cattle are being bought and sold, perhaps as Scottish or British beef, in stalls throughout Britain so as to avail of the 2p differential. A meat factory must, of necessity, process and sell its produce immediately but those who buy live cattle can keep them and speculate on hopes of a rise in the market.  To my mind the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has been sitting on the fence in this respect.  He has not been taking action to see how these problems could be resolved.  Perhaps he will come in during this debate and make a contribution, particularly in regard to our meat factories, but also on our agricultural economy as a whole.  Our processed meat industry is a source of big employment and if our beef industry progresses towards carcase beef exports rather than on the hoof, there will be prospects of bigger employment there.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry is the Cinderella of the piece at the moment.  Our hopes that we could keep our income here from tourism at £100 million annually have failed and a drop of £20 million is expected this year.  It was thought that a holding operation, as it were, could be carried out in respect of North America and the Continent. That may be possible but as regards the UK and Northern Ireland we are <Col N="865" /> out.  I understand we have dismantled some of our advertising machinery in Britain.</P>
    <P>This is the third year, and the worst, in which we have faced difficulties in this industry.  There has been a tendency, I suggest, to overblame the Northern situation for this.  It was a most important factor but even before it arose we had been falling down in our own costings side.  There were many complaints of increased prices here particularly in regard to the things tourists require.  I made a suggestion here when Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance that we should give cheap petrol to tourists.  He did not agree and we have lost in an industry which will take us many years to recover.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we are faced with difficulties in regard to demands for landing rights at Dublin Airport, the American airlines pressing for the removal of our landing rights in New York.  As well, Irish Shipping, B &amp; I and CIE are all faced with difficulties because of a deteriorating situation. Ironically, at this time, we are embarking on a campaign to see Ireland first, linked with an ethnic campaign in the UK.  At last we have discovered the Irish emigrant&mdash;the poor relation from whom we have been drawing £20 million for very many years but for whom we did not provide any guidance when he left this country.  We always took the remittances the emigrants sent, but we never gave one penny towards the provision of social welfare centres for them in Birmingham or London or any other place.  On one occasion I asked a Fianna Fáil Minister if he would ensure that a leaflet containing addresses of hostels and similar information was given to every person leaving here.  To that simple request I got the shortest answer I have ever received in this House&mdash;I was told &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  The Minister concerned was Deputy Aiken.</P>
    <P>There is little in the budget for agriculture. In 1971-72 the Vote for agriculture was £80 million but this year there has been a drop of £4 million in this amount.  They got £1.8 million as a result of the chopping and changing in the budget.  In the meantime there has <Col N="866" /> been a drop in the amount paid by way of subsidy.  Because of the rising prices of dairy products, the drought in New Zealand last summer which resulted in a reduction of production, and because of the Mansholt policy which resulted in a reduction of production on the Continent, the subsidy dropped from £30 million to £24 million.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the budget with regard to the huge investment demands which have been mentioned by some economists and by the President of the Irish Farmers' Association, Mr. T. J. Maher.  The economist, Mr. Walsh, during the year spoke about a £1,000 million investment as necessary for the agricultural industry.  One suggestion was that this should be spread over ten years; another suggestion was to spread the amount over a five-year period. However, there is little of this kind of thinking in the budget despite the fact that we hope to gain the greatest benefits for this industry when we enter the EEC.  There has been little encouragement given to the farming community &mdash;not what I expected that there would be because the money is not available to meet the cost.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made about the social welfare increases.  This is a political baby that is brought out each year.  One could say it is a foster child of the Minister for Social Welfare who likes to see that this matter is looked after.  An additional sum of £8.3 million has been given for social welfare but, having regard to the fact that inflation is running at the rate of 9 per cent and that the increases for social welfare will not be paid until August and October, one can appreciate that the extra benefits will only cover the increased cost of living.  It is contended that the increases in social welfare benefits are greater than the increased cost of living but, if this is so, the margin is very thin.  If we have an increase in the cost of living of 9 or 10 per cent it will absorb the £8.3 million. So far as the social welfare category are concerned they will not be any better off.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Finance introduced an extension for estate duty activities.  There has been criticism at different times regarding the wisdom of <Col N="867" /> estate duty because it has never been a major source of income.  Approximately £5 million or £6 million has been collected but this has caused a considerable amount of stress to the people concerned.  This has been aggravated by the abolition of the marriage settlement concession by which is was possible to obtain exemption from death duties.  This concession was of considerable help to farmers.</P>
    <P>I have had considerable complaints about the effect of estate duty on ordinary farmers, particularly in view of the high inflation with regard to land properties.  I accept that the valuation for estate duty purposes in respect of a farm is a notional value and is not a market value.  Nevertheless, the duty is onerous and there have been many difficulties since the marriage settlement concessions were abolished. By increasing the revenue from estate duty it makes it correspondingly more difficult to abolish that duty.  Estate duty has increased from £6 million in 1970-71 to £9 million.  I do not know how much of this is due to the extra money arising from the abolition of the marriage settlement exemptions.  I asked a parliamentary question in connection with this matter but apparently the figures are not compiled in a form to show that information.  Therefore, I am at a loss to know what effect this imposition has had in the increase from £6 million to £9 million.  The reduction this year of £13 million must be taken into consideration and set against the increase from £6 million to £9 million.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister introduced the matter of pension parity.  This has been advocated on this side of the House since I first entered the Dáil and probably long before that. I am sure it is merely justice long delayed.  I do not know to what extent we may thank the Minister for it: one must recognise that those seeking parity formed an organisation which continued lobbying and eventually, I understand, put a notice in the paper saying they would oppose EEC if they did not get parity.  I do not know if that influenced the Minister but they got parity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> The newspapers, the public, the publicans and porter-drinkers all seem to be happy that no increased excise duties were imposed.  This was regarded as a stroke of genius on the part of the Minister.  The truth is he dared not do it.  There was the old danger of the law of diminishing returns but even that would not have stopped him: he was stopped by two considerations, first, that our tourism is already humped and to add any more taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco would make the position worse.  The second consideration was that taxation in the EEC on these commodities is considerably lower than here and the Government know the time will come when harmonisation of taxes including excise not only as regards items but also rates will become a factor in EEC agreement.  It would therefore be out of line and out of step if he further increased this form of taxation.  Therefore, he could do no more and I think nobody should give him any credit for not putting the extra penny on the pint and the extra 2d on the glass of whiskey.  In fact, at present a Double Diamond, to take one example, costs 10p in England and in the bar here costs 14p.  That does not leave much room for adding to the bill on beer and spirits if we are to get any visitors to holiday here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The same argument applies in respect of income tax and taxation in general.  Income tax jumped from £116 million last year to £152 million this year, an extraordinary increase.  Total tax revenue jumped from £481 million last year to £569 million this year.  These figures show why the Minister could not further increase taxation: he had gone to the veritable limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He increased personal allowances but how much should we thank him for that?  I do not know, because I have not yet worked out what the increase means in relief of particular persons, but before the new allowances were given the position between ourselves <Col N="869" /> and those in Britain or Northern Ireland was as follows: for earnings of £500 by a single person there would be no income tax payable in Britain but there would be £35 payable here.  With earnings of £700, the income tax payable in Britain would be £33 and in Ireland £96.  Again, a single person earning £1,000 in Britain would pay £123 tax; in Ireland it would be £175.  In the case of married couples the position was as follows: at the £500 level there would be no tax in the UK and none here; on £700 there would be no tax in the UK and £9-£10 here: at £1,000 there would be £68 tax in the UK and £114 here.  It was that differential which forced the Minister's hand and not conscience or any other consideration.</P>
    <P>Faced with the position in which he could not further increase taxation he was forced to borrow.  The whole pattern of budgeting here does not seem to be logical.  There seems to be some extraordinary difficulty in the field of economics and forecasting in our circumstances. For example, in trying to analyse what went wrong with the different budgets we had the position of the present Taoiseach coming to the House and exclaiming piteously &ldquo;What went wrong with my June budget?&rdquo; These things are still going wrong with our budgets.  In 1970, the main feature of the budget was the doubling of turnover tax.  The turnover tax which was originally reckoned to yield £12 million a year was doubled from 2½ per cent to 5 per cent.  That turnover tax now brings in £50 million and perhaps will yield £60 million in the coming year.  In the meantime, other taxes, such as wholesale tax, are being added.</P>
    <P>Following the budget of 1970, which increased turnover tax from 2½ to 5 per cent, there was the mini budget of autumn 1970.  This mini budget hinted that a prices and incomes policy would be introduced. It hinted also that the second leg of the tote &mdash; a 10 per cent wage increase&mdash; was to be amputated.  Eventually, however, either the leg was too strong or the surgeon too weak because the leg was not amputated.  What did <Col N="870" /> happen was that corporation profits tax was increased from 50 to 58 per cent.  This resulted in taking £6 million from Irish industry in a full year at a time when they were facing the dismantling of protective tariffs. Some of these industries were old established ones and were not able to face this increase.  At that time wholesale tax on luxury goods was increased from 15 to 20 per cent while tax on motor vehicles was increased by 25 per cent, which increase was absorbed by the Exchequer.  It did not go to the road fund or to the local authorities who had collected it.  All of these methods were supposed to have been a cure for inflation.  This taxation was imposed on an open type economy, an economy where strong counter forces will operate as soon as taxation is imposed.  We have here a free economy and a highly organised trade union movement which makes demands for increased wages.  We have also an open system of industry that can increase prices to meet increased taxation.</P>
    <P>In introducing that mini budget the Minister said that in 1969 unit wage costs in industry increased by more than 10 per cent, that this rate was more than double that envisaged and that, while no firm figures for 1970 were available at that time, it was possible that these costs would show a further increase of 10 per cent.  He told us that increases in income in excess of total GNP caused prices to rise approximately by the amount of the excess.  He said that the fall in industrial production was being regarded as a matter of serious concern and that, excluding seasonal adjustments, this was the first fall since the second quarter of 1966; that unemployment had increased, consumer imports were mounting, external deficits were at a high level and that tourism was in danger of losing its momentum. He said also that no responsible Government could have delayed any longer adopting the measures proposed.</P>
    <P>This form of abrasive taxation was expected to put the economy right. Such a measure would be feasible if we had a Stalin here who would stand <Col N="871" /> up and say: &ldquo;You have too much money in your pockets so I shall take it from you.&rdquo;  That could not be done here, although Fianna Fáil went very near to doing it on a few occasions. In a democracy such as ours increased prices follow increased taxation and these increases are followed inevitably by demands for increased wages and salaries.  Therefore these measures are not the answer to the problem and it has taken Fianna Fáil a long time to find this out.</P>
    <P>The measures of which I am speaking were designed to cure inflation but a few months later the Minister changed his mind again.  In the autumn of 1971 he borrowed £20 million and, as he told us, injected that amount into the economy for the purpose of getting the ship off the rocks again.  In this budget he reduces the corporation profits tax to its original figure of 50 per cent.  It is still higher than the figure which obtains in Britain, but I do not think that conditions in the two countries are comparable.  The Minister has gone further.  We are told that the change back to 50 per cent was not to take place until 1973-74 but it has been decided to do it now. Of course this decision is a result of the Minister having seen the published figures of the companies which show that trading profits have fallen.  Also, the Minister is aware of increasing unemployment and of the redundancies that have occurred and also that some companies have been put out of business.  Even if our companies should be on comparable taxation with Britain, some of them would go by the board; but if they are to be put in a disadvantageous position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Britain, many more will go.</P>
    <P>Because of the number of factories that were threatening to close and also the amount of redundancy that has occurred, the Minister for Labour must have asked the Minister for Finance to reduce the corporation profits tax because otherwise his position would be intolerable.  Apparently, the good office of the Minister for Labour seems to have prevailed.</P>
    <P>This is a borrowing budget.  The Taoiseach said it was a calculated risk. <Col N="872" /> Any budget that would have been introduced by the present Government in our present economic situation would have been risky and perhaps this is the least risky one that could have been introduced.  The risk was not a calculated one but an imposed one.  We have been managing our taxation system for a number of years now on a budgetary system called current and capital.  In the capital budget that is based on borrowing there are included items which should not be included in a capital budget because, strictly speaking, they are not capital expenditure.  I think this is being done deliberately so as to disguise expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some doubts about it because it disguises expenditure. The current budget and the capital budget have caused some confusion because they are overlapping and items have been introduced into the capital budget which should not be introduced because they are not of a capital nature.  That work is done by borrowing and, therefore, rendered respectable.  Otherwise, you would have to have them in the current budget and increase the deficit budgeting.  That would not look so respectable.  The objective is to keep the front window clean no matter what happens in the basement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our borrowing, even allowing for depreciation in money values, has reached crisis proportions in the last two or three years, particularly in the field of external borrowing.  There was a time when external borrowing was regarded as almost malpractice.  It has the disadvantage that the repayments are moneys which leave the country, in contradistinction to internal borrowing which at least keeps the money at home.  Our internal Government debt last year was £1,017 million.  This year it is £1,142 million.  That is an advance of £125 million.  That is proportionately <Col N="873" /> the biggest advance we have had since the State was founded.</P>
    <P>External borrowing stands at £107 million.  In the past two years the step forward in that borrowing has been extremely steep.  Local authority indebtedness has doubled in the past decade.  Out total net national debt now stands at an extremely high figure. It is costing us over £2 million per week to service the national debt.  Two-thirds of that money is for the repayment of interest and only one-third is for paying back capital.</P>
    <P>This budget is a &ldquo;once and for all&rdquo; budget.  We cannot afford to repeat this type of budget.  It is creating a big jump in capital expenditure as well as budgeting for a deficit.  Our internal debt maturities at 31st March, 1971, which are the debts in the various national loans which have been floated and which are due for maturity by 1976, was £498 million. This figure has advanced to £575 million.</P>
    <P>The role of the economic forecaster is always difficult.  When I criticise the various dedicated men who prepared the First, Second and Third Programmes for Economic Expansion I do not do so in any carping fashion. This is a difficult field.  It is not a precise, mathematical field, by any stretch of the imagination.  I will give an example of difficulties one would meet when making these type of forecasts. We have completely different sets of figures for growth forecast. These figures are given by people who could be regarded as experts.  The Economic and Social Research Institute give a very gloomy picture of our prospects for the coming year.  They forecast our growth prospects as 1½ per cent.  The Government give a forecast of 2 to 2½ per cent.  The OECD and the Confederation of Irish Industry forecast 2½ to 3 per cent.  Here are four responsible bodies giving different prognostications.  Similarly, there are different prognostications in relation to our balance of payments. The Economic and Social Research Institute give a figure of £70 million. The Confederation of Irish Industry give a figure of £60 million.  The Government give a figure of £68 <Col N="874" /> million.  The Government are relying in this budget, on the £28 million expansion in public capital investment, to shift the economy rather than on tax cuts or social welfare spending.</P>
    <P>I take it that it is the public capital investment on which the Government pin their hopes.  This is not something that will happen overnight.  One cannot expect immediate results from that type of investment.  The type of budget introduced by the Government was probably the only one open to them in the circumstances in which they found themselves.  I doubt if there were many other options open to them.  That does not mean that they should have found themselves in these circumstances.  It is clear that they have been flying without a compass. I do not know whether they ever had a compass.  Some people say that Deputy Haughey was the compass, and he was thrown overboard.</P>
    <P>In the last two or three budgets there seems to have been a stop-go policy pursued by the Government. They did not know what type of policy they should follow.  Perhaps their minds were on other more devious matters.  In the field of economics they do not appear to have given thought and study to the matter and have not been capable of resolving the problems.</P>
    <P>I would like to read from the <i>Newsletter</i> of the Confederation of Irish Industry of 18th April, 1972:</P>
    <P>The financing of this year's Capital Budget does, nevertheless, involve heavy borrowing by the Government.  Between now and March 1973 the Government will borrow £170 million directly and £55 million indirectly through the semi-State companies and local authorities.  Since total Government debt now stands at around £1,500 million this year's Capital Budget will bring the total up to around £1,700 million by March 1973.  Also by March 1973 Government debt will have risen by 58 per cent in four years and from 72 per cent to 85 per cent as a proportion of Gross National Product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> Because the greater part of this debt is raised from and held by residents of this country and payments of interest and principal made by the community to the community no net burden of indebtedness is involved. However, a significant and increasing proportion of the Government's debt is raised abroad and this borrowing does involve the usual burdens of indebtedness on the community. Thus in 1969 total foreign borrowing at £69 million was about 7% of GNP while by the end of this fiscal year it could be well over £200 million and 10% of GNP.  The use of foreign borrowing on this scale, with its attendant costs to the current balance of payments and the current budget, could be avoided if the nation's official external assets, which have a low yield, were run down by corresponding amounts.  It seems paradoxical, to say the least, to borrow dear and lend cheap!</P>
    <P>I think it would be accepted that our external assets are not so necessary now to guarantee our economy as they were in the early days of the State.  There would be sufficient confidence in us now.  The repatriation of our external assets is a widely publicised question and one which you will hear discussed in every pub in the country.  I should like the Minister to give his view on this matter, whether it is necessary to have our external assets at their present level, whether they can be repatriated, whether something on the lines suggested by the Confederation of Irish Industry is feasible or desirable.  The point about foreign borrowing is well taken, because this is a field from which we could well retreat.  Even in the field of revenue accountancy current Government expenditure as a percentage of our gross national product has again increased precipitously, from 25 per cent in 1966 to 30 per cent in 1971.</P>
    <P>In general the public do not appreciate the dark shadows behind this budget.  As I said already, this is a borrowing budget, and anyone who has to sustain himself on borrowing can only do so for a limited period. <Col N="876" /> This is a lamentable image for a country to present on the eve of entering Europe.  The fact that our economy has to be bolstered up by a higher degree of borrowing than ever before indicates that not alone are we the most underdeveloped country of the Ten but unfortunately also the most maladministered.</P>

      <P>These figures are absolutely correct.  The Government are living on borrowed money and borrowed time.  Their attitude is that the economy is no longer a viable entity.

      <P>I am particularly concerned with the social welfare aspect of the budget and I do not intend to take up the time of the House going into all <Col N="877" /> aspects of Government policy as did the previous speaker.  I do admit that the budget does give an opportunity to cover a wide field, but it is not the overall policy-making instrument that it is claimed to be, although it is important in making financial provision for the year ahead in relation to matters that are not already covered in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan concluded by saying that Fianna Fáil are the greatest cliff-hanging party he has ever known.  I am 21 years in the House this year and I have spoken on every budget, and there has always been a challenge from the other side of the House to Fianna Fáil to go to the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Deputy blathering for the last two hours and I did not contradict him once.  I have often listened to this challenge to go to the country.  Time after time we went to the country and this cliff-hanging Government came back stronger than before, so often, in fact, that this statement has no credibility any more.  I suppose they must keep on making it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hogan covered a wide field and was most contradictory.  In one breath he said that Fianna Fáil were operating without a compass and in another breath he admitted that forecasting was a dangerous business, an area in which it was impossible to be accurate, which, of course, is correct. He then blamed different people for having different speculations with regard to the future.  <i>Old Moore's Almanac</i> was one of the things that prophesied most in my young days.  I think it is still in existence.  They were free to say what they liked.  Anybody who gets up to make a speech outside can prophesy what the future will hold but we must be realistic and try to aim at attainable or realisable targets.  It is not always possible to forecast accurately even using the indicators available and the methodology that is now used.  That does not mean that others, whether associations, groups of people, <Col N="878" /> or individuals, cannot make an Old Moore effort and forecast whatever they will.</P>
    <P>This budget has been condemned by the speakers I have listened to so far, not strongly condemned, but all of them attributed motives for every item dealt with by the Minister in his budget speech and said it was for the purpose of entry to the EEC.  Some people suggested it was an election budget.  It is interesting that the FUE, the Congress and all the people who came together and made pronouncements before the budget suggested that this was what they would like to see the Minister do.  Now when he has done it, all sorts of ulterior motives are imputed and everybody sees some sinister reason for everything in it.</P>
    <P>There is another thing&mdash;perhaps when we were on the other side of the House we had this weakness but I always tried to avoid it&mdash;and it is the method of attack or opposition by which a Deputy first takes all the things that were not done in the budget, things which would cost millions, and criticises the Government for not doing them and then goes on to criticise all the borrowing, all the taxes, and to make unfavourable comparisons between us and other countries with regard to taxes.  The insinuation is that you should take money out of anywhere to do all the things you want to do and then the taxes are criticised at the same time. If we are to show people outside that we are serious and attempting to be constructive we must appreciate that anything we do is limited by the resources available to us.  If we are to ask for benefits of any great magnitude we must have a corresponding debit on the other side of the ledger in order to pay for them.  The money must come out of somebody's pocket.  There is no magic way of finding money.  We are dealing with the people's money.  We will be judged on how we distribute it.</P>
    <P>I am mainly concerned with the redistribution of national wealth which is something for which we are often criticised.  We are told not only in this House but by organised groups outside that we lack a social conscience <Col N="879" /> because we are not giving greater benefits to this, that and the other group.  There are many things we lack when it comes to paying the weaker sections but a social conscience is not one of them.  Whenever we do something generous for the weaker sections we are accused of doing it for the purpose of getting votes or for some other ulterior motive.  When we do not give as much as Deputies opposite would like us to give, we are accused of lacking in social conscience, of, for some peculiar reason, not wanting to give to people, of trying to penalise the poor people.  I am happy about the budget this year because, first of all, it is a budget that does not place an extra load on anybody.  It relieves the load for most.  In that context I am prepared to accept the difficult situation. One could not expect to get all that all of us would like to get for the weaker sections.  The £12 million odd which social welfare benefits will cost in a full year is no trifle.  I hope the day has not come when we regard £12 million as a trifle not worth mentioning. It is a marked step forward in the right direction for the right people.  I wish it was three times as much but it is a worthwhile contribution to the right people who do spend what they get immediately; it is injected into the economy, stimulates circulation and purchasing power and benefits the butcher, the baker and so on.</P>
    <P>Social welfare can be the political football it often is but we must adopt a serious outlook towards this whole question.  I am having a lot of examination carried out at present particularly in relation to what is known as &ldquo;home assistance&rdquo; with a view to having a restructuring in that area so that we will have a nationalised service with some uniformity that will be capable of reaching out to persons who perhaps do not qualify for a particular benefit at present or who are in receipt of a benefit for which they are not exactly qualified.  I refer to unemployment assistance or a thing known as &ldquo;dole&rdquo;.  In many cases if a person had to prove that he was capable <Col N="880" /> of, available for and genuinely seeking work he would find it rather difficult to do it.  There are people in an age-group or in a physical condition where assistance is needed.  Apart from the restructuring that is to be done, the social welfare umbrella here extends over a great many people and indeed more than is necessary to cover the requirements of the International Labour Organisation conventions to which we have subscribed and our requirements <i>vis-à-vis</i> membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Rates may not be equal to those in other countries.  I do not say that with any shame.  I am not ashamed of the rates at all.  I can say that there is no country in the world that has shown such a marked progress in such a short time, the same upward trend that we have shown in the past ten years in social welfare, adding from £16 million to £11 million, and not less than £9 million, every year, in the budget. For a small country our rate of progress is something we need not be ashamed of.  Please God we will keep it up and our next budget will be twice as good for the social welfare people. This is the type of progress one looks forward to.  We can only use resources to the extent where it is not hurting too much those who must pay.  We must have regard for an important individual in our economy, the man who produces.  We have not got all that many producers.  The producer is an important person and we must ensure that he is given an opportunity to continue because he is the source of all our wealth.  We must have regard to what we take from him at any given time.  When we join the enlarged EEC we will undoubtedly, irespective of what the critics may say, have resources available to us that we have not had before and it will be easier to do things more rapidly than it would be if we were left out in the cold or remained as we are.  We cannot remain as we are.</P>
    <P>It will not be sufficient for me, as far as social welfare is concerned, to enjoy the rhythm of progress that membership of the EEC will give us, in addition to our own resources, so that we can improve matters for the <Col N="881" /> weaker sections, the social welfare classes.  That is very good in its own way but it is not enough.  Immediately on entry we must take a serious look at the whole field and do something worthwhile.  It is for that reason that the Government have authorised me to say that social welfare will have a first call on any savings that there will be in subsidies to agriculture and milk products for immediate improvement. That is exactly as one would expect. We cannot allow the weaker sections of the community to suffer any jolt or not to enjoy the improved standards that others will enjoy with an expanding economy consequent on wider and stronger institutions being available to us.</P>
    <P>We must export.  We have been exporting.  Despite all the criticism that there has been in the past year or two, when we, in common with most developing countries, experienced a recession in some respects, our exports were running at a remarkably creditable level.  That is a tribute to those who are exporting, very often against a tariff wall.  It is one of the best indicators of the soundness of our economy. Inevitably, peaks and hollows occur in the economy.  I am not making an EEC speech but I would say that membership of the European Communities would be the best means of obviating these peaks and hollows which any expanding economy must experience from time to time.  I do not say it would obliterate or prevent them but it would obviate them.  These peaks and hollows are inevitable, the only hopeful thing being that each time a recession occurs our economy is stronger and better able to withstand it and it passes off leaving less scar.</P>
    <P>In that context, I was delighted that I succeeded in getting almost £12 million, in a full year, for the social welfare classes.  There are some notable features about how the money is allocated. I would point out that one of the things the Government were anxious to do was to lean heavily towards those with dependants.  Deputies will notice that in the case of all social welfare payments the increase is greatest in cases where there are dependants, so that the family will get <Col N="882" /> the greatest improvement from the benefits given.  In fact, the dependant allowance is in some cases increased by 50 per cent, which is not bad, and in a few cases the increase is greater. That is a creditable performance by any standards.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested that we are greasing the road to the EEC.  I would remind those who would say that that when it was suggested by all the economists, by the Congress of Trade Unions, by the Federated Union of Employers, before the budget, that this would be the right thing to do, nobody then said that, if we did it, it would be regarded as being done for some ulterior motive.  This budget is calculated to be the best type of budget to introduce in the present circumstances. It eases the burden.  It does not impose any new burden.  It gives generous benefits to those most in need of them.</P>
    <P>One thing that is conspicuous by its absence from the social welfare benefits is any reference to the childrent's allowance as such.  I am not referring to dependent children.  I have already pointed out that they have come out of the budget very well.  We have leaned reasonably heavily towards them.  I refer to the children's allowance which is now under examination for the purpose of devising some form of selectivity.  I would not promise at this stage that it would be possible but I hope that we can reach a stage where the amount of money we pay would, by more selective distribution, give a worthwhile contribution to those most in need of it.  In the matter of the children's allowance our social welfare stands the worst comparison with other countries with which we will be closely associated in the future.</P>
    <P>I abhor the system whereby people receive children's allowance who frequently forget to draw it and have to get a special order to have the matter rectified while there are many others who are almost knocking at the post office door before it opens in order to get their money.  It is to this latter category that I would like to give more, and considerably more, because the children's allowance is the most desirable and most laudable of the <Col N="883" /> family supports.  Its general application, as at present, rules out any means test.  A means test is something that we would like to avoid.  If we find that there is no better means of selectivity, then a means test, on some basis, would have to be accepted so that the money would be more equitably distributed.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a lot of money here.  There are well over one million children.  An increase of one shilling per week per child would take over £2½ million a year.  Any worthwhile contribution would cost a great deal. We have got to be prepared to make that worthwhile contribution in the not too distant future.  This is the only aspect of the social welfare code that has not got a lift in the budget.</P>
    <P>I was particularly concerned about the provision of free travel for all persons over 70 years of age.  I am frequently asked why we should not abolish the means test and give everyone the pension at 70 years of age.  I have always pointed out that, on the calculation given to me, it would take £8 million or £9 million&mdash;more now as the rates go up&mdash;for that purpose and that if I had that sort of extra money available.  I should like to increase the pension to those already getting it rather than give it on a no means test basis to everybody.  However, everybody who reaches 70 years of age is entitled to some recognition from the State, particularly those who worked hard and accumulated and who put themselves out of reach of qualifying for pensions.  One of the criticisms frequently levelled at the old age pension scheme is that the hard working man who has been thrifty during his lifetime becomes disqualified for a pension by his good management while the ne'er-do-well qualifies easily.</P>
    <P>Free travel for all old people has been introduced for the first time. Beyond the birth certificate, it is something that goes without a means test and it is a recognition of the responsibility of the State towards our old people.  On this occasion also we have given extra units under the free electricity scheme.  Of course, this is a misnomer because that scheme pays only <Col N="884" /> for the normal fixed ESB charge levied on floor space, plus so many units. the one hundred units has been increased to 200 units in the summer and 300 in the winter.  The specific purpose of the latter increase is to encourage old people to use electric heating. Sociologists and medical men agree that more old people die from cold than from any other cause and one has only to look at the death columns in the winter to realise that about four times as many old people die in the winter than in the summer.  I hope that this increase in the number of units will encourage them to use more electric heating.  There may be some difficulty here because there are separate meters for heating and for ordinary current and if heating is added to the ordinary meter it becomes more costly.  I hope that the extra units provided will mean that fewer old people will be cold in the winter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to many aspects of the economy and the Minister for Finance will deal with those when he is replying.  I rose mainly to deal with the social welfare aspects and I should like at this stage to deal with one point made by Deputy Hogan. He was critical of the information service provided by my Department for emigrants.  We have had an emigrant committee for some time and they have been provided with money to disburse.  They meet in my Department frequently.  They have been in touch with all the agencies interested in emigrants and they have given them financial assistance to make better provision for the enlightenment of emigrants.  Of course, the first duty of such agencies is to inform intending emigrants of the opportunities for them at home and try to persuade them to stay at home.  If people still want to go they can be given assistance.  I might add that very few emigrants needed assistance.</P>
    <P>Recently a clergyman from London told me that there is only a trickle of emigrants arriving there at the present time.  Even when emigration was running at its highest, many emigrants went to join relatives or friends or members of their own families and they did not want anybody bothering <Col N="885" /> about their business or about where they were going.  Indeed, many of them can become irate at the suggestion that they might need guidance.  Many professional people go abroad for the first year of their careers to get experience which will stand by them in later years, whether they be dentists or doctors or teachers.</P>
    <P>Our present emigration regulations leave no room for the kind of worry expressed by Deputy Hogan.  Everyone associated with this matter agrees we have done a good job in the matter of looking after people who involuntarily emigrated and who need assistance. As I have said, in the past year or so very few people are leaving us and, of course, this raises another problem of providing alternative opportunities at home.  This, however, is a challenge we can hopefully face and I hope that in a few years we can look back and say that we have done a good job.  Many people are realising that far off hills are not always as green as they look.  Many have come to realise that there is not a country in the world in which one can bring up a family as well as in a place called Ireland.  The more who appreciate this the better for the country.  Soon our people will be able to take advantage of the greater opportunities that membership of the EEC will bring to us.</P>

In this context, this budget has done a great service.  It has added £12 million to the payments of social welfare benefits.  It has given us a great start on the threshold of our admission to the EEC, one which I hope will be availed of by all.</P>

Today he <Col N="886" /> was bubbling over with the milk of human kindness and one would not imagine that this was the same Minister who withdrew the dole from some 27,000 people last year, the man who left the most destitute and helpless section bereft of any means of livelihood.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated afterwards he did not realise what the officials in his Department had done. Obviously, he is a well-intentioned Minister, but he is a Minister in one of the most conservative and reactionary parties this country has had.</P>
      <P>Even a schoolboy with an elementary knowledge of economics could have predicted this budget.  It was designed to put a better face on a most ugly and appalling economic situation. Inflation is rampant, the cost of living is spiralling, unemployment is nearly at the 100,000 mark and taxation in terms of income tax, purchase tax, rent and rates and interest rates is reaching backbreaking dimensions.  Having regard to all these factors there was little else the Minister for Finance could do. He did the usual thing.  He threw out a few sops here and there and, for the first time in the history of this State, the Minister deliberately budgeted for a deficit of £34 million.  Whatever concessions he gave he has given on borrowed money and the people will have to repay that in higher taxation in the months and years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole unsavoury piece of legislation was designed to entice people to vote for the Government in the forthcoming referendum on entry into the EEC.  It is well to remember that a short time ago the late General de Gaulle rejected Britain's application for entry on the grounds that Britain was not ready economically for entry; in fact, Britain was referred to at that time as &ldquo;the sick man of Europe&rdquo;.  If General de Gaulle were alive today and <Col N="887" /> if he were asked to diagnose our economic malaise, surely he would come to the conclusion that <i>rigor mortis</i> had set in and that there was no salvation for our weak and undeveloped economy.  Never was a country less prepared, unready and vulnerable for entry into the battle with the giants of Europe.</P>
    <P>This budget is unique in many ways. First, we budgeted for a deficit of £34 million.  Clearly the plight of our people was so bad that the Minister for Finance was unable to balance his budget.  He followed the example of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Tory Government in Britain, a Government that very quickly have undone the great achievements of the Labour Government and have brought economic disaster on the British people.  As we are bound financially to Britain. Minister for Finance invariably tend to imitate in some way the British budget and this budget was predictable in that regard.</P>
    <P>The budget was predictable in that statesmen at home and abroad were appealing for some positive steps to bridge the gap between standards in this part of Ireland and in the North of Ireland.  Positive action was demanded by many people.  We expected some movement towards bridging the gap, spiritually and materially, between our peoples, North and South.  We looked in particular to social welfare for a vast improvement in this connection. Some slight concessions were granted but they were totally inadequate to bridge the gap or to bring our social welfare benefits into line with those obtaining in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The increases in retirement pensions were also predictable.  The growing numbers of unemployed were a great embarrassment to the Government. Public representatives know that every attempt is being made to reduce these figures by making it more difficult to secure benefit, even to become registered as unemployed.  It was an effective gimmick by the Government to increase retirement pensions to the same figure as contributory old age pensions and thereby entice people to retire at 65 years.  These are people <Col N="888" /> who, in the normal course of events, would continue to sign as unemployed until they reached the age of 70 years. By this device the unemployment figures would be reduced.</P>
    <P>The increases in retirement, old age pension and widows' pensions, in disability benefit and unemployment benefit, merely compensate for the increase in the cost of living.  They do nothing to improve living standards and this is where we fault the Government. These people must wait several months before they get these increases but in the meantime the cost of living will have risen further and their incomes will be depleted.</P>
    <P>Again, in respect of non-contributory classes the increases have been marginal and, I believe, were calculated merely to compensate for recent cost increases.  I am sorry that the Minister for Social Welfare found it necessary to leave because I intend to comment briefly on certain serious anomalies in the administration of the assistance schemes which urgently need to be rectified.  There is an odious means test involved for the old age pensioners and those of us on old age pensions committees can see the injustice of the whole process in operation. The rigid application of the means test whereby anyone whose means exceeds £4 per week means that he does not receive any portion of an old age pension but at the same time a large farmer who may have handed over his mansion and possibly estate to a relative will be granted the full pension.  Here is a situation of a man on the poverty line denied an old age pension because he has more than £4 a week while a man who continues to live in luxury deriving all the benefits from a large estate gets the full pension.</P>
    <P>There are anomalies in regard to the deserted wives' allowance.  If these unfortunate women go to work to supplement their meagre means they risk having their allowances withdrawn.  I have cases on my file at present of women who, because they went to work to maintain themselves and their children, have been asked to return their allowance books to the Department.</P>

      <P>Why continue a situation where you have people living on pensions, local authority retirement pensions, British war pensions or some such pensions treated so shabbily?  Let us take a British war pension.  Immediately the pensioner gets an increase in the British pension, his old age pension or any portion of it he is getting is reduced or withdrawn. This is the kind of odious means test against which I protest and the kind of anomaly I find utterly disgusting.</P>
      <P>I was talking about the deserted wives and the precarious position they are in especially if they tend to help themselves by going out to work.  The Minister should be very slow to withdraw allowances where women feel compelled to work to maintain themselves and their children, assuming the children are adequately cared for in the mother's absence.  I am sure good care is taken in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned also with the further anomaly of the divorced wife.  Despite the many times the matter has been mentioned in the House the Minister has not yet taken positive steps to rectify it.  Women who are clearly deserted, and positively proved to have been deserted by being divorced in Britain, are not recognised as deserted <Col N="890" /> wives or divorced persons in this country. We may not have many of these cases but there are some in my constituency and, despite my many pleadings in the House, representations and personal contacts with the Minister, I have not been able to resolve them.  It is particularly disgraceful that women known to be deserted in this fashion should be so completely disregarded by the State.  This situation has continued too long and I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to convey to the Minister my strong views on the matter.  It is high time that this anomaly was remedied and that these women were granted the deserted wives' allowance. It is a meagre allowance but many of them are living in utter destitution and have no positive source of income through being disowned under the present code.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the administration of unemployment assistance and benefit.  I believe that at some time a directive must have been issued to all employment exchange managers to get tough in respect of applicants for unemployment benefit or assistance.  I have been appalled at the number of people who have been disallowed benefit on the flimsiest pretexts.  Invariably, it happens to married women who, despite having worked and been fully insured for a good number of years, are turned down when they apply for unemployment benefit on the ground that they are not ready, willing and available for work.  This is particularly disgraceful in circumstances where I know these women to be anxious, willing and available for work.  It is a disgraceful action on the part of public officials.</P>
    <P>The position is still worse in the case of those now applying for unemployment assistance or the dole.  They must qualify on a number of grounds.  A rigid means test is applied.  I know of single men genuinely seeking work whose stamps have run out and who are compelled to sign for unemployment assistance as distinct from unemployment benefit and who had this means test applied to them.  As a result, they were offered the paltry allowance of 50p weekly.  Imagine having to sign daily at the local exchange and at the <Col N="891" /> end of the week collect 50p! I asked how this was possible.  I knew a particular man to have no positive means. So clear was the position that the local assistance officer, who is no easy man to contend with, granted £1 a week home assistance.  Despite that, I was informed by the Department that the fact that he was living with his family and enjoying the shelter of his parents' roof was regarded as means.  The assessment of that accommodation was such as to result in his weekly allowance being reduced to 50p.  That is an example of what is probably the worst form of social code in the world.  It is bad enough to have it in respect of single men but it is particularly galling where married men are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is also the case of a married man, the father of a large family, who lives in Cashel town.  This man has been denied unemployment assistance on the basis of a means test.  I am prepared to swear, as I am sure would those people in the town who know him, that he has no other means.  He has been refused a qualification certificate which would enable him to be registered as unemployed.  It is my contention that every possible type of unfair device is being used at present to prevent people being registered as unemployed.  This is resulting in untold suffering and hardship in that such people are being denied the means of livelihood for themselves and their families.  For the record and for the information of the Minister's Department, the registered number of the man in Cashel to whom I have referred is V19771.  That man and his family are trying to exist on a £5 weekly food voucher.  I deplore such trickery in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that home assistance which is the last resort is the most degrading system of all.  I understand that some changes in that code are envisaged and I urge the Minister to have the changes implemented with the least possible delay.  As one who has worked and lived among the poor and who has striven to uplift them.  I know of no more inhuman and degrading system than that whereby one must present oneself for assistance at a <Col N="892" /> public place and tell one's sad tale within the hearing of other people. This code is the last remnant of the old British poor law system.  It should be eradicated from our social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given corresponding increases in respect of disabled persons maintenance allowances and infectious diseases allowances.  Again, these schemes are not administered by the Minister's Department: they are administered now by the Minister for Health and the regional health boards. The odious means test applies, too, in respect of a disabled persons maintenance allowance in that family income is reckonable in dealing with applications. An unfortunate mentally or physically retarded person will not qualify for an allowance if there is any worthwhile income going into the house in which he resides.  I understand that as a result of constant agitation in this House, the Minister may have in mind taking into account only the disabled person's circumstances. This is the right and just thing to do so as not to discriminate against those people because of other incomes in the household.  It is bad enough to be afflicted by mental or physical incapacity without having to suffer also the loss of independence as a result of having no personal income.  I hope that urgent steps will be taken to liberalise the means test and to make it possible for all those disabled persons whose applications have been refused to secure allowances.</P>
    <P>The same odious means test applies in respect of infectious diseases allowances so that the same sort of injustice results.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am afraid that the administration of the social welfare code seems to be designed to prevent people from receiving benefits rather than to facilitate them in securing benefits.  This is evident particularly in respect of certain perquisites which the Minister referred to &mdash; allegedly free electric light, free travel, free television licence and so on.  The Minister said that free travel would be available now to all people of more than 70 years of age.  I wonder whether it is to be the position now that anyone, <Col N="893" /> irrespective of whether he be a pauper or a millionaire, can travel free on a CIE bus or train?</P>

      <P>I wish the same sort of generosity would apply to other categories of persons.

Many people have the impression that if they are caring for an aged relative they are entitled to this allowance and they become indignant with public representatives when we must spell out the regulations for them or, when, having tried to secure an allowance for them, we failed.  There is trickery of a nefarious kind in respect of this allowance and the Minister ought to rectify the matter as quickly as possible. According to the regulations the allowance is payable only to a daughter or a daughter-in-law of an aged person.</P>

If her husband is alive and working invariably the application for an allowance is turned down.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is talking on the budget and has read it very <Col N="894" /> carefully and is very conversant with the allowances for old people.  The Deputy has approached the Department on many occasions, arguing the case for the old people.  If there is any liberality in the matter I will be grateful to hear about it.  Up to now I have found it impossible to secure an allowance of this kind if there is any worthwhile income going into a house. It was impossible to get an allowance unless the daughter or daughter-in-law had no income.  Invariably, if the daughter-in-law's husband was working no allowance was granted.  I make a special plea on behalf of such cases because I know what a tough nursing job caring for an old person is.  Many of these people are dedicated women and they look after their relatives very well.  They are conferring a benefit on society by caring for them at home rather than having them sent to the county home or to hospital at much greater cost to the ratepayers and taxpayers. It is time that the anomalies in the operation of that scheme in respect of allowances of this kind were amended.</P>
      <P>It was hoped that the local authorities would be empowered to provide financial or nursing assistance in such cases.  As yet, the administration of the health services is such that no such assistance is being provided.  The most that is provided is the usual chequered visit of the dispensary doctor or the local nurse.  Beyond that no assistance, financial or otherwise, is being given towards the care of the aged in their own homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been dealing with the social welfare aspects of the budget primarily. Apart altogether from social welfare, there is nothing positive in this budget which should be geared to reactivating the economy and providing more jobs.  There is nothing in the budget to provide the extra jobs which are so badly needed.  The Minister knows that industry has been reeling from attacks following the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement. This agreement caused widespread dislocation of our more vulnerable industries such as textiles, clothing and footwear.  Not only has nothing been done to safeguard these industries <Col N="895" /> by providing some form of protection, but everything is geared towards the greater market in Europe. Industry has taken a pretty bad beating under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement.  Large numbers of workers have become redundant and have been thrown on the unemployment scrapheap over the past 12 months.  This has followed an economic battle with one member of the new Community, as I shall call it. What is going to happen when we go into battle with the other eight members? What is going to be the position in this country when there will be free access of men, money and materials available from the other countries of Europe, together with Britain?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have guaranteed markets for our produce.  Does the Deputy want to stay with the country which gave us bad service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>What guarantee are you going to give the working-classes that they will have jobs when this happens?  We believe that there will be widespread unemployment and a vast increase in the cost of living. There will be a lowering of standards which will drag us down to something on a par with the early twenties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that the Parliamentary Secretary and the Government have failed utterly to govern this country. Their only outlet is to join with the other countries of Europe in the hope that the gold will rub off and give some kind of boost to our wilting and dying economy.  There is a serious threat facing industries.  There is hope and confidence that some industries will survive and expand.  As a result of factual appraisals by committees established by the Government it has been indicated clearly that the vulnerable industries are clothing, footwear, textiles, food processing, printing, light engineering, ship-building and many others.  Unless we can provide alternative work for the many who will be disemployed in, for instance, the motor assembly industry, which has got a lease of life until 1985, there will be further unemployment.  We are concerned in respect of oils, inks, <Col N="896" /> paints, polishes, drugs &mdash; all vunerable industries.  If these industries go what will replace them?  Where will the workers find jobs?</P>
    <P>I do not see much evidence in the budget of an improvement in our health services.  As a member of a health authority I know it is a difficult as ever to secure a medical card, free drugs or any other service.  Far from a liberalisation of the means test for these facilities the situation has worsened.  In the health authority to which I belong the same kind of yardstick is being applied now as was being applied a number of years ago.  It continues to be applied without regard to the increase in the cost of living or the increase in wages and salaries.  There has been no attempt to face up to the realities of the situation and to fix a means test which would have regard to modern standards and modern needs.</P>
    <P>Far from the liberalisation to which various Ministers for Health referred in this House, there has been a hardening of attitudes in respect of applicants for medical cards.  It was spelt out in the White Paper that the means test would be very largely abolished, that it would be confined to the applicant for a medical card, that there would be no regard to family income as such and each case would be decided on its merits.  That has not occurred.  This was the view of the late Minister, Donogh O'Malley; it has been adverted to by the present Minister. Deputy Childers, but he has done nothing to implement this essential feature to bring the health services down to a larger section of our community. I assert that it is more difficult today to secure these services than it was a number of years ago, and I believe the proof of that would be found by assessing the number of medical cards in use today as against this day 12 months.  I shall be asking for the figures in the House by way of Parliamentary question as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I believe that the regional health boards have proved to be a big disappointment in their operation.  They have done nothing but increase costs out of all proportion in the lavish appointment of staff, but I see no improvement <Col N="897" /> in the services.  As I have said already, I see a hardening of attitude and a worsening of facilities and, consequently, more anxiety and more distress on the part of the people who need the health services and who cannot afford the cost of doctor's fee, drugs or medicines and the like.</P>
    <P>There is also confusion in the minds of many people about the various methods of payment, about the dubious means test applied to the lower income categories, and the facilities available to the social welfare classes who contribute 30p per week in their social welfare stamp.  This applies also to the other categories of self-employed or farming people who contribute £7 per year for the health services.</P>
    <P>Neither did the budget do anything to ease the cost of living of our people. This country is fast becoming one of the most difficult countries in Europe to live in, because of spiralling costs. Our housewives are scourged and our tourist industry is being destroyed by increased prices for all commodities within recent years.  This is true in all spheres of activity and particularly in respect of the essential requirement of housing.  Serviced housing sites which were available in County Dublin for some £200 in 1960 cost £1,500 in 1969 and are costing over £2,000 at present.  In the past 12 months housing costs have been allowed to rise by upwards of 20 per cent, and the home which could be secured for some £2,500 a few years ago is now costing over £5,500.</P>
    <P>The Government which allow this situation to arise in respect of the essential requirement of housing deserve to be condemned, and condemned severely, by society.  We have been playing into the hands of the speculators, the money lenders and the rackrenters and not a finger has been lifted to stop the racket.</P>
    <P>Again the sphere of education leaves much to be desired.  The Minister for Finance must surely have had some knowledge, when he was preparing his budget a week or two ago, of what the universities contemplated in respect of fees.  There is nothing in this budget which gives hope to the many <Col N="898" /> thousands of university students that their grants will be increased, but we have the startling news that university fees are about to be increased by 25 per cent in some universities, by 20 per cent in others.  This has caused shock and dismay throughout the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope not.  I hope it will be discounted.  I understand Galway University propose to increase fees by 25 per cent, Maynooth University by 20 per cent and that the other universities will follow suit.  This is what the news media have told us today. If this be untrue, let it be stated here in this House and stated quickly. If anything can be done to stop these increases, which will bear heavily on so many of our students coming from the poorer sections of our community, let them be stopped immediately. Alternatively, let the Government indicate that grants will be increased proportionately; otherwise our universities will become what they were in the past, universities for the élite, and the poor man's son or daughter will never see the inside of a university.</P>
      <P>These increases will discriminate against the children of the poor who do not have the means to maintain themselves at university.  This is a problem which has to be grappled with effectively and speedily.  I hope, therefore, that if the Parliamentary Secretary follows me he will confirm that what the news media intimated is going to happen will not happen, or if it does happen that steps will be taken to compensate the students for these increases.</P>

      <P>On percentage it is a colossal increase which will make it virtually impossible for ordinary boys or girls to maintain themselves in a university city.  It is something that must be tackled immediately and steps taken to ease the burden and cushion the impact on the students concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No mention was made in this budget of rates.  We are concerned with taxation of various kinds.  We are concerned about turnover tax, value added tax which is proposed for the future, income tax, rates.  I understand that this matter is being looked into but it is being looked into for a long time by a Government commission.  The matter is of such urgency and importance and bears so heavily on our people that our local authorities will simply not continue to operate unless something is done to relieve the burden of rates. Already the City Fathers of Dublin have had their authority abolished because they refused to impose a crushing burden of rates on the community. Many other local authorities were also faced with that prospect.  It is high time something positive was done about it.  The injustice of the system is <Col N="900" /> to be greatly deplored.  We had hoped that pending the outcome of the commission there would have been a decision made to relieve the local authorities of the burden of the health services. This has been adverted to many times.  It has been said that the health services should be made a central charge and no longer imposed on the local authorities and thereby reduce the crushing burden of rates.</P>
    <P>I think it is fair to say that the budget on this occasion treated the farmers of Ireland with disdain and contempt.  Of the colossal amount being allocated in the budget the farming community derive merely £1.8 million.  It seems clear to us all now that the farming community have been taken for granted by the Government. Seemingly they are no longer regarded as a political force to be reckoned with.  They are expected to support entry to the Common Market.  They allegedly are the people who will reap the greatest benefits from free trade in respect of the price of the commodities they produce, especially beef, milk and milk products.  I know the farming community feel very badly about the fact that they have been treated in such an offhand fashion, as of no consequence, their votes already counted for Common Market entry. After that, of course, the Government can disclaim all responsibility for the affairs of the farmers and, indeed, the affairs of all the people of the country. They can blame it all on Brussels.  I believe the farmers large and small, rich and poor, were very unwise to show their hand in such enthusiastic fashion for entry to Europe.  This is what they get for it &mdash; contempt, nothing, the back of the hand.  If and when we join the EEC they can no longer look to this Government for sympathy, support or assistance.  All the State aids which they now enjoy in such lavish quantity will be withdrawn. Henceforth they will be dealing with the bureaucrats of Brussels.  No doubt they will have cause to agitate, protest and possibly march but it is a long march to Brussels and there can be very cold comfort at the end.  I believe many of the farmers of Ireland will be doing a serious rethink on this whole <Col N="901" /><i>modus operandi</i> and the Government may find on referendum day that the euphoria has diminished and that the farmers are seeing the sense and reality of the situation and that they will vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the position in respect of income tax.  We must be grateful for small mercies and we are not ungrateful for the meagre concessions which the Minister conceded.  For years we have been pleading with successive Ministers for Finance to recognise the injustice and unfairness of the system of income tax prevailing which is highly disincentive.  Since the advent of PAYE it has no longer been a painless extraction, as we were told it would be.  There was no attempt made to increase allowances proportionate to living costs.  The amount of income tax taken from the pockets of the hardworking people rose astronomically in recent years.  It became daylight robbery on the part of successive Ministers. They rifled the pockets of the working class.  There was a growing mountain of resentment against the system.  The system was highly disincentive and dissuaded workers from operating incentive schemes with enthusiasm or working overtime with any degree of enthusiasm.  They realised they were working not for themselves but for the tax man.  It had become a vicious system particularly unfair because there were so many other categories in opulence, highly salaried people in the professions and in the ranches who were exempt from income tax or able to evade it.</P>
    <P>It is the mass of the working class who have been maintaining this country for the past few years by their contributions to taxation.  They could not avoid income tax.  They were caught in the mesh. The last halfpenny was extracted from them.  It was high time that some recognition was given to that situation.  Were it not for the fact that a Tory Minister for Finance, in similar circumstances of economic bankruptcy, made this concession, I believe that we would not have had it from Deputy George Colley.</P>
    <P>The system remains iniquitous and unjust.  The concessions amount to <Col N="902" /> some 34p per week for a single person, some 47p for a married person and from 61p to 89p per week in respect of one child to three children.</P>
    <P>There is still no recognition from the Minister or from the Revenue Commissioners of the fact that it is only right and proper that a travel allowance be made.  A travel allowance may be claimed by the executive class but not by the working class.  Let us face the fact that a motor car is essential in most instances for travel to and from the place of employment. Labourers, artisans, tradesmen, industrial operatives must have cars to bring them to and from work.  Alternatively, they require motor cycles or scooters.  No allowance is granted under our tax code for such costly items.  In the case of the executives, the mohair suited, an allowance may be claimed in respect of an executive car. This anomaly must be changed, and changed quickly.</P>
    <P>Building workers, forestry workers, factory workers are amazed when a public representative has to say to them that they will get no allowance from the inspector of taxes in respect of their cars.  We all realise that cars are expensive to run.  There is the cost of wear and tear, repairs, replacements, tax and insurance, petrol and so on.  There is no allowance under the heading of transport costs.</P>
    <P>The housekeeper allowance is laughable in the extreme.  This allowance is granted only in cases where young children are being cared for.  In rural Ireland in particular there are very many cases of single men or widowers living alone and who must have someone to housekeep for them.  Because there is not a child in the household the housekeeper allowance is not applicable. Such men are obliged to pay a housekeeper a generous allowance per week.</P>
    <P>A short time ago there was a protest outside the gates of Leinster House about the income tax on the earnings of part-time fire fighters.  This tax is particularly disgraceful.  They are men who are prepared to train and to sacrifice time and leisure and to endanger their lives in saving the property of their neighbours.  The small honorarium <Col N="903" /> they receive for this public service is liable to tax.  The honorarium is paid annually and a considerable portion of it is deducted for income tax purposes.  This is disgraceful.  It will destroy the voluntary aspect of the fire fighting service.  Irishmen may be patriotic but they will not be taken for suckers all the time.</P>
    <P>The same applies in respect of allowances payable to local authority employees. I refer to travel allowances to truck drivers who have to travel long distances and meal allowances and lodging allowances.  It was a matter of astonishment to me as a public representative to be informed by the workers in Waterford County Council that the meagre allowances payable to them for meals, lodging and travel are now liable to income tax.  This is deeply resented.  I have a duty and an obligation to express resentment in this House of the fact that the honoraria payable to county council workers in Tipperary and Waterford are liable to tax.  I wrote to the Minister for Finance setting out the facts.  I received an acknowledgement &mdash; that was all.  I asked that the Minister would be kind enough to introduce amending legislation to rectify this matter but the Minister did not do me the courtesy of giving a detailed reply.  He failed to introduce the amending legislation in conjunction with the Budget.</P>
    <P>When we talk about improvements in the income tax code, let us not forget the glaring defects that are a cause of indignation and outrage on the part of many workers.  I think the meal allowance in question is in the region of seven shillings.  You would not get very much for seven shillings nowadays. The travelling allowance is mearge and so is the lodging allowance.</P>
    <P>They were concessions the unions fought for for a long time and having secured them we find that their value has been eroded because the tax grabber took away a sizeable portion of them.  I protest against it in the strongest possible manner.  The same applies to the payment of lump sums, be they in respect of redundancy, of gratuity or of deferred payments of arrears of <Col N="904" /> wages.  We have these amounts reduced out of all proportion by taxation.</P>
    <P>It is high time, therefore, that we took the existing old age pensions and the increases given in the budget out of the tax net.  It is particularly disgraceful that old age pensioners who may have some other small means, such as retirement pensions from local authorities, should be subject to income tax.  More disgraceful still is the manner of collection.  It is cold and callous. I have known income tax to be deducted around Christmas week in the cases of the categories I have in mind.  Large hunks of their pensions were taken away in income tax.  Old age contributory pensioners who have also small pensions from local authorities or some other such source should be free of income tax.  The standard of living of those people is very low and it was only in the past 12 or 18 months that they were taken into the tax net.</P>
    <P>There is also an anomaly in respect of lodging allowances of different kinds.  A man may be obliged to work away from home and to maintain himself in digs while maintaining his wife and family at home.  It is startling to realise that there is no income tax concession or allowance in respect of that man's obligation to buy food and to pay for lodgings while he is working away from home.</P>
    <P>These are flagrant anomalies.  Mark you, there are considerable concessions in this budget for the surtax element.  They are important, but when it comes down to the working man we find him being treated with disdain. The working man will not be exploited any longer.  He will demand social justice, and one of the reasons we had a relatively cushy budget this year is the growing widespread indignation at our callous system of income tax which has become a scourge on the main producers of wealth and at the same time conferring benefits and concessions on the people who have not been paying their fair share and who are clearly seen not to have been paying it.  We had the sad sight of the rich growing richer and the poor poorer and the wealth of the country falling into the hands of a minute <Col N="905" /> percentage, a small clique.  We have come to the stage when the working classes are not prepared to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water to a new master élite.</P>
    <P>When one examines this year's concessions in income tax, which were so long overdue, one finds they do nothing to improve the living standards of the wage earners or to increase production. They will have to go a long way further before they appease the unions and the workers.</P>
    <P>Every speaker so far in the debate has adverted to the EEC.  I have already put my views on this on the records of the House and all I will say now is that we are opposed to entry to Europe on the present terms because we believe them to be utterly inadequate for our needs.  We believe the Government have not been serious in the negotiations, that they have failed to safeguard our industries and the jobs of our people.  The Government have shown scant regard for the increases in the cost of living which we know will result from our entry. The cost of living will increase by upwards of 20 per cent and this in turn will cause a great lowering of standards which will bring our people down to mere subsistence level.  Our people will have great difficulty in securing increases in wages proportionate to such an increased cost of living because of the vulnerability of our industries and the growing lack of competitiveness of our industries in this gigantic battle.</P>
    <P>We feel the Government's approach has been too timorous, that they have sold us short to Europe.  They want us to sign the Rome Treaty on the basis that we can complete as equal partners with the rich economies of Europe when all of us know this is not true, when all of us know ours is a very weak economy and that what we will be competing in is a battle between a pigmy and a giant.  In circumstances of that kind, where we have so much to lose, we have a right to expect from the Government that they would treat these negotiations with deadly seriousness.  This is no mere trading agreement which can be amended if something goes wrong.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> The referendum will determine the standard of life of our people for an indefinite number of years ahead.  In the circumstances we have a right to expect our Government to be honest and sincere in their negotiations with the Six.</P>
    <P>This has not been done.  We are going into Europe ill-prepared, when our economy is at its lowest ebb.  We are going in in the hope and belief that the gold will rub off in the rich man's club and give a boost to our economy. I hope the gold does rub off but this may not happen.</P>
    <P>The Government have adopted a fawning, crawling approach towards the EEC, an attitude of going in at any price and on any terms.  This is what happened in 1961 when the door was slammed on Britain and Ireland. This is the foolish, stupid posture which has been maintained ever since. There have not been any serious efforts made to negotiate.  We believe there are alternatives&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Minister for Finance told us he was budgeting for a deficit, that he was going to finance that deficit by taking approximately £7 million as a once-for-all payment from the Central Bank and that he was going to borrow approximately £27 million and finance his budget in this way.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that because I think he is budgeting for a surplus rather than a deficit; I think he has underestimated his receipts and over-estimated expenditure in some respects.  I can give a few examples of what I mean. The Minister has stated that receipts from turnover tax, income tax and other items will be increased by some £10 million.  That is a gross underestimation because he can expect to receive a much larger sum from those sources.  The Minister has told us he has taken into account a sum of £17 million in respect of increases in salaries in the coming year.  I am told that a study of previous budgets will show that such provision has never been made in a budget in respect of such increases.</P>

    <P>The Minister has presented a budget in which he did not find it necessary, whether honestly or dishonestly, to impose any taxation.  I suppose we should not complain about that, but as an instrument of social justice this budget has failed miserably.  I am glad that the previous speaker for the Government was the Minister for Social Welfare because I should like to point out <Col N="908" /> several instances where I consider the Government have failed to help the poorer sections of the community.</P>
    <P>The benefits that have been given to the social welfare classes will not do any more for them than to keep body and soul together.  In the social assistance classes there are two categories: those who are living with other people gainfully employed and those who are living on social assistance and are living alone or with other people not gainfully employed.  These people have been treated in a disgraceful way.  They have been given an increase of 50p in their allowances as from 1st August, 1972.  At a time when £1 had some value, even though we had not the apparent affluence of today, these people were given 5s or 7s 6d.</P>
    <P>The situation has completely changed because we are living in an inflationary situation which gives the appearance of wealth and affluence.  The gap between the lower income group, between the people on subsistence level and the remainder of the community, the better-off people, has widened tremendously. I was amazed to hear the Minister for Social Welfare opening his remarks today in this House by saying that as Minister for Social Welfare he is very happy with the budget. This is a reflection on his social thinking and on that of the Government. Surely the Government realise that there are many elderly people living alone, or with relatives not working or not able to work, and to give these people an increase of 50 pence per week in present conditions does not even indemnify them against the present cost of living.  Not only should they be indemnified against current costs but we should do something to bring up their standard of living to the standard required in 1972.  The Minister for Social Welfare has failed to do this in this Budget.</P>
    <P>I am speaking particularly on behalf of the non-contributory old age pensioner &mdash; and also, indeed, contributory old age pensioners if they have no other means of support &mdash; unemployment assistance recipients and disabled persons who are living on the paltry sum of £4.40 at present and who will <Col N="909" /> get another 50 pence to bring them up to £4.90.  That is not good enough.  I hope we have reached a stage in our social thinking when nobody would begrudge to the less fortunate section of the community some approach to social justice.  I say that because I believe it is true.  There is no new social thinking in this budget.  Some suggestion was made by one of the Parliamentary Secretaries to a Labour speaker that he was complaining about the man who transfers his farm to his son.  I am not complaining about that or about the farmer qualifying for the old age pension.  That is a good thing and is in the interests of the country in general.  Elderly people should be encouraged to give up their farm to their sons or nephews but I make no apology for saying that there is a tremendous difference between an old age pensioner in that category and one living in a house on his own with no other person living there and no other income coming into the house.  This budget does nothing to differentiate between the two categories.  There is a great difference between the pensioner who can use his pension to buy little luxuries for himself or make himself more independent in the household of which he is part and the pensioner who depends upon his pension to keep heat in the house, to buy food for himself to keep body and soul together but there is no differentiation in the budget and no indication that any thought was given to that situation.</P>
    <P>We should be ashamed of ourselves to believe that an old person with no other income of any kind can be expected to live on £4.65 plus 50 pence which he will get in this budget to make £5.15, and out of that clothe and feed himself, pay rent and rates. Because of the miserable, deceptive rates relief scheme we have it is not operated in many counties and these people must pay rates.  The Government have nothing to be proud of and much to be ashamed of in respect of the classes about which I am speaking. I am sure that no taxpayer would begrudge a worthwhile increase to these people.  The 50 pence per week does not represent as much today as the half-crown a week when it was given.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" /> If the Minister for Social Welfare accepted this at the Cabinet table he was fooled; he did not fight hard enough; he did not get his fair share of the national cake for those he represents here.  But that is the same Minister who last year did not realise that an employment order had been made depriving unemployment assistance recipients in rural and urban Ireland of benefits from May until November, until a storm blew up.  I think he was on holidays at the time and the first reaction to it was that it was some sort of horrible mistake.  Then, when it was pointed out that the Book of Estimates which had been published made provision for it, it was said it was not intended to apply to the towns but only to rural areas.  It was pointed out to him that many social welfare recipients in rural areas were social problems, people who were not unemployed but people who could not work, people constitutionally and physically unfit to work.  A sufficiently hard battle is not fought at Government level for the poorer section of the community, the worst-off and most defenceless section, people dependent on the State for the means to keep body and soul together.  I hope that we have seen the end of this sort of budget in so far as this section of the social welfare classes are concerned.</P>
    <P>The next matter with which I wish to deal is the question of rates and I refer to this question more or less in a social welfare context because I believe that the present rating system is inflicting severe hardship on people who cannot afford to pay the rates imposed on them.  The Government seem to admit readily that the present system of rating is unsatisfactory. Since coming here I have been hearing that admission from the Government benches.  Of course, it cannot be denied that the system of rating is a system of taxation that has no regard to the capacity of the ratepayer to pay.  There may be a situation of two houses side by side each with a valuation of £10. In one house there may be living a man who is in good employment and whose income may be £2,000 a year while in the other house there may be a pensioner or a social welfare recipient but each householder will have to <Col N="911" /> pay the same amount in rates and this may be as much as £70.  That is not fair.  So far as the present system is concerned it is of no consequence whether a man may have the responsibility of a young family or whether he is a bachelor who can afford to go to race meetings a couple of times a week.  Is it any wonder that the Government do not seem to justify such a system?</P>
    <P>This year, in particular, there is to be levied on many county councils huge charges in respect of malicious injuries.  Meath County Council and many others are to be inflicted with charges of thousands of pounds in respect of malicious injury claims and these will result in a rate in the £ of as much as or perhaps more than an old age pensioner will get for a week. Have the Government been giving any thought to this matter?  I say they are doing nothing about it.</P>
    <P>A former Minister for Social Welfare, Mr. Boland, introduced a scheme which permitted rating authorities to adopt a scheme under which they could grant exemption to certain categories of ratepayers.  That was nothing more than an enabling Act to begin with. The local authority might or might not adopt it.  However, any relief given under that Act was not covered by the Exchequer: it was passed on to other ratepayers in the local authority jurisdiction who, already, were unable to pay their rates.  The result was that many rating authorities did not adopt the scheme, miserable as it was, on the basis that the county manager would write off rates in hardship cases.  It is a dreadful experience to try to have rates written off under a hardship clause in some Act.</P>
    <P>This Government have done nothing to operate the rating system in so far as the householder is concerned.  For many years an abatement in rates in respect of agricultural holdings has been in operation.  I am not complaining in that regard but pointing it out merely to show that the Government are aware that even under the present circumstances there are ways and means of getting around the problem.</P>
    <P>I know a lady who worked in <Col N="912" /> England until she retired.  She then came home and bought a modest bungalow in this city in the hope that she would be able to live here on her pension.  However, she found it impossible to do so because, first, in regard to the health services she was worse off than she would be in England and, secondly, she was much worse off in respect of the rating system.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the Minister for Local Government to the fact that in England there is a system whereby a generous rate rebate is granted subject to a means test.  I have here a leaflet that was published on behalf of the Ministers dealing with matters of this kind in England and Wales.  This tells ratepayers that they may be entitled to a rate rebate.  It goes on to say that any tenant or owner-occupier in England or Wales whose income is small and whose rates are not already covered fully by supplementary benefits may qualify for a rebate.  According to the leaflet this includes tenants who pay rates in with their rents and in the case of a tenant the rebate application and payment is handled entirely between the ratepayer and the council.  Regarding the income limits the leaflet says that one qualifies for a full rate rebate if, (1) his rates are not already covered fully by the supplementary benefit&mdash;that leads me to believe that certain categories in England are free entirely of rates&mdash;(2) if one's recent average gross income averaged not more than £12 a week in the case of a single, widowed, separated or divorced person, or £14.75 a week in the case of a married person, plus £2.50 a week in either case for each dependent child.  Examples are given of the income limits for families. These are £17.25 a week for a married couple and one child, £19.75 a week for a married couple and two children. £22.25 a week for a married couple and three children, and so on.</P>
    <P>The fact is that within those limits and depending on the number in a family there are generous allowances operated in Great Britain.  This particular document which I have read was sent to me by the lady about whom I have been speaking, who worked all her life in England and <Col N="913" /> retired here and tried to live on her pension.  She found she could not do so because of the inadequate health services, for which she had to pay, and the crippling rates system, not to mention the high cost of living.  The cost of living is much higher here in many respects than it is in England.  It is high time that some system like the one I have mentioned was brought into operation here, so as to cushion the lower income groups and the modest income groups against the inequitable rating system which is in operation at present.  The Government know that this can be done.</P>
    <P>The Government have operated for many years the scheme in regard to the agricultural holdings.  The agricultural grants have existed from the time most of us knew anything about rates. In latter years certain categories of agricultural holdings have been derated. That is right.  Why ignore the hardship that is imposed on the married man with a family, or the man with a low income, or the shopkeeper who is being crushed out of business in rural towns by the supermarket and the big concern?  Why ignore the many people in the small towns in which the population has fallen and where the business has moved into the bigger towns?  Surely a system such as I have spoken of should be brought into existence here.</P>
    <P>This is another example of the slovenly, lazy Government going about their business in a lazy way, working a system which has been handed down from our grandfathers.  This system is not fair or just at the present time. I want to repeat the point which I made before that when this rating system was introduced over 100 years ago very few people then could contribute to taxation or to the health services, such as they were, or to local or public services, unless they were property owners.  That day is gone but we are still operating the same system.</P>
    <P>We were promised a White Paper. If White Papers, commissioners' reports and committees' reports meant anything then this would be the finest country on the face of the earth.  We must have more commissions, more <Col N="914" /> White Papers, and more reports of committees of one sort or another than any country in the world.  Very little, if anything, is ever done about the reports of committees and commissions.</P>
    <P>There is another thing which does not affect very many constituencies in this country but about which I wish to speak.  I am pleased to have the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare sitting opposite me now because I know this point affects his constituency very much. That was brought home to him at Maam Cross not very long ago.  I am speaking about the local improvements scheme grant.  This is a scheme operated by the Government to enable county councils to carry out small drainage works and to repair boreens or lanes leading to a number of houses. The social thinking of this country seems to have gone wrong in this regard because this scheme was meant to benefit the small man and it has been in operation since the Government ditched the Local Authorities (Works) Act which was introduced by the inter-Party Government for the same purpose.  I want to put on record what this scheme is all about.</P>
    <P>In rural Ireland, and particularly in Cavan and constituencies which comprise the 12 western counties, there are many people living considerable distances back from the county roads. Access to their houses is by lanes. These are not private lanes or private roads but lanes or boreens which are not in charge of the county council but which serve six, eight or nine families. Naturally, no one of those families is going to make that lane, which serves several people, serviceable.  Furthermore, it would be impossible for these people out of their own resources to make these roads or boreens or lanes serviceable or passable.  It would not be within their competence to do so. For that reason the local improvements scheme was introduced.  It has been in operation for as long as I have been concerned with my constituency as a public representative.</P>
    <P>In 1966 this scheme took a &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; turn.  At that time it was operated by the Department of Finance <Col N="915" /> through the Office of Public Works.  It literally came to a standstill.  The Government, as they always do when they find themselves in a fix, decided to make a change.  They introduced a new scheme and the change took the form of handing over the running of the scheme to the Department of Local Government.  Again nothing much was done.  The scheme never got into operation and about about a year or so later the Government introduced another Bill and handed the whole matter over to the local authorities to be operated by them from grants from the Department of Local Government.  This chopping and changing and inaction meant that in each constituency there was a list of hundreds of applications waiting to be served under this scheme.  Last year in my constituency the county council were dealing with applications received in 1967 and 1968.  When the Book of Estimates was published last year it contained a grant of £500,000 for the whole country under this heading.  In the context of the public scandal about the cutting off of the dole in rural Ireland this £500,000 was increased to £1 million and later another £1 million was added.  The Minister for Local Government strenuously denied to me as late as last week that the cutting off of the dole had anything to do with the increase from £500,000, which was published in the Book of Estimates, to £1 million.  Be that as it may, the increase was welcome; the grant for Cavan increased from £35,000 to £77,000 and it was a help, but there is a long way to go yet.</P>
    <P>I was absolutely shocked when I got the Book of Estimates here and found that the £1 million allocated to this worthwhile poor man's friend last year was reduced to £500,000 this year.  I read some of the political correspondents in the paper as saying that the Book of Estimates would be out of date by the time the budget was announced.  I regret that it was not out of date in this respect because all that is allowed under this heading is a paltry sum of £500,000, which was allowed two or three years ago and which, of course, will not do nearly as much work as it did then.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> I want to protest in the strongest possible terms about this, and I am not alone.  I understand I am supported by a Fianna Fáil county councillor who resides in Clifden and who apparently has a social conscience.  He has represented Fianna Fáil in that area for many years.  He was selected by them at the last general election as a Dáil candidate and secured nomination as a Seanad candidate at the last Seanad election.  Because he comes from the constituency of Connemara and knows how much it concerns his people, he has resigned from the Fianna Fáil Party over it.  He continues to sit on the Galway County Council as an Independent and has announced that he does not propose to join any other party but took this step because he felt strongly about this decision.</P>
    <P>I can tell many of the Deputies in this House that if they knew the hardship that unfortunate people living on these lanes are suffering they would rise up in indignation about the cutting of this grant.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare is here because I want to remind him about what we call John Donnellan's by-election in which I was canvassing in the Parliamentary Secretary's county, not his constituency. We went along a boreen on a Sunday and at this house there were a few teenagers, some of them girls.  When they heard we were politicians, the first question they asked before we could open our mouths was: &ldquo;Will you get the lane done?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is all that concerned them.  This is a very serious reflection on the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Molloy, who represents the constituency of West Galway and on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, who also represents Galway; I hear he has moved into Salthill and, perhaps, the boreens are not as common there as they are in the remoter areas.  They have done less than their duty in this matter.  I suppose the Parliamentary Secretary has not access to the Cabinet but the Minister <Col N="917" /> for Local Government has and he is the Minister who has charge of this.  If I were Minister for Local Government and the Government treated me and my constituents as they treated Deputy Molloy and his constituents, I would not stand for it.  It is a disgrace, and I hope that even now there will be a supplementary estimate or a suplementary &ldquo;think&rdquo; on this issue.  You see the same trend here: they have done nothing for the old age pensioner or the disabled person living alone, the people on the lowest rung of the ladder.  Nothing has been done to relieve the lower income group from the crippling burden of rates.  All these things indicate the sort of social thinking that is going on within the Government, and no amount of soft chat by the Minister for Social Welfare here will explain it away as far as I am concerned.</P>
      <P>I am moving, perhaps, to a somewhat higher category now when I deal with death duties.  We have been led to believe that a concession has been given under the heading of death duties.  As of now estates not exceeding £5,000 are totally exempt.  When was that figure fixed?  It was fixed under the Finance Act, 1960, when the exemption was raised from £2,000 to £5,000. That is 12 years ago.  For the first time an increase is now being given and estates of up to £7,500 are to be exempt, but everybody knows that £7,500 today is not worth nearly as much as £5,000 was in 1960.  The exemption should be higher if it is meant to compensate for the change in the value of money and in the value of property.  Surely a farm of land that is selling for £1,500 in 1960 is now selling for £5,000.  Possibly I am being conservative when I say that but I do not want to use extravagant language. The relief in death duties has only been raised to £7,500 in the year following that in which the Minister for Finance adopted the anti-social move of removing relief in respect of marriage settlements in the death duty code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his speech has blamed the troubles in Northern Ireland for the sluggish economy and has stated that, therefore, our tourist business <Col N="918" /> will not be as remunerative.  That may be so, but lack of leadership has a lot to do with it, too.  In so far as the troubles in Northern Ireland are damaging our economy, there is a bounden duty on everybody in this House and in this country to speak out unambiguously and clearly in a call for an end to violence in Northern Ireland. That is a duty that rests on everyone in this House and in this country, in Church and in State.  I believe that what have come to be known as the Health initiatives were a tremendous move in the right direction.  I believe there are very few people living today who ever thought they would live to see the day when the Health initiatives would be announced.  I said in this House before that Mr. Gerry Fitt, MP, expressed the views I have just expressed. I entirely agree with him.  I believe it is high time those initiatives were given a chance because they have not been given a chance to date.  I believe the people who are continuing violence in Northern Ireland do not want harmony.  They do not want any reasonable end to the trouble in Northern Ireland because they know that immediately the communities of Northern Ireland get down to know each other, to understand each other and to embark on a road of reconciliation, these men of violence will then cease to be relevant because the people will solve problems in their own way, in the only way that can last and that is by the method of reconciliation.  I was glad to hear John Hume, MP, today making the same appeal I am making now.  I believe it should be made by everybody in this House and everybody, in particular, on the Fianna Fáil benches.  Backbencher and front-bencher should speak out with one voice, without qualification, in an effort to bring violence to an end and let peaceful methods prevail.</P>
    <P>These people who are preaching violence now are people who jumped on the peaceful methods bandwagon in 1968.  They did virtually nothing any more than, indeed, did any Government in this country over the last 50 years do anything to bring about better conditions in Northern Ireland or to bring about reconciliation between the people.  It was the peaceful methods of <Col N="919" /> 1968 that started it and then all sorts and sizes jumped on the bandwagon.  I want to conclude this part of my speech by saying that I think it is the business of everybody in this House, from the Taoiseach down, to speak out in a demand for an end to violence so that the people of Northern Ireland can come together in a peaceful way and solve their own problems as I believe they will.</P>
    <P>I only want to speak of income tax in a very general way.  I was sorry, indeed, to hear the Minister say on budget day that he proposes to make income tax a permanent feature of our taxation law.  I say that because I believe it is an unjust tax.  I do not mean to convey that income tax, as such, is an unjust tax but in my opinion it is an unjust tax since PAYE was introduced because, as a Labour Deputy said today, PAYE catches in an inescapable net certain categories of the earning community while everybody knows that other vast sections of the community literally make their own arrangements about paying income tax.  Any system of that sort is unjust.  Perhaps everybody would not agree with that statement but, personally, I feel that income tax as operated or as it could be operated in this country is unjust.  The personal allowance of a single person was increased from £299 to £324, that is about £6 or £7 a week.  Every single person who is earning over that, or if married something slightly more, is liable to pay tax and unless tax can be fairly and equitably enforced it is unjust.  It used to be said here away back in the old days that it was unjust then.  I do not know whether I could agree with that or not but it is certainly unjust since the present rigid system in respect of certain categories has come in and when it is enforced rigidly in respect of one class and cannot be enforced rigidly in respect of another.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister for Social Welfare speaking about the increase in the allowances in respect of electric light to social welfare classes. He made the case that it was necessary to encourage old people to use electric current for heating purposes because <Col N="920" /> many old people die from cold.  I agree with the Minister but I disagree with the policy of local authorities building pre-fab houses or demountable buildings to house old people in them and forcing them to light and heat these houses by open fires.  That is being done by local authorities and it is wrong.  It is unfair to the old people to have them messing around with primus stoves and open fires in these highly inflammable houses.  There should be some sort of get-together between the local authorities and the ESB to see to it that electricity is installed in these houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare in his hour of agony last year when he was trying to get himself out of the fix which had been created by the withdrawal of the dole told us that he had some new system of social insurance which would end all problems and one would think, on that fateful day of last year, that this new scheme was to be introduced the next day or certainly within weeks.  It has not yet been introduced.  I think the Minister stated today that he was thinking about it or that it was being worked out.  It is a long time coming.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to conclude without making some reference to some of the things that Deputy Treacy said in reference to the referendum which is being held on the 10th May.  I was sorry that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle called Deputy Treacy to order when Deputy Treacy was about to tell us what the alternative was.  He had told us up to that point that the farmers, the business people and everybody would be worse off.  He had not told us what the alternative was.</P>
    <P>I heard of a gentleman who at one time stood as a candidate for Dáil Éireann and who started off as an Independent with high hopes of heading the poll.  As the campaign proceeded, it became very clear to him that, whatever else would happen, he would not head the poll.  As polling day approached he would have settled for the last seat.  Somebody asked him: &ldquo;What will you do if you get in?&rdquo;&ldquo;That is not the point,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What in the name of God will I do if I do not?&rdquo; That sums up the most <Col N="921" /> practical argument for voting &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; but it would be too bad if that were the only argument.  I believe that it is in the national interest and the economic interest of this country to join the EEC.  Speaking nationally, when the economic border between here and the six north eastern counties disappears, as it will when we enter the EEC, the political border will look foolish and will not bear serious thought.  If the people from both parts of the country were intermixing commercially they would get to know one another and the people in one part of the country would not think that those in the other part wore horns and hooves and tails.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest blows ever struck against the unification of the country was the tariff barrier set up in 1922. As from that day, the people of the north and of the south were driven poles apart and a generation grew up who did not know one another and were led to believe that they could not live together.  Economically, it is foolish in the extreme to say that we can live here as an island without trading with overseas markets.  That is, in effect, what the people are saying who tell us not to enter Europe.  I have seen the same wall carrying slogans &ldquo;Boycott British&rdquo; and &ldquo;Do not join the EEC&rdquo;.  That is the type of campaign that is being conducted against our entry into Europe.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that it is simply not possible to negotiate suitable alternative agreements in respect of the industrial sector and the agricultural sector.  We realise that this is a plural economy or an economy which works in tandem.  We have the industrial arm and the agricultural arm. One cannot get on without the other. You can have a trade agreement about industry which would be tantamount to free trade but you cannot have a suitable agricultural agreement without the Common Market.  That was proved very effectively when the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries returned here in 1966 and told us that he had solved all our problems, or a lot of his own anyway, by getting a market for some thousands of cattle in West Germany but we know <Col N="922" /> that not a single hoof ever left the country because the cattle would be going into West Germany over a tariff and it would not be good business to send them.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the people will come out in big numbers on the 10th May and vote &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  The mass media seem to assume that it is enough to highlight the Government speakers and Government thought about this.  That could be a fatal mistake. I think the Government themselves realise that they and they alone could not carry this and, indeed, they are very wisely playing down the political aspect of it in their propaganda. They are lucky to have a responsible Opposition that is not prepared to play politics with national issues.  It is essential, if the referendum is to be carried conclusively, that the views of the principal Opposition party he brought very clearly before the people.  I hope that that will be done before the campaign closes.</P>
    <P>That is all I want to say about the budget.  I deplore its lack of social thinking.  That is what I got up to say.  That deplorable lack of social thinking is emphasised in its treatment of the social welfare classes on the lower rung of the ladder, in its refusal to face up to the injustices being inflicted on tens of thousands of people by the present unjust and inequitable rating system and by its stabbing in the back of the less well-off people in rural Ireland who have not a means of access to their homes. When a saving needs to be made, the Government attack and slash the scheme that was doing something to make life a little more tolerable for these people.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons why I say that this budget has been a complete failure as an instrument of social justice.  When I say that the budget has been a failure as an instrument of social justice I mean in the same breath to convey that this Government have no social conscience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like at the outset to congratulate the Minister and to say nice things to him for the considerable sums he has distributed to <Col N="923" /> the more needy sections of our people. I am particularly grateful that he has given the unemployment assistance back again to single people from whom it was taken last year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy said that the amount of the increases given to old age pensioners in particular would barely meet the increase in the cost of living and that no effort is being made by the Government to increase the amount to a level that would give them a better standard of living.  Listening to suggestions of that type in the House from Deputy Treacy and other members of his party, we have to remember that Deputy Treacy's party and the trade unions press for the last pound of flesh and for the last penny they can get out of the national kitty.  Is it any wonder therefore that the Government are not able to give the sums of money they would like to give to the weaker sections of our people?  If we could get our younger workers to save a little more, to work a little harder for the money they are getting and to produce more goods for export, then perhaps we might get nearer to the social welfare benefits of Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy omitted to mention a benefit which many of our lower paid workers enjoy here and which does not apply in the North.  We provide houses at low rental and in many cases we practically make a present to the tenants of houses costing £3,500. Through legislation the tenant of such a house is enabled to purchase it.  In my county, houses which cost £2,500 are being vested in tenants who are being asked to pay less than £200.  In other words, the tenants are being given a present of more than £2,000. That is a concession not available to similar workers in the North where they have a rental scheme through which a person on unemployment assistance or on a low income is asked to pay a scale of rent in accordance with his income. They cannot, however, obtain ownership of those houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Treacy referred to the Common Market and spoke of the widespread unemployment which our entry would cause.  I agree with Deputy <Col N="924" /> Fitzpatrick that far too much of this material is being disseminated throughout the country.  It is confusing our people and it tends to frighten them into believing that a situation would apply here if we enter Europe which most definitely would apply only if we did not gain entry.</P>
    <P>We know that 52.8 per cent of our exports consist of agricultural goods. This must indicate to our workers and to our industrialists that if our agricultural export business were brought to a halt, as it would be if we failed to gain entry to the EEC and Britain went in, we would revert to the 1924 position on which Deputy Treacy dwelt.  Without fear of contradiction I say that if we did not gain entry to the EEC we would most definitely revert to those conditions.</P>
    <P>The Common Market people will purchase our beef as they require it. They certainly will not purchase our butter.  Estimates have been made as to alternative markets outside Europe available for our butter if we failed to gain entry.  Our main market would be our home market and that would be restricted by the unemployment conditions which would prevail.  The estimates of the milk required by creameries in such conditions is 200 million gallons per year as against the 600 million gallons taken last year by our creameries.  This means that two-thirds of our creameries would have to close down, a position that is too horrible to contemplate.</P>
    <P>These are facts that must be brought home to our people.  We must remember that if our agricultural industry goes down seven-eighths of the business of the country goes down with it. There is very little credibility in the suggestion by some industrialists that they could still operate in the tariff conditions that would apply if we did not gain admission to Europe.  It has been said that there are markets for our butter in Africa and India.  That may be so, but those countries have not the money to buy our produce.</P>
    <P>Therefore, without Common Market membership we would be reverting to the 1924 position.  I have had experience of those days.  I knew farmers and I worked for farmers, decent men, <Col N="925" /> who could not sit their workmen down to butter, then 4d per lb., or to eggs, then 6/- per 120, because they had to sell the eggs and the butter to buy the flour, the meal, the tea and the other household goods required.</P>
    <P>That is the position we are being asked to accept if we do not go into Europe.  In Kerry the industrial firms are nearly all exporting to the Common Market countries and the balance are exporting to Britain.  Outside EEC conditions they would have to face a tariff of 14 per cent in Europe and the same would apply to Britain if she were in and we were out.  A production manager told me that they could not operate in such conditions, that it would be only a short time before they bade us goodbye.  They would be forced to send their materials to America and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This situation must be faced and it should get the maximum publicity. Deputy Fitzpatrick said that people should be made aware that they have a duty with regard to the decision that must be made and I agree with him. In my constituency I have tried to get Macra na Feirme, the Irish Farmers' Association and the ICA to encourage people to vote.  We will man the polling booths in the various areas but we would like people to make a decision in the referendum irrespective of politics.  We are facing a tremendous challenge and it is vital that the people should make the right choice.  It is essential that Ireland should enter the Community and be in a position to make our requirements known to the other states when regulations are being made.</P>
    <P>In referring to what might happen to our agricultural exports if we do not enter the Community, I should like to mention a position which obtained before France succeeded in reducing drastically our cattle exports to Europe.  In 1962 we supplied 11,879 cattle to Western Germany, in addition to 2,438 tons of carcase beef; in 1963 we supplied 15,544 cattle and 2,174 tons of carcase beef; in 1964 the figures were 32,537 cattle and 5,911 tons of carcase beef; in 1965 we supplied 58,974 cattle plus 5,607 tons of beef.  At this stage France <Col N="926" /> started to bring pressure to bear to ensure that tariffs were imposed on our cattle exports.  In 1966 we exported 28,980 cattle and 1,627 tons of beef; in 1967 the figures were reduced to 5,647 cattle and 119 tons of beef. These were supplied in January or February but thereafter we were pushed out of the market.</P>
    <P>In addition, considerable quantities of Irish cattle were exported from England as fat cattle.  This was to our advantage because the Germans were paying high prices and the British were forced to increase their prices to us. If we do not enter the Common Market, for every £100 worth of cattle we export there will be a tax of £36; the farmers will get only £64 for an animal that would be worth much more in the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The people who advise against entry into Europe do not realise the effect it would have on our dairy products.  The money we obtain in respect of our dairy exports is a net figure; last year we exported approximately £300 million worth of industrial goods but 68 per cent of that represented imports which ultimately were exported in processed form.  We would not be able to buy this raw material if it were not for our agricultural exports.</P>
    <P>The people who say we would be better off outside the EEC should examine these facts and tell us what alternatives they have to offer.  However, they are carefully avoiding this because they realise they do not have alternatives.  I cannot understand why people are opposed to entry into Europe because for the first time we have the opportunity of getting away from British economic domination and of getting good prices for cattle, milk and butter.  It is said that we can make our own way of life outside the EEC.  This may be true of a certain number of people, provided they are prepared to accept the standards that existed in 1924.  The opponents of entry into Europe know that the alternative is too horrible to contemplate.  It is not that the people are opposed to entry into Europe; they are confused and many of them may not vote in the referendum. This is where the danger lies.</P>
    <P>A considerable amount of money <Col N="927" /> should be made available for more projects in the underdeveloped areas. In this connection I have in mind the many rivers and streams which cause considerable damage to land in the western areas.  A drainage scheme was introduced some years ago which operated in conjunction with the arterial drainage scheme and this did valuable work.  I have in mind an area outside my home town where streams are causing considerable damage to the land.  It would not cost very much to clear the streams but it would be money well spent through the land that would be reclaimed.  In the event of our entry into the EEC farmers will need all the land available in order to stock increased numbers of animals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to have the Department examine this and to get the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and all concerned to co-operate because a great job can be done.  Many holdings of good land along the lower reaches could be reclaimed and brought into cultivation and production.  This would also help the redevelopment of bogs because, strangely enough, we have forgotten the part turf played during the war and drains and roads have been left without grants.  With the present price of coal, particularly along the west coast, turf could once again come into its own and be a great national asset in reducing coal and oil imports for heating.  Small turf machines which I have seen, particularly around Cahirciveen in my own area, are doing very good work and turning out good quality turf when the bogs are good.  Unfortunately, the good bogs have their outlets and drains choked but if the bogs were drained and the machines enabled to produce the type of machine turf they can produce a good part of Munster certainly could be supplied with high quality turf.  Again, this is something the Department should examine because it would provide useful work in areas where it is needed as well as reducing imports of coal and oil and other materials for heating.  It should be possible with modern techniques, management and production methods <Col N="928" /> for turf again to serve a great many of our people.</P>
    <P>Last year I took a week away from constituency work and travelled to Dublin and across by Cavan into Sligo and Mayo.  I was amazed how many shops, even big premises, in Ballina and such places had huge ricks of turf in the back yards.  It is great to find people can still do this and I should like to see the same being done in the south, in Tralee and such places. Unfortunately, it does not happen there.  An all-out effort to help bog producers should be made.  There are six machines in the Cahirciveen area and there could be many more there if the bogs were drained and the roads into them restored so that the turf can be got out.  With modern transport turf can be hauled 50 or 60 miles inland.</P>
    <P>Large sums of money are now necessary to bring all our small piers up to the standard required so that our fishery industry can expand.  It is making progress at a reasonable rate but too slowly for my liking.  We should be farther ahead.  The clear thinking that was necessary by the people in charge of fisheries was never put into this very valuable industry. A number of processing industries will.  I think, come here from the Continent because of the value of our west coast fishing and particularly when out on the continental shelf for 100 or 150 miles, the advantage of being able to land their fish here for processing must be attractive to them. We shall need to have our harbours and piers up to the mark for this valuable industry.  The Minister should be thinking in that direction and should make extra money available.</P>
    <P>Afforestation plays a very important part along the west coast where the labour is available.  It is valuable in much the same way as the turf.  We have a number of middle aged people there.  When a man gets beyond 30 years of age in modern times he is regarded as rather middle-aged and not adaptable to factory work and we must find work for him.  Afforestation and turf production schemes would help that type of person to obtain the type of work in which he would be <Col N="929" /> happy and we should plan to have that work available and encourage him to take it up.  Afforestation is held up because the prices offered for forest land, in the light of prices applying generally today, are ridiculous.  If, in my own county, a reasonable price were offered, large tracts of land would become available in the areas where work is needed and I ask the Minister for Finance to examine this position and get the Forestry Section to pay realistic prices.</P>
    <P>Factories are vital for the west of Ireland.  I believe they can be provided there but I do not think that the thinking of the development teams, particularly in Kerry, is conducive to getting industrialists into areas where employment is needed.  Only yesterday I met some of our officials in County Kerry and I tried to get the message across to them.  They had some inquiries from industrialists and they are still persisting in trying to get them into industrial estates.  I made it quite plain that the last place a German industrialist wants to be is in an industrial estate.  He is coming out of what is an industrial estate in Germany where he is hemmed in and could not expand his buildings and working staff.  He wants to get out because he was in a polluted area. He wants to get out into God's clean air.  No place suits him better than a small area along our mountain sides, once he is satisfied that sufficient labour is available.</P>
    <P>All our efforts must be directed towards encouraging industrialists from outside to come here.  Two years ago when I visited Germany I found that many industrialists, particularly in the Rhineland, were interested in coming here.  Therefore, all the relevant information must be made available to such people.  A normal approach to this matter is vital.  I know that our representatives in Europe are doing their best but I do not think that the efforts are penetrating sufficiently.  Industries have been lost to us and have been set up instead in such countries as Spain and Portugal.  I have met Germans who expressed regret that they had not known of the facilities that were available to them here.  In spite of the fact <Col N="930" /> that the industrial facilities offered by this country are publicised widely in Germany the message does not seem to be getting across.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick referred to the rating system.  In counties such as Kerry the rate is so high that we have reached the crossroads in this respect. When reliefs are given to some people they must be borne by somebody else and this results in more people being in need of reliefs.  The most serious aspect about this increasing spiral of rates is that it will hold up our building programme.  In County Kerry we have allocated vast sums of money to house-building grants and towards subsidising, almost entirely, the cost of housing for working people.  The stage is being reached where we cannot continue to do this any longer.  I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick that some alternative system must be devised or, failing that, that the present system be altered so that there would be a fixed figure and that the Government would provide the balance required to help local authorities continue in operation. If action of this nature is not taken we will find ourselves, in a county such as mine where the current rate is £8 in the £, of having to strike a rate of £9 for next year thereby holding up all our operations.  The position must be remedied.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the widows of Old IRA men who are in receipt of special allowances only being brought into the scheme of widows' pensions. Those are widows of men who, for one reason or another, did not qualify for service pensions.  The only men who qualified for these service pensions were men who were involved in combat or in attack on the forces of the day.  A man who was involved in keeping the communication lines open did not qualify although very often his position, as was proved, was more dangerous than that of many of the men who were involved in attacks.  The remaining widows of those men are now more than 70 years of age and are not likely to be with us for very much longer.  Therefore, they should be brought into the widows' pensions scheme.</P>
    <P>Money should be made available for <Col N="931" /> the erection of houses for old people. Such houses, which would not need to be elaborate so long as they were comfortable, could be built in blocks of ten or 12 so that the old people could help to look after each other.  Too many of them are scattered in different places at present and there are not sufficient old people's homes to care for all of them.  In many cases they are neglected by their relatives, possibly through no fault of these relatives, but there are neighbours who are prepared to look after them if houses are available to accommodate them.  In most cases these old people have worked very hard during their lives and have not had very much comfort and the least we might do is to give them some little comfort in the autumn of their lives.</P>
    <P>A local group in Killorglin have equipped five or six caravans for old people and the people living in the nearby cottages are doing a very good job looking after them.  For an old couple all that would be required would be a house containing a kitchen and two rooms.  Even concrete floors would probably be ideal because some of these people might be in wheelchairs which they could manoeuvre best on level surfaces.  This matter should be examined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to say that it is vital for this nation that we join the EEC.  For people of my age the matter may not be of any great importance but for the younger generation and for the generations to come it is imperative that we join. Should we be unable to secure markets for our agricultural produce, our standard of living would be as bad as what it was in the old days.  Smallholders seem to be of the opinion that within the Common Market their holdings would be taken from them. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth.  I spent three years in Europe and during that time I made it my business on some occasions to travel as far as 40 or 50 miles to see how farming operated on the Continent. To my amazement I found that there are 1,400,000 landholders in Western Germany, of which 1,000,000 <Col N="932" /> have less than 25 acres.  Over 350,000 have from one to five acres and a further 350,000 have from five to 12 acres.  Roughly another 300,000 have between 12 and 25 acres.  There are about 1,000,000 German landholders who have much smaller places than we have.  The same applies to Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.  If we take the entire Common Market pattern the average size of farms in the Six Common Market countries is 28 acres.  The average size of farms in our own country is 47 acres.</P>
    <P>The information disseminated to our people is frightening.  We have nothing to fear from the farming pattern which I have seen throughout Europe. Our farmers are energetic.  Their farmhouses and their farmyard patterns are ahead of anything in Europe.  The only advantage in Europe comes from the marketing organisations which sell the farm produce direct and get the maximum price for the farmer.  All the stock in Europe, particularly in Germany, has to be hand-fed.  There are no grasslands as such in Germany, except for the small amount in Bavaria and a little in north-east Germany.  There are some grasslands in France but, by and large, all the animals have to be hand-fed by people who are paid the highest wages of any workers in Europe.</P>
    <P>In Berlin I found that there were 24,000 cows in a huge complex in the city.  They were there to provide milk for the city.  Their food was hauled 50 to 150 miles by rail.  We have nothing to fear.  Our farmers have the energy and ability to make their way in Europe.  Our farming patterns are up-to-date.  Our farming community are progressive.  Our young farmers are doing a great job of work.  I have not got statistics, but I believe that there are about one-sixth of the number who worked on the land 40 years ago working on the land now, and that they are producing 40 times as much. The farmers have increased their production by using up-to-date methods. Great credit is due to them.</P>
    <P>On 10th May I would like to call on everyone to vote because the person who is staying at home is the person <Col N="933" /> who will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  It is vital and necessary to bring about a position where our country can march forward. Let us hope that we have a very authoritative result from the people on 10th May in order that we can plough ahead into Europe and develop our nation so that we can obtain our rightful place among the nations of the earth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to be brief. I want to make a few general remarks about this budget.  It is a very important budget.  When introducing it, the Minister for Finance rightly said that it is the last budget any Government here will introduce before we become members of the EEC.  For that reason it is a very important budget.  The attendance of Deputies in this House does not indicate its importance.</P>
      <P>I did not have an opportunity of preparing a speech but it is quite obvious to any Deputy who is active within his constituency that there are many problems which the people must face.  I was listening to the Minister for Social Welfare earlier this evening. His concluding remarks were ones with which we must all agree.  He dealt with the advantages our country has as compared with other European countries. He said it was the most attractive country in the world in which to rear a family and live in peace and comfort. This was so in the past.  Many people, throughout Europe particularly, realised this in latter years.  I am afraid this country is fast losing that reputation. I refer to the lawlessness and the complete breakdown in law and order in this country in recent years.  This week this point has been brought to my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the South particularly there are many people of different religious persuasions and beliefs.  Last week I heard of an Englishman, a pensioner, who retired with his wife to live here.  They had reared a family in London and decided to come here to live, having been here year after year on holidays in the South of Ireland.  They decided to spend the end of their days in this country.  They bought an expensive house.  Their family still live in London. These unfortunate people received an <Col N="934" /> anonymous, threatening letter saying that if they did not move out of the area within a month they would be shot.  They sold the house and left the country.  The wife particularly became so frightened that she left before the month was up and before the sale of the house was concluded.</P>
    <P>This has worried many people because unless we have law and order we will not have the attraction which we had in the past for people like these. People will not come and reside here. Many people are concerned with the attitude of the powers-that-be.  There is no doubt but that we are fortunate in having such a loyal Garda Force.  They are quite prepared to do their duty but everybody realises what has happened in recent times when the gardaí bring the culprits before the courts.  This is a terrible indictment of the people who are paid big salaries to do a job and have fallen down in the carrying out of their duties.</P>

      <P>That may be so, but earlier in this debate I listened to speakers who went into great detail. Maybe what they had to say was not relevant, but I think law and order is very relevant to this debate at present, and as a Deputy I think I should be entitled to point out what the people are thinking in relation to the breakdown of law and order.  The people are concerned about this and unless some stern action is taken against wrongdoers, we shall have far more people leaving this country like the people to whom I have already referred.</P>

      <P>If it is not in order I shall leave it, but I intend to deal with it at the first opportunity that is available to me.  This matter has also a serious impact on what could be our greatest industry, that is, tourism. Everybody is well aware of the complete failure of the Minister for Transport and Power to attract tourists to this country.  In regard to the fall-off in tourism and in the income from it, I believe the true picture has not been revealed.  What really infuriates me is that when questions are put down to the Minister for Transport and Power the Minister says: &ldquo;There is no problem.&rdquo; Everybody seems to realise there is a problem except the Government and the Minister for Transport and Power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>He has stated quite clearly on several occasions that people like Deputy O'Donnell who have put down questions are exaggerating the situation.  A person need only travel in the south of Ireland, around the Ring of Kerry, or travel from here to Cork, to find the finest hotels in Europe empty, and this is as a result of the breakdown in law and order, because people are afraid to come here.  Those of us who had the opportunity of being abroad recently had this brought home very clearly to us.  We are losing our greatest industry because, as the Minister for Social Welfare said in his speech here today, we have natural advantages and attractions of which many people in Europe and throughout the world are aware, but there is no doubt that they are afraid to spend their holidays here at present.  I have a fair experience of the tourist industry because I live in an area which has benefited considerably in recent years from this industry.  I am sorry to say that many <Col N="936" /> people will be out of employment and many of those people who have big overdrafts and who have invested large sums of money in this industry are now facing a very bleak period.  This is all due to the fact that the Government have allowed the situation to deteriorate to this alarming degree and have not taken action.</P>

      <P>This country has quite a lot to gain from membership of the EEC but many people, particularly people living in rural Ireland, are afraid of the implications.  People are being misled and there is a certain section of people with an ulterior motive who are touring this country at present and frightening the people against entry.  I said here about 12 months ago that I believed it was incumbent on the Government to make the facts known to the people through the news media and to have programmes presented on television, such as we saw some time ago, where speakers for and against membership would put their case.  This sort of programme can help people to make up their minds about the most important decision they have ever been <Col N="937" /> asked to make.  Whatever decision they make on referendum day will affect the generations yet unborn.</P>
      <P>The Government have fallen down in providing information on the EEC. As regards our major industry, agriculture, the natural advantages we have should be highlighted.  The Government are guilty of neglect in not availing of the years leading up to entry to the Common Market to make our people more efficient, to gear our industries, our transport and marketing systems to the requirements of membership so that the farming community would get the maximum benefit.</P>
      <P>I have to admire the contribution made by Deputy O'Connor.  He was not afraid, like other back bench Fianna Fáil Deputies, to highlight the problems in his constituency and to speak out about the Government's neglect in not dealing with the problems of the people in the constituency of south Kerry.  The problems mentioned by Deputy O'Connor are problems which are common to all rural Deputies.  There is the problem of vast acreages of fertile land being flooded so that farmers cannot bring this land into full production.  I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance is here, because he has quite a big part to play.

      <P>If the Parliamentary Secretary allows me I shall deal with him, whether he likes it or not.  In regard to the case made by Deputy O'Connor about the drainage of the land and the cleaning of rivers in the south of Ireland and particularly in <Col N="938" /> the constituency I represent, I can remember a colleague of the Parliamentary Secretary, a Fianna Fáil Deputy who is no longer in the House, Mr. Martin Corry, stating clearly at a Cork County Council meeting that if we wanted rivers drained in the south of Ireland we would need a Parliamentary Secretary from the south.  When the present Parliamentary Secretary was appointed to that office, seeing that he did not have any such problems in his own constituency, I requested him to pay some attention to the problems in the south of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>In the south of Ireland there are many farmers who cannot avail of Land Project grants because the rivers and streams which the Parliamentary Secretary and his Government have neglected down through the years are choked and prevent farmers from draining their land.  If the full potential of our land was realised we would not have the huge amount of unemployment we have at present. Because of the constant neglect of the present Government, the moving from <Col N="939" /> one crisis to another, the stop/go policy in relation to agriculture, we are not in a position to gain the full benefits that should accrue from membership of the EEC if we had a proper Government who dealt with the problems confronting farmers.</P>
      <P>There is one thing this Government cannot be blamed for and that is for not producing reports on the problems of rural Ireland.  I do not know what has happened to all those reports but no action has been taken.  There is only lip-service paid to those problems. The greatest problem facing the country is the manner in which rural Ireland is being denuded of its population. The Government are not aware of that and do not accept it.</P>
      <P>Even though this budget contained a number of handouts it contained no long-term planning.  For example, rather than reducing the amount of money allocated to the Land Project scheme and to the farm buildings scheme we should double, treble and quadruple it so that vast areas of land could be brought into productivity.  If grants were stepped up and if there was not a long delay before a farmer could avail of these grants this would happen.  The Government have failed to realise that if you can encourage a farmer to make full use of his land, for example, if he is producing 20 gallons of milk a day and if he can be induced, whether by grants under the Land Project scheme or under the farm buildings scheme to double his output, which can be done in many cases, this will provide extra employment. Over the past four or five years the output of milk has more than doubled.  I believe that because of the higher price paid this year, belated though the increase may be, we can look forward to an increased output, an increase over and above the 600 million gallons taken into our creameries this year.  If we can increase our output we will be increasing employment because in the taking in at the creameries, in the processing, in the transport, in marketing, there will be increased employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Connor said that the advantages to the dairying industry in <Col N="940" /> the EEC are quite clear and this is true.  Few people realise that it costs almost twice as much to produce a gallon of milk in some European countries as it does here because we have a shorter term in-feed for cattle in the winter.  We have natural grass. A former Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture was christended by some Fianna Fáil Deputies the Minister for Grass when he called grass a crop.  I wonder do the Fianna Fáil Deputies now realise how valuable grass is and the part it will play in the low cost production of agricultural goods when we enter the EEC.  This is very important. If more money was provided to make our small farms viable it would help to solve many of the problems in rural Ireland.  The Government do not accept that.</P>
    <P>I wonder did the Government read the Scully Report on the problems of the West of Ireland.  What action is to be taken on it?  Will it be slept on like many similar reports, like the reports on the rationalisation of the creamery industry?  What became of them?  How long did it take before any action was taken?  No action was taken because the then Minister for Agriculture was afraid that if he took action there might be some cost in the line of votes.  Pressure was brought to bear on him not to take action on the reports that were issued as far back as 1962.  I would say in fairness and give credit where it is due that the present Minister for Agriculture fully realises the problems as far as the rationalisation of the creamery industry is concerned. It is clear to everybody that in the EEC there is no future for the small crossroads creamery because of inflated costs and rising overheads but a certain pressure group are using their influence to try to stop the rationalisation of this industry. If our farmers are efficient it is important that this efficiency will not be squandered by an inefficient processing or creamery industry.  I am not satisfied with the progress made in relation to this aspect of our agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>Some people have said that this is a great social budget.  It is true that the Minister did not forget people in <Col N="941" /> receipt of social welfare benefits but there has been a lot of ballyhoo about the meagre handout given to windows, orphans and old age pensioners.  During Deputy O'Connor's speech I was looking at the increase given in the non-contributory window's pension.  A widow with two children is now getting over £7.  Imagine an unfortunate widow living on the side of the street with two children on something over £7 a week.  Does anybody imagine they can exist on it?  Here you have members of the Fianna Fáil Party loud in their praise of the Minister for Finance because he came to the rescue of those people.  Widows in receipt of non-contributory pension and having dependent children have now taken on the role of being the poorest section of our community.  A widow with two children will have to provide out of approximately £7 a week 21 meals a week for three persons and will have to pay rent, rates, and provide clothes, shoes and all the rest.</P>
    <P>This is responsible for a lot of the unrest that exists at the present time. Children who are neglected, who are regarded as second class citizens, become poisoned against society and they will be against the institutions of the State and will regard the system as having neglected them and being responsible for their malnutrition.</P>
    <P>While the standard of living has increased in recent years there is still concealed poverty.  There are thousands of widows on the verge of starvation.  I known a number of them.  It is tragic that children should not have the necessaries of life.  This Government down through the years have forgotten those people.  We talk about membership of the EEC and of the benefits that will ensure.  I demand from the Government now a statement similar to that which has been made by this party that if savings accrue to the Exchequer on the withdrawal of price support they will be redistributed <i>in toto</i> to those on fixed incomes and in particular to the widows and orphans who have been neglected for so long.</P>

      <P>I and other Deputies in my constituency are inundated with problems in regard to electricity supply. Recently I attended a seminar on the EEC with a member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  A person living in a remote area told that member of the Fianna Fáil Party that in areas where rural electrification has not taken place the ESB demand sums as high as £850 before current will be made available. The person in question was a pig producer. He said that if electricity supply were available he could make sufficient income out of pig production to enable him to rear a family on the farm.  This is another example of the neglect of people in remote rural areas.  If a blackout occurred in this city and lasted for one night it would get headlines in the news media.  The Government and the ESB are quite content to commit the people in rural Ireland to blackout and darkness for the remainder of their lives.  The Government should make more money available to the ESB so that those living in remote areas would <Col N="944" /> get the amenities to which they are entitled and who are subsidising those who are in a position to get electricity supply.</P>
      <P>Income tax is an unfair tax.  The administration of it is unfair.  A worker who may have to drive 30 miles to work gets no income tax allowance in respect of his car.  We have the dearest motoring in Europe.  The cost involved in travelling to and from work reduces the man's net wage considerably.  The Government should consider this matter and the Minister for Finance should deal with it when he is replying to the debate.  On the other hand, there are persons who can walk from their homes to their jobs and who do not incur transport costs.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that this country can survive within Europe, and those who say we cannot are saying we are second class people.  I believe this country can stand shoulder to shoulder with any country in Europe or in the world.  The only thing it requires is a change of Government to somebody who will vigorously tackle the problems facing us.</P>

      <P>This year's budget is praised and is accepted as being one of the best ever, even if all Members on this side of the House were to remain silent.  It is accepted here and elsewhere in that way.  Listening to Members of the Opposition whose role here is interpreted by them as always to attack and to belittle any recommendation or proposal coming from the Government benches, it is very obvious that they realise they have very poor grounds for attacking this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Especially in connection with this budget, one matter to which I wish particularly to refer is the reference to efficiency in the public service.  I made <Col N="945" /> some inquiries and I am told that the salary bill this year in respect of civil servants, exclusive of the Garda, the Army and all the teaching professions, will amount to £63.9 million.  That is a formidable sum.  There is some collecting in £64 million.  I am not concerned about the money value of any money at any time but rather with the real value as seen in which other way that £64 million could be spent.</P>
    <P>We all will appreciate that in the times in which we live £64 million could be put to many other uses which would bring many advantages to this country.  Having said that, I am not at all being critical of the amount being expended.  I worked for many years as a civil servant.  Subsequently I went into the teaching profession.  I am fully convinced that in the public service I found brain power and ability superior to any which I met elsewhere.  What grieves me about the expenditure of a sum like £64 million is that, because of the manner in which the Civil Service is manipulated, having regard to the traditions which exist in the Civil Service, this money is not being expended as effectively or as fruitfully as it might be.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I served in the Civil Service, as the most junior officer in it, but I am aware of the remarkable brain power which exists in it.  However, because of the order, as I saw it, this brain power was not fully exploited nor is it being fully exploited today.  There are men and ladies in the Civil Service who on leaving school could have entered universities, could have gone into the commercial world or any other branch of business life in this country and I have no doubt they would have been more than successful. However, having entered the Civil Service, they found themselves, after a short while, realising that because of circumstances and traditions, perhaps the most dangerous thing they could do as civil servants was to overwork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Here perhaps I should be critical of this House and of politicians <Col N="946" /> in so far as we seen to think that anybody in the country can make a mistake but the Civil Service may not.  Because of that, it seems to be accepted as a first principle in the Civil Service that whatever you do, do not make a mistake.  A mistake may be something as simple as not using the correct adverbial form of a word.  At that level I have known of cases of excellent officers who having offered themselves for promotion were rejected, and often the report of the interview would not always be correct. Indications could be given that the reason Patrick or James or Catherine or Elizabeth did not get promotion was that four years earlier he or she was guilty of some simple error of that nature.</P>
      <P>If a person thinks that the only thing he has to do is not to make a mistake, straight away you destroy industry and initiative in that officer. The community is deprived of the talents and the value that officer could contribute but which, for understandable reasons, he is not giving because he considers it endangers his promotional prospects.  We must accept that civil servants are as human as other people and are as liable to make mistakes. We should not be afraid of mistakes occuring because they can be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was happy to read that the Minister spoke about selecting the right men for the top posts in the new Department, but I am more concerned that rearrangements should take place from lower levels upwards. I am convinced there is a vast area of untapped talent in the Civil Service and I am sure other Members agree with me on this.  During the past years some civil servants have been given the opportunity of moving into semi-State bodies, into what might be called commerce. Some of these people have got to the top in these organisations.  I am sure that there are hundreds, possibly thousands of others in the Civil Service who are capable of doing excellent work in semi-State bodies.  I am sure that these people in semi-State bodies &mdash;I am not at liberty to mention them by name&mdash;would be leading nice quiet <Col N="947" /> lives as assistant principal or principal officers in Government Buildings or in some other Government Department where they would probably be dealing with minor schemes and with statistics if they had not moved to the semi-State bodies.  Instead, they are making a valuable contribution to the economic life of this country and are earning salaries of £5,000 or £6,000 per year.</P>
    <P>We must accept the need for greater mobility in the Civil Service.  While the civil servant must be allowed to remain in whatever section or Department he is in if he wishes, he should not be prevented from moving to other Departments if he desires to do so.  By this mobility it will be possible to discover which Department is best suited to his abilities.  If by moving him means he will cut across the promotional prospects of some safe civil servant in another Department who never makes a mistake, this does not interest me in the slightest.  From the writing assistant to the secretary of any Department there should be the opportunity and encouragement to move to other Departments and other challenges. By so doing they would enjoy a certain rejuvenation, they would get greater work satisfaction and they would make a more useful contribution.</P>
    <P>The country would get a better return for the £64 million invested in the public service.  I do not accept that investment requires only the production of goods.  I am happy to accept that the production of service is as necessary as the production of a commodity.  I am concerned that civil servants should be allowed to make the contributions of which they are capable and which would allow them to enjoy life in the service and would contribute considerably to the nation.</P>
    <P>I agree with one point made by Deputy Creed regarding the delay in the matter of reports.  Reports are requested and they are prepared but when they come before us they do not seem to have relevance.  Their relevance and usefulness is maximised when they are received as early as possible after they are requested.  I give one example of what I have in mind.  Last year I had a special interest in matters connected <Col N="948" /> with the Adoption Board, An Bord Uchtála.  The report of that board for the year ended December, 1970, was laid before this House in September, 1971.  My immediate reaction was to be critical of the staff of the board but I subsequently discovered&mdash;and here again I had my faith in public servants renewed&mdash;that the report was prepared and ready on 5th January, 1971.  The board had its report ready then but whatever takes place within the Civil Service, whatever are the traditional lines on which work is sent to the printers I do not know, but it took the best part of a year to get a simple four-page report prepared, printed and placed before the House. That tends to create annoyance and a certain cynicism towards public servants. I do not know what public servants would be responsible for the printing work, but I certainly must admire those who were able to have the report for one year ready five days after the year ended.  I criticise the <i>modus operandi</i> connected with the printing and presentation of these reports and in future I hope these reports will be much more on time and so assume the importance to which they would be entitled.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to exclude references to EEC.  On some former occassion I said I was not happy that the pseudo-opponents of EEC were doing any more than going through an exercise they felt obliged to undertake perhaps because there are so many people in favour of it that there was a greater likelihood of getting notice and Press comment if you try to make the case for the other side.  In regard to EEC and what is wrongly described as our entry into Europe&mdash;as far as I am concerned we were always in Europe; we should have and would have been much closer to Europe were it not for the dominance of our nearest neighbour&mdash;I welcome membership now principally because I see in it emancipation from conditions under which we were forced to suffer, social, economic and political conditions, for so long.</P>
    <P>I am happy that in this regard Deputy Keating shares my concern.  I refer to his speech here on 3rd February, 1972, at column 1053 in connection <Col N="949" /> with the debate on Northern Ireland.  Deputy Keating then said:</P>
    <P>I do not think that within the present framework of policies that we possess, there is very much we can do because I think the British have the most ferocious leverage over us, that we have permitted them to have over the last half century.</P>
    <P>Further on he says:</P>
    <P>That is a most enormous leverage that we have chosen to leave in British hands for the past half century.... Two-thirds of all our export trade is with Britain.  So that the industries here that are not actually owned by the British are depending on British trade.  We have left all these in different national hands in the mouth of the British dog all these years.</P>
    <P>Somewhere many years ago&mdash;I hope I have it correctly but I do not now know whether it was connected with Greek mythology or not&mdash;I remember reading of and being attracted to the partridge of Paphlagonia.  Deputy Keating, I notice&mdash;and I shall quote from him&mdash;is given to similes and imagery connected with birds.  He spoke about the Taoiseach as a dove and Deputy Blaney as a hawk: I had hoped he would be present because I was about to talk of himself and the partridge of Paphlagonia whose particular attribute, apparently, was that he had a soft heart for himself and a hard heart for everybody else. I believe that in his heart, as a worthwhile economist and successful agriculturalist and a man whom I accept is interested in the welfare of the Irish people, Deputy Keating is as convinced as I am of the merits of EEC and welcomes the opportunity as much as I do of entering Europe.</P>
    <P>I cannot see into the mind of Deputy Keating but I regret that he takes the line of considering himself obliged to make a case against our becoming members of the EEC.  I do not know whether there are other considerations that influence him.  I make the point here that our dependence on England in the matter of trade that up to now we have been <Col N="950" /> forced to accept will disappear when we join the Common Market.  Anybody who is critical of the position to date must welcome the new opportunities which, will now be available to us.  In a world where no country now is very far removed from any other in terms of transport we must all welcome the opportunity of this integration with Europe.  I know that Deputy Keating accepts that because, speaking in this House last year he said that he welcomed international brotherhood.  I am speaking generally now because I have not the quotation with me.  He told us that the Labour Party enjoy certain socialist contracts throughout Europe and throughout the world which they hoped to exploit and which he thought could bring better results to us.  He must realise that so far as the EEC is concerned its greatest exponents are socialists. Therefore, if he is not prepared to join with these socialists there is an obligation on him to explain to us where are these other socialists with whom the Labour Party have contacts and he should indicate how beneficial these might be to the people of this country.</P>
    <P>During that same debate last year Deputy Keating said that the Taoiseach was a dove and that Deputy Blaney was a hawk, and that both of them were speaking from an equally impossible position&mdash;the position of weakness&mdash;because, Deputy Keating said, we do not have the economic independence that would give us the power to take significant action against Britain. He went on to say that we are in pawn to Britain in the ways he had mentioned but which he would not elaborate.  Obviously, it would be easy to spend much time elaborating.  I accept that when Deputy Keating was speaking at that time he spoke with sincerity, as I accept that every Deputy who speaks here is sincere in what he says.  But if Deputy Keating is so agitated and perturbed as he indicates, why does he suggest in this same House but on another topic that while he would favour our going into Europe we should go in on special terms&mdash; associate membership?  In other words, what he is advocating is that, instead of sitting down at the same table as <Col N="951" /> the British representatives and the representatives of other European countries and working out terms that are acceptable to all, we would get better terms from this dreadful tyrant if we were not there at all.  To me that does not make sense.  If we are critical of the attitude of Britain or France or Germany or any of the other bigger powers and if we are suspicious of how they will treat us as members, I cannot see how we could make a case for the wonderful way they would treat us when we would be at their mercy completely.</P>
    <P>The case has been made also that by entering Europe we are losing our sovereignty.  I do not propose to dwell on that aspect to any great extent except to express my disappointment that, having read as much data as was available to me in connection with the EEC, I have not seen it written anywhere that once a country joins, she must stay in.  I do not think there is anybody who would claim that that is the position.  To me the greatest proof <Col N="952" /> that a country does not lose her sovereignty on joining is the fact that she is not obliged to remain a member. Maybe there exist some hidden documents which the rest of us have not seen but I think it is fair to say that there does not exist anywhere, either in written or implied form, the suggestion that, having entered the Community, a country may not opt out.</P>
