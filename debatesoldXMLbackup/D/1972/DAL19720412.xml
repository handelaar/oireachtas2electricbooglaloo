    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11 together.</P>
      <P>I regard Mr. Heath's initiatives as a step forward in seeking a lasting solution to the remaining problem in Anglo-Irish relations.  As I have already said in the House there is a constant flow of communications between the Government and the British Government. In accordance with customary practice, however, it is not my intention to reveal the contents of such communications.</P>
      <P>I am always receptive to meetings with Northern elected representatives both Unionist and non-Unionist to discuss matters of mutual interest on a confidential basis.  I have no plans at present to meet Mr. Heath or Mr. Whitelaw.</P>
      <P>The Government agree that the Constitution of a united Ireland must reflect the nature of the country as a whole.  This is one of the matters which I hope will also be examined by the inter-party committee now in course of being formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general it is my policy to make public pronouncements in relation to the Northern situation only when I <Col N="4" /> consider it appropriate and useful to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach give us an indication of whether there will be an opportunity to discuss these initiatives in the House?  I feel this is necessary particularly because the House has been in recess since the announcement of these initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There will, of course, be opportunities in the House to discuss the Northern Ireland situation in general.  I do not know how soon that will be.  As the Deputy is aware, the Budget debate will begin next week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I appreciate there will be opportunities from time to time, what I had in mind, particularly in view of the great number of questions the Taoiseach covered in his reply today, is that it would be appropriate and necessary to have a discussion on the whole matter as it now stands in order that there will be clarification rather than confusion, which seems to be the situation since the announcement of these initiatives. In other words, what I am seeking is an early opportunity for a discussion on the specific situation obtaining since the announcement of the initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most Members of the House have been very prudent in this matter especially during the last 2½ weeks or so, and the need for a continuation of that prudence is still here.  When it is judged that a debate of the nature the Deputy has in mind would be desirable that debate can be arranged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask one prudent supplementary, which the Taoiseach can answer in a word?  Have the Heath initiatives the approval of the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The indication we gave on the day of the announcement of these initiatives put the views of the Government on them.  I said at the beginning of my statement today that I regard Mr. Heath's initiative as a step forward in seeking a lasting solution to the remaining problem in <Col N="5" /> Anglo-Irish relations.  I referred also to the need for all sections of the community, North and South, to consider the initiatives maturely and objectively in the interests of peace, friendship and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the general picture as outlined by various leaders North and South, by Church and State, has been to over-exaggerate what has been contained in the initiatives.  It is in order that that might be discussed here that I have risen.  Surely a discussion of that nature in this House could not be regarded as imprudent? If it is so regarded, Members of the House should look at themselves and ask themselves why they are here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is satisfied with assignments undertaken by Markpress on behalf of the Government: if he will indicate the cost to date for services rendered by Markpress; when the contract expires; and if it is the intention of Government to renew it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether the Government or his Department have entered into a new or extended contract with Markpress; and, if so, on what terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>The initial agreement with Markpress expires next month and the conclusion of a new agreement to commence next month is being considered.</P>
      <P>To date, I am satisfied with the services given by Markpress which, up to the 31st March, 1972, cost an estimated £20,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any extension in the coverage of the general purpose contract with Markpress? Does the new contract prevent this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the new agreement but I would not envisage any extension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="7" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach look again at this contract and see if there is scope to provide this from native sources&mdash;in other words, that Irish journalists could do the same work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated, the immediate purpose was to establish our <i>bona fides</i> in Europe as a progressive economy and I thought Markpress had access to outlets in Europe which Irish agencies might not have.  It is unlikely that if a new contract is made it would be with an agency other than Markpress, but in the future it might be possible to see if an Irish agency would have the expertise required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should we farm out this type of work to outside agencies?  Surely the Irish agencies would be able to assemble the facts here much better than Markpress. Would it not be reasonable to assume that Irish agencies would have the same or similar access to outlets?  Can we not do anything ourselves?  We have to farm this out in the same way as we had to get McKinsey&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be Government policy to farm to outside agencies work which in my opinion could be done better at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If I thought that certainly I would employ Irish agencies.  All things being equal Irish agencies would be employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reflection on our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to assume that an agency like this, which is established in one of the biggest cities in Europe, and has access to outlets such as I mentioned all over Europe, is certainly in a better position to get the kind of message across that we want to get across.  If, for example, I was a resident of Switzerland and wanted to get something across to Ireland I would probably employ an Irish agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether or not the terms of the agreement between the Government and Markpress preclude that company from making critical comment on the Opposition parties and members of the Dáil; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will place in the Dáil Library a complete file of the Press releases issued by Markpress since the retention of that firm's services to newspapers and media abroad; and whether, if he accedes to this request, he will at the same time indicate the countries in which the various categories of release issued and produce for inspection by Members of the House whatever evidence of publication has been produced by Markpress or reported by the Department's offices abroad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the Deputy wish to obtain the text of any particular Press release, Markpress will facilitate him.  I would not be prepared to ask the agency to meet the requests in the first and last parts of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>The Markpress public relations service has been operating mainly in Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Belgium and the United States of America; and, as occasion arises, in other countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of a further increase in the unemployment level in <Col N="9" /> the month of March; that there has been no decrease in this level over the period 1st January to 31st March; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="The Taoiseach Jack Lynch">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to the implication in the Deputy's question the average weekly number unemployed in March, as measured by the live register, was 1,360 less than the average weekly figures in February. Moreover, the number unemployed on the 30th March was approximately 460 less than on the 3rd March.</P>
      <P>It is true that there has been no decrease in numbers on the live register between the 1st January and the 30th March, but this is in accordance with the normal seasonal trend.  The number unemployed this year showed an increase between early January and early February followed by a general decline between then and the 30th March.</P>
      <P>The measures taken to stimulate the economy in October and the further action taken in January last had specific regard to the problem of unemployment, and the indications are that they have helped to improve the underlying trend.</P>
      <P>The Government regard the level of unemployment as a matter of vital concern and are keeping the situation under continuous review.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask a couple of questions on this subject because it was discussed in January last. The Minister knows this Health Act came into operation on 1st April, 1970, and now it is past the 1st April two years later.  Would he not agree that it is completely unfair that this particular section, which is one of the most beneficial sections in the Act, is deferred indefinitely?  Is he not aware that many disabled people who live with relatives, some not even of first degree relationship, throughout the country, are denied payment from the different health boards in view of the fact that section 69 has not yet become law? Surely the Minister will agree that this section is the one we should be most sympathetic to and most careful about because it refers to a group of disabled people?</P>

I have addressed a letter to the chief executive officers suggesting to them, in view of the deferring of this particular section of the Act, that they perhaps take a more liberal view when they are giving disability allowances, that they inquire into the question of how far the family contribute.

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated in reply to a previous question by the Deputy that I have seen a report on a survey of office conditions in Zurich.  I have no information about a report on central heating in high rise dwellings in Woodenburgh, Germany, or, indeed, that there is any such place.</P>
      <P>In my reply of 27th October, 1971, I suggested to the Deputy that if he thought there was a particularly high incidence of upper respiratory tract infections in the Ballymun area he should submit his evidence on the subject to the chief medical officer of the Eastern Health Board.  I understand that the chief medical officer has not received any such evidence from the Deputy.  As this is primarily a local matter I would suggest again to the Deputy that he should pursue it with the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting the Minister right with regard to the particular town in Germany.  I should like to ask the Minister if he seriously considers that this problem refers solely to Ballymun? Is the Minister aware that the Department of Local Government are encouraging the erection of similar buildings in St. Michael's estate, Inchicore, in Kilbarrack, in Cork, and in Galway? If the Minister does not finance a research team to investigate the effects of central heating on respiratory tract diseases, it will become a widespread problem.  The Minister is well aware of the facilities of a DMO to forward documented evidence to the chief medical officer in his area.  This matter should not be treated lightly.</P>

Would the Minister not agree that the fact that it was stated at that trial that photographs were produced, and the prosecutor did not deny this but suggested they might have been obtained by methods other than direct photography by a South African secret agent, raises an issue which the Minister should have been pursuing in the last five months in a manner which apparently he has not been doing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All relevant extracts from the transcript have been made available and have been studied in the Department of Foreign Affairs. The evidence given by the witness was not as published in the newspapers. The evidence was to the effect that she had been told by the accused that such photographs had been shown to him while he was in detention.  There was no direct evidence with regard to the actual production of photographs at the trial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The prosecutor did <Col N="22" /> not deny that these photographs existed and had been shown to the accused but suggested they might have been obtained by means other than direct photography by a South African agent, either by stealing them or by buying them.  In view of that implied admission of this kind of indirect activity here, why has the Minister not taken action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say to the Deputy in the House is that the actual transcript and the evidence produced at the trial did not disclose any photographs.  What was disclosed was hearsay evidence by a witness that she had been informed that photographs were produced to the accused while in detention, but photographs were not produced at the trial.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>As I have explained in reply to previous Parliamentary Questions on this subject, I am satisfied that there is no need for a harbour authority under the Harbour Acts for Bantry Bay so long as commercial shipping activities there are in the main confined to the use of Whiddy Island by the sole company at present operating there.  If, however, circumstances should change and conflicting interests arise the necessity for an authority would be urgently examined.</P>
      <P>The Cork County Council recently renewed their request that a harbour authority be set up but nothing has transpired which calls for such action at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Petroleum Act, 1871, requires that, in the case of every harbour where petroleum is landed, by-laws regulating such landing be submitted to me by the relevant authority.  For the purpose of this Act a harbour includes, <i>inter alia</i>, any dock, pier, jetty or other works at which goods are shipped or unshipped.  I have been legally advised that for the purposes of the 1871 Act, Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd. are the appropriate authority to prepare petroleum by-laws and to administer them under the direction of my Department.  The company were, therefore, requested to prepare and submit draft by-laws to me.</P>
      <P>Following publication of the by-laws, a number of objections were received.  I have sought legal advice on some of the points raised by the objectors and the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot therefore give any undertaking at this stage as to subsequent action in regard to them.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the views of all interested parties will be borne in mind before any decision is made on the by-laws as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should emphasise that the sole purpose <Col N="26" /> of the by-laws is to ensure that the highest standards of safety in regard to the handling of petroleum are enforced at the Whiddy Oil Terminal.  Their operation is confined to the area leased to Gulf Oil under the Foreshore Act, 1933.  They do not confer on Gulf Oil any status as a harbour authority under the Harbour Acts and do not prejudice the establishment of a harbour authority under the Harbour Acts at Bantry Bay if this is later found necessary.  The operation of the by-laws will be kept under strict review by the marine survey staff attached to my Department to ensure that they are reasonably and properly administered not only from the point of view of operations of Gulf Oil but also the safety of all other persons who may be in the area at any time.</P>
    <P>With regard to the reference to an agreement signed between the Government and Gulf Oil, the only agreement entered into is a lease between me and the company in accordance with the terms of the Foreshore Act, 1933.  The lease, which contains the usual provisions, is for a term of 99 years at a yearly rent of £7,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not accept that Bantry is one of the most important harbours in this country and consequently its entitlement to a harbour authority goes without saying? Will he not also agree that his dealings and the Government's dealings with Gulf Oil were, to put the matter mildly, rather shady?  Will he not accept that, while the Government and the Minister for Transport and Power will not approve of a harbour authority in Bantry, they will approve of a foreign company setting themselves up as a harbour authority within this State under an Act which is 101 years old today?  An old British Act of 1871 was used by the Minister to get Gulf Oil to submit an application to him to establish by-laws which will give them certain rights in this bay which may be detrimental to other users of the bay. I will let the Minister off with that much just now.  I have a few more questions for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to <Col N="27" /> emphasise that the purpose of the by-laws is to ensure safety in regard to the handling of petrol in the area of the Whiddy oil terminal.  We are concerned with the need to avoid oil pollution and to ensure safety in regard to the handling, landing and disposal of petroleum at Whiddy Island.  It is in the public interest that by-laws of this kind should be drawn up and implemented. This in no way confers harbour authority status on Gulf Oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>It does and this was clearly set down in the by-laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would let me finish&mdash;at the moment I am receiving representations in regard to these by-laws.  I will be in consultation with Cork County Council and everybody interested in the preparation of the by-laws.  This consultation will take place and no by-laws will be drawn up without this consultation and without my final approval.  I should like to emphasise further that I have an open mind in regard to the establishment of a harbour authority.  In the event of a further proposal being adopted and put into effect in that area&mdash;an industrial proposal or a petroleum proposal or anything of that kind, where a conflict of interest might arise&mdash;there might be a need for a harbour authority.  We will establish a harbour authority there if and when we find it necessary to do so.</P>
      <P>I want to repudiate any suggestion that anything other than the best commercial and national considerations were adopted by the Government in their dealings with Gulf Oil and in the establishment of this terminal for the benefit not only of Bantry and the areas surrounding it but for the benefit of the country as a whole, in enabling us to have a basic supply of oil for security reasons.  We have insisted on a 60 days supply of oil being maintained in the tanks there as security for this country in the event of any oil supply emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>While we welcomed Gulf Oil to Bantry Bay we should like to know why does the Minister not place before the House the terms of the agreement with Gulf Oil?  Does he <Col N="28" /> not agree that, while there may have been nothing out of place in the hobnobbing between members of the Government and the executive of Gulf Oil and while everything may have been above board, such activities&mdash;and I use the world deliberately&mdash;are open to suspicion?  I used the word &ldquo;hobnobbing&rdquo;; I do not know where I got it; it just entered my head; it may be as good as any other word.  Does the Minister accept that Gulf Oil are getting more than they are not entitled to and something that may be detrimental to the interests of the people in Bantry and the surrounding districts, to such people as fishermen&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power why he sanctioned the recent increase in cross-Channel air fares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 49, 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>As I have said in reply to previous questions, international air fares are agreed by the airline at meetings of the International Air Transport Association. The level of these fares is dictated by commercial considerations related to the economics of operation. Low fares which did not cover costs would result in losses which would have to be paid by somebody.  The Government have no intention of calling on the taxpayer to subsidise air travel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By virtue of the powers vested in me by section 10 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1965, I have approved the recent increases in air fares, viz. 7½ per cent on the London/ Dublin route and 10 per cent on other cross-Channel routes.  The air fare <Col N="31" /> increases which have been allowed do not include any increase in respect of the air fare portion of an inclusive tour.  The National Prices Commission decided that the case was not appropriate for reference to the commission.</P>
    <P>Air fares have not increased disproportionately with general increases in salaries and wages and, consequently, I do not anticipate any undue cut-back in the growth of air traffic as a result of the increase in fares.  On the contrary, and apart from the exclusion of inclusive tour fares from the general increases, new tourist and other promotional fares which have been introduced by Aer Lingus, will it is expected stimulate the traffic growth.  These include a special youth fare, the fly-drive facility which combines an air fare with car hire; and &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; holidays which include air transport, connecting transport to and from the hotel and accommodation at the hotel for a price equal to the lowest air fare in the off peak season and slightly in excess of it in the peak season.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte are giving priority to selling these special fares to the British market and anticipate a traffic increase. I am not in a position to give a projection of the number of visitors expected to use the Dublin-London route between 1st May and 30th September, 1972.</P>
    <P>As regards the comparison between the cost of a holiday in Spain with that in Ireland, various elements, as for example, cost of living differences, make comparison difficult.  However, the Irish &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; holiday at about £40 per person, from London, compares favourably with inclusive tours to Spain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the announcement of the recent increase, coming as it did just at a time when our position in the British tourist market was showing slight signs of recovery, came at the worst possible time?  Did the Minister have discussions with Aer Lingus or did he take any steps to have this increase deferred until the end of this year or did he just give sanction without going into the implications of it? <Col N="32" /> Is the Minister aware that the increase came as an absolute shock to everybody involved in tourism promotion in Britain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House and the Deputy that scheduled air fares within Europe were negotiated within the IATA umbrella as far back as last December and this was merely the implementation of a decision taken then and to which I referred in my Estimate speech in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the same time as we were announcing increases in our cross-Channel air fares announcements were being made in London of decreases in fares to Paris and other continental destinations from London and also to Australia and New Zealand?  How is it that you can have lower fares to the Continent and continually increasing fares from Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLenihan" hpid="Mr. B. Lenihan Mr. B. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is too global a statement.  I can give the Deputy a full schedule of the fare increases and decreases that were agreed at the December conference.  The important thing is that Aer Lingus are taking the initiative in the area they themselves can control, that is, in the nonscheduled area of charter flights.  In that area they have introduced, as I have said in the reply, a number of package holidays involving free car hire to destination in Ireland, free petrol within certain limits and, in another package, free hotel accommodation for bed and breakfast for two days after landing along with car hire to destination.  They are taking every initiative in the area open to them, the non-scheduled charter area, but the schedule flights are entirely a matter for international agreement between scheduled airlines.</P>

      <P>Again, you could bring disruption into the air situation between ourselves and BEA.  Between BEA and Aer Lingus there is a pooling <Col N="33" /> arrangement as regards flights between Ireland and Britain and this arrangement would be totally disrupted if we took unilateral action. We want to see Aer Lingus in a breakeven financial situation: we do not want to see them going into a loss situation in which the Irish taxpayer would have to subsidise Aer Lingus in order to maintain reduced schedule rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is clearly what the Minister said.  Would he not further agree that the suggestion that air fares must rise by the same proportion as costs is based on an economic fallacy?  Would he not agree that the principles which apply to the CIE reductions could also be applied in this area where elasticity of demand in relation to price can be quite high?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must appreciate that, as I said in my first supplementary reply, internal arrangements are entirely different from external arrangements and CIE price-cutting arrangements were properly effected by reason of decisions taken within our own ambit of control.  Aer Lingus have taken similar steps in the <Col N="34" /> non-scheduled area, the charter area, where they are their own masters.  The Deputy is well aware that in regard to rates in respect of scheduled flights it it a matter that is worked out by international agreement and co-operation with all the airlines.</P>

I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 25 on 22nd February last in the course <Col N="35" /> of which I explained in detail the situation in relation to CIE's promotional work in Britain.  Intensive promotional and publicity campaigns are being carried out by Bord Fáilte in Britain in conjunction with the regional tourism companies and the other State bodies involved in Irish tourism.  These campaigns are being concentrated on the ethnic market. Intensive campaigns are also being carried out in North America and Europe.  I am satisfied that every effort is being made by the State bodies concerned to promote Irish holidays as vigorously as possible.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte have informed me that in view of the fluidity of the situation in Northern Ireland and its likely effects on tourism earnings in 1972 it is not possible at this stage to give a meaningful forecast of tourism revenue this year.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte administered a scheme of grants to An Óige for the development of youth hostel accommodation.  The levels of grants are 80 per cent in western areas and 50 per cent elsewhere.  The 50 per cent level applies to Limerick city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I explained in reply to a similar question by the Deputy on the subject on 9th July, 1970, that the site then <Col N="39" /> being discussed by An Óige with Bord Fáilte for a Limerick hostel would not qualify for an 80 per cent grant because it was not in the western area. Bord Fáilte were of the opinion that it should be possible to find a location for a hostel within reasonable walking distance of the city, which would qualify for the higher rate of grant.  I am informed by Bord Fáilte that there have been no developments on that point in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the desirability of encouraging this type of accommodation and in view of the special need in Limerick for accommodation of this nature, would the Minister consider increasing the grant from the normal 50 per cent to a more realistic figure especially since the balance has to be made up by voluntary effort on the part of An Óige?

I would ask the An Óige people and the other people in Limerick who are concerned to take some initiative in that respect.  This was made known to them by me last July 12 months but so far they have not shown much initiative.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will arrange to have the regulations changed whereby people in agricultural employment and domestic service do not qualify for unemployment benefit until ten years have elapsed from the date of their entry into insurance, as the present arrangement appears to be unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the question is intended to refer to women employed in agriculture or private domestic service, since these are the only people in <Col N="40" /> agricultural employment and in domestic service who are affected by the regulations referred to.</P>
      <P>Up to 1966 such women were not insured against unemployment but since then they are covered for unemployment benefit at a special reduced rate of contribution and subject to an additional contribution condition which modifies the general scheme of unemployment benefit to meet their particular needs.  The additional condition requires that the claimant be in social insurance for at least ten years and that she satisfies a yearly average test, related to her age, of contributions paid during that period.  The test requires a yearly average of paid contributions of (a) 40 where the claimant's age is up to 30 years; (b) 35 for the age bracket 30 to 50 years; and (c) 30 where age is from 50 to 65 years.</P>
      <P>The additional condition does not apply if a woman is more than 65 years or if she has changed from private domestic or agricultural employment and has become regularly engaged in another occupation than those and 26 contributions reckonable for unemployment benefit have been paid in respect of her since she changed her occupation.</P>
      <P>The 1966 legislation constitutes a considerable advance in that it provides cover for unemployment benefit to those older persons in the types of employment mentioned who are most likely to need it, while requiring only a modest increase in the contribution rate in their cases.  In the circumstances I do not accept the Deputy's suggestion that the present arrangement is unjust and I do not propose to alter the position.</P>

A domestic employee should be treated in the same way as any other type of <Col N="41" /> employee, such as a factory worker or a shop assistant.  Why discriminate against domestic employees?  Everyone knows that they were discriminated against for long enough.  It is now about time to take them out of bondage.  The Minister should act.

      <P>A claim by shift workers for an incremental salary scale in place of existing weekly rates of pay has given rise to the present unofficial strike situation in the ESB.  In accordance with procedures which have been negotiated within the board, the claim was processed through negotiation, conciliation and, finally, through reference to the ESB Industrial Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council, in its recommendation on the dispute, stated that the claim by the shift workers could not be isolated from the total wage and salary structure of the ESB and that it involved changes such that a final resolution could be achieved only after all the implications had been fully studied by the board and the unions.  The council, therefore, recommended that the unions should hold the claim in suspense until the negotiations relating to a new agreement&mdash;to become operative on 1st April, 1973&mdash;took place. The council, nevertheless, accepted that incremental salary scales, in a grading structure, for shift workers, with associated benefits, would have to be granted not later than 1st April, <Col N="42" /> 1973.  The council further accepted that it was the board's firm intention, and that the board was committed, to pay shift workers on an incremental salary basis from April, 1973.</P>
    <P>The shift workers, however, and against the advice of the group of unions negotiating on their behalf, rejected the recommendation of the Industrial Council and served strike notice on the ESB to take effect as from today.  The dispute is, therefore, not one of principle but of time, the shift workers, through their own association, saying that they are not prepared to wait for the conclusion of negotiations which their trade unions are conducting on behalf of the shift workers and other workers who are also concerned.  The contention appears to be that the shift workers, because of their importance, and because of their power to disrupt, must have their claim considered in isolation from the claims being pursued by their unions on behalf of all the workers in the ESB who are affected.</P>
    <P>Over the last few years very intensive negotiations have been going on between the ESB and the many unions which represent their employees to arrive at new structures and procedures for industrial relations within the ESB. Considering the difficulties involved, good progress has been made.  Direct intervention by me now in this dispute could put all this progress at naught and this is a view which is shared by those in touch with the situation.  In any event my intervention should not be necessary.  The shift workers could return to work and allow the negotiations to continue, for the sooner these get under way the sooner agreement can be reached on implementing a programme to harmonise conditions for all ESB workers, including the incremental salary scales which the unions are claiming.  The ESB has committed itself in principle to this in the context of negotiating a new comprehensive charter for all ESB workers.</P>

    <Title>Veterinary Surgeons Order, 1972: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons) James Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. J. Gibbons)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby confirms the Veterinary Surgeons Order, 1972.</P>
      <P>The order in question was made by the Government on 21st January, 1972, under section 5 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1952.  Its purpose is to provide for the enlargement of the membership of the Veterinary Council, the statutory governing body of the veterinary profession, on the basis of representations made by that council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing council of ten members, constituted under the Veterinary Surgeons Order, 1954, made by the Government, comprises seven elected members elected by the profession, one member appointed by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and two members appointed by the two universities concerned, that is, the National University of Ireland and the University of Dublin.  When seeking to have this membership enlarged, the council proposed that the number of elected members be increased from seven to 12, which, along with the existing three appointed members, would give a total new membership of 15. <Col N="62" /> The grounds for increasing the membership, as put forward by the council, are that there has, since 1954 when the present council was consituted, been a substantial expansion in professional membership; that this expansion, accompanied by an expansion in the &ldquo;institutional side&rdquo; of veterinary practice, has resulted not only in an increased volume of work but also in entirely new forms of problems and cases coming before the council; and that real difficulties are at times experienced in setting up, when necessary, a committee of the council to deal with particular disciplinary matters.  On consideration of the circumstances, the Government were satisfied that the membership of the council needs to be enlarged as proposed and so made the present order accordingly.</P>
    <P>The order, as I have already mentioned, was made at the wish of the Veterinary Council and to meet a real need due to changed circumstances.  I can confidently recommend it to the House for confirmation.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, in connection with the supply granted for the years ended 31st March, 1971 and 31st March, 1972, the Dáil takes note of the activities of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to refer to the general crime situation.  I dealt with this topic in some detail in connection with the Garda Síochána Bill which was recently before the House and I then outlined the efforts that are being made to curb and, if possible, to reverse the upward trend in crime with which we, in common with most other countries, are faced.  On this occasion, therefore, I shall not detain the House by going into the kind of detail that I might normally be expected to do on an occasion such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the last year for which final figures are available, that is, for the <Col N="63" /> year ended 30th September, 1970, there was an increase of 18.4 per cent in the total number of indictable crimes known to the Garda.  Two-thirds of these consisted of offences against property without violence, mainly larcenies.  The bulk of the increase in larcenies was due to an increase in larcenies from parked cars and other unattended vehicles.  These went up by over 1,800.  Offences against the person have been almost constant over the past four years, but offences against property showed an increase of 19.7 per cent over the 1969 figure. Proceedings were instituted by the Garda in respect of 13,710 indictable offences known to them or 45 per cent of the total.  The overall detection rate fell to 50 per cent as compared with 61 per cent in the previous year.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Area the detection rate was 37 per cent while in the rest of the country it was 69 per cent.  Although crime figures for the year ended 30th September, 1971, are not yet available, the indications are that there was a further substantial increase in the figures for that year.</P>
    <P>In the year ended 30th September, 1970, the number of persons charged with summary offences was 169,581 as compared with 178,186 in 1969.  Road traffic offences continue to constitute by far the greatest category&mdash;126,643 persons were prosecuted for road offences in 1970 as compared with some 134,000 in 1969.  Over 200,000 &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; notices were issued for contraventions of the parking bye-laws and similar offences and in 53,188 of those cases there were prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of subversive organisations.  Deputies will remember that I spoke at some length on this subject in the course of the Adjournment Debate in this House last December.  I do not propose to detain the House now by repeating in any detail what I said on that occasion. Deputies will find the relevant passages in Volume 257 of the Official Report, at columns 2557 to 2572.  I pointed out then that those critics, including some Deputies opposite, who say that nothing is being done about the activities of illegal organisations or <Col N="64" /> that not enough is being done or that the Government's attitude towards these organisations is ambivalent are ignoring the true position.  The fact of the matter is that, if the activities of these organisations are to be effectively curtailed we as a community may have to accept the need for substantial changes either in the criminal law &mdash;and in particular in the rules of evidence&mdash;or in the judicial machinery for the investigation and trial of certain offences, or perhaps even in both.  It must be remembered that, in a system of unanimous verdicts by a jury in a criminal trial, each and every member of the jury is open to intimidation.  And we all know what intimidation can mean in this country.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that people not familiar with the rules of evidence who read in newspaper reports about persons who are openly described as being members of illegal organisations will ask why those persons are not prosecuted for membership of those organisations.  Some have, in fact, been prosecuted and have been acquitted. I have already pointed out that, if fully effective legal action is to be taken in all such cases, a first requirement would be a change in the law in certain respects.  Incidentally, one of the odd features of our times in this country is that whenever any person throws out a suggestion that we might consider looking at how other countries&mdash;countries in the Continent of Europe, for instance&mdash;deal with certain types of problem, he is immediately assailed by people who in one and the same breath hold themselves out as ultra-nationalistic&mdash;and reformist&mdash;but condemn as unthinkable any deviation from the concepts of law that were imposed on us from across the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>According to that extraordinary school of thought, the slogan of the seventies&mdash;the updating of Swift&mdash; seems to be that one must burn everything English but their law.  It is as if &mdash; and, indeed, some say this in almost as many words&mdash;we are asked to believe that Continental Europe, the cradle of Western civilisation, has no respect for human liberty and that only by adhering strictly and even <Col N="65" /> slavishly to what we inherited here can justice be done&mdash;and this even after our benefactors are themselves satisfied that their system of justice is no longer all that just or all that suitable for their own society.  In this respect one of the most astonishing misconceptions to have gained currency, even in quarters from which one would expect more, is that an accused person in European countries is treated as guilty until he proves himself innocent. This, of course, is a myth.  I think we ought to have sufficient self confidence, and to be sufficiently mature, to be able to cast our eyes a little further than we have been doing and to learn from what other civilised nations do.</P>
    <P>I, for my part, make no apology whatsoever for inviting the attention of Deputies of this House to the real problems which our present laws pose for the Garda Síochána, for the Government and for all those with special responsibility for upholding the authority of the Oireachtas and the institutions of the State.  The problems are real and I take this opportunity to say once again that sooner or later we as a community may be faced with the choice between making some significant changes in our legal system and allowing our basic institutions to be eroded and ultimately destroyed.  I do not suggest that we have yet reached the stage when this choice must be made, but I think it well to invite Deputies to reflect on the very real possibility that the position may radically change, especially if we see any further attempt, such as has been made in recent days, to subvert the allegiance of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, I would ask Deputies to reflect on the perverse logic of those who will accept or reject, just as they feel inclined, the democratically established institutions of this country and the laws enacted by the freely elected and independent Parliament of our own people.  There is from time to time considerable discussion on changes to be made in our Constitution if we are to ensure a united Ireland.  This discussion could become very unreal if we had to face a grave challenge to the survival of constitutional government itself.  Recently, when the Garda <Col N="66" /> Síochána Bill was being debated both Houses of the Oireachtas had an opportunity to debate fully the present situation in relation to the Garda Síochána.  On that occasion there was a welcome on all sides for the planned increase of 1,000 in the Force.  I am glad to say that the response to the recruiting drive has been very heartening and that there is every indication that the required number of good quality recruits will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>Under the Garda Síochána Act, 1972, which came into force on 29th February, the Government recently made an order&mdash;the Garda Síochána (Ranks) Order, 1972&mdash;setting out the various ranks of the Force and the maximum number of members of each rank.  The number of inspectors is being increased substantially in order to help to reduce the excessive hours now being worked by many inspectors and superintendents.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like once again to pay tribute to the magnificent work done by the Garda Síochna in face of the very difficult situations that they have had to contend with, particularly in Border areas.  I am sure that I speak for everybody in this House when I express the hope that the problems facing the gardaí in those areas will soon disappear.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increase in strength, steps have been taken to make the best possible use of the available manpower.  These steps include the employment of female clerical assistants to do the office work now being done by the gardaí and the employment of an increasing number of traffic wardens, which should release a substantial number of gardaí for more important police work.  Extra funds have been made available for the purchase of Garda cars.  Special temporary arrangements have been made to complete a radio communication service for all parts of the country within a matter of months.  These new arrangements are already in effect in some areas and are proving both very useful and very satisfactory.  However, the present arrangements are temporary and a permanent and even better system is being planned for the gardaí by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, <Col N="67" /> with whom, of course, a constant and close liaison is being maintained.</P>
    <P>As regards Garda building, I have approved the use of a standard system-built station to replace existing stations in need of replacement at some rural centres.  Already contracts for ten such stations have been placed.  Associated with them, contracts have also been placed for a system-built official house for gardaí at each of the ten centres.  A new Divisional Headquarters is at present under construction at Waterford and the planning of new Divisional Headquarters for Limerick and Cork is in train.  The provision of a new headquarters for the Dublin Metropolitan Area is also necessary and I have already initiated discussions with the Office of Public Works about this matter. In addition, the Office of Public Works recently invited tenders for a new communications centre at Dublin Castle and they hope to have work on the new building completed by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>My Department, among its other activities, is engaged on an extensive programme of law reform.  In the ten years since the programme was launched, substantial progress has been made as is evidenced by the law reform measures which have already reached the Statute Book.  Of its nature, law reform is a long-term project involving the giving of priority to certain items. Various practical considerations affect the rate of progress&mdash;in particular, the limited number of skilled staff available for this work.</P>
    <P>The House dealt last year with two Law Reform measures, namely, the Courts Act, 1971, and the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971. The first of these provides for increases in the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Courts and deals with a number of other important matters relating to the functions and operation of the courts.  The other Act deals with a number of urgent matters in the field of landlord and tenant law including the grant of a new type of lease to sports organisations in certain circumstances. Incidentally, this latter Act is an interim measure which will be absorbed into a comprehensive Landlord <Col N="68" /> and Tenant Bill now being prepared.</P>
    <P>Among the law reform measures in various stages of preparation are a Charities Bill to make new provision for the incorporation of charity trustees, to make special provision in relation to charities that are governed by Private Acts of Parliament or by Charters and to amend the Charities Act, 1961, in certain respects; a Criminal Injuries Bill which will consolidate, amend and reform the law relating to malicious or criminal injuries to property or to the person; the comprehensive Landlord and Tenant Bill, which I have already referred to; a Courts and Court Officers Bill which will contain provisions to implement recommendations made in the sixteenth interim report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in relation to the jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court and will include a number of other important provisions relating to the Courts and Court Officers; and a Registry of Deeds Bill.  Other legislative proposals which are being prepared include Bills to provide for the enforcement of foreign judgments and maintenance orders and a Bill to deal with the jury system, a subject on which recommendations have been received from the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.</P>
    <P>The Committee on Court Practice and Procedure have submitted 17 interim reports up to the present.</P>
    <P>The first of these reports dealt with the procedure for the preliminary investigation of indictable offences and legislation based on the report has been enacted, namely, the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  Another of the reports dealt with the question of increased jurisdiction for the Circuit and District Courts and this, as I mentioned a moment ago, is a matter that has been provided for in the Courts Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>The jury system forms the subject-matter of three interim reports of the committee and, arising out of the recommendations contained in these three reports, legislative proposals relating to the jury system are at present under consideration.  One of <Col N="69" /> the committee's reports deals with the criminal jurisdiction of the High Court and another with appeals from conviction on indictment.  I am having the committee's recommendations in these reports examined and I hope to introduce amending legislation in due course.</P>
    <P>Further reports of the committee deal with the service of court documents by post, the fees of professional witnesses, proof of previous convictions, the interest rate on judgment debts, the jurisdiction and practice of the Supreme Court, the organisation of the courts, the rights of audience of solicitors in the courts, the liability of barristers and solicitors for professional negligence and the extension of the &ldquo;fine-on-the-spot&rdquo; system to offences other than parking offences. Provision has been made in the Courts Act, 1971, for an extension of the registered post mode of service to documents of the superior courts and for a right of audience for solicitors in all our courts.</P>
    <P>The Government authorised me to arrange for the implementation of the committee's recommendations in regard to the fees of professional witnesses, and new rules of court in this regard, in which I have concurred, were made by the Superior Courts Rules Committee.  The remaining matters dealt with in the reports of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure are being examined.</P>
    <P>The Landlord and Tenant Commission have so far presented two reports dealing with specific issues.  Their first report deals with the renewal of occupational tenancies under the 1931 Landlord and Tenant Act.  The second report deals with extensions of the rights of renewal and of outright purchase given by the Landlord and Tenant Acts from 1931 to 1967 and enjoyed by what may be called ground rent tenants.  It covers, <i>inter alia,</i> the renewal of the tenancies of sports clubs in certain circumstances.  I have already mentioned the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971.  This is the first instalment of legislation which arises from the recommendations of the commission.  All the recommendations made by the commission <Col N="70" /> have been accepted by the Government subject only to relatively minor amendments.  This acceptance involves the promotion of legislation to make considerable changes in the Landlord and Tenant Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967.  These changes will be embodied in a comprehensive Bill which has already been introduced as the Landlord and Tenant Bill, 1970. This will be a complicated piece of legislation involving the amendment of the Acts of 1931, 1958 and 1967 and their consolidation with the Act of 1971.  It will be recalled that owing to the complexity of the Bill, I decided that it was necessary to abstract from it the more urgently-needed provisions and to introduce them as a separate Bill.  That separate Bill was since enacted as the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act, 1971.  The text of the comprehensive Bill is now being settled and it will be circulated as soon as possible&mdash;I hope before the summer recess.  After presenting their first two reports, the commission commenced their main work, that is, a review of the whole law of landlord and tenant, apart from questions bearing on the scope and policy of rent control.  This review involves an examination of the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1860, commonly known as Deasy's Act.</P>
    <P>The rules committees of the various courts have done quite an amount of work during the past two years.  The District Court Rules Committee continue their major task in connection with a general revision of the existing District Court Rules.  The committee have made&mdash;and I have concurred in &mdash;the following rules: the District Court (Extradition Act, 1965) Amending Rules, 1971, which prescribe certain forms in substitution for forms prescribed in the District Court (Extradition Act, 1965) Rules, 1968, the District Court (Charge Sheet) Rules, 1970, which will extend to the whole country the system at present in operation in the Dublin Metropolitan District whereby the offence charged against an arrested person is entered on a charge sheet instead of in the Minute Book and the District Court (Courts Act, 1971) Rules, 1972 which deal with procedural matters arising <Col N="71" /> from the Courts Act, 1971.  The committee have submitted the District Court (Summonses and Warrants) Rules, which are designed to secure a more expeditious discharge of business in the District Court by making changes in the procedures relating to the preparation of records and warrants in the court.  These rules are at present being considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court Rules Committee are making progress with their work of revising and consolidating the Circuit Court Rules.  I have concurred in rules made by them entitled the Circuit Court Rules (No. 1) 1970, dealing with certain procedures under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, and the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1967.  In addition, the committee have for some time been examining draft rules, and suggested amendments to those rules, to deal with procedure under the Succession Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Five sets of rules, in which I have concurred, were made by the Superior Courts Rules Committee.</P>
    <P>First, there were the Rules of the Superior Courts (No. 1), 1970 which prescribed the procedure for appeals, on a point of law, to the Supreme Court from decisions of the Circuit Court under the Electoral Act, 1963. These rules also deal with the lodgment of money in court with the defence and with orders for delivery of possession.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there were the Rules of the Superior Courts (No. 2), 1970, which replace, by a new rule, the existing rules covering fees and expenses of witnesses.  The new rule is in the main designed to implement the recommendations of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure in Part (2) of their eighth interim report.  The principal change is that the fee for a professional witness allowable on taxation of party and party costs is no longer prescribed by the Rules of the Superior Courts but will be determined by the Taxing Masters after consultation from time to time with the professional associations.  The third set of rules in which I have concurred are <Col N="72" /> the Rules of the Superior Courts (No. 1), 1971, which provide for the recovery of certain court fees increased under the Supreme Court and High Court (Fees) Order, 1970.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, there were the Rules of the Superior Courts (No. 2), 1971, which relate to bankruptcy forms, the grant of free transcripts to appellants in legal aid cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal, procedure under the Redundancy Payments Act, 1967 and the reckoning of certain execution costs by reference to Part III of Appendix W to the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1962.</P>
    <P>The fifth and last set of rules made by the Superior Courts Committee were the Rules of the Superior Courts (No. 3), 1971, which provide for an increase in the costs in respect of shorthand writers and transcripts of evidence, as prescribed in the Rules of the Superior Courts, 1962.</P>
    <P>The three Courts Rules Committees made new costs rules which came into operation on Decimal Day, the 15th February, 1971.  The effect of the new rules was to substitute the new decimal currency equivalents for amounts of costs previously prescribed in pounds, shillings and pence.</P>
    <P>A division has been established in my Department to continue the work of examining the implications for the Department of entry to the EEC and to take the necessary consequential action. The Department is considering in conjunction with the Attorney General's Legal Committee what legal provisions will be required, in so far as the Department is concerned, to implement the Treaties, Community secondary legislation and the Rules of the European Court of Justice.  The provisions required are likely to include amendments to existing legislation, certain new legislative measures and new rules of court.  The Department is also considering the EEC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Civil and Commercial Judgments, with a view to accession by Ireland to the Convention.  The Convention has been ratified by three of the existing six member states and it will come into force when all the member states have <Col N="73" /> ratified it.  The Accession Treaty provides that the new member states shall enter into negotiations with the Six in order to make any necessary adjustments to it.  These negotiations have already begun but they are still at an exploratory stage in the field of &ldquo;technical adaptations&rdquo;.  We have received and are examining a preliminary draft of an EEC Convention on Bankruptcy, Compositions and Related Proceedings. This draft is still being considered by the Six and I understand that negotiations on the terms of the convention will not take place with the applicant States until a new draft has been prepared in the light of the views of the existing members.</P>
    <P>The Adoption Board made 1,305 orders in 1971, 109 less than in 1970. The proportion of children placed by Adoption Societies was 85 per cent as compared with 83 per cent in 1970.  I should like to place on record my appreciation of the excellent work that is being done both by the board itself and by the Adoption Societies, of whom there are 21.  Six hundred and fifty-six of the orders made in 1971 were in respect of boys and 649 were in respect of girls.  The board continues to hold sittings outside Dublin so as to facilitate prospective adopters.  Forty-eight of the total of 92 meetings held during the year were held in various centres outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>There has been some increase in recent years in the number of aliens registered as being resident here for three months or more.  The number so registered on 31st December, 1971 was 6,088 as against 5,126 on 31st December, 1970.  The influx of visitors subject to immigration controls continues to increase at a rapid rate.  Over 222,000 visitors came here in 1971 from places other than the North of Ireland and Great Britain as compared with 190,000 such visitors in 1970.  Those figures do not include British subjects, who are exempt from control on a reciprocal basis.  The increasing number of foreign visitors coming here creates various administrative problems for the immigration service, and the service has to be kept under constant review in consultation with the other Government Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="74" /> In the year ended 31st December, 1971, 71 persons were naturalised as compared with 95 in the previous year. This brings to 2,928 the total number of all persons naturalised since 1935, when provision for naturalisation was made.</P>
    <P>In 1970, the latest year for which figures are available, the Film Censor examined 789 films with a total footage of 3,034,288.  The number of films examined by the Censor in 1969 was 843 and the footage examined in that year was 2,767,232.  Of the total of 789 films which the Censor examined in 1970, 646 were passed without cuts, 70 were passed with cuts and 73 were rejected.  The Censor issued 119 limited certificates. The Censorship of Films Appeal Board considered appeals in respect of 74 films.  Sixteen of the appeals were rejected.  Four films were allowed for general viewing without cuts, 13 for limited viewing without cuts and 41 for limited viewing with cuts.</P>
    <P>The Censorship of Publications Board examined 367 books and 13 periodicals in 1971.  Five books were examined as a result of formal complaints from members of the public and 362 books were referred to the board by Officers of Customs and Excise.  The board made 291 prohibition orders in respect of books and five in respect of periodicals.</P>
    <P>Appeals for revocation of prohibition orders were lodged with the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board in respect of five books; and five appeals were made for variation orders in respect of particular editions of books prohibited and a further five were brought forward from 1970.  The Appeal Board made two variation orders.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967, a prohibition order imposed on the ground that a book was indecent or obscene ceases to have effect after 12 years.  By virtue of this provision, 279 prohibition orders in respect of books ceased to have effect on 31st December, 1971.</P>
    <P>In the Public Record Office the amount of material being transferred <Col N="75" /> continued to grow.  The main intake of documents in the office consists of the transfer of records from the principal and district probate registries and from the courts.  During the current year a large quantity of old family and estate papers were received from solicitors and others.</P>
    <P>I now come to prisons.  An outstanding feature of the period under review has been the steep rise in the numbers in custody, itself a consequence of the increased incidence of crime to which I referred earlier.  At present there are 1,078 in custody.  This figure is 153 above the daily average for 1971 and 329 above the daily average for 1970. The situation is greatly altered from that of ten years ago&mdash;when there were about 450 in custody&mdash;or even five years ago&mdash;when the figure was about 560&mdash;and when whole sections were empty in all the prisons.</P>
    <P>In January of this year we reached the position of having to accommodate a small number of prisoners and detainees in overcrowded cells.  Fortunately this situation did not persist, and there is not pressure to this degree on the available accommodation at the present time.  By and large, however, it can be taken that the prisons and detention centres&mdash;Cork excepted &mdash; are almost full to capacity.  There are now 506 in Mountjoy, 123 in Limerick, 177 in Portlaoise, 15 in Cork, 207 in St. Patrick's and 50 in Shanganagh. Here I may say that our prison buildings, in common with those of most European countries, are not modern.  Mountjoy, St. Patrick's, Limerick and Cork were built more than a century ago and Portlaoise as a convict prison dates from the first decade of the present century.  With the exception of Shanganagh, the principal part of which was built as a modern residential college in recent years, the other places I have mentioned are out of date in lay-out.  Mountjoy, St. Patrick's and Limerick radiate in wings from a central area and Portlaoise and Cork are long rectangular blocks.  In both types there is a great open space between roof and ground floor with stairways and passageways leading to tiers of cells on three or four unfloored levels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The likelihood that the increasing crime rate would cause an accommodation problem in the prisons was already showing itself when I first became Minister.  Possible solutions had been under consideration in my Department and I visited all the prisons to make myself familiar with the problems which had to be met.  It was clear that additional accommodation would be needed before very long and it was also clear that the existing accommodation needed to be seen to.  I set up, therefore, a group representative of my own Department and the Office of Public Works to get to work on a number of projects which I considered should be attended to immediately.  A great deal of progress has been made and I have approved of several new developments.</P>
    <P>I directed that priority be given to the provision of a new women's prison in Dublin.  The existing prison consists of the ground floor of a wing which is structurally part of St. Patrick's Institution and has its own separate grounds.  It is too small, it is not well serviced and neither it nor St. Patrick's benefits from being adjacent to one another.  Several possible sites were inspected.  I am glad to say that one of these is very suitable.  I am anxious to acquire it and negotations are on point of completion.  Even when the site is finally acquired, it will of course be at least another year before construction is likely to commence and a second year at least before the new prison is ready.  However, it is good to be at the stage when one can definitely foresee that a modern purpose-built centre to accommodate and treat women prisoners will be available to replace the accommodation which we have at present.  In the meantime my Department has sought advice from the United Nations Social Defence Research Institute.  The information available to the institute on up-to-date standards of design and equipment for prisons is at our disposal. Deputies can rest assured that we are abreast of current ideas on these matters and that the preliminary briefing is being undertaken already.</P>
    <P>There is also a major programme of redevelopment on hands for the men's prison in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> A new corrective training unit is being planned for 100 trainees in place of the ordinary prison wing used in Mountjoy at present for corrective training.  The new unit will be located on the Mountjoy site but it will be completely separate from the main prison and will be an autonomous institution.  Guidelines for the new unit have been discussed with the architect. The unit will provide first-class living accommodation and educational, training and recreational facilities and both finishes and equipment will be in harmony with its purpose.  The experience gained in the present corrective training wing has underlined the basic soundness of what we have been trying to do and the new unit will afford an opportunity to develop several aspects of training.  Staff and the overall training activity of the new unit will be carefully planned and I am confident that we will make worthwhile advances in this area.  It is hoped the new unit will be complete within a year from now.</P>
    <P>It is intended to build new quarters for unmarried prison officers adjacent to the prison but outside the perimeter wall.  These living quarters will be for 50 officers and will be capable of future extension if that proves desirable.  They have been designed to provide acceptable standards of living and recreational accommodation for staff, taking into consideration the trying circumstances in which officers perform their daily duties.  The architect's plans, which have been discussed with the officers' staff association, are now being examined and construction is expected to commence in 1973.</P>
    <P>As soon as the new staff quarters are ready to be occupied it is intended to adapt the present staff quarters in prison precincts as an infirmary.  A thorough reconstruction is envisaged. It should enable up-to-date facilities to be provided not only for the general run of minor illnesses but also for mild psychiatric disturbance or for relief of drug dependency conditions.  It is intended, however, to continue the policy of referring cases of serious illness, including mental illness, for treatment to the appropriate outside hospitals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="78" /> Might I interpolate here that considerable progress has been made in reaching agreement with the Eastern Health Board's Department of Forensic Medicine on the provision of a psychiatric consultancy and treatment service for the prisons and detention centres near Dublin on a weekly sessional basis.  A similar arrangement will be sought from other regional health boards in respect of our other establishments.  Such formal arrangements will greatly enhance the service which the psychiatric hospitals have extended for years past.</P>
    <P>A new corrective training unit within the next year and a new infirmary by 1975 holds out the prospect of two of the present four wings in Mountjoy being vacated.  At present the numbers in Mountjoy are running close to 500. This is too high.  It is particularly undesirable because it greatly impairs the degree of segregation which is desirable. Apart from that, it reduces the quality of personal relationship between staff and prisoners and by straining the physical resources of the prison it makes it impossible to undertake many developments that are called for and that I would like to see in operation.  The vacating of the corrective training wing next year should afford some early relief and the vacating of the hospital wing subsequently should effect a significant improvement.</P>
    <P>Quite a good deal of renovation is being carried out in Mountjoy.  The kitchen has been completely re-equipped. It took a long time to get the work done, because the kitchen itself had to be kept operative right through and it had to cope as well with a rising population.  A fully equipped dental surgery has also been installed in which the full range of dental treatment can be carried out. At the present time a new central prison stores is nearing completion as is a new multi-purpose hall which can be used for talks, games and even for visits.  Throughout the prison, much of what I will call the &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; is old and unsatisfactory.  A continuous effort is being made to improve the situation in this respect.  A lot has already been achieved though, as vandalism is <Col N="79" /> always with us, some of it has to be done and done again.</P>
    <P>Limerick Prison is now also almost full to capacity.  In many ways it is the prison in best state of repair.  Good living-quarters for the staff of the women's prison have been built, entirely by prisoners under the guidance of the trades staff.  The women's prison there is being renovated.  Half the cells have been replastered and painted and a pleasant workroom constructed.  The remainder of the cells are being done at present.</P>
    <P>The numbers in Portlaoise have gone up also and resources are strained.  Contracts will be placed shortly for the total reconstruction of a wing of the old county prison which has been disused for many years.  It is intended to re-roof this wing, to floor every storey and to have every one of the three floors self-contained to a considerable degree.  The new wing will provide three sectors for 16 men each and, in the special context of Portlaoise, as the prison where the longer prison sentences are served, this should enable particular categories of prisoners to be brought together in small groups as an aid to rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>In the existing block, the kitchen has also been completely re-equipped.  This year I hope to have the old laundry re-equipped as a modern laundrette. A five-shower unit has also been installed but the rest of the &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; needs seeing to.  The roof of the wing has been giving trouble.  I saw just how much on the rainy day of my visit and I am glad to say that the job that needed to be done is now well under way.  Deputies passing the prison on their way to Dublin may have noticed, as I did myself, the continual improvements in the staff-houses along the Dublin road&mdash;re-plastering, new garden walls, railings and so on.  They may be interested to know that only a few of the many who were working were officers.  The rest were prisoners and there have been no mishaps, so far, anyway.  I regret that for security reasons, much of this worthwhile activity has had recently to be curtailed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> Early this year when the existing prisons became overcrowded the Minister for Defence made the military detention barracks in Cork available to me for use as a civil prison.  The building was in excellent condition and the prison is already in operation. Up to the present, 24 local prisoners have been transferred there from the other prisons.  The prison potentially has accommodation for 100 but for a year or thereabouts, until ancillary buildings are provided and services augmented generally, it will not be possible to house anything approaching that figure.  It is valuable, however, to be able to use it to its present limited extent because it is its availability that has made it possible to alleviate the overcrowding, properly so called, of last January elsewhere.</P>
    <P>A degree of adaptation and modernisation will be necessary in Cork Prison.  Consideration is being given at present to flooring each storey and having half of each floor almost self-contained and so having a prison in which there will be six separate sectors available for more satisfactory and more relaxed treatment of various categories of offenders.</P>
    <P>The renovation of Cork Prison along these lines will enable this rather attractive idea to be tested on a moderate scale.  If it proves successful, it could be the basis of a long-term programme for modernising the main block in Portlaoise and&mdash;with some moderate adaptation&mdash;the radial wings of Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>I pass on to St. Patrick's.  It is an old prison building built to a radial pattern on a very restricted site.  It is full to capacity with more than 200 boys between 16 and 21 years of age.  I reject any suggestion that I am, or ever have been, complacent about it.  I have always felt that structurally it was far from suitable and in any case that it attempted to house twice or maybe three times as many youngsters as it ought.</P>
    <P>Things are changing for the better. I have acquired the residential college, formerly conducted by the White Fathers at Loughan, near Blacklion in County Cavan, as a detention centre partly to relieve the pressure on <Col N="81" /> accommodation in St. Patrick's.  Up to the present this new centre has been referred to as Blacklion.  This is not quite correct, as Blacklion is some miles away.  It is intended to call the centre simply Loughan, which is the name of the townland of which it comprises the greater part.</P>
    <P>The college was built only 16 years ago and is entirely suitable to its new purpose.  When provision has been made for staff, it will be possible to house about 35 offenders immediately. Within a year or so, by taking away easily removable party walls, it will be possible to accommodate 72 offenders in 18 rooms, four to each room.  These rooms have washbasins and fitted wardrobes.  There are chapels, classrooms, recreation rooms and a theatre.</P>
    <P>Already the County Leitrim Vocational Education Committee, in whose catchment area the centre will be, have offered their assistance with daily classes in general and practical subjects. Their spontaneous offer was most heartening and ensures that there will be a proper educational emphasis in the running of the centre from the outset. The buildings are situated on about 50 acres in lovely countryside. It will not be an &ldquo;open&rdquo; centre like Shanganagh nor will the same high degree of selectivity apply and it is intended to erect adequate&mdash;yet discreet&mdash;perimeter fencing.  Within the precincts, however, there will be considerable freedom of movement.</P>
    <P>Many things are undecided as yet about the new centre.  The idea is to be quite flexible initially and, indeed, it may be necessary to modify and adjust as experience is gained.  I am not yet in a position to say what age group will be sent to Loughan.  The House will recall that power was taken in the Prisons Act, 1970, to alter the ages for committal to St. Patrick's from 16 to 21 years to 16 to 19 years. This change has not been made because the growing prison population afforded no opportunity to implement it.  I am now reviewing the matter and perhaps, as a preliminary exercise we may have one or other of the two age groups 16 to 18 and 19 to 21 in Loughan and see how matters work out.  At any rate, the stage of reducing <Col N="82" /> the population in St. Patrick's has been reached.</P>
    <P>A great deal of much needed work has been done in St. Patrick's itself. With one exception, all the wings have been re-roofed and this greatly improves the day lighting.  The remaining wing will be re-roofed this year.  One wing is being thoroughly renovated. This involved hacking off all the old plaster, electrical rewiring, installation of new lights and complete replastering. The work is well advanced.  When it has been completed and redecorated, and when the old granite floor has been replaced by linoleum tiles, the former aspect of the wing will be greatly improved, particularly as an amount of superfluous internal bars have been removed.  As soon as this wing has been finished, work will commence on another.</P>
    <P>When I visited St. Patrick's after being appointed Minister, I decided that matmaking should be brought to an end.  This has made it possible to have the old matshop converted into a large recreation hall which, to an extent, can be used as a gymnasium, for boxing and as a concert-hall.  It is really a fine job of conversion.  Apart from this recreation hall, a great deal of gymnastic and sport equipment has been purchased and the playing field has been laid out as a multi-purpose all-weather pitch.</P>
    <P>The kitchen in St. Patrick's has also been re-equipped.  I take this opportunity to mention that here, as in all the prisons, the use of aluminium table utensils has been discontinued, and a range of patterned ware introduced. All prisoners now have patterned cup, saucer, plates and dishes.  They also have an individual teapot, which is of stainless steel.  I should also mention that, as the new kitchens are now in operation in all the institutions, improvements can be made in the present diet.  The revised diet will be introduced shortly.</P>
    <P>Nearly all the boys committed to St. Patrick's are educationally backward and I am glad to be able to tell the House that much has been done in the past year to come to grips with this situation.  A new educational centre is now almost ready for use and it is <Col N="83" /> furnished and equipped in the most modern way.  It has three ordinary classrooms for basic subjects and another two which are more spacious and which can be used for singing, art, group discussions, evening activities and so forth.  This facility is one which has been lacking in St. Patrick's and it will enable teaching in basic subjects to be effectively undertaken.</P>
    <P>Since October, 1970, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny have been coming in to take the boys for reading, writing, arithmetic, arts and crafts and singing.  Two sisters come in daily, morning and afternoon.  One of the sisters, a qualified and experienced teacher, who has been on the academic staff of a teacher training college and who has also had extensive experience of social problems, sees every boy coming into St. Patrick's and finds out what his immediate educational needs are.  This sister also takes some classes and the second sister, who has spent her life teaching, takes classes all day. Co-ordinating with them are a large group of students who take the boys, under the sisters' guidance, for individual tuition.  These are students from St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra, Holy Cross College, Clonliffe, Dalgan Park and the Salesians.  I should like to express here my appreciation of what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Just for the present and until the new centre is finally available the sisters, as far as accommodation for classes is concerned, are making do as best they can.  Despite the inadequate accommodation, the results of their work have exceeded expectations and they and their associates are now reaching almost 180 boys.  As well as the two sisters who come in daily, a larger group come in on Saturdays and take the boys for singing, guitar playing, choir practise and so on.  In addition to their teaching work, the sisters have brought into St. Patrick's a womanly presence which was heretofore lacking and their influence on the boys can only be for the best.</P>
    <P>In one sector of the educational programme for St. Patrick's there was a setback.  It proved difficult to recruit <Col N="84" /> a psychologist.  A competition was held by the Civil Service Commission in 1970 and candidates who qualified were offered the post but, in every case, individual reasons of one kind or another resulted in the person concerned not being able to accept appointment.  I am still endeavouring to recruit a psychologist on a permanent basis and another open competitive examination will be held later on this year.  In the meantime we have been fortunate in that we have recently been able to obtain the full-time services of a psychologist on a temporary basis.  Incidentally, office and consultancy accommodation for a psychologist is included in the new school building to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>As part of the modernisation of the existing buildings, loudspeakers are being installed in each cell and a central studio is being equipped to enable the transmission of talks, readings, music, indeed educational programmes of all kinds, in the widest sense of the word &ldquo;educational&rdquo;, to the cells during the evening lock-up period and in this way to put to good use what has heretofore been a tedious time for the boys.</P>
    <P>Under the guidance of the trades staff the boys in St. Patrick's have been helping with much of the reconstruction going on.  This has been worthwhile training for them.  The work has, however, caused its own quota of disruption and, unavoidably, a problem about grit and dust. Occasionally a boy has taken advantage of the disruption to cause trouble or to abscond.  The great majority are making the best of the situation.</P>
    <P>In Shanganagh Castle there have also been a number of developments. A community of sisters is now associated with the work of this centre.  They are the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth and a house has been acquired for them nearby.  One sister who is a qualified nurse acts as matron and two others, both qualified and experienced teachers, take the boys for elementary subjects, geography, current affairs and handcrafts.</P>
    <P>The sisters, who have just recently taken up duty, are now working out the programme which will be followed. <Col N="85" /> Excellent classrooms are already available and equipment on modern lines, suitable for the special requirements of the boys, will be provided shortly.  An art teacher is also provided by County Dublin Vocational Educational Committee for three hours on Saturdays and talks and discussions are conducted regularly on week nights by some voluntary workers who offered to give their time to the work for the boys.  Once again I am grateful.</P>
    <P>I think that I should mention here that both the housekeeper and the welfare officer in Shanganagh are also women and they, with the sisters, correct the staff imbalance that would exist in an all-male house.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be interested to hear the results of a follow-up on over 100 of the boys who have been through Shanganagh to date.  It was encouraging to find that almost 80 per cent have not been in trouble again and that the majority have continued in employment.</P>
    <P>The new gymnasium and manual classrooms are now at the final stage of architectural planning and construction will commence later on this year.  Work has already begun on hothouses for horticulture, which will cover a half acre.  These will provide training for employment.  The centre itself will be completely refurnished this year.</P>
    <P>Last year a training course for prison officer recruits was inaugurated. The course consisted of explanatory talks, visits to welfare services, courts, hospitals, prisons, detention centres and also an introduction to the various kinds of duty these officers are called upon to perform.  A series of lectures on human personality and on counselling has been given to the staff in Shanganagh Castle.  The lectures were arranged in co-operation with the Department of Psychology of University College, Dublin.  In addition, a number of prison staff have attended shorter training courses on one aspect or another of their official duties.</P>
    <P>The members of the various visiting committees perform an indispensable service when they give their time to visiting the prisons and places of <Col N="86" /> detention and looking into such things as complaints by individual prisoners, food, and so on.  I welcome the latest addition to their number, the Visiting Committee to Shanganagh Castle.  I have had a very full discussion with members of this committee and with the Committee of St. Patrick's.  To all the others voluntarily engaged in welfare and educational activities in connection with the prisons and other institutions, I also wish to express my appreciation.</P>
    <P>The expanded welfare service for offenders which I spoke about in the Prisons Bill, 1970, is now in existence. There are now 31 welfare officers as against eight two years ago.  Thirteen of them are in Dublin.  There are posts in Athlone, Cork, Dundalk, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo and Waterford. Officers may not be assigned yet to some posts but officers for them are in training.  There are now eight welfare posts in all the prisons and detention centres as against two for all the institutions before the expansion.</P>
    <P>Further appointments both in Dublin and the provinces are being considered.  The welfare officers have undergone intensive four weeks' induction courses.  These courses consist of talks from people experienced in various aspects of the work, group discussions, study visits to places and environments with which welfare officers are likely to be connected, and a wide sampling of the duties which they are likely to be asked to carry out.  I wish to place on record my special appreciation of all the assistance which has been received from the Sheffield Probation and After-Care Service.  Two years ago, when officials of my Department were examining the requirements for a better service, they were most helpfully received in Sheffield and were given a thorough insight into the fully organised welfare service which is operating there.  Since then the Sheffield Service has continued to help and has offered to receive our recently appointed officers for study visits.  Already two of the senior officers have been there and all the other officers will go in turn this year.</P>
    <P>A new headquarters office has been <Col N="87" /> opened in 39 Anne's Lane off South Anne Street not alone as a headquarters for the service but as a co-ordinating centre for the many voluntary bodies in the community at large who are co-operating with the service.  I have explained at length on several occasions why I consider community effort so important in relation to a community problem like offenders.</P>
    <P>This community interest is growing daily and I welcome it.  But as well as being articulate it should, indeed must, be practical also, if it is to be valid at all.  Perhaps the most remarkable recent development in this sector was the fine hostel for boys placed on probation by the courts, provided in Chapelizod by the Dublin Club of Lions International.  They made an outstandingly good job of converting the former Garda station there, which I was glad to be able to make available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the context of non-institutional treatment for offenders, I should also like to refer to an experimental project recently undertaken to compare the effect on offenders of being supervised in the community as distinct from being kept in detention.  The Welfare Service conducted a survey in Saint Patrick's and identified a number of detainees who by reference to their histories, records and personal qualities might be considered as likely to benefit from such supervision.  They were, in the main, offenders who might well, even at the outset, have been put under supervision by the courts if welfare officers had been available to them at the time of sentence.  Thirty four were selected and I allowed them conditional release under close and intensive supervision of the Welfare Service. No more than two or three were allocated to any one officer and very precise norms of supervision applied.</P>
    <P>The purpose was to see if these offenders could be kept out of trouble with supervisory support and guidance for the period during which they would have been in custody.  In the eight weeks that the project has been in operation four of the boys have lapsed and are again in custody but 30 of the 34 are doing well.  The group under <Col N="88" /> supervision are matched to a group serving out their detention sentences and the behaviour-patterns of both groups on completion of their sentences will be compared later on as a follow-up.  It could be that there will be evidence in favour of relying more than at present on non-institutional supervision and that some offenders may do as well under supervision as they do in detention, or possibly better.</P>
    <P>I have listed a number of things that are being done&mdash;in the short term and long term&mdash;to improve our places of detention in various ways.  No doubt there is a lot of leeway to be made up, though I am bound to say that we are less adept than we might be in boosting what we have done.  Be that as it may, I do not think that any Deputy listening to me could fairly deny that we are doing a very great deal, especially when regard is had to the many demands on our resources by other citizens who in their own way are just as unfortunate as&mdash;perhaps more than&mdash;those who come into conflict with the law.  One of the things that has struck me in meeting some of the people who are interested in a general benevolent way in penal reform is that they persist in telling me that nothing is being done about it in this State.  When I stress the scope and variety of what is in fact being done or being planned I want to acknowledge in full the work done in this field during the period of office of my predecessor. What I feel justified in saying for my own part is that I have built on, and expanded, the work he had done, just as he did during his period of office.</P>
    <P>I should not like to conclude this review of developments in regard to the treatment of offenders without referring to a matter which has been the subject of concern to the Tánaiste, as Minister for Health, and to myself for some time past, that is, the provision to be made for mentally disturbed offenders.  In consultation with him, I have set up an informal interdepartmental committee, which includes specialists in the medical and legal fields, to examine this problem. The committee will be concerned with persons, including drug abusers, <Col N="89" /> psychopaths and emotionally disturbed and maladjusted children and adolescents, who have come, or appear likely to come, in conflict with the law and who may be in need of psychiatric treatment.  The idea is that the committee will make recommendations informally as they go along, so to speak, and it is not envisaged that there will be anything in the nature of a single formal report or that the reports will be published.  This is a wide and complex undertaking and it would be unrealistic to expect recommendations from the committee for some time. Nevertheless a fresh appraisal of the problem is necessary and I am confident that the efforts of the committee will result in a genuine advance.</P>
    <P>There is just one other observation which I would like to make before I go on from prisons and the welfare service. I do so to clarify for Deputies the institutions for which I am answerable to this House.  I am not responsible for industrial schools, reformatory schools, St. Laurence's Centre for Delinquent Boys in Finglas, the remand home at Marlborough House in Glasnevin or the projected replacement for St. Conleth's School in Oberstown.  I mention these places because Deputies may have been led to believe from references in the news media that they are controlled by my Department and unless, so to speak, I put the record right matters might be raised that are not my responsibility and are, therefore, not relevant.  I am aware, of course, that it is being alleged that there is no liaison or coordination between my Department and the Department of Education in relation to the custody and treatment of young offenders.  I want to say categorically that that is not true and that the people who make these charges are unaware of the facts.</P>
    <P>The next area of my Department's responsibilities that I want to deal with is that relating to the courts.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that an order made by my predecessor which came into operation on 1st April, 1969, provided for a general closedown of sittings of the District Court during the month of August and for short periods at Easter and Christmas and for the <Col N="90" /> holding of special sittings as required to handle urgent business.  In general, this system operated smoothly and successfully, met the convenience of the general public and contributed to the efficiency of the District Court. However, on the basis of practical experience of its working, I felt that a further improvement could be made by providing that, instead of special sittings as required, weekly vacation sittings would be held at a central venue in each District Court District during the month of August, with additional sittings in Cork and Dublin. The new arrangements came into operation with effect from 1st August, 1970.</P>
    <P>A particular problem arises from delays that have been building up in the Dublin Circuit Court in the trial of offenders and in the hearing of criminal appeals.  To meet this situation, the President, on the recommendation of the Government, appointed an additional Circuit Court judge for the Dublin circuit for a period of two years from 6th December, 1971.  This means that there are now four Circuit judges assigned to Dublin.  In addition, the spare time of the provincial judges continues to be utilised in the Dublin circuit.  Since the appointment of the additional Circuit Court judge for Dublin, the delays in the hearing of cases have been reduced.  At present, the average delay in the trial of an offence is six months as compared with eight months formerly.  In the case of a criminal appeal, delay has been reduced from seven months to three months.  I hope and expect that the position will continue to improve.  It will be generally accepted that persons should be brought to trial or, as the case may be, have their appeals determined as speedily as possible.</P>
    <P>The rapidly-increasing volume of court business in Dublin in recent years has imposed a growing strain on available accommodation for the courts, and court offices, particularly in the Four Courts complex.  It is now clear that the existing accommodation is no longer adequate and that the time has come for a complete reassessment of the present and future accommodation requirements of all the <Col N="91" /> courts in Dublin.  I am, therefore, setting up a small committee, representative of the Departments immediately concerned to look into the matter. The President of the High Court has kindly consented to act as chairman of that committee which, I expect, will begin work immediately.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the accommodation available to the Children's Court in Dublin leaves much to be desired.  I have, accordingly, had this accommodation examined with a view to seeing whether it can be improved pending the outcome of the deliberations of the committee I have mentioned, which will, of course, concern itself with the long-term accommodation requirements of this court as well as of the other courts in Dublin.  Certain proposals, designed to improve the existing accommodation in the short term, are at present under discussion between my Department and the Office of Public Works and I am hopeful that it will be possible to effect the necessary improvements at an early date.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Children's Court, I want to take this opportunity of correcting recent erroneous references made and repeated in public to the number of children dealt with annually by this court.  Wide publicity has been given to statements that 16,000 children pass through the court annually. The figure of 16,000 refers, in fact, to the number of charges listed and not the number of children involved.  The number of children involved would be approximately one third of the number of charges.</P>
    <P>The staffing requirements of the Circuit Court and the District Court are at present being re-assessed in the light of the increasing volume of work in these courts in recent years.  The staffing situation will be reviewed in the light of experience of the increases in the jurisdictions of these courts under the Courts Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>A review of the free legal aid scheme was completed in 1970.  After discussions with the General Council of the Bar of Ireland and the Incorporated Law Society, I made an order on 7th October, 1970, increasing <Col N="92" /> substantially the fees payable to solicitors and counsel under the scheme and providing for the payment of additional fees and expenses in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Following a full and detailed examination of the fees chargeable in court offices, I made orders which came into effect on 19th October, 1970, increasing certain fees chargeable in the offices of the Supreme Court and the High Court and increasing generally the fees chargeable in the offices of the Circuit and District Courts.</P>
    <P>The fees chargeable in the Office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy were substantially reduced and rationalised.  Apart from some minor adjustments necessary because of the advent of decimalisation, no increases were made in the fees chargeable in the Probate Office and in the district probate registries.  Moreover, the additional Revenue fee of 1/- hitherto charged on an official copy of a will was abolished by the Finance Act, 1970, so that the existing Probate fee of 25p for an official copy of a will is now the total fee payable.</P>
    <P>In making the fees orders, I had specifically in mind the desirability of keeping as low as possible those fees with which the community in general is more frequently concerned, and also of encouraging members of the public and solicitors to avail themselves of the services provided for them in the various court offices.  It is for this reason that I made no increases in Probate fees, confined increases in the fees for a civil process in the District Court and for a civil bill in the Circuit Court to a minimum, and substantially reduced the fees in the Office of the Official Assignee in Bankruptcy.</P>
    <P>All court fees may now be paid either by impressed stamps or by adhesive stamps.  Previously, impressed stamps were mandatory in certain cases.  This caused inconvenience to solicitors, who had to keep stocks of those documents that required impressed stamps.  Country solicitors, in particular, were inconvenienced as there were no facilities outside Dublin for impressing stamps on documents.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to the fact that, under the Courts Act, 1971, fees now payable by litigants <Col N="93" /> generally will be substantially less by reason of the fact that a significant number of proceedings that have to be taken in either the High Court or the Circuit Court will, under the new legislation, fall within the jurisdiction of either the Circuit Court or the District Court, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Land Registry, there has been a continuing upward trend in recent years in the intake of work.  For example, the number of applications for changes in registration increased from 38,000 in 1970 to 46,200 in 1971 and, since the end of 1971, the rate of increase has accelerated sharply.  On the basis of the current intake, it is estimated that the number of dealings lodged in the calendar year 1972 will be in the region of 58,000.  This represents an increase of 53 per cent as compared with 1970, and creates serious difficulties as regards the provision of an efficient service to the public.  I shall return to this aspect of the matter in a moment.</P>
    <P>On 1st January, 1970, the compulsory registration provisions of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, were brought into operation in respect of the Counties Carlow, Laois and Meath.  What this means, in effect, is that whenever unregistered property is sold in these counties the new ownership must be registered.  The bulk of agricultural land in this country is already registered and, accordingly, the impact of the new provisions is mainly on urban properties.  The question of extending the area of compulsory registration is one which I shall consider in due course, in the light of experience.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that for some years now there have been problems in the Land Registry in connection with arrears of work.  These arrears have been due to a number of factors, including increases in the volume of work, shortage of accommodation, staffing and organisational difficulties. I am glad to say that the accommodation problems have been solved for the present.  Reorganisation proposals which are in the process of being implemented will, I hope, solve the other problems.  The reorganisation, which was recommended by a study group set <Col N="94" /> up to review the organisation and procedures in the Land Registry, involves a change from the traditional structure of the Registry, which was based on a division of the work into various subfunctions, each of which was dealt with by a group of staff.</P>
    <P>The system now being implemented calls for a division of the work by reference to geographical areas.  Each area is given its own group of staff and an application to register a change of ownership made by a person in a particular area is processed from start to finish by the group dealing with that area.  At the time of the debate on my Department's Estimates for 1969-70, two such groups had been set up on a pilot basis.  We now have 11 groups operating.  The possibility of increasing the number of groups is being examined having regard to the steep increase in the volume of work now being experienced.  Already there are indications that the new procedures have in fact led to an improvement in efficiency.</P>
    <P>However, I am still extremely concerned about the arrears in the Land Registry and, in particular, about arrears in the Mapping Branch.  The introduction of an incentive bonus scheme helped to reduce the mapping arrears considerably during 1970, but a marked increase in the intake of work, combined with staffing difficulties, led to a worsening of the position during 1971.  I am only too well aware that delays in the Mapping Branch can and do lead to considerable difficulties in effecting registration. The study group, to which I have already referred, have made recommendations for the reorganisation of the Mapping Branch and every effort is being made to have the necessary improvements effected at an early date so that an efficient service to the public will be provided.</P>
    <P>Another matter which the study group examined is the system of paying for the services which the Land Registry renders.  It is not always realised that even in money terms the Registry is quite a substantial business &mdash;one with an annual turnover of more than £400,000.  The group have made recommendations for the introduction <Col N="95" /> of a system of payment by cash rather than by Revenue stamps. This would obviously be more convenient for most solicitors.  The recommendations are at present under examination and I hope to be able to have a detailed system worked out in the near future and brought into operation as soon as possible.  The study group are continuing their work and I hope that we are now well on the way to designing and establishing an organisation that will not only be able to cater for the needs of the community in this important field but be fully capable of meeting future demands.</P>
    <P>There has also been a general increase in the volume of work arising in the Registry of Deeds.  The number of deeds registered has gone up from just over 34,000 in 1969 to almost 36,500 last year&mdash;a trend which shows every sign of continuing in the present year.</P>
    <P>Finally I wish to refer briefly to the Office of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  The last report which the commissioners made to me is in respect of the year 1970.  Cash totalling £40,744 and stocks to the nominal value of £861 were transferred to the commissioners during that year and at the end of the year the nominal value of investments standing in their name was some £2,253,000.  The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests give their services voluntarily and their extremely valuable work is quite onerous.  We should all be grateful to them.</P>
    <P>This leads me to express to the other voluntary bodies and commissions which are associated with my Department, and which I have not already mentioned, my sincere thanks for their services during the past few years.  It is one of the more encouraging things in public life that so many people are prepared to devote their valuable time and expertise as well as their leisure hours to work of national importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Cavan)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> In view of the Minister's speech, I think I had better bring the House back to the motion in the name of the <Col N="96" /> Minister which we are discussing.  The motion reads:</P>
      <P>That, in connection with the supply granted for the years ended 31st March, 1971 and 31st March, 1972, the Dáil takes note of the activities of the Office of the Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>It follows from that, that we have not had a discussion on the Estimate for the Department of Justice for the year 1970-71 or the year 1971-72.  In fact, according to some research which I did, the last occasion on which we discussed the Estimate for the Department of Justice was when we commenced a discussion on 21st November, 1969. On that occasion we were discussing the Estimate for the year 1969-70.</P>
      <P>Quite a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then.  The Minister had a very wide field to cover. During the period covered by the resolution the Minister had not only to explain or deal with his own activities since he became Minister on that fateful day, 7th May, 1970, but also the activities of his predecessor in office.  In a 37-page brief, the Minister confined himself to a few of the activities of his Department.  Indeed, a stranger sitting in the Distinguished Visitor's Gallery, might be pardoned if he thought that, instead of listening to an account by the Minister for Justice of the complex and critical periods of the years 1970-1971 and 1971-1972, he was listening to the chief jailer of some complex detention centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At page 14 of his brief the Minister said: &ldquo;I now come to prisons.&rdquo;  He departed from the subjects of prisons on page 30 of his brief having devoted 16 pages, or nearly 50 per cent, of his 37-page brief to dealing with detention of criminals, young and old. In the situation in which we find ourselves something more was expected from the Minister.  I know he has a difficult task to perform.  I know he has a difficult situation to account for. It follows from what the Minister said that everything is far from well in the country.  It follows that the administration of justice and the prevention of crime have broken down in some way or another.  It would have been better if the Minister had devoted himself to <Col N="97" /> giving an analysis of the cause of the increase in crime and the breakdown in the detection of crime rather than giving us an item by item account of prisons and places of detention which, as I said, one would think was coming from a jailer-in-chief.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister dealt with it at such length, I may be pardoned for departing from the way I had intended to commence my remarks by saying that it is evident from the Minister's speech that prisons and places of detention are &ldquo;busting at the seams&rdquo;; that in the last two years the prison population has increased by leaps and bounds; that there is overcrowding in all prisons; that the Minister has quite rightly acquired Loughan House in County Cavan&mdash;although, in passing, I must say I should prefer if his colleague the Minister for Health had acquired it to accommodate mentally retarded children who are on a waiting list for seven or eight years.  The Minister referred to that in passing.  It is a question of priorities; it was necessary and I am glad the Minister acquired it.  The Minister thanked the Minister for Defence for making available to him a military barracks in Cork to accommodate people who have broken the law and are sent there by the courts.</P>
    <P>All this builds up to an alarming state of affairs in which we are losing respect for the law and crime is on the increase.  Other documents to which I shall refer prove that the prison population is not the end of the story and does not truly reflect the serious position in which we are.  We also know from the Minister's brief and from the report of the Garda Commissioner for the year ended 30th September, 1970, that while breaches of the law, offences indictable and summary, have increased considerably the rate of detection has fallen dramatically from 68 per cent a few years ago to as low as 51 per cent in the country as a whole and to 37 per cent in the metropolitan area.  Truly, if we were keeping up with crime, if we had a proper rate of detection we should certainly need a Minister for Prisons who could devote his entire speech&mdash;as the Minister nearly did&mdash;to an account of prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="98" /> I propose to ask the House to consider with me what is the cause of the lessening of respect for the law and why do we find ourselves in the position outlined in the Minister's speech and in the report of the Garda Commissioner. The Minister rightly concedes that the position is bad, that crime has increased, that the rate of detection has decreased, that the prison population has gone up.  I am not too clear whether he was referring entirely to subversive organisations and activities or to the criminal law in general when he says that our criminal procedure must be amended and that we shall have to get away from the idea of burning everything English except their criminal code.  He suggested, as he did here previously, that we must amend our laws of evidence to shift the onus of proof considerably on to the accused person, that we shall have to amend the laws of evidence in order to make it more difficult for an accused person to prove his innocence or make it less difficult for the State to establish guilt. He is prepared, as far as I can see, to do that at the risk of departing from the age-old procedure adopted here whereby a man is innocent until proved guilty and it is better for many guilty people to escape than for some innocent people to be convicted.</P>
    <P>The Minister complains about the machinery at his disposal and about the criminal code; he complains about the laws of evidence.  I hope I am not being unfair to him or, more especially, to the Government in saying that in my opinion this is classic example of bad workmen complaining about their tools.  A heavy responsibility lies on the Government.  The state of affairs disclosed in the Minister's speech and in the report of the Garda Commissioner calls for an explanation.  It is too bad that we did not discuss the Estimate for the Department of Justice for the year 1970-71 and that we are only discussing the Estimate for 1971-72 on the eve of the Budget for 1972-73.  That shows there is something wrong in the machinery of the House, either that, or the Government have not got their priorities right and the time of the House is taken up with internal squabbling in the Government or matters that are not of serious importance. <Col N="99" /> It is also a pity that the last report of the Garda Commissioner available to us on crime is that for the year ending 30th September, 1970.  We should at least have the report for the year ending 30th September, 1971, available now; it will come later.  In my opinion, the Government have much to answer for because of the example they have shown, the disrespect for institutions of State which they have generated. In a democracy the Department of Justice can only operate efficiently, effectively, impartially and with respect from the public at large if presided over by a Minister who is part of a Government united on fundamentals and seen to respect law and order themselves, thinking in a straight manner themselves and expressing those thoughts clearly so that the people as a whole, from the top down, know where they stand.</P>
    <P>I would be doing less than my duty as spokesman for Justice on behalf of this party if I did not go briefly through some of the outstanding events that have taken place during the period covered by this resolution and which affect directly the office of the Minister for Justice.  Much water has flown under the bridge since we had an opportunity of discussing in this House the affairs of the Department of Justice.  The Minister who introduced the Supplementary Estimate on 21st November, 1969, ceased to be responsible for the Department of Justice and left the Government in May, 1970. There was controversy as to whether he resigned or was sacked.  That controversy has not been cleared up.  The present Minister assumed responsibility for the Department of Justice on what I have described previously as that fateful day, the 7th May, 1970. He was appointed on a day on which this country was to become aware of a public scandal in the Government that was of major dimensions, a public scandal concerned directly with the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>On the same day that this young man was given this onerous position of Minister for Justice, two Government Ministers were sacked, a third resigned and a Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="100" /> resigned also.  Shortly afterwards two of those Ministers were charged, arrested and brought before the courts on charges which involved the security of the State and went to the very foundations of the administration of justice in the country.  Informations were refused in the District Court against one of the Ministers concerned and he was released.  The second Minister and three other civilians were brought before the Central Criminal Court on these serious charges.  Before the trial began a responsible judge, the President of the High Court, stated that he was reluctant to have to try the case and said he was sure that each of his colleagues would be equally reluctant. Surely that was an extraordinary pronouncement.</P>
    <P>Eventually the trial began before the reluctant trial judge.  It was an abortive trial.  After several days it exploded, not because there was any evidence admitted that should not have been admitted which is the usual reason for the discharge of a jury, but because for some reason best known to himself, the judge took offence and refused to continue with the trial.</P>
    <P>Subsequently the trial began before another judge and jury.  A Minister and a former Minister of the Government were pitted as witnesses against a man who had been a Minister of the Government up to a few months previously. There was a conflict of sworn testimony as between one and the other.  I shall not criticise the trial. Neither shall I criticise the verdict. When the trial ended the accused were acquitted and the accusers, including some of those who gave evidence, held their posts.  Surely that episode had a traumatic effect on the institutions and must have had a traumatic effect on respect for law and order, respect for justice and respect for authority.</P>
    <P>During this same period that we are dealing with&mdash;the past two years&mdash; there have been unprecedented happenings in the six north-eastern counties of the country with an inevitable overspill into the Republic.  I am bringing up this matter only to show inconsistency and to show the difficulty that the people of the country have in getting a lead or in ascertaining from <Col N="101" /> where the lead should come.  In relation to this situation we had statements from the Taoiseach and, so far as I know, from the Minister for Finance and other Ministers, towards the end of 1970 to the effect that they proposed then or shortly afterwards to use the Office of the Minister for Justice to intern people without trial in this part of the country.  Yet these same people raised their arms, in absolute indignation and rightly so, in August, 1971 because what they were talking about in 1970 was done then in Northern Ireland.  How can the people know what the Government are thinking?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> How can the people know what the Taoiseach is thinking or what individual Ministers are thinking and, especially, how can they know what the Government collectively are thinking? The position that we find ourselves in here is, in my opinion, responsible for the lessening of law and order in the country, for the prisons being full and for the acquisition of other places of detention.</P>
      <P>How can juries know what is expected of them?  In Dundalk, during the period covered by this debate, a man in a white Jaguar was arrested.  The boot of the car was packed with lethal weapons, capable of taking life on a grand scale.  This man was brought before a jury at Dundalk.  What was the defence?  He stood before those 12 jurors and said: &ldquo;If I am guilty of any offence, the Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, and each Member of his Government is guilty of the same offence.&rdquo; That was the only explanation or excuse that he offered.  Again, I do not quarrel with the jury but they retired and after an absence of eight minutes found the man not guilty.  Obviously they accepted his unsworn statement that there was double thinking at all levels here and that it was hard to know what was wanted or who to believe.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> During the period covered by this resolution there was a case in Cork <Col N="102" /> also where three men who were armed &mdash;I am told it was not a political robbery&mdash;robbed a supermarket and fired on members of the Garda Síochána. These gardaí displayed extreme bravery in tackling the men and in following them.  They used telecommunications to get in touch with headquarters, calling on the gardaí there and getting support.  Eventually, these three criminals were rounded up in the city of Cork on that very evening.  If the Minister for Justice makes inquiries he will find that the gardaí who made the detection were far from satisfied with the way in which they were allowed to investigate that crime.  The ballistic experts were not brought down for a number of days and then only under pressure from one of the gardaí who had been involved.</P>
      <P>The men were brought before Cork Circuit Court.  One of them was dealt with and pleaded guilty.  The judge stated that in his opinion he was not the ring leader and instead of sentencing him to eight years he sentenced him to four years imprisonment.  The trial of the other two men was transferred to the Central Criminal Court in Dublin.  Eventually their case was heard.  I know one cannot stop people talking or prevent people from making wild statements, but it was being said freely in Cork in the days before the trial in Dublin by relatives of the men concerned that they would never be imprisoned.  That was being said.  The Minister was not responsible for what was said and cannot muzzle me.  When the trial came on in Dublin the serious charges were dropped.  They were charges of having weapons to cause danger to life or with intent to murder. A number of charges were dropped and these two people were given suspensory sentences.  The Circuit Court judge in Cork thought that one or other of them was more involved than the man he had dealt with.  This is hard to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unfortunate man who had got four years imprisonment came up before the Court of Criminal Appeal and said that since it had transpired that his sentence was too severe he was appealing against it.  The Court of Criminal Appeal said that they could only deal with the facts as they knew <Col N="103" /> them and that they thought he did not get an hour too long imprisonment.  He was sent back to prison to serve his sentence.  There were complaints about the way that case was presented.  It is not for me to criticise the judiciary but I am entitled to criticise the manner in which many cases are investigated and the manner in which the evidence is produced.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I concede that.  The Minister is responsible for investigations.  I would like to say that I raised some point like this a couple of years ago and I was then told, as I know, that the Minister was not responsible for the presentation of cases in court.  That is dealt with in the Taoiseach's Estimate. The Taoiseach's Estimate always comes up for discussion on the adjournment debate with a mixed medley of things to be discussed, usually with limited time and limited speeches.  I missed a couple of these occasions.</P>
      <P>There are a few other points I would like to make.  It was reported in some newspapers recently that a member of the district court in dealing with what appeared to the general public to be a serious case of violence said that were it not for the fact that the accused was a university student and not a member of the lower strata or the working class he would have had to send him to prison.  If that was said I want it to go on the record of this House that saying it was a public scandal.  The man who made that statement is not fit to be on the bench.  It is the Minister's duty to investigate this matter and see whether that statement was made or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a case in Dún Laoghaire within the last six or eight months which was reported in the papers which, as we know, can be misleading. It was said that some elderly gentleman and his wife were walking down <Col N="104" /> the pier about midnight or 1 a.m. and the living daylights were kicked out of the man by some blackguard.  If the paper was correct this was a most disgraceful performance and a serious crime of violence.  The Probation of Offenders Act was applied.  That is hard to understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House reported progress on this measure before the recess, I was making some points in regard to the pollution of water and how we might set out in the direction of abating this horrible nuisance.  It will be freely admitted here by all Deputies that this country is possessed of lovely lakes and streams, and at this stage in our development it would be too bad that the public in general should be allowed to forget this fact. There are many other countries who envy us the variety of scenery we have here, scenery which is made up of high vegetation, beautiful lakes, mountains and streams.  It is regrettable that, in this modern age, the motor car, not to mention the affluence that goes with it, should be used to convey to the vicinity of a lake or river, trash which may give rise to pollution.</P>
      <P>This measure deals with water preservation, and to this extent the scope for discussion is limited, but the preservation of water is something which should concern all of us.  I referred previously to the fact that some of our lakes are already highly polluted, and this without the advent of high industrialisation. Lakes may become polluted from many causes.  Intensive farming is only one way in which a lake may become polluted.  It behoves all of us who live in these surroundings and who meet people who are engaged for a livelihood in raising livestock of one kind or another to find ways and means of reducing the degree of pollution of lakes which may arise from fertilisers, the spreading of nitrogen and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we should start preserving our rivers and lakes in a practical way.  We should educate the young about the danger of litter which leads to pollution.  It is regrettable that if a local authority develop a lay-by it is not developed six months until it becomes a polluted area.  There <Col N="106" /> is something wrong with the civic spirit of a community which permits this to happen.  Children grow up in this atmosphere and when they see their elders dumping refuse anywhere they will certainly follow this course.  There should be a campaign against this, first of all, and, secondly, against pollution. On the Continent, in areas where there is a high degree of industrialisation, they go to great lengths to try to preserve the sluggish rivers they have there, to try to prevent litter and pollution, and in certain cities in Europe it is a crime to dump even an empty matchbox on the street.  It is not so here; people here seem to be quite unconcerned about the dangers of this trend.  It is high time that all of us&mdash; and when I say all of us I include this House and the various Departments of State&mdash;should, by every means open to us, condemn all sorts of dumping and make it a crime.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, who pay grants in respect of the erection of out-buildings, to explain to the promoters the dangers which may arise from untreated effluents discharged from those buildings.  Similarly in the case of industry, the Department of Industry and Commerce should be alive to the fact that, while locating an industry in a given area may be a very helpful promotion to the community, they must take steps to see that it does not lead to the pollution of a lake or stream.  I am not saying this is an easy problem to deal with.  We have been living with it now for a long time and in the last ten years it has increased out of all proportion to what it was in the previous ten years.  Local authorities should also be encouraged to provide dumps which can take the refuse of the community and which will be attended to and drained and prevented in future from polluting streams.</P>
    <P>There are many elements which come into this whole matter, and one could go on at length about the dangers of indiscriminate development, by which I mean development that is not planned, and about planning towards the elimination of pollution of both the air and the water.  Bear in mind that one can pollute vegetation just as one can pollute the air and the water, <Col N="107" /> but water is, perhaps, more susceptible to pollution than any other natural element.  Early on we set out to encourage the development of our lakes and streams.  We encouraged both Bord Fáilte and the Inland Fisheries Trust to stock our lakes with game fish.  We encouraged Bord Fáilte to invite tourists here every year for fishing.  It would be too bad if when these visitors come in high hope of good sport, they should find themselves fishing in polluted lakes and streams.</P>
    <P>I read recently about the pollution of vegetation in certain parts of England.  A well-known species of tree has been affected by pollution.  The more we become industrialised the more likely it is that we shall meet with the same catastrophe.  We have some lovely forests in which we have invested a large amount of money.  We have private planting.  It would be too bad if pollution were allowed to affect our natural vegetation.  If our vegetation is affected our lakes and rivers will also become affected.</P>
    <P>To combat pollution we should start with the things we can accomplish.  We are very careless about litter.  In a certain town the operatives of the cleansing department clean up the town between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. every day.  By mid-day one is up to one's knees in litter.  If that is allowed to continue the problem of pollution will be almost incapable of solution.</P>
    <P>Primary development and industrial development must go hand in hand and we must at all times ensure that, before development takes place, we are in a position to nullify the possible effects of pollution.  We have not done that so far.  We are all aware of the horrible scars left on certain industrial towns in the North of England as a result of open-cast mining and so forth. Do we want to see scars like those in this country?  I do not think we do. Do we want to see our vegetation ruined?  I do not think we do.  Do we want the air we breathe polluted?  I do not think we do.  It behoves each and every one of us to play his part in abating this horrible scourge.  About 18 months ago when one of our most beautiful lakes was denuded of fish because of pollution it was brought <Col N="108" /> home to me vividly that pollution is a scourge.  The water will have to be cleaned and the lake restocked.  Would it not have been better in the five years before it became polluted to have taken steps to ensure that this could not occur?</P>
    <P>The beauty of our countryside is not man-made and we have, therefore, a greater duty to preserve it.  Steps will have to be taken and there are steps which could and should be taken to reduce the dangers of pollution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone is now conscious of the threat of pollution to our environment.  There are many things we can do to prevent pollution.  We are in a fortunate position compared with highly industrialised nations.  Our rivers have always been polluted to some degree, but the threat of pollution is greater today because of industrial development.  One contributory factor to pollution is modern living and modern living standards.  The movement of people from the land to the cities and towns is another factor in pollution.  Social development is a factor.  The biggest contributory factor is, however, industrial expansion. While we all welcome industrial expansion it is our duty to lay down certain conditions in order to nullify the danger of increased pollution and, with all the progress in modern science, technology, and so forth, this should not be beyond the competence of man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should be capable of protecting our waterways from any further pollution. It is only in isolated areas that we have pollution and we should be able to devise means of eliminating this.  When you travel on the Continent and see the condition of the great waterways of Europe you become conscious of the terrible evil of pollution.  Less than 12 months ago I was fortunate enough to be a member of a delegation travelling through Germany.  I was amazed at the extent of pollution there.  I saw great waterways like the Rhine thick with industrial pollution, completely devoid of fish life.  We associate Heidelberg with everything good in life and with the finer arts but when you see the colour of the river as it passes through Heidelberg, which is well inland and <Col N="109" /> far removed from the industrial Ruhr area, you become conscious of the great threat we are facing.</P>
    <P>We have in this country some of the finest waterways in Europe.  The Shannon is our pride and joy.  I am fortunate enough to represent the county which is closest to the Shannon.  There are many industries in our part of the country.  As far as I know every step is being taken by our local authority and our planning authorities to prevent any pollution by these industries.  It is only right that this should be done to preserve our environment.</P>
    <P>We are also fortunate in this respect in that we have not got a dense population. There is only one other country in Europe, Norway, with a less dense population.  We are also fortunate in that we have a generous rainfall which helps to eliminate pollution.  We also have ample water resources for domestic needs.</P>
    <P>The principal spheres affected by pollution in this country are rivers and recreational activities.  These are the two fields which are in most danger. There is also the question of the expansion of agriculture.  Being an agricultural country, many of our industries, such as milk plants, have an agricultural base.  There is also the modern trend in cattle rearing of silage pits. These are big offenders where small streams are concerned.  No stone should be left unturned by the people in charge of sanctioning grants to ensure that the effluent from these silage pits is properly treated and not allowed to flow into small streams. These people can prevent this by not sanctioning grants where such a danger exists.  Local authorities should be more conscious than anybody else of the question of pollution from effluent and sewage disposal.  I am sure they are quite conscious of it and will take the necessary steps to eliminate it where it exists and to prevent it in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to the penalties provided for not keeping up to required standards it might be difficult to operate the Bill.  For instance, there could be more than one industry on a river bank and it could be very difficult to decide which industry was causing pollution.  There is also the question <Col N="110" /> of differentiating between a big waterway and a small one.  Naturally, if there is effluent from a factory into a small waterway there will be a higher standard of pollution than if it were going into a great waterway like the Shannon.  I can see difficulties with regard to enforcing the Bill and imposing the penalties contained in it.  We are assured by the Minister for Local Government and his Department that they are more conscious than anybody of the dangers and I have no doubt that the Minister intends to bring in the necessary measures in due course to eliminate existing pollution and to prevent any further pollution.  We owe this to ourselves but we owe it especially to future generations.  Future generations will judge us by what we do now.  We are duty bound to preserve our environment for posterity and to hand it over as we received it from previous generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is vital, in enacting legislation like this, if it is not to be in the realm of pious platitudes, that there should be an adequate staff and adequate mechanism for the enforcement of the standards which are being set.  I believe there is within the Department of Local Government the wrong order of priorities. This is demonstrated most effectively by the fact that the number of staff in the sanitary services section of the Department is quite inadequate to deal with the very great responsibilities with which they are charged.  They are charged not only with responsibility in regard to pollution but also with responsibility in regard to fire damage. We have one of the worst fire damage records in the whole of the civilised world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are also charged with responsibility for the ordinary question of providing water supplies and sewage facilities.  If we compare the number of staff in that section with these very wide responsibilities with the number of staff in the roads section, and we already have probably more square feet of road per head of population than any country in Europe, we find that there are many more staff in the roads section in an area where there is not as great a need for action as in <Col N="111" /> this section where there is a tremendous need for action.  I cannot find the figures but I think there are about 160 people in the roads section as against 30 or 40 in the sanitary services section.  If there is such an inadequate staff in this section and we are prepared to devote such resources to a section like the roads section, there will not be the staff to ensure that this legislation will be enforced.  If this Bill goes through, I want to ensure that it will be enforced rigorously.</P>
    <P>It is very important also that we recognise that rates of pollution will vary at different times of the day and, indeed, at different times of the year. It is important that the test be taken at the time of highest pollution.  It is possible to get favourable figures of rates of pollution at particular points in rivers by taking the test at a time of day when it is not likely that there will be heavy discharges, in view of the low level of industrial or domestic activity at that particular time.  This factor should be borne in mind.  It should be a requirement that the test be taken at the time when pollution is likely to be at its highest because that is the time when the damage is done.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that at various times of the year there are high and low levels of pollution.  I understand that there is the lowest volume of water in rivers in the months of February and August.  It is very important, therefore, that tests should be carried out in those months when the volume of water is low because damage which takes place at that time will affect fish life.  If fish are killed by pollution in February, there will be no fish available in March, April and May.  If tests were carried out in March, April or May they might show that the level of pollution was not very severe.  The damage would have been done in February, when the water level was low.</P>
    <P>Agricultural practice should be guided by considerations of water pollution levels.  I am informed that nitrogenous fertiliser will dissolve only at a certain high temperature.  I do not speak with any first-hand knowledge of this matter but I am informed that <Col N="112" /> if nitrogen is spread in cold winter weather it will not dissolve within a short time and will be washed away into a river.  The low temperature renders plants unable to absorb the nitrogen. If a farmer uses nitrogen he should spread it at a time of the year when the temperature is sufficiently high to enable it to be dissolved.  Undissolved nitrogen washed into a river becomes a source of pollution.  If, as I am informed, this is the case, this information should be made available on a much wider scale than at present.</P>
    <P>When standards are being established it is important that they should be realistic and modern.  Standards were established in 1913 for water quality.  It is fair to say that the type of pollution which occurred in 1913 was quite different from the type of pollution occurring at the present time. In 1913, the pollution was organic, self-destructive, caused by natural products. The pollutants worked themselves out of the system.  Much of the pollution occurring at the present time derives from artificial products which are not self-destructive; they are persistent and if they get into a river they will remain there indefinitely.  The standards to be enforced when this Bill is passed should not be based on the standards adopted by the Royal Commission in 1913.  There must be new standards which will take account of the types of chemical pollutants now entering rivers.</P>
    <P>Figures have been made available to me relating to the level of responsibility of various agencies for pollution of rivers.  I am reliably informed that local authorities are responsible for 65 per cent of the pollution occurring in rivers at the present time; that 15 per cent relates to creameries, 10 per cent to farmers and the other agencies are not classified.  If it is true that public authorities are responsible for 65 per cent of the pollution, these are the bodies to whom the Minister should direct his attention in the first place when this Bill becomes law.  It is obvious that the main cause of this pollution is the inadequacy of the sewage treatment works being operated by local authorities.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I asked the Minister <Col N="113" /> for Local Government in this House if he would give me a breakdown of the sewage facilities available in the country and if he would indicate the areas which had primary sewage treatment, secondary sewage treatment and tertiary sewage treatment, these various levels of treatment indicating the level of pollution of the water discharged ultimately into rivers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And which areas had none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The Minister was not able to give me the information I asked for.  It was obvious that the Minister had not got the information in his Department.  Otherwise, presumably, he would have made it available to me.  To ask a man to deal with the problem of water pollution without this basic information as to the sewage discharge into rivers is asking the impossible. This information is a necessary tool in the performance of this task.  The Minister, however, is himself responsible for the fact that he has not this essential information.</P>
      <P>I have been told recently&mdash;again I have not first-hand knowledge&mdash;that the urban council in Monaghan have a very modern sewage disposal works but are unable to maintain them because of lack of finance, which is to some degree the responsibility of the Department of Local Government.  I would be glad if this matter were investigated.  If there has been capital expenditure on the establishment of these works, it is bad economics as well as bad environmentalism not to provide the necessary finance for maintenance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only should standards be established but there should be an ongoing, continuous survey carried out to discover the level of pollution in rivers at various points and, as I said earlier, the tests should be made at times when pollution is likely to be highest so that the findings may be realistic.  The results of the survey should be published nationally so that manufacturers and the IDA will be aware of them and will be able to consider the pollution factor in their policy for the location of industry.  In the absence of this information it could happen that <Col N="114" /> they would encourage the location of industries in areas where there was already an intolerable level of pollution. Because they do not have the necessary scientific data, it is possible they will do this and it is very important that this information would be available in published form throughout the year throughout the country.  It should be available to the IDA and to individual industrialists.</P>
    <P>Very often at certain times of the year industrialists may have to discharge an item which could cause heavy pollution if it were discharged at the wrong time.  Such industrialists may have no other way of disposing of it.  It is therefore important that they should be able to dispose of it at a time of the year when it will do the least harm.  Because of river levels and so forth, they are unlikely to know the best time and it is therefore clearly important that they be given this information.</P>
    <P>To ensure that this is done it seems to me to be necessary to establish an interdepartmental committee to oversee the entire question of water pollution. It is important also that there be co-ordination between the various authorities who are directly or indirectly concerned.  An Foras Forbartha are responsible from the point of view of research; the Department of Local Government are responsible because the Minister is responsible for sewage and water schemes; so are the Department of Health from the point of view of the effects on health of pollution; the Board of Works are responsible in so far as they are concerned with arterial drainage; the Inland Fisheries Trust are responsible in so far as they are concerned with fresh water fishing; the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries are concerned in so far as they are responsible for maritime fishing&mdash;mussels and other shell fish are affected by polluted river mouths.  That Department are also concerned with agricultural policy.  The Department of Industry and Commerce are concerned because they may have inadequate policies in regard to industrial discharges.</P>
    <P>Therefore, if we are to have a rational policy in regard to water pollution <Col N="115" /> we must have co-ordinating activity in respect of all these bodies. It is therefore a sensible suggestion to say that an interdepartmental committee or, alternatively, a commission be set up and given enforcement powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The final point I should like to make it that it is important that refuse disposal should be considered in regard to river pollution. Refuse should be the subject of proper collection services which would dispose of it in places not likely to cause pollution. Supervised dumping should be available to people, in particular at weekends, and officers of the various corporations and county councils should be available at the dumps to supervise dumping.  It is only fair to say if you have dumping facilities available to people during the week at times when most of them are at work they will not be able to avail of them.  It is very important that dumping facilities should be provided at weekends as otherwise people will be tempted to throw their refuse into rivers or some other places where pollution can occur.  It is very important that there should be an adequate refuse collection service in rural areas.  I know it is rather difficult to provide this in some places but there should be established collection points in rural areas where people can leave their refuse in well secured packages so they can be collected at a specified time each week by the scavenging service when it is on its rounds.  All county councils should be encouraged to provide such facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> It is very important that there should be an adequate method of prosecuting people dumping refuse in rural areas. I understand at the moment that the county councils must themselves prosecute by means of a private prosecution and that they must get one of their officers into the court.  He must act in what is called in legal terminology as a common informer in order to bring the person responsible to book. This is quite inadequate.  Those officials are not anxious to do this.  They are not policemen.  They are not trained as such and they are not concerned in this way with law enforcement. They are there to do a different job and it is asking them to do too much to act as law enforcement agents as far as dumping is concerned.  Dumping should be made an ordinary common law offence for which prosecutions could be initiated by the Garda. In places like Dublin, where we have heavy population and where there is a large amount of refuse, consideration should be given to retrieving from it materials which may be of value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This does not arise on this Bill, which deals with water preservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A very heavy accumulation of refuse, even in well controlled dumps, can be a problem.  There may be a difficulty in providing an adequate number of these dumps.  If that is the case there may be dumping in private places which would lead to water pollution.  It is very important that we try to decrease the volume of material which is in these dumps by retrieving any valuable materials. Ground glass which has been retrieved from some dumps in the US has been used for paving roads.  In many other cases valuable materials have been retrieved by the use of various forms of equipment, which are now being developed in the US.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that this be done because it would minimise the volume of potentially polluting refuse in dumps throughout the country.  The initial capital outlay involved in such equipment is expensive but it would be worth while in an area like Dublin, where there is a large volume of refuse. <Col N="119" /> The world is gradually using up its resources of certain substances and we should try to use again various substances which are dumped.  If we do not try to do this we may find that we will gradually run down our resources of such substances.  Consideration should be given to the establishment of such methods of retrieving valuable materials from refuse dumps. It will not mean very much if we pass legislation like this unless there is adequate staff available to enforce the law as it stands and to publish adequate and detailed scientific information to ensure that a rational policy is adopted in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Some time ago we discussed the general problem of pollution.  The menace of that problem was appreciated here.  At the time some Deputies said that a theoretical approach to such a problem as this was not sufficient, that positive action was necessary and that there was a danger in dealing with a problem like this of indulging in what I called on that occasion &ldquo;window-dressing legislation&rdquo;, that is, paper provision for what one would like to see without adequate arrangements for enforcement or for the practical application of measures to cope with the problem in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with the more specific problem in this Bill of water pollution.  I should like to make a suggestion which is in line with what the Minister has been doing already. A Parliamentary Committee should be set up to consider this problem, to keep it under continuing review, to help in advising on legislation and to sit particularly as a committee on whatever legislation is proposed.  This would be a useful complement to what has already been done within the Department.  This matter has already been receiving serious study within the Department where a committee has been considering this subject.  That is a very good thing but a stage comes when such committees need their counterpart in the political machine, that is, in Parliament, and where eventually we will have to consider any legislation emanating from the <Col N="120" /> work of the departmental group or committees.  That is the first reason I am making this suggestion.</P>
    <P>The second and more fundamental reason is that here we are in company with perhaps every other developed country in the world facing a problem which is becoming more and more apparent and one which will develop in future years.  This is not something that will pass in a day; it is not something that we can deal with completely within our own boundaries.  This is a problem which we will share in the future with the whole of humanity.  It is not a problem that we can settle ourselves, we will only have control over part of the problem.</P>
    <P>Because of this wider and more dangerous aspect I should like to suggest that this House should consider setting up a Parliamentary Committee on a permanent basis, a committee which can function as a select or special committee to deal with relevant legislation regarding the problem of pollution as it affects us at present and as it will affect us in the future.  The problem of pollution is one we cannot escape, any more than people elsewhere. However, although a departmental committee would be useful, we must keep in mind the necessity for practically and effective action in dealing with pollution.  Talking about it is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett made the point that we are relatively fortunate in that our country has not suffered from the problem of pollution to a great extent as yet.  Perhaps this is some compensation for the lack of development from which we suffered during the 19th century, but whatever its origin or cause, we must be thankful that today we have a problem that is less acute than that facing other European countries. Although we are in an area of the globe in which pollution has been very marked we have adequate supplies of pure water and we should not lose sight of this fact.  We should be thankful for this, but more important than that we should be determined to keep this advantage.</P>
    <P>In this debate we are primarily concerned with water pollution but we <Col N="121" /> must realise that this is inseparable from atmospheric pollution, land pollution and so on.  One of the more important aspects is the pollution of the oceans and it is important to realise that we cannot confine ourselves merely to discussing water pollution in this debate.  For instance, tied up with this matter is the question of oxygen for humanity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett and other speakers mentioned that we have been very fortunate in having an adequate rainfall; in fact, we have an excess of pure water.  For this reason we do not realise that other countries are short of fresh water&mdash;the more industrialised countries and centres of concentrated population are short of this commodity. The fact that we have more than an adequate supply of water may make us complacent but that situation can change and, so far as our rivers and lakes are concerned, it has changed already.</P>
    <P>I was distressed to hear two speakers &mdash;one on either side of the House&mdash; speaking about the pollution of lakes because I know that they are speaking from their own factual information on this matter.  Deputy Esmonde and Deputy Carter both gave instances of alarming pollution of our lakes&mdash;the lakes which we thought were good clean fishing waters.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy if pollution has reached the stage where fish are killed but if that were all the damage likely to result one might not be so alarmed.  We must realise that if pollution has got to that stage it is another alarming symptom of the threat to nature and man's existence on this planet.  It is obvious that many of our rivers are becoming dirty and the dangerous symptom shows itself when life in the rivers is killed.  We discussed this matter before and I shall not delay the House with an analysis of it.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the extremely polluted state of the lower reaches of the river Liffey.  It is polluted in every way, not least by the discharge of untreated sewage and waste.  It does not stop there.  Even the rain is polluted in city areas, as I mentioned previously. Anyone who sees the smog ceiling that is developing already over the city of <Col N="122" /> Dublin will have no difficulty in realising that the rain which falls is contaminated and putting that contamination into the ground and into the waters. That contamination is not insignificant, as I pointed out on the last occasion. We can be thankful that we have had rain.  The atmosphere over this city is cleaner today because of the rain we have had recently.  If the atmosphere has been washed to some extent, what has been washed out of it has been washed into the rivers and streams and waterways to add to the pollution of the waters.</P>
    <P>Ultimately all life in the waters will be killed if pollution is not arrested or counteracted.  It is because of that that I am joining with the other side of the House in this debate in advocating that steps should be taken to deal with pollution.  I appreciate the gesture made in bringing in this Bill.  It is right that it should be brought before this House. The Deputy opposite has done the right thing in bringing it before us, but a matter of this magnitude cannot be handled by a Private Member's Bill. The whole resources of the Government and the State are required to deal with it.  That is another reason why a committee such as the one I suggested might be invoked.</P>
    <P>Coming back to the pollution of the waters, people talk about the nuisance of pollution and the killing of fish. These are two very important points but, from a fundamental point of view, they can be regarded merely as symptoms of something much more deadly.  I suppose humanity could live without fish such as those which live in river waters.  I suppose humanity could survive without affording facilities to sportsmen to fish, and I suppose we could survive the inconvenience of bad smells and ugly sights, but let us remember that, objectionable as these things are, they are only symptoms of something worse.  There is here a real threat to humanity.  One of the difficulties in dealing with it in a local way is that our contribution to this great problem can only be in proportion to our own area, and our own size which is relatively small in relation to the totality of human existence on this globe.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, we will have to play <Col N="123" /> our part with others for the survival of man here on this planet.  It is highly desirable that we should play our part quickly to maintain the biological advantages which we still possess in this country through the relatively clean environment we have compared with other places.  When one talks like this one runs the risk of being accused of being an alarmist and of saying dramatic things which have no real significance.  The optimist will say: &ldquo;Somehow or other we will get over it.&rdquo;  That will prove to be a false comfort for humanity as a whole in dealing with this problem.</P>
    <P>The waters of the world are an essential part of nature's balance and nature's equilibrium.  We human beings are animals living within nature's system symbiotic with all the other species, all the bacteria, plants and animals which make up the life of this planet and condition its environment. The waterways of the world, and particularly the oceans, are of fundamental importance in the life cycle for all nature and for humanity in particular.  We human beings like many other animals&mdash;all of them perhaps&mdash;are dependent on oxygen. Every one of us breathes a number of breaths of air every minute and without oxygen we would be dead in a matter of seconds.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person does not stop to think how oxygen is provided. There is a wonderful cycle in nature in which the seas and the green lands and the plants play a part.  The algae in the seas and the green of the plants are constantly regenerating the oxygen that is taken in by the animals in nature and destroyed or used up for the moment.  The oxygen is used up by us, put back into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and then the plants and the algae turn that carbon dioxide back into oxygen so that it is available to us again.  That is the cycle.</P>
    <P>A vital part of that cycle is the area of green or active plant matter: algae, forests, grassland and greenery generally available to the sun.  Through the sunlight works this wonderfull cycle of the process of nature for us and it enables animals to work the other <Col N="124" /> side, the using of the oxygen.  This very cycle is threatened by the pollution of the oceans.  The oceans contribute a significant part to the oxygen.  When one reflects that already mankind has destroyed very large tracts of forests and other green land, and is also in certain areas blotting out the sun with smog clouds, one can see that there is a danger here which, if allowed to continue, must inevitably lead to disaster for man as well as for other animals.</P>
    <P>Is that all theory?  It is certainly sound to say that if you destroy the oxygen-producing elements of nature you will destroy humanity as well as other forms of animal life.  Is the threat really there is the question to be asked.  Here one finds some very frightening statistics becoming available. The pessimism of certain marine biologists in this regard is, to say the least, really frightening.</P>

I am certain we agree on this. I should be very surprised to find one Deputy who does not agree that the problem is there.  But what are we going to do about it?  As Deputy Barrett on this side and Deputies opposite pointed out there is an urgency in this matter because we still have a good deal to say and contribute in this connection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Immediate action is required.  I was dealing with the question of whether or not it is only a theoretical danger.  When you analyse it, as I have done, there is a threat but it all hinges on how great or how serious is this pollution of the waterways in the world as a whole.  It is here that we must consider the views of the marine biologists some of whom are very pessimistic about it and maintain that before the end of this century <Col N="125" /> the oceans may be dead, a thoroughly frightening thought for those who realise what is involved.  If, for instance, the algae, the oxygen-producing entities in the ocean, were to be wiped out in that period we should be very near to a survival problem.  Quite apart from having no fish, you would have no life in the ocean and you would have a serious disbalance of nature problems.</P>
      <P>If nature gets out of balance a vicious circle is set up.  There is, without doubt, serious alarm over this already.  Somebody else mentioned that major rivers and lakes are no more than sewers, but they are now sewers at their capacity.  In a sense the oceans through all biological history were a sink, but one that could absorb, so to speak, the refuse and convert it and restore it.  Now, the danger is that they may become dead seas with nothing to give back and no further capacity to absorb or even be an effective sink.</P>
      <P>I have heard somebody describe the Rhine as the sewer of Europe.  In the case of the Thames, which was very bad, there is a ray of hope.  The British have been able, at very great expense, to do something to reverse the trend in that case and I understand that fish have again been found in the Thames in regions where they had disappeared.  That is a very wonderful and important achievement but it was done at tremendous cost that need not have been incurred if precautions had been taken in time.  There is a lesson there for us.  We already have the river Liffey&mdash;I do not know about the Lee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Immediate action is needed to keep clean whatever clean waters we have.  If we do that we are contributing our share in regard to the sea.  Our contribution in reducing world pollution of the oceans may be insignificant but by looking after our own waterways we are making <Col N="126" /> our proper contribution to the broader human problem.</P>

      <P>It goes further than local authority sewage and industrial waste.  I am sorry one has to see it this way.  A very serious element in all this has been the get-rich-quick policy in agriculture generally all over the world, putting in fertilisers, pesticides and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not mean it in that sense.  I am not talking about the agricultural community but about humanity as a whole.  Please do not misunderstand me.  But there is a problem all over the world for all humanity in farming techniques and the use of fertilisers and pesticides to boost production artificially, regardless of the disbalance involved.  This is an important aspect that must be watched and it is difficult to deal with.</P>
      <P>Pesticides, things designed to kill, have been one of the major pollutants of the ocean, one of the major causes of disbalance, even more than raw sewage which is relatively harmless compared to the chemical and lethal pollution of pesticides and certain artificial growth stimulants.  This will be a problem&mdash;to see that really lethal matter is prevented from getting into the water.</P>
      <P>Raw sewage is perhaps less objectionable than DDT, because sewage is the type of waste that nature provided for and which could be dealt with by normal biological processes. Man-made poisons are different: they kill the agents nature has to process the natural forms of pollution.  Much the same applies to plastics and petroleum products which are the really dangerous pollutants&mdash;oils, hydrocarbon compounds, inactive substances that form films and prevent the agents of nature from working.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> When I reported progress I had almost completed what I had to say about one aspect of the Department.  I was pointing out that there must be a reason for the lack of respect for authority and law disclosed in the Minister's speech and in the Garda Commissioner's report.  I was endeavouring to point out as clearly as I could that the responsibility for that state of affairs must rest fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government whose behaviour during the period covered by this report did very little to encourage respect for the law but which, on the contrary, had very damaging effects on it.  In certain respects and on certain occasions and for political reasons I believe the Government panicked.  An example of this was at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis when the Minister for Justice at the behest of the Taoiseach announced the proposal to resort to section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936.  We know that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice complained about certain cases in which district justices had refused informations in cases of persons charged with subversive activities.  I wonder whether the Taoiseach and the Minister were being fair to justices in all cases.  In respect of one case I know from those who were in court that the State solicitor did not even ask the justice to receive informations because there was not a scintilla of evidence in the book of evidence on which the <Col N="128" /> district justice could be justified in returning the person for trial.  Yet, that district justice was held up to ridicule by the Taoiseach and the Minister at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis and elsewhere. The fault lay in the investigation of these cases.  It lay in direction from the top as to how these cases should be investigated.  It is well known that officers of the Garda who are not free agents in these cases are supposed to act under remote control from the Minister for Justice.  In my opinion that handicaps the investigation of the cases and makes it difficult to procure evidence while it is still fresh and to present it.  These district justices are knocked on the knuckles.  I do not pretend to know all the cases involved but I know of one where the State solicitor did not ask that informations be received because it was obvious that there could not be evidence.</P>
      <P>There is a time and a place for everything and there is a way of doing everything.  I want to complain now about the Minister and the Taoiseach panicking at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis for political reasons.  Section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act has been on the Statute Book since 1936.  It is a section which enables the Attorney General to send forward for trial on indictment accused persons whom he thinks should have been returned for trial but it is a section that should be used with great discretion.  Certainly, it is a section that should be used in a way that would not prejudice the courts of justice.  In my opinion the speech made by the Minister for Justice at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis was contempt of court.  If a newspaper editor had written a leading article on the same lines, he would be up for contempt of court because in effect what the Minister was saying was that these district justices should have returned for trial identifiable persons, that they failed in their duty in not doing so, that he would see to it that they were sent forward for trial pursuant to section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, 1936, and he was implying that he was satisfied they should be convicted.  He made this speech in public to be read by jurors who would be invited later to try these persons on indictment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> Surely that was prejudging these cases.  It should not have been done in this way.  I am not saying for one moment that the Attorney General has not the right and, indeed, the obligation in certain cases to send forward people for trial under section 62 of the Courts of Justice Act, but it should not be done with a fanfare of trumpets and with an exhortation to everybody that justice had not been done but would be done.  That was never the intention of section 62 of that Act. That section was intended to be used in exceptional cases.  It is a section which if it was not to bring about a miscarriage of justice would have to be used without publicity.  It could be argued that if the defence did not make it known to the judge and jury who were trying the case that the person had been sent forward under section 62, the State certainly should not make it known.</P>
    <P>That, then, is an example of Government panic, of a lack of direction from the top and a lack of appreciation of what is at stake and the way it should be handled.  The happenings since May, 1970, happenings which were disclosed then but which had been simmering under the surface before then and which by various instalments since then, have done more to undermine confidence in the Government of this country and to undermine respect for law and order and for the administration of justice than anything that has happened since the foundation of the State.  Not until such time as the Taoiseach seeks a mandate from the people will any Government enjoy the respect that a Government should enjoy if they are to carry out their functions.  That is the only way that the damage can be undone.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the report of the Garda Síochana on crime. I have mentioned this already on a few occasions.  The last copy available to me is for the year ended September 30th, 1970.  I do not wish to go into the matter in detail except to say that it discloses an alarming state of affairs. In his brief the Minister stated that the number of indictable offences has increased from 25,972 in 1969 to 30,756 in 1970, an increase of 18 per cent. Detection has dropped from 61 per cent <Col N="130" /> in 1969 to 50 per cent in 1970.  In the Dublin Metropolitan District the detection rate is as low as 37 per cent.  That is an alarming state of affairs according to any standards.  It compares very unfavourably with the figures in Great Britain.  The Commissioner in his report does not analyse it.  He does not give any reasons for it.  He considers it the duty of the political head of his Department to give explanations.  It would be a good thing if the figures were analysed.</P>
    <P>Housebreaking and burglary increased from 3,992 in 1965 to 9,042 in 1970.  That is an appalling state of affairs.  Crimes of violence of one sort or another such as robberies with violence increased from 147 in 1969 to 215 in 1970.  All this has happened within the last few years.  It happened at a time when there was considerable unrest within the Garda Síochána for one reason or another.  It coincided with the introduction of nominal overtime payments to members of the Garda Síochána.  It is felt that the Minister and those in charge of the purse were really more interested in seeing that overtime was not earned than in having criminal offences properly investigated. This report proves two things to my satisfaction.  It proves that Dublin is a city where serious crimes of violence, offences against the person and violence to people's homes are on the increase to a considerable extent and also that Dublin is a city that is grossly underpoliced.  We have to tackle this problem.  The Minister must tackle it.  The citizens of Dublin will demand that their persons and their property be given adequate protection. I am glad to know that the Minister has strengthened the Garda force under the Bill which came before us. This is absolutely necessary.  It is doubtful whether the proposals introduced by the Minister are sufficient to ensure that Dublin is properly policed. There is no substitute for a garda on the beat, or for constant vigilance.</P>
    <P>When we last discussed this Estimate in this House we were told that there are parts of huge housing estates in this city which had only a patrol.  A patrol operates on eight-hour shifts, three shifts a day.  Parts of this city had only the attention of a garda on <Col N="131" /> patrol once in a while.  I want to call on the Minister to see that crime is prevented in Dublin and throughout the country.  It is not fair to the law-abiding citizens or to the potential criminal if the potential criminal feels that the city is inadequately policed and that his criminal activities are likely to go undetected.  He will be encouraged to pursue them.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of joining with the Minister in complimenting the Garda Síochána on the job they are doing, on the duties they are carrying on and have carried on. These duties were never intended for an unarmed police force.  They have been called upon during this time to guard the banks of this country against armed attacks.  They have been called upon to do Border duty under difficult circumstances.  Deputy Fox was blamed here for raising the matter of protective appliances, such as gas masks, and proper clothing.  If the Garda are to be asked to continue in this line of duty these things will have to be provided for.</P>
    <P>The burning of the British Embassy was an indication of how ill-equipped the Garda are to deal with the emergency which presented itself that day.  They had no helmets or crash barriers.  We are not doing our duty unless we anticipate such incidents.  We certainly had every right here to anticipate such an incident in the situation which has existed over the last few years.  I spoke for a long time on the Bill to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána and in dealing with the force in general.  I dealt with the rights of the force and I do not intend to go back over it all now.  I would be guilty of unnecessary duplication.  I am glad that the Minister has done something to remedy in some respects complaints which I put forward on behalf of the force at that time.  Overtime was a source of continual irritation.  A person who was entitled to overtime did not know whether he was going to be paid for three months.  He could be offered time off within three months and then he did not qualify for overtime payment. I am glad that the period has been reduced from three months to one month, and that the rest days have <Col N="132" /> been increased from seven days in 28 to eight days in 28.  That is a move in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I understand that another source of irritation in the force is housing.  There are many young men in the force, and nowadays more of them are getting married young.  Housing is a problem. The other day I came across the sale of a plot of land that had originally been bought as a site for a Garda house. Admittedly it was in a small town, but it is not being used for that purpose; it has been sold.  If there are young members of the force with domestic problems because they are not properly housed or because they are inadequately housed, the Minister cannot expect the best from them.</P>
    <P>There should be more flexibility in regard to transfers of gardaí.  The Minister should avail of this opportunity, the opportunity of an influx into the force now of some hundreds of young men, to grant transfers to men who are not happy where they are, for one reason or another, and who have applied for transfers.  This may have presented problems in the past but if it has it can now be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I wish to join with the Minister in deploring any effort made to encourage gardaí to be disloyal to the force or to refuse to carry out their duties.  That has appeared for the first time in the last few days.  I do not believe this appeal will succeed but it is significant that it was made in a part of the country, the south, where there has been unrest within the force.  For some time past there has been unrest; meetings have been held in various places. This, to me, suggests the necessity for preserving a contented force.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the situation of the Department of Justice and of law and order in the context of this island as a whole.  It is up to the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government, by leadership and example, so as to avoid jackboot methods, to demonstrate to the people that substantial progress has been made in Northern Ireland in the form of the Heath initiatives.  Ordinarily this might not be relevant to this debate, but there is bound to be an overspill from that in here.  I want to re-echo the words of <Col N="133" /> Mr. Gerry Fitt, MP, who said he never thought he would live to see the day when a Tory Government would go as far as they have in righting wrongs and bringing the people of Northern Ireland, Catholic and Protestant, together so that they can ultimately find a solution to the Northern Ireland problem which has blistered the country for 50 years.  Irrespective of what other people say, I think it vindicates once and for all the words of Michael Collins, the 50th anniversary of whose death we are commemorating this year, that the Treaty was a stepping stone towards the ultimate freedom of this country.  All of us here who have been elected as leaders and who represent public opinion should plead that these initiatives be given a chance and that nothing be done either in Northern Ireland or in the Republic of Ireland that would prevent them getting a reasonable opportunity to work and come to fruition.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the jurisdiction of the High Court and to proposals he has in regard to the Master of the High Court.  We received a one-or two-section Bill recently which is to be introduced in the Seanad and which proposes to give authority to the Minister to continue the appointment of a temporary master for more than three months.  I do not know what the Minister has in mind, but I hope that instead of taking away the powers of the Master of the High Court, he will do something to extend those powers. While I have nothing against civil servants, I sincerely hope that the proposals to hand over the jurisdiction of the Master of the High Court to the Taxing Master, or any similar proposal, will be forgotten.  We have an opportunity here for bringing in a worthwhile reform.  Instead of abolishing the position of Master of the High Court we should enlarge the jurisdiction of the office and perhaps appoint two masters and entrust them with some pre-trial duties, so as to reduce the time involved in hearing actions in the High Court.  They could be entrusted with the duty of agreeing maps, agreeing medical or other professional evidence in respect of which there is usually not much difference of opinion, <Col N="134" /> and in that way reduce the expensive trials in the High Court, reduce the inconvenience of bringing witnesses form all over the country.  That is what I recommend to the Minister instead of abolishing or downgrading this office.  It is an office that has been there for a long time but it is an office that has not been worked to the fullest extent or availed of to do the work that it could have done.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with law reform. I think the Minister and his Department are a bit behind with law reform. His predecessor introduced a Landlord and Tenant Bill in 1970 and it has not got a Second Reading yet. The explanation given for that is that it needs tidying up and sections need to be redrafted and looked at again but it is long overdue.  There has been nothing worthwhile done in respect of law reform in the last couple of years.  Admittedly, the increase in the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court and District Court was worthwhile but it did not take any great imagination to do that.  The Minister spoke here about a lot of rules that he had sanctioned and approved of by various rules-making committees but he did not yet approve of rules to implement the increase in the jurisdiction of either the District Court or the Circuit Court. I would appeal to him to do that immediately.  There is at least one set of those rules before him for some considerable time.  I do not know offhand whether it is the draft rules of the Circuit Court or the draft rules of the District Court but there is one of them before him.  I understand it has been cleared by the rules-making committee and that the Minister was waiting until he got the other one.</P>
    <P>For some time past the relationship between the Minister's Department and the professional bodies representing the legal profession has not been what it should be.  That is a pity because if we are to streamline the administration of justice at working level, that is through the courts, we can only do it if we have come and go between the Minister, on the one hand, the Benchers of Kings Inns on the other and the Incorporated Law Society. You will not get the desired net result if you are to have the Minister and <Col N="135" /> the Department proceeding on the basis that &ldquo;We are the boss and what we say must go&rdquo; and resenting approaches, resenting consultation.  I believe that if the Minister is prepared to consult, prepared to sit down and talk on a man to man basis and if necessary without any prior conditions he will get a good reception, he will get proper consultation from the Incorporated Law Society and the representatives of the Bar.  For some reason or another civil servants are not too well disposed towards the legal profession.  They regard them as potential invaders of their rights.  I think that we will only get an efficient modern machine to serve the citizens of the country if there is a good relationship between the Minister for Justice, whoever he is, and the bodies about which I have been speaking. I am asking the Minister to think about that.  I am afraid he has got off on the wrong foot, but I am asking him to think about it again.  He is flexible enough, I am sure, to be able to do that.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at some length with the Adoption Board.  At the end of his brief he took the opportunity of thanking sincerely all the voluntary bodies and commissions and, I am sure, persons who have rendered valuable service during the last couple of years.  If I were to deal in detail with the Adoption Board I could go on for a very long time and I do not propose to do that.  I believe that when a board is set up and a number of citizens are asked to serve on it, selected by the Minister or appointed by one interest or another, these people should be treated seriously and they should have the respect of the Minister and the Minister's Department and their views should be respected.  That has not been the case in respect of the Adoption Board.  I regret to have so say that bureaucracy has been seen at its worst on the Adoption Board.  We have a chairman, who is a district justice, and we have a registrar.  As far as I see, over the last number of years the registrar has regarded himself as the Adoption Board and regarded his duties there as the implementation of Departmental policy on the board.  He <Col N="136" /> has treated the lay and voluntary members of that board in a disgraceful way.  The fourth board was appointed by the Government in January, 1968. It consisted of the chairman and six other people, people who had an interest in adoption, people who had an interest in serving their fellow citizens on a voluntary basis, people who had given good service in other voluntary spheres.  Yet we find that on 11th November, 1970, three of those members resigned because they were being bullied about and ignored by the registrar and to some extent by the chairman.  The registrar considered that only himself and the chairman counted and that the other members of the board had no say. That is a deplorable state of affairs. The Minister knows that letters passed between members of the board and his predecessor and between the members of the board and himself and all these people wanted was to be taken seriously, given some say in decisions that were being made and that recommendations they made about amendments in the adoption laws would be given a hearing.  They became so frustrated that after a short time they resigned.  They were appointed in January, 1968, and they resigned in November, 1970, and it is very significant that when the board's annual report for the year ended 31st December, 1970, was published and presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas for the first time, the format of the report was changed.  In that critical year the format would appear to have been designed deliberately to omit the names of the three members who resigned on 11th November, having served for 11 months of the year under review.  Their names were never mentioned in the report presented for 31st December, 1970.  On the information before me that was in keeping with the way these three voluntary members were treated during their time on that board.  Roughly their complaints were that the registrar and chairman ran the board without reference to the members.  The chairman and the registrar compiled adoption standards without reference to the ordinary members of the board.  Would it not <Col N="137" /> have been a good thing to have consulted with them and to have taken them into their confidence?  The registrar on one occasion left the hearing of a case and telephoned the Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I appreciate the Minister's point, but I cannot see how I can get around it.  I can blame the Minister.  I can deal with it by saying that the Minister ran the board in such a way that he, as Minister, permitted himself to be communicated with and interfered in the running of the board through his officers.  I believe there should be no communication between the Adoption Board when it is hearing a case and the Department of Justice.  There has been at least one instance in which the Department of Justice was consulted during the hearing of a case and that leads me to believe that the board was not permitted to have that independence to which it was entitled and was being run by the Minister.  Now if the Minister wants to take responsibility for that, I admire him for doing so. He is responsible for the actions of those under him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is anything but a happy relationship on the board.  It was running anything but smoothly.  In the period to which I refer, 1968 to 1970, the Minister should have called for the resignation of the members of the board if he thought they were not behaving properly.  The fact that he did not call for their resignations suggests to me that he had no reason to believe they were not behaving properly, but he permitted his executives to remain there and let this unhappy state of affairs continue.  I could read the correspondence. I know the Minister has it.  I know the Taoiseach was consulted, so indignant were these voluntary members about the way they were treated on the board.  Having been unable to get any satisfaction from the Minister, the Minister's predecessor or <Col N="138" /> the Taoiseach, they were so frustrated they were forced to resign in January, 1970, and the report dealing with that year did not think it worthwhile to mention that they were ever members of the board or that they had resigned.</P>
    <P>If I were to speak here for the next two hours and spell out every word of every letter about this matter, nothing could more clearly demonstrate the unsatisfactory way in which these three men were dealt with.  If their resignation from the board does nothing more than bring home to the Minister their sense of frustration and the necessity for ensuring that there is in future a proper relationship between the Minister, on the one hand, and the chairman and the registrar, on the other, with the ordinary members of the board, then it will have done a good day's work.  It is no use running a voluntary adoption board on the basis of a county council: something that is a managerial function and you keep out of it; you are entitled to deal only with reserved functions.</P>
    <P>I would recommend to the Minister that he should appoint a departmental chairman on this board.  I understand that when the chairman is not present the board cannot function; it can have informal meetings but it cannot come to any decisions.  I will not deal with the necessity for reforming the Adoption Acts because, if I were to advocate legislation, I would be told by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that I am out of order.  I mention that lest it might be construed that I have not availed of this opportunity to demand amendments of the adoption laws, amendments which are long overdue and which, I hope, the Minister will introduce at some stage.  I have dealt with this matter at some considerable length, as the Minister said, because I know how strongly those concerned feel about it.  It was a unanimous decision of the board that no one should go on television.  Yet, the chairman was sent on television against the wishes of the members of the board.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> That is why I am half sorry for the Minister because there are certain things over which he had no control. The board decided they should not go on television.  There was some controversy about a child down in Waterford and the chairman was sent on television by the Minister's predecessor against the wishes of the members of the board.  I will say no more about it.  I have said enough.  Maybe the Minister thinks I have said too much.  Let us treat voluntary members of boards better.  Let us treat those who offer their services voluntarily better.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister proposes to deal with prison reform.  I hope prisons will not long be necessary to accommodate people but, so long as they are necessary, I hope they will be made more humane.  I am glad to see that the living quarters of prison officers will be transferred outside the prison walls.  It must have been a pretty grim existence for prison officers to have to spend their working life and their spare time within prison walls.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has acquired Loughan House, Blacklion. It is not many miles from Blacklion &mdash;perhaps one and a half.  It does not matter whether we call it Blacklion or Loughan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the question of mentally disturbed children and said that he and the Tánaiste had a common interest in this.  If I had been given the right to make a decision as to whether Loughan House should have been purchased as a place of detention for adolescents or as a home for mentally retarded children I would have had no hesitation and no difficulty in deciding that it should have been acquired for mentally retarded children.  There may have been difficulty in finding nursing staff but there been acquired for mentally retarded children.  There may have been difficulty in finding nursing staff but there is a waiting list of up to eight years of children who are mentally retarded, whose parents cannot handle them and who need to be placed.  There should be a crash programme for that purpose. I am glad to hear that the Minister for Justice and the Tánaiste have a common interest in this matter.  I <Col N="140" /> hope they will get together on it and will introduce a crash programme that will put an end to the waiting list.</P>
    <P>The Minister has dealt with law reform and with the reform that he has brought about and that he intends to bring about by granting a right of audience to solicitors in all courts. That is a good move and will help towards one profession, which I believe will come, but it will come gradually. It will be a long term process. I complained here about solicitors not being allowed to conduct proceedings in the metropolitan district court.  I ascertained that £17,000 in fees to barristers had been paid for a period in the District Court.  The Minister, quite correctly, told me that he was not responsible for the instruction of barristers in the District Court and I accept that, but he has a remedy; he is responsible for the staffing of the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> On that point, I shall not trespass on your patience or get out of order. If we are to unite the two professions, we will do it by gradually projecting the solicitors' profession into the courts.  Whoever is responsible for the present policy of conducting prosecutions in the District Court in Dublin is doing violence to the Minister's <Col N="141" /> efforts to grant a right of audience to solicitors in all courts, with the apparent intention of encouraging them to practise there.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked about fees orders.  He mentioned several times that certain fees under the courts had been increased and certain others had been reduced.  He went out of his way to say that he had not increased probate fees.  Perhaps when he is replying he will tell us when probate fees were last increased and by how many hundred per cent and what they are now. He could not have the neck to increase them any further because they are absolutely staggering at the moment.  In the last few years they have been increased by hundreds per cent.  There was a time when old people said that the &ldquo;cess&rdquo;, as they called it, would be worse than the rent, in other words, that the rates would be worse than the rent.  I can say now that the probate fees are worse than estate duty.  They are much more than they were a few years ago. The present probate fees are much more than the estate duty in small cases was a few years ago.  They should be reduced.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is a need for legislation to deal with the Registry of Deeds.  There are some things there that are not absolutely regular, the parchment, and that.  I do not want the Minister to go back to parchment but legislation is necessary to tidy up matters and make it completely legal and I hope that will be done.</P>
      <P>The Minister concluded by saying a few words about the Office of the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  That office runs very smoothly.  The legislation that was brought in, the Charities Act, 1963 &mdash;or whenever it was&mdash;is working very well and is being used to appoint trustees of charities all over the country where otherwise it would be very expensive to find a way of perfecting title in order to sell redundant parochial property.  That office is being run with a minimum of red tape and in a very humane way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see the Landlord and Tenant Act introduced soon and <Col N="142" /> I should like to see law reform proceeded with as rapidly as possible.  I did not envy the Minister in dealing with the two years that have passed and, perhaps, that is one of the reasons he dealt at such length with prisons but I would not be discharging my duty if I did not point out that in my opinion the responsibility for the deplorable state of crime in the country, the lack of respect for law and order, rests fairly and squarely on the Government.</P>
    <P>In regard to legal education, I appeal to the Minister to co-operate with the Law Society and the professional bodies.  I believe that certain proposals were put to the Minister by the Incorporated Law Society in respect of legal education as far back as 1969 and they await implementation.  It is true to say that the Minister referred them to the King's Inns.  That should be dealt with now.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with free legal aid.  I would like the Minister to know that it is being worked by the solicitors' profession, not at a profit, but in many cases at a loss and as evidence of their co-operation with the Minister.</P>
    <P>I shall conclude on the note that nothing short of a mandate from the people will restore the Department of Justice to a position of respect which it can hold and should hold and which it has lost through the unfortunate and deplorable episodes which I dealt with in the early part of my speech.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Although many people were aware that crime in general, but particularly vandalism, has been on the increase, I am sure the public at large will be very perturbed by the figures given by the Minister this evening in relation to the sharp increase in the crime rate and the apparent failure of the detection system to keep pace with it, although our prisons are bursting at the seams.  As well, there is a backlog of cases in the courts, the justices and judges are overworked and extra judges and courts have to be provided.  This makes very sad reading and we, and in particular the Minister, must ask ourselves what is happening to create such a situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Particularly disturbing is the increase <Col N="143" /> in vandalism of one kind or another, the wanton damage being done to property and the injuries to persons in the pursuance of crimes of robbery. There is a need for very close examination if a solution is to be found.  The solution will not be in increasing the capacity of our jails or in opening new jails.</P>
    <P>In a Bill some weeks ago, the Minister provided for an increase in Garda numbers.  This was overdue because practically all of our major towns and cities, and many parts of the rural areas, were under-policed.  The provisions in that Bill will not be sufficient and I was surprised that the Minister, apart from mentioning these figures this evening, had not any proposals or suggestions to combat the increasing crime rate.  I looked very closely for some such suggestion or proposal but the only one I could see in his statement is that he intends to increase the capacity of our prisons and to provide extra accommodation for juvenile offenders, a very desirable step.</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I was puzzled by the Minister's reference to the need for some kind of changes in the law to deal with subversive organisations. We know the present Government have relied through the years on the Offences Against the State Act to solve all their problems in this respect. Because they now know it would be politically disastrous for them to introduce internment without trial, they are fishing around, as it were, and flying numerous kites to discover or to test public reaction to some in-between measure that would deal with their problems in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be sensitive on this point and particularly sensitive to criticism about importing from continental countries certain provisions in the law that would strengthen the procedure in this country and enable the Government to deal more effectively with what they call subversive organisations.  I do not think the Government should turn to examining the legal systems of various countries in Europe and elsewhere and picking aspects of law from each or any of them because I do not think you can <Col N="144" /> make a good comprehensive legal system simply by picking parts of the legal systems of other countries, parcelling them together and saying: &ldquo;This is the system that meets our requirements.&rdquo;  That is not a satisfactory way and it would be disastrous because each part of a legal system depends on another part and you cannot build a proper legal system on a mixum-gatherum of parts from various legal systems.</P>
    <P>We must here pose questions about the Minister seeming to blame the jury system.  This, of course, conveniently ignores the fact that practically all the judges appointed here are nominees of the present Government.  In that context one must ask oneself again if political judicial appointments are a good thing.  That is one aspect the Minister conveniently ignored in his statement.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Garda Síochána Bill some weeks ago I welcomed the provision to increase the number of gardaí and I urged that the facilities and equipment available to them should be improved.  I urged that the equipment should be made to keep pace with modern needs and that we should continue with this.  I notice with some satisfaction that this is being done to a great extent.  We cannot expect members of the Garda to do the job they have to do without proper equipment, proper radio equipment, reliable patrol cars and any other equipment they need effectively to carry out their duties.  No matter what training or education we get it will go west if we have not the equipment and the facilities on the beat and in the Garda stations for our Garda force.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Minister is at long last making some really definite and positive arrangements about the provision of Garda stations and housing for members of the Garda.  System built housing and system built stations are a good idea because it will enable these buildings to be provided quickly.  This means that, particularly in relation to housing, houses can be provided very quickly and at suitable centres.  There will be a great necessity for housing <Col N="145" /> accommodation in almost every area because of the influx of new gardaí. Poor housing accommodation or lack of housing accommodation puts strains and stresses particularly on a man with a family.  This impairs the ability of the person to perform his duties. We should pay tribute to all the Garda officers who have performed their duties so well, particularly those living and working in conditions which are far from ideal.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned law reform. I am not happy with the progress made in this regard.  Much of the past year was taken up by debate on the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Bill.  That time could have been used much more profitably on more progressive law reform.  The law reform in relation to children and young people needs to be reorganised.  At the moment we have the situation where offences committed by children are dealt with through a procedure enacted by the Minister for Justice but when a penalty is imposed the Department of Education take over. In some cases the Department of Health have a function in this matter. This is very unsatisfactory.  We should press on with law reform to provide for one Minister to be totally responsible for children and young people and not to have it as it is at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister appeared to be very relieved in pointing out to us that he had absolutely nothing to do with reformatory schools and other detention centres for young people.  He said that his Department had liaison with the Department of Education in these matters.  He seemed to be very relieved to be able to say that.  It is unfortunate that we should have this division of responsibility as regards young people. A new comprehensive Bill should be brought in to deal with this whole matter.  The responsibility for all aspects of child care should be transferred to one Department.</P>
    <P>We have other outdated things in this regard that need to be reformed quickly, such as revision of the present age for criminal responsibility.  At the moment this is 7 years but it should be changed to at least 14 years.  That is the average in western Europe. <Col N="146" /> Children should not be sentenced to places away from their families unless there is no other alternative.  I know the Minister is making provision for more places for the detention of young people but I feel that it is not a good thing to sentence them away from their families.  I believe there is a better and cheaper alternative.  It must cost about £10 a week to keep a young person in a reformatory school or other corrective training school.  That money could be far better spent on providing a part-time social worker to supervise the child while he is kept at home or kept at least within the family circle for a certain period after committing the offence.  A child should not be sent away from his own home.  It should only happen if there is no other course open to the court that would be beneficial to the child.  If the child must be sent away from his home environment he should not be sent to an institution but he should be sent to what might be described as a group home of boys and girls with house parents.  Of course, the staff in these homes who would cater for these children must be properly trained.</P>
    <P>The after-care of young offenders should be an essential measure after the period of detention.  The sentences in the children's court to detention in a reformatory are subject to a minimum of two years but this is wrong.  A committee are sitting on this problem at the moment and I assume they will make recommendations that at least will abolish some of the more objectionable parts of the treatment of young offenders.</P>
    <P>The Minister must take positive steps to provide free legal aid for those who require it.  Owing to the limitations imposed at the moment it does not help many people.  This also applies to the children's court.  It is important that everyone, no matter what his state in life is, should be able to take any matter to court and to appeal his case to a higher court if convicted in the District Court.  Lack of finance should not prevent people from doing this.</P>
    <P>The children's court should be obliged to ensure that each child appearing before it is legally represented. This would include those <Col N="147" /> children whose parents might have the means to provide legal assistance but who do not do so for any reason.  Disrict and Circuit Courts should be obliged to advise each accused person of his right to obtain free legal aid.  If the district justice refuses to grant legal aid&mdash;at the moment under present regulations his decision is final&mdash;he should be obliged to give his reasons for this refusal.</P>
    <P>We must spend much more money in providing free legal aid.  Until such time as that is done, it can be said with some degree of conviction that the law is not equal.  Some time ago a man was convicted on a very minor charge but, possibly because of the mood of the district justice on the day, he was disqualified from driving for six months.  The man was out of work at the time.  He lived in a rural area and in order to get a job it was necessary for him to have a car. Although he had not much money as he was unemployed, he was fined £15 in addition to disqualification from driving.  The disqualification from driving meant that even if he got a job, effectively he was prevented from taking up employment.  Thus, the sentence he received had serious consequences. The man could not appeal his case because he would require a certain amount of money to have counsel instructed for the Circuit Court hearing.</P>
    <P>A man in such a situation should get free legal aid because there was a case for an appeal to the Circuit Court, particularly on the severity of the sentence. The case I have mentioned was an instance of a man being kicked when he was down.</P>
    <P>The amount of money spent for free legal aid in the last few years has not been considerable; in particular, the amount spent in the children's court in Dublin has been small.  My information is that half of the money this House votes each year for free legal aid is not spent on such aid.  I have heard some criticism that people are not advised about their right to this aid and I must refer in particular to the children's court in Dublin Castle. I am told that the notice regarding this matter is hidden behind the door. A distinction should be drawn between <Col N="148" /> the right of young persons to this aid and adults who might require such aid. There should be a distinction made in the administration of the scheme for these different groups.</P>
    <P>Still dealing with children's courts &mdash;because this is important if we are to provide for the future; children will become adults some day&mdash;we must pay more attention to the procedure through which young offenders are put and the way they are treated both in court and afterwards.  This is most important.  Either of two things is happening.  We are putting a young offender on the road to crime and beginning to make a hardened criminal, or he is beginning to see the error of his ways and to realise that what he was doing was wrong.  He is beginning to make up his mind to lead his life within the laws of the country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, changes should be made in the set up, in the composition, the format and the procedure of courts dealing with young people.  For example, in the children's courts, a justice could sit with two lay assessors who were qualified in the field of child care.  Such a court would be regarded as a type of community court.  They have something like this in Scotland where they have brought their laws up to date in regard to young offenders and legal proceedings against children under 16 years of age.  Some of those aspects could be followed here.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere in the courtrooms should be less foreboding and more friendly.  It is wrong to try young offenders in the same type of environment as hardened criminals, with the same procedures, the same format. Young offenders must be catered for differently.  Charges against children should be in plain, simple language, a language which they can understand. When a justice or anybody else is advising children on their rights, he should speak in plain, simple language also.  If children are being charged with committing offences, it is important that they should not be corrupted by their appearance in court, that is, by mixing with adult offenders in courtrooms, or in cells, or in waiting rooms.  This is happening at present.  In many cases young <Col N="149" /> offenders are side by side with hardened criminals both in the court and in the precincts of the court. This should be avoided.  Steps should be taken to ensure that it does not happen.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat amazed to hear the Minister say that he is only now beginning to examine the implications for his Department of entry into the EEC, and that &ldquo;the Department is considering in conjunction with the Attorney General's Legal Committee what legal provisions will be required, in so far as the Department is concerned, to implement the Treaties, Community secondary legislation and the Rules of the European Court of Justice.&rdquo;  He went on to say: &ldquo;The provisions required are likely to include...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is amazing at this stage of the negotiations the Minister and his Department are still only vaguely thinking about what might happen to court procedure, to legislation generally, if and when we enter the Common Market.  The public should have been made fully aware by the Minister and by the Government of what the implications will be.  It is obvious from the Minister's statement today that he and his Department have yet to do their homework on the matter.  The Minister is still very vague about what position his Department will be in, if the people decide to accept membership of the Common Market.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at great length with prisons.  I am sure that most people will be amazed to learn that our prisons are fully occupied, that they are overcrowded, and that the Minister had to take the unprecedented step of getting the loan of a building from the Minister for Defence in order to accommodate the overflow.  I do not think the solution to the rising crime rate is the provision of more prison cells and prisons.  The solution must be found before people reach the stage of going to prison.  At the same time, there will always be people who will end up in prison and we must ensure that they are catered for properly and adequately.</P>
    <P>The complete lack of suitable accommodation <Col N="150" /> for young offenders has been criticised down through the years.  I am pleased to note that steps are being taken at the moment in that regard. I accept the Minister's statement that he is concerned with this problem and that he is doing what he can about it, and that with the purchase of the premises in County Cavan recently the situation will be improved.  The provision of a new women's prison is long overdue also.  The provision of proper staff accommodation should not have been put on the long finger for so long.</P>
    <P>The arrangement with the Minister for Health for medical examinations and visits by psychiatric doctors to prisons is very necessary and I hope will go hand-in-hand with the provision of better training and rehabilitation facilities and better accommodation in the prisons.  A number of people who went to prison, possibly for very good reasons, came out as nervous wrecks. Before they went in they had no need to see a psychiatrist but that was not the case when they were released and their health was impaired for the remainder of their lives.  This should be guarded against: prison was never intended to have that effect on any human being.  The medical treatment of prisoners is very important.  It is questionable whether offenders who are mentally disturbed should be detained in any place resembling a prison. Care should be taken to ensure that such offenders are not sent to prison and, if discovered later in prison, they should be sent where they can get treatment and be properly looked after.</P>
    <P>There are many other things in the Minister's statement with which one might deal but unfortunately the type of lighting we have here this evening prevents me from going into too much detail.  But there is one aspect of the Minister's Department to which I must refer before I sit down and it is this: last Friday I had occasion to telephone the Department of Justice to register a protest about the way I was being stopped by members of the Garda while engaged in my duties both as a public representative and a trade union official.  Last Friday I was stopped in Naas and questioned as to where I was going and what I was <Col N="151" /> doing.  No other car or vehicle was stopped; I was picked out.  This is not the first time this has happened to me over the last few months and, of course, it is in relation to a trade dispute which exists in Freshford, County Kilkenny.  It has been going on for the past 25 weeks.</P>
    <P>Over that period I have been perturbed by the use of the Garda in that dispute.  They are being used in a way that is totally one-sided; they are being used to ensure that a recommendation of the Labour Court will be defeated, that a worker's constitutional right of becoming a member of a trade union and of association with his fellow workers will be denied to him. That right has been denied by this particular employer and he has been able to call upon and receive all the Garda patrol cars and gardaí he wants every week.  To keep the facts right for the record, this dispute occurred last October when 15 people, one woman and 14 men, became members of a union.  A few weeks later they were locked out of their employment. At that time also, unfortunately, the local sergeant allowed himself to be used in a way that could only be described as intimidating those who were locked out.  He allowed himself to be used to stop and question people who did not pass the pickets.  On at least one occasion he took instructions from the employer in relation to stopping a man who did not pass the pickets because the van-driver in question was told by the employer that he was not to leave the town until the local sergeant had interviewed him.</P>
    <P>When an employer can tell this to a man&mdash;and the local sergeant, of course, duly stopped him and questioned him&mdash;it is a most disturbing situation.  But the most disturbing thing is the fact that each week lorries which came down from Northern Ireland were getting two squad cars on the full journey back over the Border from Freshford, a distance, I suppose, which is the best part of 200 miles.  It was not uncommon to see 12 squad cars and 20 gardaí, on average, being used to escort the consignment of horse meat from this factory.  This had been going on for over 20 weeks.  After I <Col N="152" /> raised the matter here, the Garda escorts were reduced to one car at any one time.  However, the provision of police escorts for these people are encouraging them to come here and act provocatively.  There are only 14 men and one girl involved.  They have acted within the law in spite of all the attempts to provoke them to act outside the law and in spite of all the false charges that have been made against them.  Not only are these escorts being provided freely for no apparent reason but the lorries that have been coming from the North during the past 20 weeks have not yet complied with the traffic laws of this country.  When I raised this aspect of the matter the Minister made light of it.  Later the Chair refused to accept questions I wished to put down on the grounds that they were repeats of previous questions.  As recently as two weeks ago one of these lorries came to this part of the country without having any number plate whatsoever. Last week it was noticed that one lorry had number plates but that the number shown on the front was different from that on the back.  This is going on all the time.</P>
    <P>In January last while travelling on the Ashbourne Road I was followed by a police patrol car and stopped. The manner of the operation could be likened to a James Bond film.  After the sergeant had gone through the formalities he informed me that one of the number plates on my vehicle was dirty.  A little later I saw the same man escorting two lorries, one of which had no number plate while the other had a number plate on its front that was covered in mud, mud that had been splashed on to it from underneath the mudguards of the Garda car. The driver of the lorry had scraped mud from the escort car to cover the number plate of his own vehicle.  The Garda concerned did not see that happen.  In spite of all this the Minister tells me that the law is being used impartially.  On another occasion when I was stopped by a garda&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the admission of the Minister and as we all know there <Col N="153" /> is much crime being committed in this country.  However, I have never been associated with any crime nor do I intend to be but from the way I am being watched one could not be blamed for getting the impression that I was one of the most wanted criminals in the country.  I do not know what stories the gardaí are being told about me.  I would be prepared to put the facts I have to any inquiry that the Minister may wish to hold.  On another occasion when I was stopped I asked a young garda the reason for having stopped me.  He replied that he had to be very careful because he was escorting a lorry load of explosives.  He believed that.  I do not know who had fooled him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is about time that this extravagent waste of public money was discontinued.  If these people from Northern Ireland cannot come here without guarantee of protection, they should not come at all.  Why do they look for such protection?  I suppose it is because they are aware of being engaged in a very dangerous and very provocative type of activity. The taxpayer should not have to foot the bill in this respect.  All that is required is that the employer in question honour the Labour Court recommendations and come to terms with the trade union.  At present members of the Garda are being used to help an employer to defeat a Labour Court recommendation.  Neither I nor the public in the area can understand how the law can be violated so blatently in this circumstance.  I was silenced when I attempted to raise the matter here but I take the opportunity of this debate to do so now.  The provision of these police escorts is giving the impression that the employer in question has the full support of the law.  I know that the Minister would not wish that to be the case.  Without realising it, certain members of the Garda are being used in a way they should not be used. This situation cannot continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of the Minister and members of the Garda who may not know me but who may have been told to watch me, I should like to repeat <Col N="154" /> that I have no criminal record.  I do not intend to do anything wrong.  The attitude of certain members of the Garda who stopped my car was that they felt they had really caught a big one and that they had somebody dangerous.  On one occasion the boot of my car was searched.  This was ridiculous at a time when we saw the crime rate soaring and the Garda being stretched to their limits to provide protection for decent, law-abiding citizens.</P>
    <P>That is practically all I can say.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the Garda pensioners and the Garda widows are not forgotten.  He should ensure that the Minister for Finance in the forthcoming Budget will have something for them.  These are the people who worked in the difficult years when the pay in the force was poor.  They should be compensated by adequate pensions for the pensioners themselves and their widows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to the statement made by Deputy Pattison whom I look upon as a most courteous, law-abiding Deputy.  It is very hard to understand, even if he is a trade union official, that the things he has referred to should have happened.  I accept the Deputy's word, but it is hard to understand.  In my long years here I never knew any-think like this to happen before.  I hope that the Deputy is not under the impression that the Minister for Justice has anything to do with this.  We are going through a very hard time.  This concerns us all.  We have a young man as Minister for Justice.</P>
      <P>We all know that if this Dáil does not remain supreme then we are failing the people who have sent us here. No matter which side of the House we are on, this is a very serious matter.  If this House cannot be supreme in all matters regarding law and order then we have failed as a democratic State. There are people outside this House who claim to speak for the public. There are people who have no respect at all for the decisions of the public representatives of this House and they feel they are a law unto themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very strongly about these matters, having listened to the Minister, Deputy Tom Fitzpatrick of <Col N="155" /> Cavan and Deputy Pattison.  I want to put on the record of this House that our present Minister for Justice has the heaviest burden any Minister for Justice ever had in our time in this House.  He is depending solely on our goodwill and co-operation to back him in decisions he has made. Thank God, he is a man of the world and a man with backbone who is able to stand up to responsibility.  He is strong enough to administer the law. If Deputy Treacy or Deputy Pattison were Minister for Justice I would say the same thing.  This is our Parliament, and we hope to see the day when it will cover the Thirty-two Counties. The Minister for Justice in trying to ensure that the democratic law of this Assembly is obeyed by all citizens. Any citizen who is not prepared to obey that law can go before the people in the next election.  If these people who are outside and who have cures for all ills were the Government of this country, judging by their intolerance at the present time people would have a very poor living with them.  I say that with all the sincerity at my command. We are challenged by these people.  They have no regard for our public representatives who are governing the country at the present time, including members of the Labour Party, and Fine Gael, and Independents. This is a challenge to all of us. The Minister for Justice is bearing the brunt of all this.  He is not just bearing the brunt for Fianna Fáil but for all Members of this democratic Assembly which has been so strongly challenged.</P>
    <P>We are going through a transitional period in our lives.  Any day we may be told that we are no use and that these people are of every use.  I would like to deviate and to pay a compliment to the Minister for Justice and to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Deputy Hillery has succeeded in influencing opinion in other countries in support of our drive for the re-unification of our country.  I know I am out of order in speaking in this way.  I do so because of the support which we have received throughout our fight for a united Ireland and the fight on behalf of our less fortunate brethren <Col N="156" /> in the North of Ireland.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs in making friendly approaches all over the world has succeeded in bringing pressure to bear on the British Government.  According to certain people outside, this Assembly has been of no assistance in regard to this problem.  However, many friendly nations have come to our aid and will continue to help towards the re-unification of our country.  They will not be concerned with the people who say they have cures for all ills, who want to get rid of Parliament and get rid of the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>We as public representatives should support the stand of our Minister for Justice.  As a Dáil Deputy, I have no authority to break the law.  If I do break the law I am liable to be prosecuted and punished for it.  Why should anybody else be able to do as he likes and threatens the downfall of this democratic Assembly?  If we allow ourselves to be ruled from the streets and by the mobs of Dublin we shall be failing in our duty.  I must thank the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party for their honourable stand in defending democracy.  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke at great length here on matters on which he was capable of expounding.  He is a democrat and believes in the rule of law, as does Deputy Pattison.  When I came to Dublin as a young man and when we worked for buttons trade unionism was at a very low ebb.  We went through many vicissitudes, but we always upheld the law.  We in this Assembly cannot bow to those who are challenging us here.  Our aim is to achieve a lasting re-unification of North and South, and we are anxious for all the co-operation we can get from our people.</P>
    <P>Our national dailies, the <i>Irish Times,</i> the <i>Irish Press,</i> the <i>Irish Independent</i> and the <i>Cork Examiner</i> are a credit to our country.  They have contributed day after day towards re-unification of the country by the constructive statements they have made.  Let no one here imagine that it is only Fianna Fáil who are being challenged.  All the parties here are being challenged.  Are we going to say that we are wrong and those who are challenging us are right? The day we do that the freedom of the whole country will not be worth a <Col N="157" /> thraneen.  The only way to solve this problem is through the efforts of the democratically elected representatives of the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>There have been misunderstandings in the North.  The Minister for Justice and other Deputies may be misrepresented. However, during our long years here we have at all times shown tolerance to every section of the people irrespective of class or creed.  Their religious beliefs did not matter.  Everybody could compete for jobs and get them on merit alone.  The machinery set up here, the Local Appointments Commission and the Civil Service Commission, provided the fairest means of assessing people's ability for appointment to posts.  The Commissioners were not concerned whether a man was a Hindu or a Mahommedan, an Orangeman or a Catholic; the only thing that concerned them was the ability of the candidate to perform the duties of the post.</P>
    <P>In my younger days I chaired a number of interview boards, and I could swear on oath that at no time did we ever depart from the principle of fair play.  We were never concerned with a person's religious beliefs and it was a question we never asked. Certain people advocate changes in the Constitution.  That is another day's work.  I do not believe in grovelling to people.  I believe in being fair with them.  There has been no fairness for 50 years in Northern Ireland.  The people should give careful consideration to the decision to have direct rule there.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Malley, is going through a very serious transitional period in this connection. Changes have been brought about as a result of the strong representations that have been made on our behalf by the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and by our delegates who have visited other countries. I want to pay tribute to Deputy Richie Ryan, shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Fine Gael Party, and to Deputy Cluskey of the Labour Party, both of whom played their part in informing opinion in the Council of Europe about the situation in Northern Ireland and share some responsibility for bringing about an end to rule by the Stormont Government.</P>

      <P>Sometimes.  As to 99 per cent of the Garda, they are honourable men who will do their duty at all times.  The Minister understands their grievances and he is sympathetic. I have been here close on 28 years now and I feel I am worth a lot more than I am getting.  But the people do not believe that.  It is the same with the Garda.  They believe they should have better conditions.  The Minister is a young man facing a big problem.  He needs all the loyalty he can get.  Certain people&mdash;I will not name them because that would give them publicity&mdash;have circularised gardaí in Cork, wanting them to do this, that and the other. These are the very people who, if they were in power, would make everybody toe their particular line.</P>
      <P>Times change and one has to change with them.  But one must ensure that the change is for better and not for worse.  The Minister should put more gardaí into plain clothes.  My ambition would be to make our country such that any man could walk the streets of our cities and towns without fear of molestation.  If we fail to do that then we fail the people.  I do not want to experience such failure.  I say to the Minister put more men into plain clothes.  The FBI does a splendid job in the United States.  A body on somewhat the same lines here could pay a dividend to society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who break the law should be brought to justice.  I name no names, but I believe certain court decisions are open to question.  I shall say no more.  Our people want law and order <Col N="159" /> maintained.  The Minister has the respect of the great majority of the people. He has their support.</P>
    <P>I have been told I should not talk about certain things here.  This is a democracy and I will always uphold democratic rights.  The day we cease to do that we will be on the slippery slope to destructiton.  If we show ourselves unable to rule ourselves a Thirty-Two county state in the morning would mean nothing.</P>
    <P>I should like if Deputy Pattison would give a detailed statement to the Minister for Justice.  I have enough confidence in my colleague to assure Deputy Pattison that justice will be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke about the adoption laws.  He knows his job in detail from a legal point of view.  As a Deputy I have come across certain things in relation to the adoption laws. These laws have been in existence for quite a number of years and they are bound to have some defects.  We have to amend all Acts of Parliament from time to time.  I agree with the Deputy that there are certain clauses that may need to be amended.  People have resigned from the board.  I would prefer to see people making their representations instead of resigning.  I know that if Deputy Fitzpatrick had been on that board, and if he were not a Deputy of this House, the first thing he would have done would have been to bring his grievance before every Member of this House.  To resign is not a good way out of anything.  To stay on a committee and fight is the best thing one could do, to amend it and make it perfect.  Nothing human is perfect. Neither is any law perfect.  It is a law dealing with human beings.  We are not supernatural beings and cannot be. Acts of Parliament are amended as a result of experience.  Deputy Fitzpatrick's contribution is worthy of consideration, but I did not agree with the people who resigned.  They should have stayed and made their grievances heard.  All of us have been on committees on which we have been severely tried.  I resigned from a few committees and was very sorry afterwards because I found that I had handed over to the <Col N="160" /> people who thought differently and given them a free hand.  After a number of years' experience I found that, if you did not agree with the decisions being made by a committee or if you did not agree with the chairman, it was better to stay there and do the best you could.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the prison service.  What to do with delinquents is one of the big problems of our time. Various Ministers for Justice have bent over backwards to deal with this problem. They set up St. Patrick's.  They started the visiting committees, made up of excellent people.  The district justices in their charity are not anxious to send a child to prison or to a reformatory for a first offence.  Many of these problems can be blamed on the home environment.  If a child is brought up in any sort of proper conditions in the home these problems will not arise.  In the US and in England delinquency is a big problem.  It is a huge problem in New York, that great city where so many millions of Irishmen have gone over the years.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Justice is doing his best to deal with this huge problem.  He has set up committees.  I was at a meeting last night of a committee dealing with delinquents.  These delinquents were allowed out of jail to see how they could be placed.  This is an excellent committee of intelligent people full of charity and goodwill. They have been told that they were interfering in the life of a family.  One lady, who is also attached to the Legion of Mary, told me she was abused by a family when she was making inquiries about a particular boy and trying to ensure that he would not be sent to St. Patricks again.  This problem concerns all of us&mdash;teachers, parents, clergymen of all denominations.  There is less than one per cent of the people interested in the problem of trying to make citizens of our less fortunate brothers.  The Minister cannot do any more.  The rehabilitation of these ne'er-do-wells when they get out of prison is a problem.  We have fewer of these people as a percentage of the population than they have in other countries, but I appeal to all sections of our community to concern themselves with this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> The present Minister has increased the number of social workers attached to the courts.  I mentioned this to a previous Minister.  The lady at present in charge of social welfare in the courts and working as a probation officer there is second to none.  She has built up a very good committee.  However, we need to get more people involved in this work, realising that these delinquents are our people and that anything we can do to make them better than they have been, notwithstanding the fact that their family life has not been all that could be desired, is worthwhile. For that reason we are anxious that this should be done.  Improvements have been carried out to prisons over the years and the conditions in prison are very good.  The Minister has succeeded in improving the conditions and involving more and more people in the improvement of prison life.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that anybody charged with the offence of using a knife, even if that person were my own son, should receive a mandatory sentence of two year's imprisonment.  A young man who lives near me in Santry was stabbed and beaten up six months before he was due to take his final examination in engineering.  He was coming out of a dance at the time. This happened six years ago.  As a result of the injuries he sustained, that young man has been a patient in a psychiatric hospital.  The three or four blackguards responsible for his injuries have condemned that young man to a life of misery.  On occasions when he was brought home he would cry out in the middle of the night, that he heard a car coming and that &ldquo;they&rdquo; were coming for him again.</P>
    <P>People will plead for those who use knives and chains and other implements to injure others.  I would suggest to the Minister that for those who use such weapons there should be a mandatory sentence of not less than three years.  That might act as a deterrent. There should be more policemen in plain clothes because offenders such as I have described have been known to take the number of a policeman.</P>
    <P>May I transgress the laws of courtesy to pay public tribute to <Col N="162" /> Sergeant Brannigan who has been worth thousands of policeman in this city, for the wonderful work he has done?  He is a charitable man.  He is now retired.  He and his squad were responsible for the fact that the citizens of Dublin could walk in this city.  Such men should be recognised publicly for their contribution.  As a social worker he tried to place those whom he had brought to justice and would meet them coming out of jail. He was a man of charity and goodwill. Offenders were more afraid of Sergeant Brannigan than they were of the courts.  He was our FBI man.  He was not uncharitable.  He tried to protect the citizens from callous gangs. I am sorry if I have offended the rules of order by mentioning his name but I thought the Ceann Comhairle would pardon me in this instance on the ground that I was paying tribute to a man who did so much to protect the citizens.  It is on such men that we have to depend, men who help so significantly to prevent crime.</P>
    <P>I presided at a meeting recently where suggestions were made that there should be harsher methods introduced to deal with those who break the law.  The Minister for Justice, in his charity, resisted that suggestion at the time and I supported him strongly but I believe that those who use knives to injure others or those who use other implements to cause injury to person or property should be dealt with severely.</P>
    <P>Car stealing is on the increase. Those who steal cars should get three years imprisonment without right of appeal.  That is a very hard thing to say but it should be borne in mind that the victim of these people may be depending on his car for his livelihood. He may be a commercial representative.  He may be an ordinary citizen.  It is not right that a man should be deprived of his car.  The Minister should introduce appropriate measures to stop this abuse.  This offence is not confined to Ireland.  It occurs in most countries.  If there were a mandatory sentence of three years hard labour there would not be so much car stealing.  Car stealing is bad from the point of view of tourism.  It reflects badly on the <Col N="163" /> country if a visitor's car is ransacked and its contents stolen.</P>
    <P>A very decent man came to me recently and told me that his son was an excellent fellow but had been on probation having been charged with stealing a car and that he had repeated the offence while on probation.  He asked me if I could do anything for him.  I told him that if I had my way his son would get three years.  He replied that he would never vote for me again.  I told him that I was delighted, that I would not like to have his vote or the vote of any other man in similar circumstances.  Public men are pressurised.  People come to them and say that they are worth 400 or 500 votes and ask them to do something for them.  To hell with them.  People like that are breaking the law.  A car today is worth £1,000 at the minimum and may be worth £2,000 or £3,000.  Even if a car is worth only £10, nobody has the right to interfere with it.</P>
    <P>There is a gang going around who use the telephone to find out if there is anybody in a particular house.  If they do not get a reply they presume that there is nobody at home.  They then proceed to break and enter.  Another gang may break and enter shops.  The Minister and the Garda authorities realise that those who are most guilty in this matter are the receivers.  It is very difficult to discover the receivers. Cigarettes and drink of all kinds are stolen.  When the receivers are caught they say they do not know who left the stuff in their houses.  They say they never did anything like it, even when the goods are found under their floorboards. I knew a case like that.  Those people cry out and ask for clemency and justice.  I am sure there is not a Deputy in the House who has not met such criminals.  They cry out for help. I have never given it to them and I never will.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are all human beings. I made a slip or two in my time, but nothing of that kind.  There are people whom we all would like to help.  There is the person, for instance, who takes a few extra drinks at a wedding and who has an accident.  He should be considered in all charity.  Of course, <Col N="164" /> there is the situation when a person might be killed as a result of overdrinking, and that is another thing altogether.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a matter in respect of which I expect to be told the Minister for Justice has no jurisdiction. I refer to our court buildings.  They are dismal and forbidding.  Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation are responsible for the maintenance of court buildings in and around this city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P. J. Burke Mr. P. J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I was hoping to be permitted to say a few words, in the hope, perhaps, that the Minister with us tonight might be able to wave the magic wand and do something about our court buildings.  Even in the Four Courts the courtrooms are too small. They were designed for another age and with our present population trends they become overcrowded.  Occasionally I have to attend the Central Criminal Court and the Circuit Court. I try to follow the cases of people whom I know and in whom I am interested.  I find the courtrooms overcrowded and forbidding.  Throughout the country court buildings are dilapidated and dismal in the extreme and something should be done about them.</P>
      <P>The Minister and his predecessors did a good deal to provide houses for gardaí.  They succeeded in building 500 houses but a lot remains to be done in this respect as well as in respect of Garda stations, many of which are too small.  As a result, unmarried gardaí have to go into lodgings.  This is a general problem.  We must realise that a satisfied garda will perform his duties better than a man who is depressed and harried because of housing conditions.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment the Minister in what he is doing at Shanganagh and I should like also to pay a tribute to the sisters who are helping him in the rehabilitation of juvenile offenders, teaching them elementary subjects such as geography and current affairs.  I am very pleased with the progress made in this direction and I hope it will continue and be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="165" /> I should like to end by saying, as I did at the beginning, that we all have an obligation to support the Minister for Justice and our democratic institutions in every way.  It is only through this that we will be able to resist the efforts of those who are trying to pull down our State institutions by their destructive techniques.  The Minister <Col N="166" /> needs our help and co-operation and we should be manly enough to give it to him.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 13th April, 1972.</P>
