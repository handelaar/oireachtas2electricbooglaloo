      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the statements made at the annual meeting of the Irish Medical Association held on 7th April last regarding the alleged lack of vitamin C in foodstuffs; and if he will comment on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen a report of statements made at the recent annual meeting of the Irish Medical Association regarding vitamin C deficiency.  I propose to study the two surveys referred to in the report and to consider what action, if any, is necessary.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the types of food available to the population as a whole, vitamin C deficiency should not occur generally.  However, such deficiency might occur because of particular circumstances or personal food choices.</P>
      <P>Diet is one of the subjects covered in the course of training for public health nurses and these nurses, where necessary, furnish advice regarding diets to mothers after confinement and to old persons living at home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. S. Flanagan)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result of a reorganisation carried <Col N="528" /> out in 1968 the staffing position was improved by the appointment of a second inspector, grade I, to take charge of County Leitrim following the division of the original Sligo/Leitrim area into two separate units&mdash;County Sligo and County Leitrim.  Five inspectors now operate in each of these counties and this is deemed adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Faulkner)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the position regarding post-primary education needs in this developing area under active consideration. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, it is intended to develop community schools in new areas of the city instead of the traditional development of separate secondary and vocational schools.  The question of establishing a community school in Lucan is under consideration and discussions will take place shortly with all of the interests involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the sisters applied some considerable time ago for permission to expand their school in Lucan?  Is it not also a fact that the brothers set up there about two years ago?  The Minister's recent announcement has caused chaos because a school which does not give a leaving certificate is not regarded as a school at all by parents.  Does the Minister appreciate that they do not want to send their children to a school where they can only go as far as the intermediate certificate?  They want to send their children to a school where they can finish their post-primary education.  The present position in that whole area is that they do not know where they are going.  I am sorry the Minister's statement does not seem to clear the position for the parents there.</P>

      <P>I take it that the Deputy's question relates to the companies operating the base metal mines at Tynagh, Gortdrum, Silvermines and the reopened mine at Avoca.</P>
      <P>No subsidies have been paid to the operators of these mines.</P>
      <P>Profits from the working of these mines are exempt from income and corporation profits tax for 20 years from the date of commencement of production.  These companies are not required to furnish particulars of their profits for tax purposes or particulars of their profits re-invested in Ireland.</P>
      <P>As the operating concerns are private companies, it would in any event be contrary to accepted practice to divulge their individual profits or the proportion thereof re-invested in Ireland.  However, I would refer the Deputy to a recent public statement by the Northgate Exploration and Development Co. Ltd. on behalf of the base metal mine operators which gives details, for the period up to the end of 1970, of the profits from the mining operations here, and the allocation of the profits for various purposes including re-investment.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether the Government has considered setting up a commission to examine the possible establishment of a State mining company to prospect for, extract, smelt and market the mineral wealth of this country to ensure the retention of revenue gained from such operations in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 1940s and early 1950s the State did, in fact, participate directly in mineral exploration and development through State-sponsored companies but this policy did not meet with any success.  It was in the light of this experience that it was decided to bring the operations of the State-sponsored company, Mianraí Teoranta, to an end in 1956 and to adopt the present policy of offering incentives to competent private enterprise as the only practical way to ensure the thorough exploration and use of our mineral potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am having a review carried out of royalty and taxation arrangements in regard to mining.  In the light of this I will consider what long-term fiscal policy for mining would be best suited for the future.  Such a policy should give the State an equitable <Col N="537" /> share of increasing profits while at the same time being sufficiently attractive to the mining companies to ensure the continued development of the country's mineral resources in an orderly and efficient manner and lead to the establishment of a smelter and other associated industries.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have at present no plans for setting up a commission as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that there is considerable public disquiet that so much wealth from these mines is being shipped out of the country?  Can the Minister give us some indication when this review will be carried out and when a report will be available?  The Minister may be aware of the fact that these mines have a certain period of life and if the review should take a long time a considerable amount of the wealth of the country would be gone.  Will the Minister consider this matter as one of urgency?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that at the present time there is a considerable effort being made to create unrest in this regard.  As I have indicated in reply to the question, I am having a review carried out of royalty and taxation arrangements.  I have indicated that I do not propose to set up a commission with a view to making recommendations on nationalisation as such. I consider that far too many wrong claims have been made in connection with the amount of money being made by the people involved in mineral exploration here.  In view of the fact that Tara Mines have not commenced operations yet, all allegations about the profits it is stated they will make must be purely speculative.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if his attention has been drawn to a report (details supplied) that exorbitant profits are being made by some people in the building industry; if he will indicate the average profit made by builders who are engaged in the erection of local authority housing; if he <Col N="540" /> will state the percentage increase in building costs over the past five years; and if he will hold an inquiry into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press reports of this statement.  Normally, local authority housing contracts are made on the basis of a lump sum quotation which is accepted following public advertisement and keen competition. The lump sum is, as a rule, based on priced bills of quantities, the unit rates of which are inclusive, and do not show the profit element separately. Records are not available, therefore, of the average profit made by local authority housing contractors. It is probable that the level of profit varies widely and depends on many factors, some of which&mdash;such as weather and strikes&mdash;are outside the builders' control.</P>
      <P>It is felt however that competition for available contracts and the surveillance over tender prices for local authority housing operated by my Department are reasonably effective in ensuring that, as a general rule, exorbitant profits are not made on such contracts.  According to official figures published by the Central Statistics Office, the wholesale price index for materials used in the building industry rose by 31 per cent approximately between 1967 and June, 1971, the latest date for which published figures are available.  Figures published by the office on earnings of skilled and unskilled operatives in the building and construction industry indicate that earnings for these categories of workers rose by 44 per cent and 42 per cent respectively between March.  1969&mdash;the base date from which the published figures are available&mdash;and June, 1971.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to hold the inquiry suggested in the press report.  I will, however, have any concrete evidence which may be submitted to my Department in support of the allegations fully investigated.</P>

      <i>Review of 1971</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley) George Colley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Colley)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with customary practice, I propose to open my financial statement to-day with a brief assessment of economic trends over the past year and of the prospects for the year ahead.</P>
      <P>In 1971, the volume of national production expanded by 3 per cent. This growth rate, while somewhat higher than the rate of 2½ per cent achieved in 1970, cannot be regarded as satisfactory.  The underlying growth rate of industrial production was sluggish during the past year, part of the apparent increase being attributable to recovery from the effects of the industrial disputes of 1970.  Domestic demand also lacked buoyancy and this contributed to the undynamic performance of industry.  In these circumstances, it was not surprising that industrial employment showed little improvement during the year.  This factor, together with an increase in the numbers coming on the labour market and a sharp reduction in emigration, caused overall unemployment to rise.</P>
      <P>However, 1971 had a number of bright features.  Agricultural output expanded rapidly in response to improved demand on foreign markets. Total exports maintained the rate of expansion of 1970.  Invisible receipts also increased with the result that there was only a slight deterioration in the balance of payments position and, indeed, a welcome improvement if trade in ships and aircraft is excluded. On the prices front, inflationary pressures, which had been very strong in the first half of 1971, moderated slightly in the second half of the year.  This slight improvement has continued into the current year.</P>
      <P>The credit guidelines issued by the Central Bank allowed for an increase of up to £118 million in total bank credit in the year to April, 1972, with preference for productive investment. The limit was not, however, reached but the exceptionally large capital inflow ensured that there was no shortage of credit.  The reduction in interest rates during 1971, which reflected an international trend, should encourage a fuller use of credit while the system of term loans recently introduced by the banks, in which the rate of interest is related to duration of loan and category of borrower, should result in the more efficient use of credit.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Economic Prospects for 1972</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in Northern Ireland is likely to have some adverse effects on <Col N="547" /> the economy throughout 1972, mainly on the tourist industry, and earlier prospects of making a substantial advance on the economic front have disimproved as a result.  Nevertheless, we can look forward to some measure of growth this year and, provided moderation is observed on the incomes front, continued progress can be made.</P>
    <P>The trend in non-agricultural employee income in 1972 will mainly be determined by settlements under the National Pay Agreement which was negotiated at the end of 1970.  The increase in the non-agricultural wage bill this year should be some percentage points less than in 1971, provided moderation prevails in the framing of a new agreement.  In the context of freer trading conditions and the need for the restructuring of the industrial base to respond to the challenge of EEC membership, less inflationary wage settlements combined with inprovements in productivity are more necessary than ever if competitiveness is to be maintained.  Agricultural incomes and output should expand significantly in 1972 since conditions in external markets continue to be favourable. The longer-term prospects for this sector are, of course, very bright in the context of EEC membership.</P>
    <P>Despite the reflationary measures taken by the Government from last October onwards, domestic demand has not yet fully responded and, in the absence of further stimulatory measures, is not expected to increase in volume terms by more than 2 per cent this year.  While this is likely to have a dampening effect on investment, there will be countervailing influences from the substantial increase in Government expenditure through the public capital programme and from the expected improvement in demand in the British market. When adjustment is made for investment in aircraft in both years, the estimated trend of capital formation for 1972 is higher than that for 1971.</P>
    <P>Industrial exports, aided by more buoyant demand in Britain and the US, should continue to expand steadily.  Market conditions in the UK remain favourable for our two main <Col N="548" /> agricultural products and agricultural exports should continue to increase.</P>
    <P>Receipts from tourism are expected to show a decline during 1972.  The extent of the decline will be influenced by the future trend of events in the North but even a substantial improvement in the situation there might not permit all lost bookings to be recovered.  Nevertheless, there are indications that spending by US and continental visitors will show an increase and, if sufficient Irish people decide to switch their holidays to Ireland this year instead of going abroad, the net loss of tourist receipts to the economy should be significantly reduced.  Merchandise imports are expected to increase in 1972 at a somewhat slower rate than in 1971, mainly as a result of reduced purchases of aircraft.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the expected pattern of merchandise trade and anticipated net invisible earnings, the balance of payments deficit on current account for 1972, estimated at £55 million, should show a noticeable improvement on last year's figure estimated at £68 million.  However, if allowance is made for smaller purchases of ships and aircraft, the deficit may not change very significantly between the two years.</P>
    <P>Official external reserves have been particularly buoyant over the past year, reflecting the record net capital inflow from abroad of almost £160 million and indicating the continuing confidence of foreign investors in the country's ability to prosper.  Between end-1970 and end-1971 these reserves rose by roughly one-third and at March, 1972, they stood at £407 million as compared with £334 million in March, 1971.</P>
    <P>Pre-budget indications are that the growth rate of the economy will be between 2 and 2½ per cent.  This is appreciably below the long-term potential of the economy and falls a good deal short of our aspirations for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Pay Agreement</i>
    </P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the considerable efforts that have been <Col N="549" /> made by most trade unions and employers to ensure that the National Pay Agreement is observed and to the way in which they have co-operated in the new institutional arrangements. When introducing last year's budget, I emphasised that, while the agreement could help in moderating the rate of inflation, it would not result in any immediate or spectacular easing of the pressure on prices.  What I was hoping for was a slowing down of the rate of increase during 1971 and a further improvement in 1972.  My hopes are being realised but more slowly than I would have liked.</P>
    <P>The incomes situation, therefore, remains crucial to our whole economic well-being.  The considerable economic problems which we already face will be aggravated if existing inflationary pressures are increased.  Discussions have already opened in the Employer-Labour Conference with a view to negotiating a new National Agreement. I have no doubt that in these discussions full regard will be had to the needs of the current economic situation, but I would be failing in my responsibilities if I did not spell out the objectives on the incomes front which we should be trying to achieve in present economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>The first objective should be to ensure that all improvements in pay and conditions of employment which are still being negotiated under the present National Agreement conform fully with the letter and spirit of that agreement. Secondly, the new National Agreement should aim at doing better than its predecessor in moderating the upward trend in costs and prices.</P>
    <P>It is well to remember that the increase provided for in the second phase of the current agreement, including the cost-of-living supplement, is substantial and covers a period of only six months.  If it were to be followed at once by another substantial increase, many concerns would find it difficult to remain competitive and employment and growth would suffer.  It is essential that the negotiators should give full weight to this factor.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic too if the <Col N="550" /> negotiations did not take into account the special problems now being faced by the economy and, in particular, the need to create new jobs.  With so many unemployed and with so many redundancies threatened, it would be inexcusable if the community as a whole had to divert to seriously inflationary pay rises money which could be used directly for providing new jobs.  It would be doubly inexcusable in that such increases, by pushing up costs, would themselves endanger existing jobs.  It would mean providing higher living standards for those in employment at the expense of those who are already unemployed or who are facing that threat.  Employers and trade unions should therefore realise, when they are negotiating pay increases, that they are in a position significantly to influence the level of employment by their decisions.</P>
    <P>It is on these tests that the Government, and the community, will judge the outcome of the current discussions. The Government, for their part, will continue to use every means in their power to moderate the rise of prices.  The National Prices Commission has performed valuable work since its establishment last October. In arriving at its recommendations on price increases, the commission tries to ensure that increased costs, whether for labour or non-labour items, will as far as possible be offset by the firms concerned through improvements in productivity and efficiency.</P>
    <P>To ensure that non-wage incomes will be subject to the same sort of discipline as wages and salaries, the Government have, as the House is aware, introduced the Prices (Amendment) Bill which will strengthen the existing powers of control and extend the coverage to areas such as professional fees and insurance, hire purchase agreements and the prices of new houses.  The Restrictive Practices Bill will widen the area in which investigations of restrictive practices may be carried out to include a large range of services, including professional services.</P>
    <P>On the international plane, the <Col N="551" /> OECD indicated in a recent review that it expects an easing of inflationary pressures during 1972.  This is of considerable significance for this country since, because of our open economy, we are particularly affected by external price movements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>EEC</i>
    </P>
    <P>This is the last budget before the date set for this country's proposed entry to the European Economic Community. Membership will have significant effects on our economic life and, indeed, on the preparation of future budgets which will involve consultation with our EEC partners on broad budgetary strategy.  This will not lead to any diminution of our control over our economic destiny.  In fact, the coordination of economic policy that is envisaged in the Community will be of great importance to our economic development.  As a small open economy we are vulnerable to economic trends in our major trading partners and to decisions, which may be inimical to our interests, taken by Government in these countries.  The experience of the past decade provides many instances of the adverse effects on our development of economic trends and policy measures in Britain, for example.</P>
    <P>In many other respects, also, membership of the Community will afford opportunities for rapid economic growth.  As I stressed in the debate on the Government's White Paper last month, it will fulfill two basic conditions for growth in Ireland's circumstances. These conditions are, first, satisfactory arrangements for agriculture, and, secondly, favourable terms of access to foreign markets for the goods we must export.  Neither of these conditions was fulfilled during the sixties, and no alternative trading arrangement would fulfil both of them for the seventies.</P>
    <P>The benefits from EEC membership will not, of course, accrue to us automatically; securing them will call for a vigorous response on the part of all concerned.  To assist forward economic planning in the context of EEC membership, the Government recently <Col N="552" /> approved the preparation of a Fourth Programme for Economic and Social Development covering the three year period 1973 to 1975, that is, to the end of the current EEC medium-term programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Industrial Development</i>
    </P>
    <P>Entry to the EEC offers the opportunity of larger markets for our products, and the Protocol negotiated with the Community provides for the retention of our export incentives.  The outlook for industrial development is, therefore, good in the context of proposed membership of the Community. Action to promote the growth of an export-oriented industrial sector and to strengthen existing industries to meet the challenges of technological change and freer trade has been intensified. This includes the selective application of re-equipment grants and the encouragement of rationalisation and mergers, temporary extension of free depreciation to the entire country and a system of investment allowances in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>While employment in manufacturing industry continues to increase, progress in net new job creation has been somewhat obscured by redundancies in traditional industries attributable, in great part, to a combination of a world recession in particular industries&mdash; notably textiles&mdash;and rapidly changing technology.</P>
    <P>Every effort is being made to combat redundancy.  The reflationary measures taken by the Government since last October were designed to safeguard and promote employment, and the strategy of today's budget is guided by the Government's continuing determination to do everything possible to prevent redundancy and increase employment. Recently a new State company, Fóir Teoranta, was established to give financial aid to assist firms to overcome temporary difficulties. The Government agencies concerned are continuing their efforts to identify, in good time, firms running into difficulties and to ensure that, where they have a future, everything possible is done to put them on their feet again.  The qualifying period for <Col N="553" /> redundancy payments has been reduced and the level of benefits has been improved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Regional Policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are now giving further consideration to future regional strategy and are drawing on the results of recent work on regional development proposals.  Each of the regional development organisations has submitted to the Minister for Local Government a report dealing with the principal consideration relevant to a development programme in its region. The Industrial Development Authority has also submitted industrial plans for each region to the Government which they will consider in the context of regional policy as a whole.  The Minister for Local Government has very recently submitted proposals to the Government on regional strategy, which take account of these reports and plans.  The Government hope to announce their decisions shortly.</P>
    <P>Development proposals will be prepared for submission to the EEC shortly after we accede, with a view to obtaining Community assistance in their implementation.  The economic and social development of the Gaeltacht which is a main aim of Government policy must feature prominently in any regional strategy of ours.  The Government's concern for the Gaeltacht is reflected in the increased provision for the improvement schemes operated by Roinn na Gaeltachta and in the additional capital being made available to Gaeltarra Éireann for grants for industrial and other projects.  The identity of the Gaeltacht areas will be reinforced by the recent launching of Radio na Gaeltachta and by the proposals which will soon be brought before the Dáil for a new local government structure for the Gaeltacht.  A comprehensive report recently prepared by the Gaeltarra/SFADCo working party adds a new dimension to the understanding of the needs of the Gaeltacht areas in present circumstances. I am confident that positive results will flow from consideration of its recommendations as to how the <Col N="554" /> State might assist in furthering cultural and economic progress in these areas.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aims of the 1971 budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>The overall objectives of the April, 1971, budget were to slow down inflation and to promote balanced growth in the economy.  It aimed to achieve these objectives by restraining the growth of Government expenditure and by minimising tax increases.  It provided for substantial improvements in the social welfare sphere and for agriculture.  It was designed to foster a climate in which the National Pay Agreement could be maintained.  Investment was encouraged by the introduction of free depreciation for a two-year period.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Autumn, 1971 and subsequent measures</i>
    </P>
    <P>As the year progressed, it was evident that the rise of inflationary pressures was moderating somewhat and that the National Pay Agreement was being adhered to.  External reserves continued to grow and the balance of payments position, while it required to be watched closely, did not call for correction.  In these circumstances, and since the economy's capacity for growth was considerably higher, the Government decided last autumn that a further stimulus was required to boost economic activity and to strengthen business confidence.  This took the form of an increase of £20 million, or 10 per cent, in the public capital programme, the immediate removal of all existing hire-purchase, credit sales and hiring restrictions, and the granting of company taxation reliefs that will cost the Exchequer £2.7 million in the current year and £7.2 million in a full year. Subsequently, public investment totalling some £6 million in agricultural grants schemes and credit was approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>In mid-January, 1972, some months ahead of usual, the Government determined the level of the public capital programme for 1972-73 and Departments and other spending agencies <Col N="555" /> were authorised to draw immediately on this expanded programme.  Thus, over the past half-year, the Government took steps, on three occasions, to stimulate demand and improve the employment situation.  The measures I have referred to related, as far as possible, to areas where employment could be increased rapidly.  There is, however, a time-lag between the provision of capital and the materialisation of the additional new jobs.  Consequently, the full effects of these measures will not be felt until later this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current budget 1971-72: outturn</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last April, I budgeted for a balance, at £551 million, between current expenditure and revenue.  The outturn for the year was a deficit of £2.2 million or less than one-quarter of 1 per cent of combined revenue and expenditure. Revenue exceeded the budget estimates by about £18½ million, mainly under the headings of income-tax and customs and excise.  Part of the increased revenue from income tax is attributable to measures taken during the past year to improve collection, including an increase in the rate of interest on outstanding tax and a reduction in the period of grace; this factor will also increase this year's receipts. Current expenditure rose slightly faster, with the main increases appearing in the provisions for social welfare, health, CIE and defence.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Budget 1971-72</i>
    </P>
    <P>The original level set for the public capital programme in 1971-72 was £193 million.  This was designed to achieve steady advance on the social and economic fronts while at the same time helping to ease inflationary pressures.  During the year, however, the programme was, as I have already indicated, increased as part of the special measures taken to safeguard and expand employment and to stimulate economic activity generally. Expenditure on the programme amounted to almost £214 million.  As regards the financing of the capital budget, the Exchequer's normal resources exceeded the April, 1971, estimate&mdash;as did also the non-Exchequer <Col N="556" /> resources of State bodies and local authorities.  The residual borrowing needed from banks and abroad was substantially less than estimated.  Details are given in the booklet <i>Capital Budget 1972</i> which was published last week.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital Budget 1972-73</i>
    </P>
    <P>The public capital programme for 1972-73 has been settled at the impressive total of £251.3 million.  If we exclude the expenditures of the air companies and of Irish Shipping Ltd., the programme shows an increase of almost 15 per cent over the outturn of the expanded 1971-72 programme. As these expenditures are incurred abroad and financed from foreign borrowing, their direct effect on domestic resources and demand is slight.</P>
    <P>The public capital programme is in itself a major part of national capital investment and it also helps to induce investment by the private sector. Soundly based growth of employment and prosperity depends largely on an adequate and balanced public capital programme.  The size and composition of the 1972-73 programme are designed to give a marked impetus to the economy.  Major constituents are housing and ancillary services, £50 million; educational buildings, £15 million; electricity development, £33 million; industrial grants £29 million; industrial credit, £14 million; agricultural schemes, £17 million; agricultural credit, £18 million and telephone development, £14 million.</P>
    <P>During the past year there has been an upsurge in the Exchequer's normal capital resources, due mainly to increased sales of Government securities to the public.  The rapid increase in sales of these securities during the past few years has been particularly gratifying. Government issues, as well as being a gilt-edged investment, provide a highly attractive rate of return to investors and I have been encouraging the growth of an active secondary market in national loans so as to improve further their marketability.  The increasing volume of sales is an obvious indication that more individuals and <Col N="557" /> institutions are investing at home and assisting the progress of our national development.</P>
    <P>The improvement in the market has been achieved by the provision of more attractive yields and by the Government support for the market.  The consequent growth in turnover of Government securities resulted in a substantial increase in net sales.  I believe that part of the capital inflow into the country over the past year was due to the repatriation of funds attracted by the active state of the gilt-edged market here.  I have yet to be convinced that this process of repatriation has been completed and I look forward to a continuation of the trend in the coming year.  To meet the needs of investors, I have issued new stocks and further tranches of many existing stocks throughout the year.</P>
    <P>As regards small savings, the amounts subscribed in 1971-72 to the various small savings schemes substantially exceeded expectations and they continue to be an important source of finance for the capital programme.  I have every hope that this trend will continue.  There is now a wide range of State savings schemes available and every saver should be able to find one that suits his or her particular circumstances. The number of agreements entered into under the National Instalment-Saving Scheme continues to grow rapidly, confirming its attractiveness both to new savers and to those whose original 12-month saving cycles have expired and who have entered into new agreements to continue saving. I must pay tribute to the work of the National Savings Committee, which has contributed in no small measure to the success of our savings promotions in recent years.</P>
    <P>Despite the buoyancy in these capital receipts, the rate of growth of the public capital programme is such that we must continue to rely on residual borrowing.  Pre-budget calculations are shown in the Capital Budget booklet which I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current budget, 1972</i>
    </P>
    <P>The uncertainty about the general economic climate makes it difficult to <Col N="558" /> estimate the tax revenue for the year ahead.  It is, for example, difficult to forecast closely the net reduction that will come about in tourist earnings and its direct and indirect effects on receipts from the main customs and excise duties and from the sales taxes, which together account for about 50 per cent of tax revenue.  I have, however, taken due account of the various factors involved in a &ldquo;middle of the road&rdquo; approach and I estimate the revenue&mdash;both tax and non-tax&mdash; for 1972-73 at £629.4 million, an increase of £60 million on last year's outturn.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure for 1972-73 is estimated at £638 million or £66.4 million more than expenditure in 1971-72. Because a continuing reflationary stimulus is clearly necessary for the economy this year, the estimates for current services as well as those for the public capital programme were settled by the Government at a level higher than would otherwise have been appropriate.  Included in this year's current expenditure figure is a contingency provision of £17 million in respect of liabilities which, on present information, are likely to arise during the year in respect of public service pay.</P>
    <P>Public service pay, which covers the Civil Service, Army, Garda Síochána, teachers, health board employees and others, continues to be the biggest single element of expenditure in the current budget and it is not easy to forecast precisely what the full provision should be in any financial year. The great majority of public servants can have recourse to independent arbitration on their pay claims and this factor alone imports an element of uncertainty into the situation.</P>
    <P>The 12th round increase for the public service was based on the proposals of the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, and the 13th round increase followed exactly the terms of the National Pay Agreement.  One of the provisions of the 12th round agreement allowed Civil Service grades to seek a review of pay on a grade basis, and the 13th round National Agreement admitted claims based on removal of genuine <Col N="559" /> anomalies between different groups of employees whose rates of pay in the past had been related.  Most of the public service groups which made such claims have now been reviewed and appropriate adjustments in pay made. Claims from other groups in the public service are still under consideration and are being dealt with under the provisions of the National Agreement, the relevant point being whether it can be established that genuine anomalies within the meaning of the agreement exist.</P>
    <P>Provision for the first phase of the 13th round for the public service which has been payable since January last has been made in the recently published Book of Estimates.  The Estimates figures do not make provision, however, for the second phase of that round which will operate generally for the public service from January, 1973. This is because of the difficulty of closely estimating the cost which depends, to some extent, on the increase in the consumer price index between November, 1971 and November, 1972.</P>
    <P>The best estimate that can be made at this stage of the amount necessary to cover the items I have mentioned is £17 million and this sum has been included as a contingency item in the pre-budget figures.</P>
    <P>With Government current expenditure fixed at £638 million for 1972-73 and total revenue estimated to come to £629.4 million at unchanged rates of tax, I am faced with an opening gap of £8.6 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>When introducing the supplementary budget in October, 1970, I indicated that, while over most of the 1960s, a deliberate policy of deficit budgeting would have been contrary to the requirements of our general economic situation, the Government would in future aim at a deficit when economic activity was depressed and at a surplus in conditions of inflation.  I have to consider whether on this test I should seek to balance the budget this year or should aim at either a surplus or a deficit.  Present and prospective economic circumstances provide no clearcut, <Col N="560" /> unambiguous answer to this question. The rate of price increase is still high and the balance of payments position is weak.  Nowhere is inflation more marked than in labour costs.  In 1971, the rate of increase in unit labour costs in this country was second highest amongst European countries, and there is little indication that we are losing this unenviable place in the league tables.  Whatever our hopes, there is no certainty that the new National Pay Agreement will diminish the pace of cost inflation.  These factors would suggest that the budget should be directed at containing inflationary pressures or, at least, not adding to them.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the economy is, for the third year in succession, running at well below capacity.  Unemployment is high.  We lack the economic buoyancy required to tackle quickly and effectively the adaptation which membership of the EEC will demand. If priority were given to these factors, budgetary policy should be primarily directed at improving the growth performance of the economy.  Faced with these competing requirements, the Government have opted for growth rather than stability.  The level of Government expenditure this year will, therefore, be determined by reference to our economic requirements and will not be cut back to the estimated yield of revenue.  There will not be any increases in taxation, and the resultant deficit in the current budget will be financed mainly by borrowing.  It is by reference to these considerations that the budgetary changes, to which I now turn, have been formulated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the years a special concern of the Government has been the improvement of the position of the less privileged members of our society who depend on social welfare payments. I have given a great deal of thought as to how the moneys available to me this year for social welfare improvements could best be applied, and have decided on the following course.</P>
    <P>The personal and adult dependant rates of all classes of social insurance and social assistance benefits, together <Col N="561" /> with the disabled persons and infectious diseases allowances administered by the Department of Health, are being increased.  Full details of the increases will be circulated at the conclusion of this statement.  Some examples are a 70p rise in the personal rate of contributory old age pension to £6.20 per week and an increase of £1 in the rate for a married couple to a total of £10.35. The widows contributory pension is being increased by 60p to £5.60 while non-contributory widows, deserted wives and old age and blind pensioners get a 50p increase to give a new rate of £5.15 per week.  I am especially conscious of the fact that very old persons are often at a disadvantage because of their inability to do things for themselves and shop around for the best value.  In recognition of this, all non-contributory old age and blind pensioners aged 80 and over will receive a further increase of 50p per week.  The total increase in their cases will, therefore, be £1 per week, bringing the pension to £5.65 per week.  Contributory old age pensioners aged 80 or over will also receive an additional 50p bringing their personal rate of pension to £6.70, and that for a married couple to £10.85 per week.</P>
    <P>At present, the pension payable at age 65 to insured persons who have retired is at a lower rate than the old age contributory pension which is payable at age 70.  In order to make retirement at 65 more attractive, I propose to increase the rate of retirement pension to the same level as the old age contributory pension.  This will involve an increase of £1.25 per week for single persons and £1.95 for a married couple.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing increases for insurance and assistance beneficiaries I am, this year, giving a further substantial improvement to people in those categories with family responsibilities.  The amounts payable for dependent children are being increased by at least 50 per cent in every case.  For example, the amount payable for children of contributory widow pensioners will be increased from £1 to £1.50 each per week, and for children <Col N="562" /> of non-contributory widow pensioners and deserted wives from 90p to £1.35 each per week.  To avoid misunderstanding I should, perhaps, add that the children's allowances scheme of general application remains unchanged, pending completion of a review of the scheme which has been in progress for some time.</P>
    <P>It is often overlooked that, at age 70 or over, social welfare pensions are supplemented by a number of additional non-cash services, especially free travel, electricity and TV licences. Those services have been so widely availed of that their combined cost has now grown to almost £2 million per annum.  This year, I am making two further substantial improvements affecting the free electricity and free travel schemes.  The free electricity scheme is available to certain categories of pensioners, for example, those living alone.  I am increasing the free allowances of electricity in each two-month period from 100 units to 300 units for the period October to March inclusive and to 200 units for the rest of the year.  As the free travel scheme is specifically designed to be of assistance to the aged, I have decided to extend it to all persons aged 70 or over, whether they are social welfare pensioners or not.  It is intended to give effect to these improvements in the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are some other improvements to which I will refer briefly.  The death grant in respect of insured adults is being increased by £10 to £35, and for other correspondingly. The allowance payable to incapacitated old age pensioners in respect of prescribed female relatives who are caring for them will be extended to cover corresponding male relatives.  Deserted wives without dependent children will qualify for the allowance at age 40 instead of 50 as at present.</P>
    <P>The increases in assistance rates and health allowances will take effect from the beginning of August, while the increases in insurance benefits will, as in recent years, be paid from the beginning of October.  The Exchequer provision for social welfare and related services will be increased by £8.3 million <Col N="563" /> in the current year and by £11.6 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Current measures to improve agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>Over the past six months the Government have implemented a comprehensive range of measures to improve farmers' incomes and productivity and to prepare the industry generally for EEC conditions.  The first major step was to change the system of supporting creamery milk prices in December last to bring it into line with EEC requirements. These measures at the same time resulted in an average increase of about 2p per gallon&mdash;worth some £10 million a year to producers.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the position of cattle and beef has been improved in a number of ways.  The support arrangements for beef were substantially increased by eliminating most of the differential between the export subsidy rate and the United Kingdom subsidy rate. Next, the price at which export subsidy is calculated was increased by 85p per cwt in line with the United Kingdom increase.  Finally, a special loan scheme has been put into operation for the carcase beef export industry to help it over a difficult period and to give a breathing space during which the industry may assess its position and take the steps necessary to become more competitive on export markets.  The combined net cost of this assistance to the cattle and beef industry is likely to come to £2 million in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The next major step to help agriculture was to increase the amount of capital for development and credit.  An additional £4.2 million was made available for grants for land and building, fertiliser improvements and disease eradication, and the amount lent by the Agricultural Credit Corporation was increased from £6.3 million to £13.5 million.  The amount of credit for 1972-73 has been increased to £18 million.  The small farm incentive bonus scheme was increased from £375 to £500.  The price of barley and the acreage of sugar beet have been increased.</P>
    <P>These are important measures for <Col N="564" /> the agricultural industry and, rather than wait until budget time, they were introduced as soon as the need for them arose so as to enable farmers to plan ahead effectively.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prospects for agriculture in 1972</i>
    </P>
    <P>The measures which I have outlined to prepare agriculture for EEC conditions are also going to realise positive benefits in the present year. Our main enterprises of cattle and milk are likely to do exceptionally well this year.  There are many indications of substantial investment by farmers in increasing cattle output. Cattle prices are running ahead of last year's high prices.  Prices obtainable by farmers for milk are about 2p per gallon up on last year's average, and indications are that output will increase substantially.  Prospects in the tillage sector are also promising and the output of barley and sugar beet is expected to increase. I, therefore, direct my attention to other sectors of agriculture which call for additional assistance now, and towards additional measures which will help the whole industry, especially smaller farmers, to prepare for the EEC.  The sectors which require additional help now are pigs, sheep and horticulture.  I propose to provide additional assistance for these purposes costing £1.8 million this year and £2¼ million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Pigs</i>
    </P>
    <P>Pig producers are especially vulnerable to increases in feed and other costs.  These costs have increased substantially over the past year and, although pig prices were increased twice in that period, some further improvement is now necessary.  The guaranteed prices for pigs will be increased by 60p per cwt with corresponding increases in bacon and pork export prices.  The cost of this increase will be £1 million in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sheep</i>
    </P>
    <P>While there is not yet a unified market support system for sheep in the EEC, the long term prospects for sheep and lamb are good.  It is in our interest, therefore, to maintain and <Col N="565" /> expand sheep production especially in mountain areas where sheep are the main enterprise.  The need to provide a better market outlet for wether lambs from mountain areas has become apparent and I am increasing the mountain lamb subsidy by an average of £1 per head on fat wether lambs of mountain breeds exported by meat factories, or alive, between next October and March, 1973.  This will cost about £250,000.</P>
    <P>The basic price on which export subsidy on all lambs is calculated has been increased by 2p per lb.  The gross cost of this will come to over £0.45 million which has already been provided for in the Estimates.  This will bring the gross total of new assistance for sheep farming up to about £0.7 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Horticulture</i>
    </P>
    <P>The horticultural sector is likely to face serious competition under EEC conditions and much remains to be done in regard to production, storage, grading and marketing.  I am providing £100,000 to meet the cost of various measures which will be introduced shortly by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Implementation of EEC Directives on agricultural reform</i>
    </P>
    <P>The EEC Council of Ministers recently adopted a directive on measures to assist agricultural reform by providing incentives for developing farms and financial assistance to those who wish to retire from farming.</P>
    <P>Although a significant proportion of the cost of implementing these directives will be recouped from the European Agricultural Fund a large part will have to be met from the Exchequer.  We can meet a considerable part of this cost by adapting many of our present aid schemes for agriculture. As the EEC directives provide for a wider range of aids than generally exist here at present, such as pensions for retiring farmers and reduced interest rates for a wide range of investment, I expect that additional funds will be required and I am providing a sum of £350,000 to enable a start to be made <Col N="566" /> this year.  Priority will be given to introducing very soon an interest subsidy scheme for the retention and expansion of livestock numbers especially on smaller farms.  Detailed arrangements will be announced later.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Further aid for small farmers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will announce details of further improvement in aids for small farmers.  The bonus instalments payable to participants in the small farm bonus scheme prior to 1st January last will be increased to £100.  A new temporary bonus scheme will be introduced for small farmers in western counties to assist them in reaching the production level at which they can qualify for support as development farms.  Finally, small farmers who are already above the production level specified in the small farm bonus scheme or who have completed a development plan under that scheme but who are continuing to implement further plans will benefit from the proposed new interest subsidy scheme which I have already mentioned. An additional £425,000 for small farm schemes has been provided for in the Estimates but I am adding another £100,000 now to enable these improvements to be implemented.  The total cost of these additional aids for small farmers over the next five years could reach £2 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>It has not been possible up to now because of the substantial cost involved, to implement fully the principle of parity for public service pensioners which was accepted by the Government in 1969.  Nevertheless, since then three pensions increases have been granted to public service pensioners at an annual cost of £3.9 million bringing their pensions up to a level based on June, 1969, pay rates.</P>
    <P>This year, it gives me particular pleasure to announce that I am granting parity to public service pensioners by bringing their pensions up to levels related to pay as on 1st January, 1972, the date of the most recent general revision of public sector pay.  The increased pensions will be payable from 1st October next.  The cost of the increase <Col N="567" /> will be £1.9 million in the current year and £4.2 million in the following year.  It will benefit retired civil servants, gardaí, teachers, members of the Defence Forces, local authority staffs and the widows of these groups. There will be a corresponding increase in military service pensions and other army pensions including special allowances. The percentage increase in individual groups will, of course, vary but the overall average will be around 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Veterans of the War of Independence</i>
    </P>
    <P>To give some additional assistance to the veterans of the war of independence and their widows, I have decided to increase and extend the funeral grants and to allow veterans' widows to benefit from the free travel scheme. At present, a funeral grant of £25 is payable in respect of holders of special allowances.  I am doubling this grant to £50 as from 1st April, 1972, and I am extending the concession to military service pensioners.</P>
    <P>I have decided also to extend the free travel scheme to the widows of the veterans.  This, in effect, means that the widows of military service pensioners, special allowance holders and other service medal holders will, as from 1st October, 1972, be eligible for free travel.  The cost of these concessions is £130,000 this year and £200,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the concessions which I have just announced in the fields of social welfare and agriculture and for public service pensioners and veterans of the war of independence will amount to £12.1 million this year and £18.2 million in a full year.  I will shortly be announcing concessions in the tax field but, before I do so, I wish to refer to a number of other matters which will be included in this year's Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Imposition of income tax and sur-tax as permanent taxes</i>
    </P>
    <P>When income tax was introduced in this country more than a century ago, it was described as a temporary tax. This polite fiction has been observed <Col N="568" /> ever since, and each Finance Act provides for the renewal of the tax for a further year, with or without a change in the rate of tax.  I think that it is now time to give statutory recognition to the accepted fact that income tax and the comparative newcomer, sur-tax, which was introduced some 60 years ago, are as much permanent features of our taxation system as are the other taxes and duties administered by the Revenue Commissioners.  As in the case of the other permanent taxes, the change will not in any way preclude modifications of the income tax and sur-tax to meet changing conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation profits tax.</i>
    </P>
    <P>A permanent statutory exemption from corporation profits tax applies to two classes of bodies one being companies established for the advancement of religion or education which are specially registered under the Companies Acts and are precluded from distributing profits to members, and the other being bodies corporate precluded by their constitution from distributing profits.  The relief for the latter class was intended to cover certain bodies set up under statute and, as well, companies registered under the Companies Acts which were established for charitable, social or philanthropic purposes and not for the enrichment of private individuals.</P>
    <P>Recently, a group of trading companies have sought to take advantage of this exemption by inserting a provision in their articles of association prohibiting the distribution of profits to members and claiming that they were no longer chargeable to corporation profits tax.  If this claim were to succeed, the effect would be that the charge to corporation profits tax on the profits of the companies concerned would be avoided so long as the prohibition on distribution of profits was maintained.  I propose to tighten the exempting provisions so that they will apply only in the circumstances for which they were intended.  The proposal will be effective as from today.</P>
    <P>A separate exemption from corporation profits tax which is provided on a temporary basis for certain public utility companies and other concerns, <Col N="569" /> including building societies, expired on 31st December, 1971.  Pending completion and consideration of the report of the inter-departmental working group which is examining the position of building societies, I propose to continue the exemption for a further year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Amendments of death duties legislation</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in the existing death duties legislation which I propose to remove.  The estate duty code provides for appeals to the Circuit Court from decisions of the Revenue Commissioners on the value of property, other than land or houses, if the value of the property in dispute does not exceed £50,000.  If, however, the value in dispute relates to land or house property, the appeal must be taken, in the first instance, to the property arbitrator appointed under the Property Values (Arbitrations and Appeals) Act, 1960.  There is a right of appeal to the Circuit Court from a decision of the property arbitrator provided the value of the property in dispute does not exceed £500.  Otherwise, the appeal has to go before the High Court.  I propose that this limit of £500 be raised to £50,000 to bring such appeals into line with appeals to the Circuit Court on the value of other types of property.</P>
    <P>Also, I have had under consideration the hardships which arise under the death duties code when illegitimate children, who have not been legitimised, inherit property from their mother, and when children adopted under the adoption laws of foreign countries inherit property from their adoptive parents who are domiciled in this country.  Such children bear legacy and succession duties at the maximum rate of 10 per cent and the abatements of estate duty provided in respect of legitimate children do not apply.  I propose to remedy this situation by providing that, for death duty purposes, illegitimate children will be treated as if they were, in fact, legitimate, and that, where foreign adoption orders have substantially the same effect as orders made under our Adoption Act, the adopted children will be treated as children adopted under our laws.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="570" /> Representations have been made me that there should be a body, like the income tax Appeal Commissioners, to determine death duty appeals in relation to the valuation of non-quoted company shares so that the costs and delays involved in taking appeals to the courts might be avoided.  There is already such an appeal body in existence for the valuation of real and leasehold property.  I have decided to extend the jurisdiction of the income tax Appeal Commissioners to cover appeals in the field of valuation of non-quoted company shares.  The appropriate provisions will be included in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Occupational Pension Schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>The existing provisions governing the grant of tax relief in respect of occupational pension schemes are contained in three separate codes enacted in 1921, 1922 and 1958.  I propose to introduce legislation to provide one comprehensive code which will be simpler and more liberal and will remove many existing anomalies.</P>
    <P>The present legislation will continue in force until 5th April, 1980, side by side with the new code.  This will provide a long transitional period to enable the trustees of existing pension schemes to acquaint themselves with the new provisions and to make any amendments in the constitutions of these schemes necessary for approval under the new code.  Until 1980, existing schemes will have the option to remain within the old code, as will new schemes established prior to 6th April, 1974.  On the other hand, existing or newly-established schemes may opt into the new code with effect from 6th April, 1972.</P>
    <P>
      <i>System of company taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The final item in this field to which I shall refer is the comprehensive examination of our system of company taxation which is nearing completion. In my financial statement last year, I indicated that I expected to publish, before the end of the year, the results of some aspects of this examination together with my views on the conclusions to be drawn from these results.  This work involved a <Col N="571" /> full statistical survey of companies including their capital structure, profits and dividends.  This survey has now been completed.  I expect to receive the report of the Revenue Commissioners within the next month or so and I hope to issue a White Paper on the subject in the summer. While the need to increase domestic economic growth and savings will be of paramount importance in determining the most appropriate system for the taxation of companies and dividends, I must also bear in mind likely developments in this field within the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income tax allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now propose to turn to the taxation reliefs which I am providing in the budget.  The Government have, for some time past, been concerned about the increasing burden of income tax, in particular on lower incomes. The incidence of income tax is relatively heavy in this country and in recent years the proportion of the total tax being paid by salary and wage earners has been increasing significantly. Relief for income tax payers has, therefore, figured high on the list of the Government's priorities in the taxation field and they have decided that this year a substantial alleviation of the burden should be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Personal allowances</i>
    </P>
    <P>The main income tax personal allowances were last increased in 1969. As is generally known, a major obstacle in the way of giving significant increases in these allowances is the cost involved, which is very substantial. However, I feel that the time has now come when further relief from the burden of personal taxation must be provided.  I, therefore, propose to increase the personal allowances for single persons by £50 to £299, for widowed persons by £50 to £324 and for married persons by £70 to £494.  In addition, each of the existing child allowances will be increased by £20. This means that single and widowed persons with earnings below £449 and <Col N="572" /> £474, respectively, will not be liable to tax.  A married man will be exempt on earnings below £744.  A married man with four children of whom two are under 11 years and two are between 11 and 16 years will be exempt if his earnings do not exceed £1,444.</P>
    <P>These increases which, it is estimated, will cost £11 million in the current year and £13 million in a full year will remove about 50,000 taxpayers from the income tax net.  As a result of the new allowances a single man will pay £17.50 less in income tax, a married man without children will pay £24.50 less and a married man with four children will pay £52.50 or £1 a week less.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Age relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>The existing minimum allowances for the purposes of age relief for persons aged 65 years are £150 for single and widowed persons and £250 for married persons.  As a further measure of relief in such cases, I propose to increase the minimum allowances to £175 and £300, respectively.  The effect of this, together with the increases in the personal allowances which I have already announced, will be that the exemption limits for persons entitled to claim age relief will be raised from £399 to £474 in the case of single persons and from £424 to £499 for widowed persons.  The exemption limit for married persons will be increased from £674 to £794.  The cost of the increased age relief is estimated to be £120,000 in the current year and £140,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Incapacitated children</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have had under consideration the question of relief for parents of children who are permanently incapacitated by mental or physical infirmity. While it is true that under the Health Services generous assistance is afforded in respect of such children, I have no doubt that in many such cases the parents are faced with substantial additional costs.  In recognition of this I propose to increase the child allowance in these cases by £50.  This is in addition to the general increase of <Col N="573" /> £20 which I have just mentioned, so that the total increase in these cases is £70.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health expenses</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present relief for income tax purposes is provided in respect of medical expenses exceeding £50 but not exceeding £500 a year per qualified person.  I am satisfied that genuine hardship occurs where heavy medical expenses are incurred in excess of the upper limit, particularly by the aged who may not be able to obtain medical insurance.  The number of cases involved is small.  I propose, therefore, to abolish entirely the upper limit of £500.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Credit Unions</i>
    </P>
    <P>Because of the important social role of the credit union movement, which is still in the early stages of development, I have, as Deputies are aware, been examining the present position, under tax law, of credit unions.  I propose to recognise their unique position by providing, in the Finance Bill, that operating surpluses of credit unions will be exempt from income tax and corporation profits tax.  The exemption will apply to existing unions from the date of their registration as credit unions.</P>
    <P>The cost of these three reliefs&mdash;for incapacitated children, health expenses and credit unions&mdash;will be £150,000 this year and £170,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rate of Company Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>I announced in my statement to the House on the economic situation on 27th October last that the increase in company taxation which was imposed in October, 1970, would be removed in two stages, one-half in 1972-73 and the balance in 1973-74.  In view of the urgent need to stimulate economic activity and to assist industry in preparing for EEC membership, I have decided that the restoration of the pre-October 1970 rate of company taxation should be advanced from 1973-74 to this year.  The cost of this concession, which reduces the rate of taxation of company profits to 50 per cent, will be <Col N="574" /> £2.7 million this year in addition to the sum of £2.7 million already taken into account in the pre-budget estimates of tax revenue.  When the provision for free depreciation is taken into account, the over-all tax position of companies is now, in fact, more favourable than it was before the October, 1970, increase.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free depreciation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year, as a special measure to encourage a concentration of capital investment in the two-year period ending 31st March, 1973.  I extended free depreciation to the whole country for that limited period.  Representations have been made to me that the concession cannot be claimed in cases where, although expenditure has been incurred, the asset will not be brought into use before the limiting date.  I propose to remedy this in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death duties relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have had under consideration the threshold at which estate duty becomes payable.  The present exemption limit is £5,000, introduced in 1960.  I have decided to increase it by 50 per cent to £7,500.  Furthermore, a new scale of rates from 1 per cent upwards will operate for estates between £7,500 and £11,000 so that these estates will also have their liability to duty reduced. The exemption limit for legacy and succession duties will also be raised from £5,000 to £7,500.</P>
    <P>When comparing the rates of estate duty chargeable in this country with those chargeable elsewhere, it is important that the abatements of estate duty provided here be taken into account.  These abatements provide considerable relief from duty where that relief is most needed, that is, in estates which pass to a widow or to a widow with a dependent children.  I increased these abatements last year from £1,000 to £1,500 in the case of the widow and from £500 to £750 in the case of each dependent child.</P>
    <P>This is an expensive form of relief. In the last financial year, it cost more than £650,000 in estate duty.  Nevertheless. I have come to the conclusion that further relief is called for and have <Col N="575" /> decided to increase the widow's abatements from £1,500 to £2,000 and the dependent child's abatement from £750 to £1,000.  In the case of a widow with-our dependants, the effect is to raise the exemption limit from £15,300 to £17,750; where there are three dependent children, the new exemption limit will be £30,200 as compared with £25,250 previously.</P>
    <P>These concessions will cost £130,000 in the present year and £500,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Financing the deficit</i>

    <P>The tax reliefs which I have announced will cost in all £14.1 million this year.  When added to the social welfare and other concessions and taking into account of the opening gap of £8.6 million, they bring the overall deficit in the budget to £34.8 million. To finance part of this deficit I propose to bring into the Exchequer an exceptional non-recurring receipt of £7 million from the Central Bank.  Arising from the expansion of the bank's activities and also from the exceptionally high interest rates obtainable on invested funds in recent years, a credit balance of this amount has accumulated in the bank in respect of surplus income.  This is additional to the surplus income from 1971-72 which will be payable in the normal course to the Exchequer this year.  The £7 million is a once-for-all payment and in future only the surplus of the immediately preceding year will be available for transfer to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The balance of the deficit&mdash;£27.8 million&mdash;will be financed by borrowing. To the extent that the budgetary measures give rise to increased economic activity, there will be a consequential increase in revenue which will reduce correspondingly the borrowing requirement.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Equal pay</i>
    </P>
    <P>Before coming to my concluding remarks, there are two important matters to which I wish to refer.</P>
    <P>The first of these is equal pay for women, which the Government accept in principle and which they now affirm as a national aim.  The second relates to efficiency in the public service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> The Government have been considering the interim report on equal pay submitted by the Commission on the Status of Women.  The Employer-Labour Conference have arranged that the working party established to negotiate on pay, with a view to reaching a new National Agreement, will take the recommendations of the commission into account in these negotiations. The Government welcome this decision and hope that agreement will result which will be acceptable to all.  Progress on this front depends on the will of the entire community.  Whatever general arrangements are accepted by the conference will be applied to the public service.  The commission also recommended the enactment of legislation to give effect to their proposals. They suggested that legislation should take into account any phasing arrangements agreed by the conference.  The Government will, accordingly, consider what specific action is required in this area in the light of the con-ference's finding.  It is also intended to consider the question of the ending of restrictions on the employment of women which, by excluding them from equal work with men, are an automatic barrier to equal pay.  It is hoped that the final report of the commission will be available when the legislation is being prepared.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the various restrictions under statute or regulation which comprise the &ldquo;marriage-bar&rdquo; in the public service are being examined.  It is hoped that all non-statutory restrictions on the employment of married women will be ended as soon as possible and that the necessary legislation for the repeal of any statutory restrictions and for the prohibition of restrictions on the employment of married women generally will be enacted within the period of two years recommended in the interim report.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Efficiency in the public service</i>
    </P>
    <P>Acceptance of the principle of equal pay will increase substantially the cost of pay in the public sector.  In view of the size of the bill for public service pay and its budgetary significance, no Minister for Finance could fail to be alive to the need for ensuring maximum <Col N="577" /> efficiency in the public service. This is not simply a matter of economy in administration, important though that is, but it is also a question of the quality of service provided to and on behalf of the community, a consideration which becomes a increasing significance in the context of our proposed entry to the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Foremost among measures to promote efficiency in the public service I must place the administrative steps, which are continuing, for the reorganisation of the public service.  As well as the legislation for the setting up of the Department of the Public Service, which will, I expect, be enacted during the current parliamentary session, two other main developments should be mentioned.</P>
    <P>First, the Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group emphasised the great responsibility of the Government to select the right men for the top posts in the new Department. The Government have recognised this by the exceptional arrangement whereby two of the three posts of Deputy Secretary in the new Department were filled by a competition open to all comers.  I am satisfied that, in this way, we have got the best available talent to carry the heavy burden of leading and directing the reform and reorganisation of our public service institutions.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Government have decided to accept, on an experimental basis, the major administrative reform recommended by the review group by initiating, in a number of selected Departments, the separation of policy and execution and by reshaping them into an Aireacht and a number of executive agencies.  I hope to deal with this subject in greater detail when introducing the legislation to establish the new Department.</P>
    <P>The efforts to achieve greater efficiency and to reduce costs in all branches and at all levels of the public sector are being intensified. Plans are well advanced for the introduction of more computers.  Operations research is being developed and strengthened.  A special unit in my Department has been set up to promote the application of management <Col N="578" /> by objectives in civil service administration. Useful results continue to be achieved in other fields, for example, those of work survey and organisation and methods.  The growth in recent years in training to promote efficiency will be accelerated.</P>
    <P>As I informed Deputies last year, programme budgeting is being introduced on a phased basis in Government Departments.  There are now eight Departments engaged activity in developing the system and it is the intention that it will be operational in all Departments by 1976.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effect on economy</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have completed the description of my budgetary measures and turn now to an estimate of their effect on the economy.  The additional spending power of almost £35 million released through this budget will raise the national growth rate by about 1¾ per cent between mid-1972 and mid-1973. This is over and above the contribution to growth and employment made by the increase of £30 million in the public capital programme.  The increased spending power is likely to cause a substantial increase in imports, and the balance of payments deficit will clearly have to be watched carefully.  If, however, during the year ahead our costs become more competitive and price increases are abated, I will have no great worry regarding our external position.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the competing requirements of economic policy.  In opting for growth, as against stability, through a budget deficit I am, indeed, taking a calculated risk&mdash;a risk that I may be fuelling the fire of inflation rather than the engine of growth.  It is essential, therefore, that there should be a widespread acceptance of the need to redouble our efforts to check price and cost inflation.  Unless we do so, much of the effectiveness of this budget will be dissipated.  We will fail to take full advantage of the boost which the budget will give to the economy if we allow the additional purchasing power to be eroded through continuing inflation.  Nor must we be content with merely a holding operation, with preventing price and cost <Col N="579" /> inflation from getting any worse.  We must aim at a worthwhile reduction in the rate of increase in costs and prices. This year, for the first time since 1959, prices will not have to be increased because of changes in taxation.  This contribution to price stability must be matched by a positive response from both sides of industry through the new National Pay Agreement.  This must take the form of a new agreement, markedly less inflationary than its predecessor, which will supplement and strengthen the budget's contribution towards moderating the pressure on costs and prices and increasing employment <Col N="580" /> and growth.  Without the cooperation of employers and employees, these objectives will be frustrated and the external deficit, which in any event is likely to increase substantially, could well be pushed to such a level that corrective measures would be unavoidable.</P>
    <P>I am confident, however, that the community will co-operate in ensuring that full advantage is taken of the opportunities which the budget provides for further advances towards increased employment and higher living standards for all.</P>

      <P>The economic situation of the country is now so bad that the Minister could scarcely have done less than what he proposes to do.  The question, however, is whether the Minister has done enough.  We are facing a situation in which we are living through a 10 per cent inflationary period.

      <P>As I was saying, when one considers the rate of inflation of 10 per cent, one realises the need for help which existed and one can measure correctly and accurately the steps the Minister now proposes.  A word of reflection is, perhaps, in order. Due to mistakes&mdash;some recognised in the budget statement today&mdash;and to lack of foresight and bad planning the present economic situation in the country is so bad that it can almost be regarded as critical.  Business activity has receded.  The absurdedly high corporation taxation, accompanied by a cost inflation which the Government did nothing to control, resulted in business activity in the last 18 months or two years definitely and obviously slowing down.  In addition, we have had in this period a price explosion. The consumer price index has advanced by over 9 per cent and is still rising.  This has meant that the value of money has been falling.  This could cause great harm if the trend continues. Added to these two significant factors is the fact that we now have over 77,000 unemployed.  For the first time that I can recall on budget day, those who came to represent some section of the unemployed were parading up and down outside Leinster House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the situation which has been brought about by this Government and by their inefficiency and by their lack of prudence and indecisiveness and the lack of any long-term policy.  With that situation confronting them, we have to examine what this budget proposes to do.  The most it can do is provide immediate relief.  The long-term cure for the economic situation of this country is a new Government and a new team.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is proposed?  Tax reliefs totalling £14.1 million.  Social welfare, agriculture and public service pension increases totalling £12.1 million.  This added to a stated initial deficit of £8.6 million gives a figure provided for in this budget of £34.8 million.  The Minister is taking £7 million from the Central Bank and is going to borrow £27.8 million.  In so far as it is necessary for the Minister, in the present <Col N="596" /> situation, to embark on deficit budgeting I welcome it and congratulate him on his courage in so doing. I said that before the budget and it has been the view of the Fine Gael Party.  However, I should like the Minister to come clean with the House, because I suspect that the extent of deficit budgeting which he states here today is not genuine.  In the first place, the Minister in his estimates for receipts and expenditure, claims as estimated expenditure this year to put in reserve for possible public service pay increases a total of £17 million.  That was never done before.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we had autumn budgets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was never done before and I suggest it is being done this time to conceal a surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was done last year and we did not have an autumn budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it was not done last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFOHiggins" hpid="Mr. O'Higgins Mr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The total public pay increase last year was £6.5 million.  Secondly, in a situation of inflation when personal expenditure is going to rise by at least 10 per cent, one can see in the estimated receipts the Minister allows an increase of nearly 4 per cent in relation to customs and excise revenue, and 6 per cent in relation to wholesale and turnover tax.  That, in my judgement, is not genuine, and the Minister and his colleagues in the Government know that they will get a great deal more from wholesale and turnover tax and from customs and excise.  They are not going to face the expenditure they mention here, and the plain position is that there was no opening deficit of £8.5 million.  It is in that regard that we must examine what is now being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a price explosion and every housewife in the country has suffered over the last 12 months.  From week to week, from month to month, in every shop and supermarket prices have rocketed upwards.  There has been <Col N="597" /> growing unemployment and decreasing business activity.  Is enough being done in this budget to rectify that situation? Let us see what is being done in relation to social welfare payments.  These are being increased.  Of course they had to be increased, but the rate of increase does not cover the rate of inflation up to this.  That is the first criticism I want to make.  I am glad of the extent to which the Minister proposes to help these people, but it simply does not go far enough.  If the Minister does not know it, I want to remind him that in relation to the pensioner, in relation to the person in receipt of social welfare payments, the rate of inflation of food prices increases is much higher on them than it is on other sections of the community, because that is the main item of their expenditure and they must bear the real brunt of increasing food prices. Therefore, while we can thank the Minister for what he has done, it is merely the half loaf.</P>
    <P>The Minister is providing parity for public service pensioners.  I want genuinely and sincerely to congratulate him, but I want also to remind him and the House that on each occasion of this budget statement since the promise was first made in 1969, I, on behalf of my colleagues, have asked the Minister, the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Finance, and Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Finance, to fulfil the solemn promise given to these people to provide parity. It is late but it is better now than never and we certainly welcome it.</P>
    <P>The Minister provides in relation to corporation profits tax that the reduction in the tax promised last October takes place now.  This of course has been a terrible story.  The Minister made a profound mistake in October, 1970, when he introduced this increase in corporation profits tax.  He did it in the teeth of advice; he did it when it was pointed out that the result would be further to bring a slackening in business activity.  He maintained an obstinate refusal to reduce this taxation in 1971.  It was not until eventually the brunt of the coercive facts forced him into taking action last October that he did it but only in a half-hearted sort <Col N="598" /> of way, promising to give back half the increase next year and the other half in the year after.  It was pointed out that that would not do; the situation was so serious that he would have to come clean.  Today he comes in to make, in effect, an admission that he was wrong, and profoundly wrong, in the last two years, and now he has to wipe out the increase he brought in two years ago.</P>
    <P>That is a good thing, but it is a very bad thing for the country that a mistake of this dimension should have been made and should have caused so much unemployment in the last 18 months.  The Minister and his colleagues have put thousands of men out of work by imposing this taxation initially and not removing it sooner than they did.  Lest those behind the Minister who applauded think the Minister is now doing something great to help Irish companies struggle on, it is worth reminding the Minister that he is merely restoring the position that 50 per cent of profits go in taxation, the position which obtained prior to his increase two years ago, and that meanwhile competing British firms have had their rate of taxation reduced to 40 per cent.  Now, even with this concession, Irish firms trying to trade on the Irish home market will still face British competitors with a 10 per cent taxation disadvantage. It is in that light that this concession can be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister does something about death duties.  Again what he does can be welcomed, but do not let us think that everything is marvellous in that respect, because what he does it merely to recognise the growth of inflation here and, while what he does is good, it certainly does not alter the real impact of these duties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the personal allowance but one must remember that the personal allowance was not altered in any way from 1955 until 1969, or 1970, and, in that year, there was a very small increase of £15 for the single person and £30 for the married couple.  The Minister now increases the allowance again but the increase in no way relates to the rate <Col N="599" /> of inflation over the last 15 or 20 years and it in no way compensates for the reduction in the value of money.  Each year, as a result of inflation and of the failure to deal with the fall in the value of money, the value of the personal allowance has dropped and any concession given by the Minister for Finance, unless it restores the position in real terms, is merely giving back a little of that which has been got in secret.</P>
    <P>These are my main comments on this budget.  To the extent that it is genuinely necessary for the Minister to engage in deficit budgeting in present circumstances, that deficit budgeting would have our support, but we are, so to speak, strangled with a deficit which the Minister has indicated is not a real deficit and I foretell that at some stage later in this year a full disclosure in that respect will be made. We are facing a serious economic challenge. We are on the eve of Europe and we are not prepared for it.  We have suffered badly from misgovernment and something urgent had to be done and to the extent that the Minister has done something in this budget, he will have our support.  But make no mistake about it; there is a crisis of confidence as between the business community and the Government at the moment, a crisis of confidence which is restricting investment.  People do not know what is going to happen.  They have no assurance that this Government is on the right lines and the long-term answer is a new team, a new government, and a new policy.</P>

      <P>It is amazing what can be done during what a great many people believe is going to be an election year.  Even if there is not going to be an election, there is the certainty of the referendum to be held on 10th May.  The greater part of this budget is designed to win support for entry into Europe or, perhaps, for the continuance in government of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I should like now to ask a direct question.  The Minister has been very, very careful in his arithmetic, in his estimates of receipts and expenditure, in his growth rate and so forth : can he say now, with any <Col N="600" /> sort of certainty, that there will not be a supplementary budget in the autumn?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity we do not have occasion to go to the country and seek the support of the people with more regularity because it would do a tremendous amount of good to those people to whom the Minister is doing good in this budget.  Everybody forecast that the budget would be a deficit budget.  Mark you, the Minister seemed to forget the lean years in between elections when Governments, not necessarily Fianna Fáil Governments, have their safe majorities and save up the jam, so to speak, for the election year.</P>
      <P>I believe this budget is designed to give a false picture of this as a happy and contented country, aye, and a prosperous country to boot, in order that it may appear to be more attractive in its intention to join the European Economic Community.  I do not think anybody would but welcome the long list of concessions in this budget, but we still have our basic problems, problems which were glossed over today to a very large extent.  The mistakes made by the Minister last year will not be corrected in any substantial way by the proposals he has put before the House this afternoon.</P>

    <P>This time last year on 28th April he said, when he introduced his budget, that the economy was &ldquo;on the mend&rdquo;. Was the economy on the mend last year?  It was the worst year as far as the economy was concerned for the last 12 years.  It was the worst as far as unemployment was concerned.  It was the worst as far as redundancies were concerned. The Minister for Finance or any other member of the Government cannot blame that on strikes, industrial strife or any sort of industrial disruption. There was every opportunity last year to engage in a programme <Col N="601" /> which, we believed, the Government were going to engage in when the Minister made his budget statement on 28th April but, lo and behold, the situation was so very, very bad the Government were forced to have two special debates on the situation of the economy, one in October, when the Dáil resumed after the Summer Recess, and the other in January, when the Dáil resumed after the Christmas Recess.  We were told in October that there would be an injection of £20 million into the economy in order to stimulate it and provide more employment.  Hire purchase restrictions were removed.  There was a lowering of company taxation.  All these measures were taken by the man who is now regarded as a clever Minister for Finance, but they had no effect on the growing rate of unemployment, particularly between October and December of 1971.</P>
    <P>It was the Minister's bad budgetary policy last year, his deliberate cutting back on capital expenditure, that was responsible for the situation in which we found ourselves.  He did all these things, in his own words, with a view to easing inflationary pressures.  The main policy error was the fact that everything the Minister did, presumably in consultation with his colleagues, created more and more unemployment. We did not see much evidence of the £20 million injected into the economy in terms of the provision of new jobs. In any case, the injection came too late.</P>
    <P>Because of the Minister's policy in relation to capital expenditure, it was a miserable winter for about 500,000 people living below subsistence level. It was also a miserable winter for the 80,000 odd unemployed.  The Minister said the £20 million would stimulate the economy and provide more jobs but from October to December, 1971, the unemployment figures jumped by an unpredecented total of 16,000.  The Minister said it was going to be a good year but, when we compare the unemployment figures in December, 1971, with those for December, 1970, we find that in that 12-month period there was an increase of 9,000 unemployed.  Then the Minister had the neck, as I said before, to tell us in April that the economy was &ldquo;on the mend&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> At paragraph 64 of the Review of 1971 and Outlook for 1972, which was circulated, there is an admission that as far as 1972 is concerned demand is going to be sluggish.  Maybe the measures which the Minister has announced here today will try to ensure that this sluggishness will be either stopped or decreased.  If unemployment is to be reduced demand must be stimulated by a budget deficit, by increases in the capital programme, which the Minister has announced today, we are glad to say.  We welcome the increase in capital expenditure of £30 million which the Minister said represents an increase of 15 per cent on last year but he must remember that prices last year increased by 9 per cent so that as far as the effects of the capital programme are concerned the net increase is only 6 per cent.  That, in my view, and particularly in view of the high rate of unemployment we have at present, is still not sufficient to deal with the basic problems we have, particularly as far as the provision of work is concerned.  As I said, 1971 was the worst year we had for 12 years.  In that period we had a 3 per cent increase in growth rate.</P>
    <P>The forecast for 1972, if it still is the forecast after the Minister's speech, is that it will be between 2 and 2½ per cent.  It is clearly the Government's duty, therefore, to increase capital expenditure even further to provide for that magical figure that was aimed at by successive Fianna Fáil Governments over the last 15 years of a 4 per cent increase in growth.  What we need now, despite what was said last year about inflation, is an increase in expenditure whether it be an increase in capital expenditure or, as has been announced to a limited extent, an increase in social welfare benefits, in pensions, or a reduction in taxation.  These things the Minister has done but these measures that he has and their details will be further discussed over the next week or two when Members of the House will have an opportunity of reading in greater detail the Minister's speech and considering the implications of it.</P>
    <P>If money is put into the pockets of people, particularly if it is put into the pockets of the working class people, <Col N="603" /> there certainly will be a diminution of the sluggishness to which the White Paper refers as far as 1972 is concerned. I believe that any improvement in the allowances for income tax will make some contribution towards the arrival by the two parties at a national wage agreement.  I should like to compliment those who are engaged in negotiating the national wage agreement, particularly the trade union movement.  The Minister will readily admit, as did his colleague, the Taoiseach, that the trade union movement did behave responsibly when the last national wage agreement was being negotiated.</P>
    <P>What we need more than anything else in this country are jobs, jobs for greater production, jobs for more money and jobs particularly &mdash; the Minister for Social Welfare should be interested in this &mdash; so that we will have less expenditure on unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. What the extra cost has been, as a result of the ineptitude of the Government over the last year in respect of these two social welfare payments, I do not know but I am sure they did not estimate for the colossal increase in unemployment and the money that had to be paid out as a result by way of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The budget is supposed to do certain things.  It is accepted as being an instrument to provide full employment, to provide for growth in the economy, a favourable balance of payments, price stability and, above all, equitable distribution of the wealth of the country.  The Minister has given concessions right down the line.  Those who get these benefits will certainly be pleased but will have reservations about them but who suffers in the meantime and who will suffer in the long term?  The Minister said he is going to borrow £28 million.  Those who have money in this country, those in whom the wealth reposes, are not asked to pay a bob.  My guess is that when the crunch comes and when the repayment of loans has got to be made, Ministers for Finance will resort to the simple but cruel expediency of taxing as they have done before, <Col N="604" /> items like food and clothing, things that are necessary for every person, every family.  I believe that in this budget somebody should have been making sacrifices because there are people who are making money, there are people who are accumulating wealth year after year and that is on the increase year after year.  They are not being asked to provide a penny in this budget.  On the contrary, as far as income tax allowances are concerned they will get the same as the agricultural worker, the plasterer, the civil servant, the same as those one would regard as having modest wages or modest salaries.  I believe there should have been some sacrifice from these people who have the money. Despite what the Minister has done as far as social welfare is concerned, and I would not like to be too qualified in my welcome for these things, we must realise that there is still approximately a half million people who could not be regarded as living any sort of comfortable life even when one has regard to the benefits they will get, some in October and some in August.</P>
    <P>Last year was a bad year all around and I think the Minister by implication, if not directly, said that was so but a peculiar thing about it is, and I talk not as an economist or knowing much about economics although about 90 per cent of the people in this House claim to be either professional or amateur economists, that though it was a bad year, though we had a big number of unemployed, our official external reserves increased by £91 million to a record £381 million.  Therefore, and I think the Minister may have got the message, it is obvious that the old argument for a stiff budget cannot be blamed on the balance of payments deficit.  Our external reserves are sufficient to offset any such deficit. At paragraph 69 of this review there is a certain amount of optimism and I trust that as far as the balance of payments is concerned we will not have this hoary and corny excuse hauled out any time we want to impose taxation.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister &mdash; I suppose we will get it in the Bill &mdash; what will be the obligation <Col N="605" /> of workers as far as social welfare contributions are concerned. We all welcome the social welfare increase no matter what it is.  I do not think an increase of the size the Minister mentions is satisfactory.  I know somebody could say: &ldquo;When you were there you gave a half crown.&rdquo;  That is a fact.  In two budgets, yes, but I am talking about 1972 now.  I do not think the increases are sufficient from many points of view.  We all meet our constituents from time to time, the couple who are on sickness benefit or the old age pensioner, and those of us who have pretty good salaries often wonder how in the name of God they exist.  How do they buy food?  How do they buy clothing?  How do they pay rent?</P>
    <P>The Minister could have done the country a service in a political sense. It is a well-known fact that has been stated in this House very many times that there is a big difference between the rates of social welfare benefits and assistance benefits payable in this country and those payable in the North of Ireland.  We have been asking for a long time that we should take initiatives. We all asked Mr. Heath to take initiatives.  He took some initiatives which got varying degrees of welcome in this part of the country.  In view of the situation existing at the present time the Minister could have done a little more to being the rates of benefit closer to those payable in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that he will borrow £28 million.  Why did the Minister not borrow £35 million or £45 million? Can he indicate what slide rule he used which indicated to the Government that the amount to be borrowed was £28 million?  The Minister says that the cost of the social welfare benefits increase will amount to about £11 million. It would have been a very good thing, not alone for recipients of these benefits but in order to allay fears in that respect of people in the North, if he had borrowed another £11 million so that our rates of benefit would come closer to the rates payable in the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I suppose there will be proposals about children's allowances but here <Col N="606" /> again the amounts payable in the North of Ireland and in Britain are greater than those which operate in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>I pose the question : if we can do all these things that the Minister mentioned by borrowing £28 million, what could we do if we borrowed £40 million?  The Minister must tell us why the amount was fixed at £28 million, whether it is the state of the economy or the anticipated state of the economy next year on entry to the EEC.  I do not know.</P>
    <P>This is a budget that we welcome for what is in it but it is a budget that I greatly suspect, especially as the Government party appear to find themselves in some difficulty as far as the referendum is concerned and may want to have a sweep out by holding a general election.  In my view the budget is designed to win support for the Fianna Fáil Party by the simple expedient of stating that the Government will borrow £28 million.</P>

    <Title>Financial Resolutions, 1972-73. - Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, 1971: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The object of the Bill is to confirm an order which I have made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953, on the recommendation of the Fair Trade Commission, relating to the supply and distribution of electrical appliances and equipment and also to confirm a related amending order.</P>
      <P>The commission's recommendation was made following the inquiry which they undertook on their own initiative following complaints from distributors that they were experiencing difficulty in procuring supplies of electrical goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their report of the inquiry, the commission state that there are over 70 Irish manufacturers of electrical appliances and equipment.  A high proportion of their output is sold on the home market, the requirements of which are also met to a substantial degree by imports.  Irish manufacturers sell to wholesalers or direct to retailers and contractors.  Imported appliances and equipment are sold by manufacturers' representative or agents to the wholesale trade or to retailers and contractors.  Some manufacturers' representatives carry on a wholesale business also, and some wholesalers have a retail business as well.  Many electrical contractors engage in the retailing of appliances and equipment.  There are six associations <Col N="609" /> representing the interests of manufacturers, manufacturers' representatives, wholesalers, retailers and contractors.  Over 100 witnesses representing trade associations, manufacturers, manufacturers' representatives, wholesalers, retailers, contractors, the Electricity Supply Board and the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards were examined in the course of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>The commission found that certain practices in the trade were not compatible with the public interest and recommended that an order be made to prohibit them.  These practices include coercion of a supplier by an association to withhold supplies or discriminate against any person; preparation or publication of lists of approved traders for the purpose of limiting entry to the trade or boycotting a supplier; re-sale price maintenance; collective fixing of prices by suppliers; and withholding of goods by a supplier because of prices charged.  The commission also recommended that the order should require a supplier to have written terms and conditions of sale and apply these terms and conditions to the acceptance of orders for goods.</P>
    <P>I accepted the recommendations of the commission and on 26th April, 1971, I made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Electrical Appliances and Equipments) Order, 1971, to give effect to the recommendations and also to provide in the light of the report that a supplier's terms and conditions should be framed in an equitable way, should not be unduly onerous, and should be applied in a manner which would not involve unfair discrimination. Subsequently I found it necessary to make the Restrictive Trade Practices (Electrical Appliances and Equipment) (Amendment) Order, 1971, which provides for a minor drafting amendment of the original order.</P>
    <P>Following the making of the original order and publication of the commission's report, representations were made to me by the Electrical Industries Federation of Ireland.  While not objecting to the terms of the order, the federation maintained that the evidence cited in the report related to practices <Col N="610" /> which no longer existed at the time of the inquiry.</P>
    <P>While I accept that many of the practices concerned had been abandoned, I wish to point out that the commission have acknowledged this where appropriate in their report and it is also true that some individual firms continue to be influenced in their distribution arrangements by policies which have been abandoned by trade associations.  Furthermore, the commission's report does not confine itself to practices of association but also embraces the activities of individual suppliers.  While I am glad to have received the federation's assurance that restrictive practices have been abandoned I am satisfied, nevertheless, that the orders to which this Bill relates are necessary to prevent restrictive practices which are outside the control of the federation or which might reappear at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have just said has not given Deputies the impression that the federation are restrictive in their outlook.  The impression I got from my discussions with them is that they have a constructive approach which is aimed at the raising of standards in the electrical trade.  In fact, in the course of the discussions, they put forward constructive proposals relating to safety standards and the training of personnel which my Department are examining in consultation with the other Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953 provides that orders of this kind shall not have effect unless they are confirmed by Act of the Oireachtas. The Bill now before the Dáil is the confirming Bill which is necessary to give the force of law to the orders concerned.  With Bills of this kind, the orders which it is proposed to confirm may not be amended by the Oireachtas but must be accepted or rejected as they stand.  The matters with which the orders deal have been the subject of a detailed public inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission, and their report sets out the arguments in favour of adopting the provisions embodied in the orders.</P>
    <P>I can, therefore, recommend this Bill to the Dáil without reservation.  Its enactment <Col N="611" /> will provide necessary safeguards against any future attempts at restricting normal competitive conditions in the electrical trade with consequent benefits to the trade and the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When a situation developed which caused these orders to become necessary, the House had to take action.  It was regrettable that this happened but I am glad of the assurance of the Minister that practice in the intervening years has shown that things have improved, that these things are not happening.  We welcome that situation and, as I intimated, we do not welcome the necessity to bring in a Bill of this kind and to make orders of the kind provided for in that Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a comprehensive piece of legislation and as far as we are concerned the salient point made by the Minister is that orders he will make will not be to stop things happening, because they have ceased, but so that they cannot happen in the future.  In other words, the intention here is to regularise matters in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acceptable to anybody who accepts free enterprise competition that we must ensure that fair play will prevail as far as we can do so.  In such circumstances we accept the necessity for making these orders and we are prepared to go with the Minister in that respect, although it is regrettable that a situation has developed or might develop whereby prohibition and coercion measures have to be introduced here.  Of course proper free enterprise competition within trade would obviate such a necessity.  Prohibition of lists of approved traders is something one must look at in more than one way. If one is selling an article like cigarettes it would be most unfair if an organisation prohibited certain people from selling them if those people were prepared to pay for their tobacco licences.  On the other hand, I believe it would be less unfair in the case of something which required servicing afterwards to prohibit a list being published of traders on the basis of their ability properly to service such articles. I am sure there is not anybody in the House who has not bought some sort <Col N="612" /> of electrical device which did not need servicing afterwards.  Some of the traders who do servicing are good and some of them, let us face it, are diabolically bad.  It is from that point of view that I wonder if prohibiting lists of approved service traders is wise.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, prohibiting lists of people from whom ordinary goods are to be withheld is one thing.  Resale price maintenance at the request of trade associations is something you could go to jail for in America if you were doing it and from that point of view it is right to ensure that no organisation may say: &ldquo;If you do not charge this for an article you will not be supplied with further or similar articles.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The rest of the Bill merely ties the whole thing into a neat bundle of powers.  The need to take such powers is regrettable though necessary and I welcome the Minister's assurance that such practices as existed have been discontinued anyway.  Long may that be so because it is unthinkable that people would be allowed to blackmail others and to assert influence and say whom they will supply and whom they will not supply.  However, I repeat the point I made in regard to such articles as electrical appliances such as refrigerators, icemakers and deep freezers because it is necessary that there should be a proper after sales service and it seems necessary that such goods should be monitored through the proper channels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that most of these practices have ceased.  From the point of view of keeping the cost of living at reasonable levels one should ensure in the supply of goods that competition should be the order of the day and that goods and services should be supplied at competitive rates.  When it comes to the question of any trade that supplies goods to the public, the public interest requires that the most competitive conditions should prevail.  The public are only too well aware of cost increases in the matter of foodstuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that electrical goods today are essential for the management of any household in any part of the country and any suggestion <Col N="613" /> that in these areas there should be agreements among traders and suppliers to keep prices at a particular level should be combated to the limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the constructive attitude of the federation.  I am glad to hear of that attitude.  He mentioned some suggestions they had made about safety standards and indicated that he was having discussions with these interests.  One would hope that the ESB would do more to advance the cause of safety in regard to both the installation and the fitting of inside apparatus in homes throughout the county.  For some years Jack Lynch &mdash; he was unfortunate enough to get that name &mdash; has been working alone without assistance from any public source in an attempt to bring about a greater public awareness of safety precautions.  He has made the point that this is an area which seems to evoke very little interest on the part of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he is having discussions with those engaged in the electrical goods trade and with the trade in general on safety measures. I hope from the constructive spirit he sees on the part of the federation that we will see some proposals advanced on how to bring about a greater awareness of safety precautions in the use of electrical goods.  This is not a matter to be put on the long finger.  I hope the Minister will be able to report progress on it very shortly.  There should be no reason from the Department's viewpoint why suggestions could not be brought forward very rapidly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a firm believer in free trade.  Free competition is of vital importance to the wellbeing of any business and to the public.  I am sure the recommendations made here by the Free Trade Commission are acceptable.  We must always remember that after sales service is of vital importance especially in regard to electrical equipment.  Retail establishments which sell electrical equipment and appliances can be very competitive at times.  Some retailers are prepared to sell at a very low profit. It should be pointed out when people are purchasing those goods that there is no after sales service.  There is a <Col N="614" /> distinct difference between a retailer giving a guaranteed after sales service and the particular retailer who is prepared to receive the goods from the wholesaler, sell them to his customers and then be finished with the matter.</P>
      <P>We know how complicated washing machines and television sets are and how costly it is to repair them.  There should be some standards for all those appliances in retail outlets.  I believe free enterprise is a good thing in business.  When there is competition in a locality you get better business and better service.  I would like to see something in regard to after sales service written into this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased with this Bill in so far as it is calculated to prevent practices which we all find objectionable. Price maintenance and price fixing behind closed doors is undesirable in any commercial enterprise.  I agree with the previous speakers that open competition is very desirable in any society.  The question of closed shop arrangements is very reprehensible. In a service like the electrical trade covering 70 manufacturers and six different associations selling a large variety of equipment, you are bound to have all sorts of different levels of standards and practices.  It is gratifying that the trade association and the federation have made any necessary corrections. However, there are some firms who are prepared to carry on restrictive practices.</P>
      <P>The question of safety in the electrical equipment trade has been mentioned. I always had the impression, certainly in regard to the wiring of houses, that the ESB took an interest in the matter.  I do not know whether any safety guarantees are required with regard to equipment from different manufacturing companies.  The Minister in his statement said:</P>
      <P>I accepted the recommendations of the commission and on 26th April, 1971, I made the Restrictive Trade Practices (Electrical Appliances and Equipment) Order, 1971, to give effect to the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now he comes here in April, 1972, with this Bill.  What has happened in the meantime.  I take it once the order <Col N="615" /> is made, irrespective of when the Bill is brought before the House, that it is effective.</P>

      <P>Therefore, it is necessary to come before the House and to have the Bill passed before anything effective can be done.  This seems to be a weakness in the system in that a person has to wait for one year to discover something which is fundamentally wrong.  It would seem to me to be in the interest of the public that it should be possible to get at the matter more expeditiously than to have to wait and go through the cumbersome method and the delay of bringing in legislation, perhaps a year after, to control something which could still operate throughout that year without being open to any real control.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that in his reply.</P>

      <P>It was natural, as this Bill confirms an order made some time ago, that it should be welcomed by the House.  As I said in my opening remarks, this Bill confirms an order made under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1953.  It was natural to assume that this Bill would be generally welcomed by the House in view of the fact that the order in question was made after a pretty exhaustive inquiry, at which many people contributed, by the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hogan spoke about the delay in making the order and also in having it confirmed.  Before the order was made, after the presentation of the report by the Fair Trade Commission, it was necessary to look into the changes that had taken place within the electrical industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It took some time to compile the report of the Fair Trade Commission after the inquiry, with the result that some of the restrictive practices which had been the subject of the inquiry had been done away with.  In fact, between <Col N="616" /> the time of the inquiry and the presentation of the report to me all of the restrictive practices which were being investigated had disappeared.  It would be fair to assume that the people in the industry who might have been guilty of unfair practices would have anticipated the report and would have abolished the practices.  In fairness to the federation in this regard, I must state that the practices which had developed have been done away with.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan referred to my statement when I said that the commission's report did not confine itself to practices of associations but also embraced the activities of individual suppliers.  I said that while I was glad to have received an assurance from the federation that all of those practices had been done away with, I was satisfied that the orders to which this Bill relates were necessary to prevent restrictive practices that were outside the control of the federation.</P>
    <P>That did not necessarily mean that there were individuals not within the control of the federation who were still indulging in restrictive practices because I am not aware of this.  Therefore, arising from what I have said, I should not like it to be taken that I was aware of the fact that there were people at present carrying on restrictive practices in contravention of the order I have made.  Arising from the question put to me by Deputy Hogan, it is right for me to say that the order I have made is not legally binding until this Bill has been enacted.  To my knowledge, there are not any restrictive practices in operation here and, even though this Bill has been on the stocks for some time, there was no urgency attached to it.  It is really to make sure that the problem &mdash; one that existed at one time &mdash; will not arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan said it was regrettable that it was necessary to have had an inquiry but, unfortunately, it was necessary to have an inquiry.  We hope it will not be necessary to have any prosecutions as a result of this measure and that restrictive practices will not develop in this industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick of Dublin said he would like to see some further provision <Col N="617" /> in the Bill dealing with the question of after sales service, or making regulations which would insist that wholesalers or retailers of electrical equipment should give some kind of assurance to customers regarding after sales service.  The purpose of this Bill is to confirm the order.  It can only be confirmed or rejected.  It cannot be added to or amended.  The order can only deal with matters into which the Fair Trade Commission have inquired and I must act and prepare legislation on the basis of the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission.  The commission did not investigate or report on after sales service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think we could have a discussion on that point in relation to the next Bill we shall be discussing. Up to now the Fair Trade Commission were restricted with regard to inquiries in relation to services.  However, this difficulty has been cleared up by the Restrictive Practices Bill with which we shall be dealing next.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Leary referred to discussions between the trade and the Department regarding the question of safety.  One of the points spelled out by the Fair Trade Commission in relation to safety standards was that the electrical industries were claiming as justification for a restrictive practice in which they were involved the necessity within their association to ensure standards by preventing new people from entering the industry.  They used by way of excuse for trying to create a closed shop the fact that they wanted to ensure that standards would be high, and, as a particular section, they thought they should involve themselves in a monopoly type of situation.  The Fair Trade Commission pointed out that a trade organisation which is concerned with the promotion of sectional interests was not a suitable medium for discharging functions relating to safety standards which would involve control over the admission of new entrants into the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the report of the Fair Trade Commission a new <Col N="618" /> council has been established.  It is known as the National Electro-Technical Council and it has been set up under the aegis of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  The object of this council is to bring about improvement in efficiency and safety and it can be backed up by the statutory powers of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It includes representatives of the ESB, Government Departments and various branches of the trade.</P>
    <P>During my time as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Power, I recall listening to comments in the House with regard to the responsibility of the ESB in relation to safety standards.  This council which is representative of the ESB, various Government Departments, the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and representatives of the industry, is studying the situation with a view to working towards greater safety in the manufacture and presentation of electrical articles.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary saw the advantage in this, in that you must have that degree of competition between the various manufacturers, wholesales and retailers in order to ensure that the consumer will get the article at the finished price, and that a type of ring or arrangement cannot develop such as developed some years ago.  If somebody sold a refrigerator, or electric fire, or any other electrical article at a certain price he was refused supply from the manufacturer because he did not maintain a particular price.  That has been done away with completely.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is simply and solely to ensure that type of development will not arise again.  I fully accept the claim that was made to me by way of protest.  When I introduced this order the federation protested on the basis that all what might be termed illegal practices that were then being conducted had been abandoned. As I saw it, it was necessary to make sure that the temptation would not arise again and I wanted to confirm that by way of legislation.  I am pleased that this Bill, which confirms the order and makes it legally binding, <Col N="619" /> has been welcomed by spokesmen from all sides of the House.  I hope that the necessity to take action under this legislation, which does not exist at present, will not arise in the future.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>We have become so familiar over the years with the operation of the Fair Trade Commission that, perhaps, many people have lost sight of the essential part it plays in the life of the country.  I believe that it is no exaggeration to call it essential, and that the Bill which I now introduce to this House is amongst the most important which I have had the honour of bringing before it.  The Irish nation has opted on the whole for a private enterprise economy, for we believe that, all in all, this is the type of organisation which best serves the real interests of the people.</P>
      <P>Like any other system, the system of private enterprise is open to abuse, and our commitment to it is on the basis that legal and administrative controls exist to prevent its being operated contrary to the common good. Perhaps the greatest attraction which the system has to offer is the stimulus which competition provides for economic enterprise and endeavour, and correspondingly one of the greatest dangers to which it is open is that the providers of goods or services may in one way or another join together to limit or even stifle competition between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fair Trade Commission has been the principal instrument for preventing this particular form of abuse in relation to the supply of goods, and now, under its new title of the Restrictive Practices Commission, I propose <Col N="620" /> to extend its operation to the provision of services, and to make a number of other changes in the law to provide for its more effective operation. I am glad to be able to say, and it is a good augury for the future operation of the legislation, that in the preliminary discussions which my Department have had on my behalf with many interests concerned, while there has been some criticism of detail there has been no rejection of the principle that the various sectors of private enterprise should be made subject to scrutiny from time to time as the common good may require.</P>
    <P>Legislation to control restrictive trade practices has been in operation in this country since 1953 and I think Deputies will agree with me that it has been very successful in liberating the distribution of goods of various kinds from the shackles of restrictive practices. The freedom of persons to set up business in any branch of trade has been safeguarded and traders have been enabled to conduct their businesses in the way that suited them so that competition has flourished with resultant benefits to the efficiency of distribution which, in turn, have led to competitive prices for the consumer. Many changes have, however, taken place since 1959 when the original 1953 Act was amended, and it is desirable to fashion a still more effective legislative instrument suitable to conditions in the seventies.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House, which consolidates existing legislation, contains two major new provisions. Services, including professional services, are brought under control, and secondly, the investigatory work hitherto performed by the Fair Trade Commission will be carried out by a new officer described as the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  The feeling has been growing among those who are concerned with the efficiency of our economic operations that the promotion of competition should extend beyond the distribution of goods and that it was important that the provision of services should reflect the benefits of competition in the prices charged to consumers who may be industrial or commercial enterprises or the man in the street.  A specific recommendation <Col N="621" /> to this effect was, in particular, made by the National Industrial Economic Council in 1967.</P>
    <P>I think also that it is hardly necessary for me to tell Deputies that if a separate officer carries out investigation and there by leaves the Fair Trade Commission free to concentrate on the task of conducting public inquiries and furnishing reports on them to the Minister for Industry and Commerce there will be a decided increase in the speed with which inquiries are completed.  Inquiries of this kind involve problems and questions which are increasing in complexity as our economy grows, and as international trade becomes more diversified and pervasive.  The division of functions between the commission and this officer will also help to ensure that the commission will, both in reality and appearance, approach each inquiry in a detached and impartial manner.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Trade Practices Acts, 1953 and 1959, provided for the setting up of the Fair Trade Commission, which is continued in being, by section 2 of the Bill, under a new name &mdash; the Restrictive Practices Commission. The First Schedule applies to the commission and embodies the provisions of the First Schedule to the 1953 Act, except that those conferring powers of investigation are omitted and conferred on the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  Section 3 provides that the commission and the examiner shall have regard to the restrictive and unfair practices listed in the Third Schedule to the Bill, which is an adaptation of the Second Schedule to of the 1953 Act to take account of the increased area of operations brought about by the inclusion of services.</P>
    <P>The commission, at present, operate towards the elimination of restrictive practices in two ways.  They may publish fair trading rules which, in their opinion, represent fair trading conditions in the supply and distribution of any kind of goods.  Section 4 of the Bill continues this power suitably adapted to apply to the provision of services as well as the distribution of goods.  Fair trading rules have no legal force and it is not intended to give them any in the Bill.  The commission <Col N="622" /> may also, at present, hold a public inquiry into the supply and distribution of any kind of goods, in the course of which they may investigate services only to the extent that they are rendered in the course of carrying on any trade or business under investigation.</P>
    <P>In other words, services must be directly related to the supply and distribution of goods and include such matters as delivery, credit and after sales services.  Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill continue this power of public inquiry but widen it to include all services other than banking, electricity supply, transport and services provided by local authorities which are controlled by legislation designed to meet the special characteristics of these services. An important change is that the commission may not hold an inquiry on their own initiative, but must do so on the recommendation of the examiner.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the making of reports by the commission, and section 8 provides that on the basis of these reports the Minister may make orders which will not have legal effect until confirmed by Acts of the Oireachtas. Similar provisions are in the existing legislation, but I feel that the wording in the Bill will make for greater clarification of the intention behind the legislation by explicitly including unfair practices and unfair methods of competition amongst the matters on which the commission are required to report and concerning which the Minister may make provisions in orders.  The existing legislation put the emphasis on the prevention and restriction of competition as matters on which the commission should report and these remain in the Bill as essential factors.  I feel that in these days of intense competition as matters on which the commission should report and these remain in the Bill as essential factors.  I feel that in these days of intense competition from powerful financial interests when small independent traders are struggling for survival there should be no doubt that the legislation gives power to outlaw any practice or method of competition which is unfair or against the common good.  I am sure that Deputies will agree with me that the amendment of these central provisions of the legislation in this respect is essential in modern conditions.</P>
    <P>Sections 13 to 17 and the Second <Col N="623" /> Schedule provide for the appointment and functions of the Examiner of Restrictive Practices.  It is envisaged that he will investigate the supply and distribution of goods and the provision of services and furnish the commission with reports of his inquiries, and he may recommend the commission to hold a public inquiry under section 5, in which case the commission is obliged to make copies of his report available to interested parties.  The examiner may also give evidence at an inquiry and may call and examine witnesses.</P>
    <P>Restrictions of competition and abuses of power by powerful firms in any country may be expected to affect business in other countries to an increasing extent as trade barriers are lowered, and I feel that the commission and the examiner should be empowered by law to take action. Section 14 empowers the examiner to investigate any restriction of competition or any unfair practice or unfair method of competition or any abuse of a dominant position by firms outside the State.  Deputies will appreciate that the exercise of his powers in the conduct of such an investigation must be confined to the area under the jurisdiction of the State, but it may be anticipated that a considerable amount of information will be obtainable from outside the State without the aid of any specified powers.</P>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission is obliged by section 11 to examine every such report and give observations on it to the Minister, and may make recommendations as to what action should be taken.  In addition, the commission is obliged by section 12 to study developments in other countries with particular reference to the operation of international firms.  I think that it is necessary to lay statutory obligations on the commission and the examiner in regard to these matters because of the existence today of international co-operation in the elimination of harmful restrictive practices.  I believe that such co-operation will increase as we establish closer relationships with other countries in the interests of the economic well-being of our people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> The commission is also required by section 12 to study and analyse the effect on the public interest of methods of competition, types of restrictive practices, monopolies, mergers, take-overs, multi-national companies and market structures, and the operation of relevant legislation.  I would like to point out that these functions of the commission do not involve the use of any powers of investigation, but their reports would be based on the knowledge and experience which they will garner in the course of their activities, supplemented by the study of published material and their contacts with corresponding bodies in other countries and with international organisations.</P>
    <P>These, in brief, are the main provisions of the Bill which I now put before the House.  I think all Deputies will immediately recognise its importance and will appreciate that in the Restrictive Practices Commission and the office of examiner the Bill creates two organs of State of very great significance, and arms them with powers and entrusts them with responsibilities which must have a real influence in shaping the world in which we live. Let me say here that I am very conscious of the need to make a careful selection for the post of examiner, and that I shall take particular care to make a suitable choice.  With the entry of the commission into new fields of activity, also, I shall, in any case where the subject matter of an inquiry seems to call for specialised qualifications, be prepared to add to its membership one or more suitably qualified members for the purposes of the particular inquiry.</P>
    <P>I hope that the industries, trades and professions which from time to time come under the scrutiny of the examiner and the commission will continue, as has been the general experience in the past, to co-operate with the operation of the law.  One of the very gratifying features of the operation of the existing Acts has been the almost complete absence of any need for legal action to enforce the various restrictive practices orders: I think this might be taken as a tribute both to the commission and to the good sense and public spirit of those trades with which it has come in contact.  I am sure we <Col N="625" /> may expect a continuance of this sensible approach under the regime of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>At this point, it is only right for me to pay a tribute to the past and present members of the Fair Trade Commission. There have inevitably been some isolated cases of friction between the commission and other interests, but on the whole I believe it would be true to say that they have been throughout enlightened and public-spirited in the performance of their functions, through in their inquiries without being inquisitorial and assiduous in taking up individual complaints whilst at the same time retaining an understanding of the constraints which may sometimes compel businessmen to adopt practices which may appear restrictive. Over the years, they have carried out a difficult task well.</P>
    <P>I now recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point that the Irish nation had, on the whole, opted for a private enterprise economy.  He was merely stating a fact but it is well to state it because it is true and it is because of the complex nature of the modern world that legislation of this kind was first introduced in 1953.  We are now bringing it up to date and expanding it as is necessary. The ideal would be to have fair competition in all trades and the consumer benefiting from that competition and a situation in which the better quality at the better price got the business. But as the Minister in various ways in his speech pointed out, this is not always the case in modern conditions. It is a very complex situation and all sorts of things interfere with the simple free competitive situation to the detriment very often of the consumer and often also of the person engaged in the business as an entrepreneur and of the workers involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept that in 1972 legislation of this kind, though, perhaps, ideologically unpleasant to some of us, is a necessity and can be, in fact, more of an insurance against improper acts and ideas than something that might end up with somebody appearing in <Col N="626" /> a court of law.  It is very difficult to find the proper price of a commodity when you think of all the world companies which have spread their tentacles throughout different nations, the cartels which have arrived, the power blocks, the supermarkets and so on. The Minister mentioned the small trader near the end of his speech and it is true that, in fact, in our sort of economy there is not much he can do that positively helps him against the operations of the large supermarket supplier.  My hope in respect of this Bill is that it would channel trade into free enterprise competition within the rules of the Bill and provide rules and guidelines for supply services and supply trade in which they can compete freely one with another and in fair competition.</P>
    <P>Up to a point the Minister is to be the examiner and he was eloquent on the point that he must think very seriously and address his mind in the most direct way to the appointment of the examiner.  Before reading the Minister's speech I had made a note to the effect that a more proper procedure might be a chairman or as he might be called, an examiner, with a representative of the consumers as well as a representative of the supply trade and one of the manufacturing trade to whom he would have recourse before deciding to hold an inquiry or to take any of the steps that he would be empowered to take under his Bill.  I suggest to the Minister that this procedure would eliminate the possibility of anybody alleging that he had appointed somebody who was a creature of his own making.  The examiner would probably find it necessary to take steps that might be unpleasant or to make various decisions and, of course, there would be people who would say that he had been appointed by the Minister because he was friendly with the Minister or it might be said that a particular inquiry was not held because the Minister was in a position to say to the examiner that he should not hold that inquiry.</P>
    <P>The examiner will be the person to initiate inquiries.  If he did not have the power to do so, he could be stultified to some extent; but just as the <Col N="627" /> President can consult with the Council of State before signing a Bill, it might be a good thing if there was machinery whereby the examiner could consult with representatives of the interests concerned before reaching a decision. In that way he would have available to him the advice of the particular interests involved but, of course, these interests of their nature, would be vested interests and, consequently, they should not have the right to decide whether there should be an inquiry but should have the right to put forward their point of view to the examiner.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to make relates to agencies.  The Fair Trade Commission have acted fairly down through the years.  They have had to adopt certain attitudes.  In respect of the Bill that has just been passed by the House there was an indication in the Minister's speech that the interests concerned had told him they had been operating certain practices but that these had ceased.  The question of agencies is one that must be considered in a detailed manner.  It is necessary that the consumer should have available to him a good service at the lowest possible cost.  An example of what I have in mind is bottled gas which is available through individual traders throughout the country.  These agents have the responsibility of maintaining stocks in containers of various sizes and I have yet to hear of anybody who has not been able to obtain gas in the size of container required.  The service is excellent.  It has been possible for the main suppliers of gas to exert sufficient discipline on their agents that ensures an excellent service to the consumer. Obviously, the Fair Trade Commission would not be involved in so far as bottled gas is concerned but it is possible that the examiner might say to an industry that they would not have individual agents in every village in Ireland but that they would supply to the trade.  In relation to the particular item I am giving as an example, I can recall two situations where traders approached their local representatives and asked them to assert influence for the purpose of ensuring that they were appointed as agents.  Their case was that there was no other agent in the <Col N="628" /> areas.  However, it was decided that neither trader should be given an agency.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that bottled gas should be in the agency bracket.  Therefore, it may not be an appropriate commodity for me to cite in this instance. It is very much in the black area but there are other commodities which are very much in the white area and in respect of which there should be agencies.  Without mentioning the name of any manufacturer, I would refer to certain drapery goods such as ladies' high-class suits and frocks which are the subject of agencies in various towns throughout the country.  In some towns there is one agent for the goods while there might be two in another but if one was to follow in spirit the whole theme of this Bill every draper in a town might say: &ldquo;I have a right to supply this particular brand name of ladies' wear&rdquo;.  The reason for the agency arrangement is quite clear: the lady who wishes to purchase these articles will have a wide range from which to choose and the manufacturer can exert influence on the agent to ensure that he maintains the wide range to which a person wishing to purchase this brand of articles for a second or third time should be entitled. Such a person should not have to go into every drapery on the street to get what she wanted.  That is the grey sector where one might say there should not be an agency but undue interference in relation to agencies in so far as this Bill is concerned would be a mistake.</P>
    <P>Regarding services, can the Minister say whether professional services are to be included?  Are such people as doctors and dentists to be included as was the case in the Prices (Amendment) Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no comment to make on that because since it has been covered in prices legislation, I suppose it might as well be taken in here.  I do not think it would have any effect on the services provided.  However, one of the services that comes to mind is the question of repair services on a car.  The services comprise <Col N="629" /> those of the mechanic together with the different tools used and all the equipment that is needed for a garage and all of which must necessitate a higher rate than would merely the mechanic's rate plus a normal profit.  These services are now taken in.</P>
      <P>Services should, in fact, be included, if goods are included.  The Minister said that it would be in order to discuss aftersales services on this Bill.  One must ask whether the restricting of the supply of certain goods to agencies may not be a good thing.  Deputy Fitzpatrick, Dublin, from the other side of the House agreed with me when I said that we all had experience of good and bad aftersales service.  I gave instances of articles which, of necessity, must have good aftersales service.  If I were to buy an icemaker for a bar, or a deep freeze for a restaurant, or a cold room for meats for a restaurant from a small electrical supplier in a small village believing that I would get the sort of service that would come from a specialist in this particular line who had been instructed by the manufacturer in regard to aftersales service, I would be very foolish.  The manufacturers might not be in a position to tell a very small operator that they could not supply goods to him.  It would be a mistake on the part of the manufacturers to give the goods to such a man.  If one does not get satisfactory aftersales service, one is as likely to blame the goods as the aftersales service.  These points should be examined in detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A local solicitor spoke to me about the following points a few months ago. A client of his bought a car on hire purchase.  The description of the car as given to him by the purveyor of the car included certain things.  It was said that if anything happened to the car within three or six months it would be looked after for him free of charge. Then another agreement was put before the purchaser by the garage.  He signed this second agreement.  The car needed a major overhaul after 150 miles.  When he brought the car back to the garage they refused to take it back.  He brought the two agreements to his solicitor and they read the small print.  The small print completely indemnified any director or proprietor of <Col N="630" /> the garage or any of their servants or employees of whatever standing from anything they might have said when selling the car.  That innocent man bought that second-hand car, signed the agreements and did not read the small print.  Such agreements should not be allowed.  This Bill could provide that such agreements would be null and void and that the production of such agreements to any possible purchaser by a garage would be an offence.  From my experience as a Deputy I feel that there is valid reason for this.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to members of the Fair Trade Commission. They have not a very enviable job. Many of them will continue in their particular vocations in life at the Minister's behest after this Bill becomes an Act.  In his speech the Minister says:</P>
    <P>The freedom of persons to set up business in any branch of trade has been safeguarded and traders have been enabled to conduct their businesses in the way that suited them so that competition has flourished with resultant benefits to the efficiency of distribution which, in turn, have led to competitive prices for the consumer.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Fair trading rules have no legal force and it is not intended to give them any in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The unfair practices described in the Third Schedule of the Bill seem to me to indicate fair trading rules.  The Third Schedule reads:</P>
    <P>Any measures, rules, agreements or acts, whether put into effect (or intended to be put into effect) by a person alone, in combination or agreement (express or implied) with others or through a merger, trust, cartel, monopoly or other means or device whatsoever, which&mdash;</P>

    <P>and so on.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister if, in fact, the operation of the Third Schedule of the Bill would constitute an offence and if, in fact, such an offence is punishable.  Is the Minister's statement correct or incorrect in this respect?  Section 23 defines the penalties. I do not want to go into the question of the penalties.  One can read about them.  Are the unfair practices listed in the Third Schedule, if contravened, subject to the penalties listed in section 23?  That is important.  It is wise that the new Fair Trade Commission should also have the duty laid upon them to observe things outside the State.  Many years ago a certain commodity was being sold at 30s in Liverpool and 40s here.  The production unit here was absolutely new and was the biggest in the country, and the production unit in Liverpool was 50 years old.  An ex-Member of this House drew attention very forcibly to this occurrence.  I do not believe in mentioning companies or people here.  It is necessary to look at affairs outside the State.  If, 30 years ago, somebody could make big money&mdash;admittedly, behind trade barriers which will soon disintegrate&mdash;then surely it is necessary to look into this matter now.  The progress of cartels, monopolies, international combines and the coming together financially of huge organisations has continued during all that time. Developments outside the State should be examined.  There is also the duty of studying and analysing mergers and takeovers.  This is the duty of the Fair Trade Commission.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="632" /> At the moment a company connected with the Industrial Credit Company called Mergers Limited are encouraging mergers.  It is quite wrong for anyone to decide that all mergers are wrong.  In present economic and industrial conditions it may well be that two out of three mergers are right, but, nevertheless, if the third merger were wrong fundamentally, it should not occur.  I want to know what teeth are in this Bill in relation to a merger which in the view of the Government and of the Fair Trade Commission should not occur.</P>
    <P>I also note from the Bill that the Fair Trade Commission will make fair practice rules, that notice will be published of these rules, and that inquiries will be set up at the request of the examiner appointed by the Minister.  Perhaps it is my own lack of perception that puts me a little wrong here&mdash;I am not being critical; I just want to get this clarified&mdash;but on page 4 it says:</P>
    <P>Fair trading rules have no legal force and it is not intended to give them any in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not see the point of publishing a list of fair practice rules if no legal force will apply to them.  Surely the Bill we dealt with earlier, the Restrictive Trade Practices (Confirmation of Orders) Bill, goes further than that. Therefore I would like to know from the Minister when he is replying what is the position in relation to these fair practice rules.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, in our complex, modern society, this Bill must be accepted as necessary.  In very few instances or certainly in a much lesser number of instances I would say it was always necessary even before 1953. However, as we have more of these mergers, international agencies and so on, it will be necessary from the consumer's point of view, from the trader's point of view and, from the point of view of the manufacturer who is outside the ring, to have such an institution as is provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill is one that should be dealt with in some greater detail on Committee Stage.  It is rather complex and there are various quite separate sections, <Col N="633" /> separate both in their nature and in their approach to the problem.  That being so, I am sure the Minister will have no objection to giving us a reasonable time to consider them and to put down amendments.  The very fact that the two principal Acts of 1953 and 1959 are of that vintage surely indicates that there was need for a change. As the world changes we have to change our legislation, and no legislation that is passed in this State can be perfect forever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of activity into the area of services under the new Restrictive Practices Commission is to be welcomed.  I note from the Minister's speech that in 1967 the National Industrial and Economic Council advocated such an extension, but it is rather a pity that it has taken almost five years to adopt that recommendation of the NIEC.  Indeed, over the whole area of consumer protection there are ample recommendations and suggestions there for some time which have not yet been acted upon.  The Minister and I shared a television programme last year in which reference was made to various surveys which had been made and had not been acted upon.  Here is a recommendation which is being acted on five years later; I suppose we should be grateful it is not ten years later.</P>
      <P>Many people may say probing is unnecessary in the area of services, that it is yet another unwarranted bureaucratic intrusion.  Unfortunately, while the experience is not general, members of the public have complained that in the area of services there have been, to some extent, if not restrictive practices, certainly practices that had little to do with open competition as in other areas of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also proposes to appoint a new examiner of restrictive practices.  According to the description of him in this Bill, he would seem to be an economic ombudsman.  We live in an age when to appoint an ombudsman is regarded as the solution to practically every problem.  I wish this gentleman, whoever he is, well in his appointment.  His task, as set out in the Bill and in the Minister's speech, appears to be a very large one indeed, <Col N="634" /> keeping an eye on the practices of international companies and on how they operate in the State, having a look at mergers, take-overs, and so on. Obviously this will require an office with a number of people working fulltime in it, and it appears as if it will become the executive of the new Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister proposes to appoint this new examiner. Since the area to be covered by him is a new one, a difficult area, and since the skills called for are not those which at present obtain in many areas of the public service, I hope that the Minister will look outside the public service into the general economic life of the country to see whether a suitable person is available.  I hope he will also consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with the employer organisations, to see that whoever fills this position knows his job and has some possibility of fulfilling the heavy obligations imposed on him in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to investigating mergers and take-overs and their effect on particular sections of industry, on employees and on employment, apart from the economic benefits which are supposed to flow from rationalisation through a merger.  Part of the weakness of Irish industry is that our units are so small, and it seems, on economic grounds, to be a good thing that there should be more mergers to make them more competitive internationally.  So far our experience has been that mergers mean loss of jobs.  Therefore I would hope the new examiner would not forget the social dimensions of his job, that he would consider that, while something might be advisable economically, there may be a social cost which the community should not be asked to pay.</P>
    <P>Under section 12 the commission appears to have the task of making reports.  Obviously there will have to be a very clear connection between the examiner and the commission, even under its new guise, with its expanded function of investigating services.  I would hope that the Minister, when he comes to reply, would give us some further information as to where exactly he hopes to find this particular <Col N="635" /> individual who will fulfil the onerous obligation of examining.  I suggest he should consult with the trade unions and with those engaged in economic life in order to find someone competent to perform this task.  Someone in the United States has undertaken this task on his own and has been engaged on it for many years now as part of the Senate investigation into prices.  He has written books on the safety of motor cars and so forth.  This particular function certainly calls for a man with extraordinary qualifications and extraordinary zeal.  The task will be both difficult and challenging.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his search and I hope he will take the advice of those with experience in this field.  For many years the trade union movement has been calling for a greater scrutiny of the cost of both goods and services. I am not suggesting the Minister could lift a trade union official for the job, but he could do worse.  I hope he will consult with the unions.  I can visualise a few who would be as good at keeping down prices as they are at seeking higher wages for their members.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The expanded Fair Trade Commission will play a very important role in both distribution and manufacture.  I agree with previous speakers that the success of the commission will depend on the personnel and on the examiner.  The latter will play a very important role. I had experience once of the existing Fair Trade Commission.  The time has come now when we must move away from staffing these bodies with civil servants.  I should like to see outsiders, economists and people qualified in industry, members of the commission.  It will be vitally important to ensure that the commission will have a through knowledge of the industry brought before it.  No civil servant could have such a through knowledge of every trade and business.  I believe the examiner will be the equivalent of a solicitor processing a case.  He will have to make inquiries to find out if there is discrimination or unfair practices. He will have to be a man qualified in industry and in the services.  I wish the Minister luck in his appointment <Col N="636" /> because on him will depend the holding of inquiries.  I believe, too, that the decision of an impartial inquiry will be accepted by those who are inquired into.  They will not feel victimised.</P>
      <P>I am delighted services will be investigated. Service generally and aftersales service is of vital importance.  The cheapest product is not always the best value.  The standards set by various retailers must be taken into consideration. There are different standards. There is the problem also of people setting up in business who have no qualifications for that business.  Those who are qualified can give aftersales service.  Where the personnel in the business is unqualified a sign should be displayed to the effect that aftersales services are not provided.  Those who go into the distribution trade should be trained in that trade.  I believe that in some countries this is compulsory.</P>
      <P>I trust that the commission will be empowered to investigate discounts.  A small retailer who places an order for ten dozen of a particular article will get a discount of 5 per cent.  The large supermarkets which purchase 100 or 200 dozen will get a discount of 25 to 30 per cent.  There is an element of unfair practice in this.  The small retailer cannot sell the article at the same price as the large supermarket and he is, therefore at a disadvantage. When a manufacturer assesses his costings he takes into consideration the fact that he will have to give a 25 per cent discount to the supermarket and this works to the detriment of the small trader because it results in raising the price of the commodity right across the board.  I trust the commission will investigate this.  The smaller traders cannot compete and every day we see them being forced out of business because the large supermarkets get such big discounts.  These discounts increase the list price of the goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe in fair trade and I welcome the Bill.  Fair trading is the life blood of business.  I do not approve of small retail outlets opening in close proximity to each other.  This works to the detriment of the trade and can result in bad service.  I wish the Minister every luck.  I hope that the examiner he <Col N="637" /> appoints will be a man capable of looking over the broad spectrum of all types of business and industry.  It is a very complex and difficult field but I do not doubt the Minister's ability and I wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>A very delicate approach towards this Bill is necessary. There are two types of attitude which could be adopted by a commission investigating trade practices.  One would want to ensure that trade practices that interfere with fair competition are not allowed to be carried on. On the other hand, one must exercise a certain amount of care to ensure that the State does not interfere to too great an extent with private enterprise or with business. A delicate approach is necessary.  I have tried to approach this Bill with this attitude, realising that such a restriction on trade practices is necessary but endeavouring to ensure that we do not have too much State interference in business.  A lot of State interference in business, in services and in industry can stultify growth.  We look to the State to increase incentives, to encourage growth, but we must ensure that there are not too many ties or holds on business and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill could cause interference with business.  Nevertheless, I welcome its general principles.  The last speaker, Deputy Fitzpatrick, mentioned something upon which I would like to enlarge.  He spoke about the smaller business.  The Minister has also mentioned this matter.  At present in cities and large towns big supermarkets are closing down the smaller businesses&mdash; the small grocery, greengrocery, drapery, wholesale confectionery, butchering business and fish shop.  One of the factors, as Deputy Fitzpatrick said, is the discount.  As well as that, because of large sales of goods the supermarkets are able to reduce prices of certain commodities.  When the housewife sees that prices are higher in the small shop she goes back to the supermarket.  Ninety-eight per cent of supermarkets are strictly cash.  They do not carry as much credit as the smaller shopkeeper who still carries quite an amount of credit.  Customers pay him <Col N="638" /> on a weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis.  The shopkeeper must carry this credit.  He is paying interest and his overdraft is increasing all the time.  The small shopkeeper is being slowly and steadily squeezed out of business.</P>
    <P>I would hope that this Bill would ensure that unfair practices, which are quite commonplace among supermarkets, are looked into to ensure that the man with the small business is safeguarded.  This is essential for the wellbeing of smaller towns and villages and, indeed, cities too because such businesses are good for the country and it is a tragedy to see them being squeezed out of business.  I hope that the examiner, when appointed, will ensure that smaller businesses are given support and safeguard from the large supermarkets.</P>
    <P>We must realise we are in the 1970s. There are people who will say that this is a reactionary attitude, a very conservative approach and that we must be forward-looking but where the livelihood of so many people is affected we must be careful and the smaller businessman must receive protection from this House, from the Restrictive Practices Commission and from the examiner when he is appointed.</P>
    <P>There are some items excluded from this Bill.  One is the banking service.  This is referred to in section 1 (b).  We are rapidly approaching a situation in which we will have banks in the form of monopolies.  This is mitigating against a customer's choice of bank.  It weakens his bargaining position with bank managers.  A situation may be reached in which there are only two banks in a town.  A person goes into a bank and is refused accommodation.  He then goes to the other bank.  In the meantime, I am sure, telephone calls will have taken place and he will be shot down at the second bank.  We are rapidly approaching that situation.  It will be a sorry day if this happens.  When we had normal banking, as it was up to now, there may have been some overlapping but there was a better choice for the customer and certainly a much better safeguard.  I hope the Minister will keep an eye on a situation like this developing.  I am speaking <Col N="639" /> for the ordinary customer, the small farmer and the businessman.  I hope this will be looked into and that the Minister will ensure that we will continue to have a choice of bank and that the mergers at present taking place will not mitigate against a choice of bank, that there will be freedom of movement from one bank to another, and that the customer will be safeguarded.  Banking is big business nowadays.  I would hope that such big business would not interfere with the choice that is essential for the business life of the community. A Bill such as this should not exclude banking.</P>
    <P>At present there is a commission sitting on the matter of insurance. The commission has not yet reported. The Minister will be in a position to say that he is not in a position to answer questions on this matter in view of the fact that the commission is sitting.  I am speaking now specifically of motor insurance.  We have reached the stage where it is well-nigh impossible for a new subscriber to obtain motor insurance.  This is a case of blatant interference and unfair competition.  I believe that insurance companies have combined in such a way that a person looking for insurance cover cannot get it.  It is wrong that such a situation should exist.  This is unfair practice at its worst.  I hope this position will be remedied in the very near future.  If it is the case that insurance companies are losing money on motor insurance, the State should intervene to remedy the position.</P>
    <P>I am quite sure that a number of people put cases to the Minister of being unable to obtain insurance cover. The customer goes to the agent; the agent goes to the broker; the broker goes to the company.  An applicant may be waiting for insurance cover for three months.  This causes grave hardship and serious inconvenience.  It affects the commercial life of the community.  This matter affects commercial travellers and interferes with ordinary merchandising where lorries are awaiting insurance cover.  Some of the mergers that have taken place have reacted adversely on customers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> I would hope that grouping of insurance companies and the creation of a ring will be considered by the examiner. The ring that is operating at present should be broken so that reasonably-priced motor insurance will be available.  Any Deputy who is in touch with his constituents will agree that it is almost impossible to get reasonably-priced motor insurance cover.  If insurance companies are not making profits the State should finance motor insurance.  The situation existing at present is not in the best interests of the ordinary customer.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Irish nation has opted on the whole for a private enterprise economy.  This is true.  A private enterprise economy, with some State aid, is good.  There is one aspect of this matter that I would like to deal with.  A person may submit a vehicle for service.  He pays for the service and subsequently discovers that the vehicle that has been serviced is not working satisfactorily.  He finds it impossible to get satisfaction.  The Bill should cover this type of situation.  As matters stand, the person's only redress is to take legal action and he may not be anxious to do this because of the possibility of having to pay costs or expenses.  This situation should be alleviated.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers many points which are important from the consumer's point of view but in my view the Bill should make provision for persons who carry out services.  It may be difficult to bring these people within the scope of the Bill.  I refer to the young men or women who enter a service industry at school leaving age and remain there for two or three years.  They find that it is a dead end job, with little prospects for the future.  They have very little money saved out of their small earnings.  There should be protection in the Bill for such young people.  They should be provided with alternative work when they leave a service industry or they should be trained for better positions.  This is a human problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that the general purpose of the Bill is to safeguard fair trade competition on the one hand and to avoid restrictive practices of monopolies and cartels of an objectionable nature on the other. What are defined as unfair practices have been described in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  It is a comprehensive definition:</P>
      <P>Any measures, rules, agreements or acts, whether put into effect (or intended to be put into effect) by a person alone, in combination or agreement (express or implied) with others or through a merger, trust, cartel, monopoly or other means or device whatsoever, which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) have or are likely to have the effect of unreasonably limiting or restraining free and fair competition.</P>
      <P>I doubt if there is any loophole in the world to be found in that.  It must cover everything imaginable.</P>
      <P>Nobody can object to the general principle of the Bill.  In a society such as ours, moving as we are from day to day&mdash;particularly with a big step in the near future&mdash;into conditions of greater competition and the likelihood of monopoly conditions, it is not undesirable we should try to put our house in order so as to be prepared for the circumstances we may have to face in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>Looking at the Minister's speech and at the Bill it seems there are exactly two new features in this legislation. First, it extends previous legislation to cover what the Minister has described as professional services.  Secondly, it deals with the appointment of an executive officer or examiner.  The difficulty here, as I see it, is the question of &ldquo;professional services&rdquo;.  This is not spelt out in the Bill, through the powers of the examiner are well defined in section 14 as follows:</P>
      <P>(a)  investigate any aspect of the supply or distribution of goods or of the provision of a service,</P>
      <P>(b)  investigate any aspect of the operation of an order under this Act,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> (c)  investigate in the State any aspect of the supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service by a person outside the State.</P>
    <P>I take it the point in paragraph (c) may have some application in the future when we are dealing with the question of dumping but I find difficulty in comprehending paragraph (a) and I should like a much closer definition from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Heretofore the Fair Trade Commission operated to provide fair trading rules and to publish&mdash;they were entitled to do so&mdash;fair trading rules. Now they are expected to extend those powers to cover services.  Heretofore they could hold public inquiries into the supply and distribution of goods and into services related to those goods.  Now their functions are to be extended to cover all services with the exception of banking, electricity, transport and local authority services.  This question of services is something that puzzles me.  It is to be applied now to the publication of various trading rules which the Fair Trade Commission previously published but it applies also to the publication of inquiries. Heretofore they could hold inquiries into the sale and distribution of goods and to the services arising from the sale and distribution of those particular businesses.  Now they are to cover all services with the exceptions I have mentioned.  That is an extension of their functions and it is in that respect that I am a bit uninformed.  I, therefore, ask the Minister to deal specifically with the services it is intended to cover.  Is it intended to cover all professional services?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not defined in a fashion that satisfies me.  It defines rather by exclusion than by a specific listing.  Anyway, I can see difficulties arising here on the question of which particular services the Bill can be applied to.  Heretofore the Act applied to a service arising from the particular activities the commission were investigating, but now it states purely &ldquo;services&rdquo;.  I find some difficulty here <Col N="643" /> about understanding how it will operate.  If you are examining a particular business in regard to distribution, you can quantify, you can measure and compare.  How are you to quantify or to measure services given by a small firm with perhaps a handyman giving after service to something being sold by that small firm, and compare it to a major firm who can employ trained operatives to give an after service?  This Bill is moving into a new field, a more complicated field, and clearly the Minister appreciates that because he is setting up an executive officer who will have to be nearly an ombudsman, a highly accomplished individual with good judgment in a highly complicated field.</P>
      <P>As I understand it an inquiry will be initiated by the Minister, an examiner will conduct an investigation and make a report to the commission.  If they think the report is worthwhile they will order an inquiry.  At the inquiry the examiner and the trader in question appears and it is conducted in public.  The report is made to the Minister and he lays it before the House.  If he feels it is desirable to make an order he makes it the same way as he did in connection with the previous Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister in his speech said that the Bill is calculated to help the small trader but I cannot see anything laid down in it which will be of any particular help to the small trader if he finds competition particularly severe. If the competitors are more efficient than he is there is nothing in this Bill which will help him any more than it helps other traders.  It will help all traders in respect of improper practices. Perhaps the Minister will give us some information as to how he thinks an examiner appointed under this Bill can secure evidence for trading practices operated in other countries. He may secure information but if it is an investigation or an inquiry I should like to know what mechanism the Minister has in mind by which such an examiner could produce evidence here of something happening a manufacturer in South America or somewhere like that.</P>

      <P>There are a few points I should like to make on this Bill.  The first point is the question of dancehall owners and the big dance bands which are now operating throughout the country.  It is a well-known fact that the large dancehall owners can keep the big bands from playing in small halls.  The big dancehall owner can offer about seven or eight engagements in a year to a particular band whereas the small man can only bring the band once in a year to his village or town. We have now reached the situation where these large dancehall owners in collusion with the dance bands can demand fees of from £300 to £500 for a brief appearance in a town.  The Minister should do something about this practice.</P>
      <P>Young people going to dancehalls have to pay 75p in order to help pay the fee of £500.  A particular dance band on one occasion was scheduled to come to my own town but a letter was received from them stating that they could not fulfill the engagement because there was an objection from a big dance band.  This type of thing should be stamped out.</P>
      <P>The second point I want to refer to is the question of insurance companies in relation to secondhand cars. Small garages throughout the country in recent years have had a few cars available for self-drive.  Last year the insurance companies decided apparently that these people should be put out of business because there was such a premium put on them that they closed up.  The self-drive business was then left to the big monopolies. It was very wrong to do this because some of those garages provided a service which was useful to people living in small towns and villages. Now they have to go to one of the large companies in Dublin, Cork or Limerick.</P>
      <P>This matter was brought to the Minister's attention last year.  A particular company refused to quote any terms to a garage but after the Minister's intervention the company quoted a charge which was so exorbitant that the man was put out of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister can exercise any control over the restrictive <Col N="645" /> practices of some of our semi-State bodies.  I refer particularly to RTE.  It is a well-known fact that a certain supermarket owner in Dublin can get in at peak viewing time at 1.45 every day with a bit of song advertising goods in his supermarket. This particular man dines fairly often in Leinster House with some of the Deputies.  The Minister should be able to put a stop to this and give a chance to other companies to advertise at this particular peak-viewing time.</P>

      <P>The general principles of this Bill, of protecting the individual against the excesses of cartels and monopolies and generally undesirable business activity, is welcome.  The Minister indicated two main changes in respect of the existing law.  It includes services within its scope and it provides for the office of examiner.</P>
      <P>In bringing services within its scope the Minister is treading on dangerous ground.  I am speaking with particular reference to professional services, mainly with regard to the legal and the veterinary professions.  Because the medical profession have a peculiar knowledge of their own which cannot be shared unless one is in that profession, for all practical purposes that profession is outside the scope of this Bill.  I doubt if any restrictive practices which may be practiced by the medical profession &mdash; although I do not know of them &mdash; can come within the scope of the Bill.  With the advent of group practice in a town, if a standard fee was charged which the public thought was unjustified or if the availability of members of the group was unduly restricted, possibly the medical profession might come within the scope of this Bill.  However, it would be extremely difficult for the examiner or the commission to devise some measure which would cure such a complaint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Minister has widened the Bill to include professional services implies a lack of confidence on the part of the Minister in the professional services to conduct their <Col N="646" /> businesses in such a way as to be fair to the public.  I wonder if the Minister is a victim of propaganda against certain professions &mdash; notably the legal and veterinary professions &mdash; propaganda that seems to suggest they provide services which could be provided by persons other than qualified members of those professions?  Does he think that these professions are restricting the provision of the services to themselves, taking advantage of this restriction and charging fees which are not justified?</P>
    <P>For some time there has been a considerable amount of agitation with regard to the supply of drugs to farmers for use by themselves for their own livestock.  This trend has brought forward protests from the veterinary profession.  It has been suggested that these objections have been based on sectional interest, that the veterinary profession want to preserve a monopoly for themselves in the administration of these drugs to animals.  Possibly this type of propaganda has led to the widening of the restrictive trade partices code as we have known it up to the present.</P>
    <P>This is an area that, if brought within the scope of the Bill, can lead to many difficulties in practice.  The commission that will investigate complaints that might be made in this respect will have to be widened and will have to include representatives of many sciences.  It will be necessary to include in it members of the veterinary profession and, having regard to the effect of animal drugs on the environment and on our food, there will have to be dieticians and scientists skilled in other fields of knowledge.  This will be necessary when one has regard to the ecological implications of widespread and large-scale administration of drugs by farmers to their livestock.</P>
    <P>Some reports which have been issued are frightening with regard to the amount of drugs that have been discovered in meat and milk.  It is because of these frightening reports that the veterinary profession have been keen to have the administration of drugs restricted to themselves so that the quantity and type of drugs to be administered will be done by persons scientifically qualified to gauge them <Col N="647" /> exactly.  If a farmer has unlimited access to drugs there is a danger that unwitting abuses could arise and much harm done to public health and to the environment generally.</P>
    <P>It is not just a simple matter of having an inquiry and introducing certain rules to say that pharmaceutical firms must supply farmers and cannot control their supplies to members of the veterinary profession only, or that pharmaceutical chemists must be prepared to sell to farmers directly.  It is not as simple as that.  It is a matter that raises wide implications, so wide that I think the Minister should have had sufficient confidence in the <i>bona fides</i> and ethical standards of the veterinary profession or, in the same context, in the legal profession, he should have confidence that neither of them would abuse their position and that they would provide their particular specialised services in a way and at a cost that would not take advantage of the specialised knowledge of their members.</P>
    <P>In practice it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to investigate so-called restrictive practices within these professions.  If there are practices which appear to be restrictive, there is a very definite reason for them.  It is facile to make the point that the public wellbeing is diminished or adversely affected by these practices just because they exist.  The Minister is disregarding the history of the professions involved, and he is disregarding the role they have to play.  If there is any question of bringing either of those professions within the scope of this Bill &mdash; and it would appear at first sight that they are likely to be brought within its scope because they are two professions which have been subject to considerable public agitation &mdash; the Minister is going into very deep and marshy ground.</P>
    <P>Any relaxation or widening that an order or a finding under the Bill could provide would, in turn, lead to a far more undesirable situation than the one which at present exists.  I would recommend to the Minister that, before any inquiry is made under this Bill into either the veterinary or the legal profession, the matter should have his <Col N="648" /> deepest consideration.  If services of this type are to be investigated, I can see practical difficulties in the Minister's way in getting the experts he will need to form a commission which would be competent to hold an inquiry and make recommendations.  I use the word &ldquo;competent&rdquo; in the sense not merely of being technically competent but of being acceptable to the profession being investigated.</P>
    <P>This is equally important because the members of that profession also have rights to be considered in the same way as members of the public have their rights to be considered.  The Minister must be careful to ensure that the extended powers taken under this Bill do not lead to witch hunts.  The extended powers are such that we can expect very many inquiries.  There will be a great number of requests for inquiries and whether or not they are acceded to depends, so far as I can see, on the examiner initially and on the Minister on appeal from him.</P>
    <P>If an inquiry has to be held into a speciality field it will be necessary, in order to have the matter fully and properly inquired into, to ensure that all the factors involved are completely presented to the inquiry.  This, in turn, may necessitate providing expert witnesses, perhaps from abroad.  It will almost certainly entail the employment of professional advocates to make the case for the person being scrutinised. These two factors will constitute a severe financial burden on the person, or the body, or the company being investigated.  In what I must confess was a rather cursory second reading of the Bill, I did not see any provision for the commission to make a payment towards the expenses of the party being investigated.</P>
    <P>In such far-reaching legislation as this, which can cause an investigation into a particular practice to be held and which, in turn, can involve the party being investigated in considerable expense, there should be some provision in regard to the expenses of that party.  The party may have to provide expert witnesses or professional advocates and there should be some assistance for him.  Otherwise the Bill could work very unfairly and could be <Col N="649" /> a hardship on a body or a company. I know the implication is that if a body or a company has to be investigated under this Bill, it is almost certain to be a wealthy body.  That may well be. Nevertheless, it is not entitled to be prejudiced by an inquiry into something which it is legally entitled to do. If the inquiry goes against it, on the old principle that costs follow the award, if it is a wealthy company it can bear the cost of the inquiry, but if no order is made, or no finding is made that there have been restrictive practices or that they were only of a minimal kind, that body should not be prejudiced financially and its expenses should be recouped by the Minister.</P>
    <P>A long inquiry into an involved subject will be extremely expensive if the Minister has to provide a commission of experts.  Once he starts widening the scope of the present restrictive practices code he will have to have experts for every inquiry.  The inquiries may be long and the cost of the experts will accordingly be that much higher.</P>
    <P>Section 7 is an interesting section.  It deals with the report to be made by the commission following an inquiry and sets out what the report should contain.  It says that the report must describe the conditions which obtain in regard to the supply of goods or the provision of services within the scope of the inquiry.  It also has to state whether if there is interference such interference is unfair or operates against the common good.  This is imposing an odd duty on the commission. The commission has to decide what constitutes the common good.  I do not know whether this has carried over from the earlier Act or whether it is a new principle.</P>
    <P>Up to now the exclusive right of deciding what was or was not the common good was a function of the courts.  If this is a new principle, I suggest that the Minister should consider its constitutionality.  If it is not a new principle and has not been challenged in the courts, I still think it should be considered from that point of view.  While this commission makes recommendations only, unless the Minister makes an order by request, nevertheless it can affect the rights of <Col N="650" /> one body of citizens <i>vis-à-vis</i> those of another body.  The criterion in the decision affecting these rights is whether the common good is involved.</P>
    <P>I always understood it to be a principle of our legal and constitutional system that the only arbiters of the common good were the courts of the land.  This commission is getting extremely wide and has unusual powers. It is an extension away from the principle of the common law that disputes and areas of contention between citizens, and between the State and citizens, should be decided on by the courts.  That is why we have the judicial arm under our Constitution.</P>
    <P>This is a drift into the <i>droit administratif</i> which is so prevalent in European countries.  It represents a trend, an undesirable trend which if it grows can do so to such an extent that the State finds itself interfering and arbitrating between itself and the citizen.  That is in effect what is happening here: the State is arbitrating between itself and the citizen in the sense that the State is carrying out the commission, granted at the request of an aggrieved citizen, but nevertheless it is the State which is investigating the particular problem, not the courts.</P>
    <P>To that extent it is an undesirable principle.  The courts are peculiarly constructed to be the better type of forum for deciding what is and what is not the common good.  Any departure from that principle is something to be watched with care.  It can be justified in only very serious circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another defect that I see in relation to the mechanics, the structures, proposed in the Bill is that there does not appear to be any room for an appeal from a finding by the commission.  I think this is also a serious defect because the commission will have a tremendously powerful influence in all aspects of Irish life, commercial, cultural, social and professional.  It can impinge on our activities in a tremendous number of ways and to a very wide extent.</P>
    <P>I think therefore that the commission's findings should be subject to some form of review.  I have no doubt <Col N="651" /> the Minister will probably tell me the commission will be extended in particular cases to include persons particularly qualified to deal with the subject matters involved and that they, in effect, are an appeal from the examiner.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the commission and the examiner are so much part of each other that they must be regarded as essentially one being a branch of the other and not having two independent functions.  I should like to see a review body above and beyond the commission with an affinity to the courts rather than to the Executive.  Equity demands that such a body would be set up.</P>
    <P>One must welcome the general principle of the Bill.  It is to protect the citizen against monopolistic practices or monopolies which use their powers adversely in regard to the general public &mdash; to prevent any cartels or rings being set up in any aspect of a business or a professional service.  There are difficulties in the way of extending it to professional services in the manner I have mentioned and I suggest to the Minister that, while the professions cannot object and do not object to being brought within the scope of the Bill, it should be made known that the spirit of the Bill is contrary to any idea of witch hunting the professions, because it is not.  It must be shown very clearly that the professions must have abused the privilege they have enjoyed before they be subjected to harassment under the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are certain exemptions from the provisions of the Bill which I think should be within it.  Perhaps the most notable of these is the business of banking.  The Minister may reply that the Central Bank provides the watchdog service in regard to that business but I suggest to the Minister that this is not sufficient because for one thing the watchdog service is being provided in private and is not being seen by the public to be in operation.  As well, if a member of the public feels he has been harshly treated by a bank or by a banking practice, it is a more difficult thing for him to make a case to some body as impersonal and remote as the Central Bank, with all the majestic <Col N="652" /> connotations that term includes.  It would be much more difficult for him to do that than to write to the commission proposed by the Bill.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I think the banking services should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  The legal, medical and veterinary services as well as all other services are within the scope of the Bill and I do not see how the banking business can make a case for its exemption or why it should have been exempted.  In his statement the Minister did not justify the exemptions set out in section 1.  I think this was an omission on his part and I should like to hear from him why banking has been exempted.  It is probably because they are controlled by the Central Bank, but I submit to the Minister that that control is not sufficient and that the banking services are now so widespread and affect so many citizens &mdash; the banks are even advertising at the moment in a manner directed to get people to come in and use their services who up to now have not been doing so &mdash; that they should be subject to the controls and the philosophy of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the House last week it was indicated that the banks have made radical changes in charges for the services they render and when it was pointed out that the public were not aware of these changes and had no say in them, it was pointed out that the Central Bank was aware of them and had authorised them.  This is not enough.  The public should be aware of these things and if the charges are of the type which this Bill seeks to protect the public from &mdash; I speak of the nature of the charges, not the level of the charges &mdash; then the public should have more protection than that afforded by the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>It is also difficult to know why the other exemptions set out in section 1 have been provided.  Any service provided under a contract of employment is exempt.  I should like to hear why this exemption is contained in the section because I am inclined to think that must leave a loophole.  One can envisage ingenious people getting around the scope of the Bill by providing services under a contract of <Col N="653" /> employment on a very large scale, to such an extent that they could operate restrictive practices and still be outside the scope of the Bill.  It is not beyond human ingenuity to manage that.</P>
    <P>The supplying of electricity is exempt.  This, of course, is the monopoly service in this country and there are many practices and rules of the ESB which have been criticised from time to time because they appear to take advantage of the board's monopoly position.  I think that semi-State bodies as well as private firms should be subject to the checks and inquiries proposed in the Bill, again, if there is adequate and justifiable reasons for it. I do not think they should have been exempted.</P>
    <P>Transport services are also to be exempted.  There was a certain amount of competition between CIE and the private transport companies so, possibly, one can see why the Minister was of the opinion that there was not the same need to include them as there was to include other types of business. Air services are exempt also.  This is an area that could be investigated with particular reference to the fare structure on the Dublin/London route.  I concede that because of the necessity for avoiding cut-throat competition and the endangering of standards, one can see that the type of service might be exempted.  Again, however, the Minister has given us no reasons for this.  The exemptions are just as important as any extensions that are included.</P>
    <P>By and large one must welcome the Bill.  The philosophy behind it is good: it is to ensure that the citizen is not exploited by giant commercial firms or by unfair professional arrangements. I would hope that in its operation there will be no element of which hunting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I notice that in his opening remarks the Minister said that the Irish nation has opted on the whole for a private enterprise economy.  I stress the words &ldquo;on the whole&rdquo; because they could be read out of context. The Irish nation has opted very definitely for a mixed economy, a philosophy that I was behind.  Our <Col N="654" /> whole approach to industrialisation is that both public authorities and the private sector need to complement each other if the maximum social benefit is to be attained.  I fear that the particular phrase used by the Minister might be misinterpreted as suggesting some kind of bias against State enterprise.  When one reads the Bill, one finds a strong bias in favour of State enterprise by exempting various State enterprises from the provisions of the Bill.  There is a certain ambivalence here between the tone of the Minister's initial remarks and the Bill as introduced.</P>
      <P>Regarding the post of examiner, the Minister has not explained the reason for this change.  The only reason given is that it would lead to a decided increase in the speed with which matters are handled.  In the use of the adjective &ldquo;decided&rdquo;, I detect a certain hint of frustration with the inadequate pace of work of the existing Fair Trade Commission, congested as they are perhaps by an excessive number of matters before them and tied as they are by a rather cumbersome procedure of inquiries which necessarily is slow.  I do not suggest any criticism of the Fair Trade Commission in this respect but I can see that the Minister has found probably that, as constituted at present, they cannot cope with the volume of problems coming before them.  However, the Minister could have developed this a little more than by merely giving us a hint of frustration. Usefully, he could have told us something about the problems that have arisen and why he has concluded that this is the best answer.  I am not challenging the matter but pointing out that, when a change of this kind is introduced, it is important that it be justified fully.  I wonder whether in this instance as in so many others, the Minister intends to say as little as possible at the outset and to explain everything at the end, thereby making sure that nobody could answer back, a practice to which this Government have been particularly inclined.  Maybe it has been the practice of previous Governments also but, at any rate, it is one which I, as a relatively recent entrant to this House, has noticed as a way in which so many Bills pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought there was a certain lack of <Col N="655" /> clarity at one point in the Minister's speech.  I was misled until I read more carefully what he had said.  I refer to that part of his speech regarding an important change, that is, that the commission may not hold an inquiry on their own initiative but must do so on the recommendation of the examiner. At first I read that as meaning that the commission may not hold an inquiry on their own initiative but only on the recommendation of the examiner. Of course, that is not what was meant, although it could be read that way.  We see from the Bill that while the Fair Trade Commission may not initiate an inquiry it may be initiated either by the examiner or, alternatively, by somebody who has been frustrated by the failure of the examiner to recommend the initiation of the inquiry.  While at first sight it might appear from the phraseology used by the Minister that nobody but the examiner can initiate an inquiry, the position is that if the examiner should refuse to do so there is another channel of direct access to the commission but the commission can act on their own initiative.  It is important to clarify that lest the account of the phraseology of the Bill in the papers tomorrow, and as used by the Minister, should mislead people in that respect. I think I have got the correct interpretation as a result of reading what is contained in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I notice, too, with regard to the examiner that there is a reference to his having certain competence in examining any abuses of a dominant position by firms outside the State. The Minister went on to say that Deputies would appreciate that the exercise of the examiner's powers in the conduct of such investigations must be confined to the area within the jurisdiction of the State.  I take it that the exercise of the power means very strictly the power to summons witnesses or to require the production of documents and that it is not to be interpreted in a looser sense as in any way inhibiting his ability to make inquiries outside the State or to invite people from outside the State to come and discuss the matter with him.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> On this particular point I am puzzled by the extra ordinary lack of any direct reference in this document to the EEC.  I do not take the view that the EEC should be dragged in holus-bolus to every discussion simply because it happens to be topical. Indeed, there is a danger of people being misled into thinking that everything in the future will be influenced by the EEC.  However, in this particular area with which we are dealing there is a direct relationship between the EEC cartel legislation under Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty as operated by the Commission, subject to an appeal to the European Courts of Justice which has very direct implications for this country.  One of the matters with which we must concern ourselves, and I am rather surprised that the Bill does not attempt to do so, is the demarcation of responsibility between the EEC cartel jurisdiction and that of the Fair Trade Commission.  This is a delicate and narrow border and one in respect of which I would have thought the Minister would have taken this opportunity to tell us something. Instead he referred to the EEC in terms of remarkable delicacy as if he believed he might offend the House's sense of modesty by using the word.  He tells us that he thought it necessary to lay statutory obligations on the Fair Trade Commission and the examiner with regard to these matters because of the existence today of international co-operation in the elimination of harmful restrictive practices.  He said he believed that such co-operation would increase as we establish closer relationships with other countries in the interests of the economic well-being of our people.</P>
    <P>Is there any reason why he should have been so extraordinarily coy in referring to the EEC cartel legislation and jurisdiction of the EEC?  It seems to me to be a curious approach at this moment to refer to the EEC in these terms.  Perhaps there are other bodies concerned in this matter but the fact is that we are to find ourselves, if we join the Community, in the position where the jurisdiction of the EEC cartels legislation will extend to us from the 1st January next.  That <Col N="657" /> jurisdiction, while concerned necessarily and properly, with aspects of cartels or restrictive practices which influence international trade, is not necessarily, by virtue of that, confined to cartels which involve people of more than one country.</P>
    <P>Let us be quite clear that a cartel or restrictive practice in this country, involving only nationals of this country but having implications for trade, affecting trade in some way while in some way restricting exports or changing the terms under which exports are sold or under which imports are sold, would be entirely within the jurisdiction of the European Commission and at least some of the work of the Fair Trade Commission will in future be undertaken by the European Commission even where there is no involvement of anybody or firm outside the country.  This should have been made clear.  It is odd to produce legislation of this kind without indicating at this point in time the kind of relationship that would exist.  The House should have been told precisely how the competence of the Commission would extend to affairs involving firms in this country, whether they be firms of this country together with other firms or whether they be firms solely of this country.  We should have been told how the demarcation lines within the jurisdiction of the European Commission are to be drawn.  Also, we should have been told something of the extent to which the jurisdiction of the European Commission will take precedence over that of the Fair Trade Commission where an overlap of jurisdiction may appear to occur.  To speak on this subject not only without telling us about these aspects of the problem, but also suppressing all reference to the EEC and introducing such guarded terminology, almost suggests a guilty conscience.  I do not know what the Government are guilty about.  The Minister when replying should tell us something about this aspect of the problem.  It is right that we should understand the implications of membership. In this country there may be cases of restrictive practices which, for some reason, the Fair Trade Commission do not investigate, but which the European Commission cartel group <Col N="658" /> will not be prepared to tolerate.  Complications of that kind can occur.  I have reason to believe that there may be one such case.  There is a case which I have in mind in which the Fair Trade Commission could well take one view in the near future and in respect of which the European Commission could move in and reverse that view after 1st January next.  The Minister should have told us more about all this.  I do not understand why he has failed to do so.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the extension of the powers of the Fair Trade Commission to services.  I was a member of the relevant committee of the NIEC which made this recommendation.  I could not be a member today, because in an effort to clamp down on parliamentarians, they are excluded by this liberal Government from such activities, even though they might learn something useful to Parliament.  The Government abolished this council and refused to replace it.  Before this plan was introduced by this liberal Government, I was a member of the relevant committee and we made this recommendation. I am entirely in favour of this recommendation.  I am puzzled as to why services have been excluded from the ambit of the Fair Trade Commission until now.  Restrictive practices in services can be very dangerous.  In some cases, there are great opportunities for such practices in services. Legislation in this respect is overdue.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there are areas of sensitivity in the professions.  In particular, I can understand the sensitivity of the legal profession because of the unremitting campaign waged by the Department of Justice under various Ministers against the legal profession and some aspects of it.  This has appeared most recently in relation to price control, where a curious arrangement has been made under which it will be possible for the Department of Justice to control the rates of fees charged by the legal profession.  This is a most undesirable development.  I can understand the sensitivity of the legal profession, and I must say that I know they have good reason to be sensitive in view of the record of this Government in pursuing them in aspects of their work where they could reasonably <Col N="659" /> have been left alone.  They should be brought within the ambit of control of restrictive practices.  The members of every profession are convinced that some restrictive practices are essential and necessary for the purposes of carrying on their business.  In many instances this is true.  The maintenance of professional standards requires, in many cases, some system of control of the activities of people purporting to carry on the profession in question.  At the same time, once a profession introduces some form of restriction on entry and on the practices in that profession, then such restriction should come under public scrutiny to ensure that it does not go beyond what is essential for the maintenance of standards, and that the public interest is served by the profession which does not exploit the advantages accruing from this closed approach.</P>
    <P>It is right that the professions should be brought within the ambit of the Fair Trade Commission.  I understand the feelings of the members of the legal profession.  My sympathies were with them on previous occasions.  In this instance there is a case for bringing them, as well as other bodies, within the scope of this Bill.  This is my personal view.  I have not heard fully the arguments against this.  There are arguments for the exclusion of the legal profession which comes under the control of the courts.  The courts should show that as a whole they exercise their functions in the public interest.  I am not convinced that the courts alone are likely to control the legal profession in a manner that would be necessarily conducive to the public interest.  They would be concerned to ensure, above all, the maintenance of standards.  They would pursue that aim without having to apply their minds to the broader question of the public interest.  They could be so concerned about preserving the profession they might overlook some aspects of public interest.  The courts consist of elevated lawyers with a certain loyalty to their own profession. Some kind of external review is desirable.  This is certainly a sensitive area.  Perhaps some proposals could be put forward to ensure that in intervening in this area the Fair Trade <Col N="660" /> Commission will have due regard to the functions of the courts in regard to the control of the legal profession and that the sensitivities involved here will be taken into account fully.</P>
    <P>When we move away from the legal profession, I am not sure that I see any argument for excluding any other profession or Service.  I am puzzled about the list of exclusions in the Bill and the fact that the Minister has not explained these exclusions.  They cannot be taken as being obviously desirable.  I am particularly perturbed about the exclusion of banking.  It seems to me that the banking system involves many practices of a restrictive character, having enormous impact on the economy of this country.  A case can be made for these practices.  I have heard the case made in favour of maintaining a single agreed level of interest rates between the associated banks and for having no competition in interest rates. I have not been convinced by that case. The fact that such competition has existed in Britain for a long time in a very similar environment makes me certain that this practice should at least be examined.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank <i>vis-à-vis</i> banks, is in a position somewhat similar to that of the courts <i>vis-à-vis</i> the legal profession. One of the functions of the Central Bank is to ensure the stability of the banking system and to ensure that the money of the people is safe and that the banks operate in a manner which is beneficial to the public interest. The Central Bank is not necessarily concerned with the competitiveness of the banks.  I am sure this is part of the concern of the Central Bank and that it is considered.  But other considerations may be uppermost in the minds of those in the Central Bank.  An external review of the banking system and of its practices would be desirable.  In recent times in this country there have been signs of a tendency towards a further exercise of this cartel power.  Far from moving towards liberalisation of interest rates which makes for competition, we have the proposed introduction of term loans and the widening of the margins between the deposit rates and overdraft rates, out of which come the profits of the banks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> We have had no indication as to what criteria are applied by the Central Bank in determining whether these are sound or not.  Up to now there has been no adequate information as to the profits of the banks. We are now told something about them but in all the years up to now we have had no facts about such profits.  The figures they publish are figures which of course they are allowed by law to invent, generally for the purpose of not disclosing their position to the public.  Anyone who would think that, by looking at the published profit figures of the banks over the years past, he would get guidance as to whether the banks are making excessive profits through the maintenance of their cartel arrangements would be naïve indeed, because any resemblance between the profit figures published by the banks and actual profits is coincidental.  I have been told in the past that there was a convention under which the bank profits as published always moved in the same direction up or down as the real trend.  I do not know whether that is true or not, that even if that were true, the fact that one knew no more than that profits were going up or down, as the case might be, certainly is an insufficient basis on which to judge the competitiveness of any system.  Moreover, the banks, because of the proliferation of branches, which they have been slow to do anything about, are <i>prima facie</i> an institution involving a degree of duplication which could only be justified by the most intense competition.</P>
    <P>There are other areas as well as the banks in which this system of agreed control of rates without any control of the volume of production of the service in question can create grave problems.  We have this in air transport. It is a very similar situation.  In air transport the airlines decide together what rates are to be charged. There can be no competition between them in terms of rates to be charged. Because this is an area in which, through technical progress, greater efficiency arises as time goes on, if rates are fixed by the airlines the airlines tend to hold them at a certain level, and as the benefits of increased <Col N="662" /> competition accrue, in the form of lower costs, as they have at certain periods of rapid technical advance, what we have got are emptier planes, not cheaper air transport.</P>
    <P>It is only because of the intervention of the Civil Aeronautics Board of the United States with IATA and with the airlines in 1952 and again in 1959 that this extraordinary process, under which the fares and rates remained at the same level despite reducing costs and the planes got emptier and emptier, was brought to an end.  It is almost the inevitable consequence of the way the monopoly system operates, that if you give to any group the power to fix what rates they charge, if there is no control over the output they are providing, and if there is any increase in efficiency occurring, you can get this problem of overproduction, over-provision of air transport capacity.</P>
    <P>This is very much against the public interest, and clearly the proliferation of bank branches when there has not been competition in rates seems to be against the public interest.  I recognise the banks are now doing something about rationalisation, rather belatedly, but nevertheless the cost of banking in Ireland is, and I think can be shown to be, a good deal higher than it need be, and one of the reasons it is so is that it is cushioned by the absence of competition of this kind.  If the banks had to compete in interest rates and if this cartel were broken, you would get a very different position and there would not be much wasteful provision of services beyond what the community required.  Therefore, there is a very strong case for including banking within the provisions of this Bill.  This has been strengthened by recent developments.  The proposed terms for loans which involve higher interest rates for lending money, the way in which in the past two years deposit rates have not fallen in keeping with the decline in interest rates generally, and the way in which the margin between deposits and advance rates has risen &mdash; all of this suggests the necessity for an inquiry into the profitability and efficiency of <Col N="663" /> the banking system.  Yet this is to be excluded.</P>
    <P>If it were the case that the Central Bank were going to hold a public inquiry and publish reports on what they found, you might make a case for leaving the matter with the Central Bank.  However, I do not think this is proposed, and I do not believe this matter, which is so much a matter of public concern, can satisfactorily be dealt with behind closed doors by the Central Bank because, first of all, people would not be satisfied with the simple statement by the Central Bank : &ldquo;We have looked into it and all is well,&rdquo; because the Central Bank have other preoccupations which must influence to some degree their judgement in the matter.  They cannot look at the question of competition in banking with the single-minded concern for efficiency and the provision of credit as cheaply as possible, which will be the sole concern of the Fair Trade Commission.  For these reasons, without any reflection whatever on the Central Bank, I think that the ommission of banking is a mistake.</P>
    <P>I think the same is true for shipping services.  There has been a long tradition of cartels in shipping.  One of the most enlightening reports ever published in this country on the secret practices of trading concerns was the 1959 report on shipping freight practices. In this report which never got the publicity I thought myself it should have got &mdash; I did my best to help it along with a few articles at the time&mdash; it was demonstrated by virtue of the quotation of extracts from the minutes of the relevant traffic conference that not alone was there over a period of something like 30 years a successful attempt to prevent any kind of innovation such as the introduction of containerisation, which kept up the cost of sea transport between Ireland and Britain for three decades beyond the time when it was technically possible to reduce them, but moreover some of the concerns in question, sitting down together, discussed the desirability of putting out of business competitors by unfair trading practices, deliberately <Col N="664" /> bankrupting them, so that competition could be eliminated and a cosy high level of rates could be maintained.</P>
    <P>I am not alleging anything that is not public knowledge.  I am merely quoting loosely from the report of this committee of inquiry.  These practices were affecting adversely the interests of shipping companies operating here. Even by that extraordinary roundabout route through Scotland and Northern Ireland, these companies could provide cheaper transport, and the horrifying thought that cheap transport could be provided by such a roundabout route resulted in an agreement to put a stop to it by the most objectionable practices.  I am glad to say that the Government of the day appointed an inquiry which examined the matter and reported very fully on it, and I do not think that situation could recur today.  Nevertheless, in view of the fact that the whole shipping business has traditionally for centuries been riddled with these practices, again I find it puzzling that shipping companies should be excluded.</P>
    <P>Wherever we look here we find State bodies cropping up: the ESB are to be excluded.  CIE, Irish Shipping and B &amp; I are to be excluded.  Local authorities are to be excluded.  What is the <i>rationale</i> of this?  As I said at the outset, I myself favour a mixed economy, but I am puzzied by the Minister's apparent commitment to one leg only of that mixed economy in his reference to a private enterprise.  I favour a mixed economy in which public enterprises are seen to operate in the public interest and are secured to operate in the public interest.  I am not convinced you do that by exempting them from the normal requirement to show that their trading practices are fair.</P>
    <P>There have been in the past allegations that the ESB have adopted unfair trading practices, that they have used their power as a monopoly producer of electricity to raise money more cheaply than private enterprise can do and have used the money thus raised to go into, say, the hire purchase business in a manner unfairly competitive with private traders.  My sympathies, on the whole, would tend to be with the <Col N="665" /> ESB in this, in so far as there is a bias, but I must say that when such a suggestion is made it should be investigated. It is in the public interest that we should know whether there has been any abuse, and the truth is that many of our State enterprises are engaged in multifarious activities; they may have a monopoly or close to it in a certain area which may enable them to make monopoly profits which they may then apply unfairly to the detriment of private enterprise in another area of competition and this could be against the public interest.  It is not that private enterprise should be sacrosanct.  Any distortion of competition, whether achieved through the activities of a State body or private enterprise, has adverse effects and should not be allowed to take place without being exposed to the full glare of publicity and without the public knowing and having shown to them that this distortion of competition is, on balance, in the public interest.  Here we find all the State bodies protected from any glare of publicity, from any investigation, and allowed to continue any practices they may have which may be unfair. The only point in putting them in here is because they may have unfair practices which would not stand up to the light of day.  If they have no such practices, if we are, in fact, to be told by the Minister that there is no question of Irish Shipping, of the ESB, the B &amp; I and so on engaging in unfair trading practices, then what is the point in exempting them?</P>
    <P>The only reason for exempting them is because they may be engaged, and the Minister may suspect they are, in unfair practices, objectionable practices, and he does not want them investigated.  There is no other purpose in putting in these exemptions.  If they are not or could not be engaged in such practices, then the Minister would not bother mentioning them at all.  The only purpose in exempting them is in some way to prevent the light of day being thrown on activities which they may have engaged in or may engaged in in the future and, for that reason, I think it is wrong that they should be protected.</P>
    <P>As someone interested in the public <Col N="666" /> sector, as someone who has a strong commitment to the public enterprise sector, I want to see it operate in fair competition because, apart from any other consideration, so long as it can be alleged against the public enterprise sector that it is not operating in fair competition, that it has some unfair advantage, that it is sheltered and protected from competition in some way, so long as that is the case the private enterprise lobby will secure by pressure that there shall not be an expansion of public enterprise.  One of our difficulties here is that the over-zealous concern of this Government to protect State bodies from any kind of inquiry or study of their activities, whether by this House, through a committee, or otherwise, has built up a picture in the public mind of bodies which cannot stand the glare of publicity, bodies which are not competitive, and this is often unfair and untrue.  It certainly creates a position in which it is possible for those in the private sector to argue that they are unfairly treated, that there is a sheltering of the public sector versus the private sector, and that therefore it would be against the public interest to allow any expansion of the public sector which would be to the detriment of the private sector.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of my party, as put forward in our public enterprise policy several years ago, that what we should do is try to put the public enterprise as far as possible on a commercial basis and, if they are required by public policy to take part in some social activity in the social interest, or, indeed for political reasons, then they should be paid a fee for doing so.  The same should be true of any private concern the Government might wish to undertake some social service on its behalf; but that having been done, the rest of their activities should be on a commercial basis and they should be put on an equivalent basis to the private sector as regards the raising of capital and as regards the manner of carrying on their trading activities and as regards their competitiveness.  When that is done the argument against the expansion of public enterprise, so often and so effectively used in this country, that public enterprise has unfair advantages, would no longer exist and the <Col N="667" /> inhibitions which exist at present to the expansion of the public sector, which very often could be expanded to the benefit of the public interest, would disappear.</P>
    <P>In putting forward that policy several years ago the Fine Gael Party gave a great deal of thought to this question and felt that this approach would be the one most conducive to the public interest and, in commenting on the Bill, I must comment that the Bill seems to go in the opposite direction. It seems to me that, whatever may have been the intentions of the drafters of the Bill in seeking to exclude public enterprise from its ambit, by so doing they are perpetuating the legend of the uncompetitiveness of the public sector and they are strengthening the power of private enterprise to use propoganda against the expansion of the public sector.  The whole approach to this Bill is, I think, in that respect inimical to the public sector and, therefore, I believe inimical to the public interest generally which can best be served by freeing the public sector and the private sector to compete with each other and serve the nation fully by so doing.</P>
    <P>I notice in section 12 provision for inquiry into mergers and takeovers. The wording is rather vague and I should like the Minister to expand on this when he comes to reply.  To what extent is it intended, or to what extent does this section indeed permit of an inquiry by the commission into specific takeover proposals, specific merger proposals, which may be against the public interest?  It sounds rather like a benevolent attempt to finance academic research into an interesting topic of business management studies rather than a practical proposal that this commission should be able to tackle problems of take-overs and mergers where they may be against the public interest.  Is it the case that the wording is such that, in fact, only the most general studies will be carried out or is the wording such that it will permit the commission, given that there is a takeover proposal announced, immediately to intervene and investigate and report on it and put it up to the Government <Col N="668" /> to take action?  We need clarification of this.  I do not think the Minister said much, if anything, about this.  I may be doing him an injustice. He did, in fact, refer to it but not in a manner which enlightened me very much as to what the intentions were.  We could, I think, hear more from him about this.  His reference to section 12, as I recall it, was merely to the fact that section 12 would enable the commission to investigate the operation of international firms, but he did not say anything more about what kind of activities of national or international firms could be investigated under the section.</P>
    <P>I note with interest section 9 which I have in my own mind, dubbed the &ldquo;Luddite&rdquo; section.  It enables the commission, whenever so requested by the Minister, to cause an inquiry to be held into &ldquo;the refusal or alleged refusal by employers or employees (or any combination of employers or of employees or of employers and employees) to use particular materials or particular methods for manufacturing or construction purposes&rdquo;.  This seems to be directed against groups of people, workers or management, who may agree together not to be competitive, not to introduce new methods and, in some way, to restrict competition for that purpose. This seems useful but I note that the commission have to be asked by the Minister to inquire.  Why is that?  Why can the commission not be trusted to investigate these matters on its own initiative?  There is no objection to giving the Minister the power to ask them.  It is quite proper that he should have that power and quite proper that the commission, if asked by the Minister, should be obliged to investigate, but why should the commission not be able on its own initiative, or on the initiative of the examiner, to examine and investigate these kinds of practices, which may hold up progress and be detrimental to the public interest?</P>

      <P>We have in the past differed on this.  It has always seemed to me that the best use can be made of the Second Stage by raising, in a very general and brief way, points on the Bill the answer to which by the Minister on the Second Stage might make it unnecessary to frame an amendment or make it possible to frame a relevant amendment. If one does not find out what is in the Minister's mind on points of this kind one is inhibited from legislating effectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">

      <P>Perhaps the Committee on Procedure would examine that very point.  I agree with the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very interesting suggestion.  I am glad the Ceann Comhairle has made it and I certainly feel it should be taken up.  Moving on to section 15 I am bothered about this whole question of the power to get information on the powers of this commission.  I should like the Minister to tell us do these proposals in section 15, which give to the examiner a number of functions, replace the powers of the commission?  As I understand it and although I was personally involved my recollection of the details is not necessarily sound, the powers of the commission to compel the attendance of witnesses before them were challenged in the action arising out of the Public Accounts Committee case where a warrant signed by myself, in fact, sending Padraig Haughey before the High Court was quashed on the grounds that it was unconstitutional. My recollection is that, in fact, the powers of the Fair Trade Commission were impugned indirectly because the wording of their powers was similar to the wording used in the Act under which we, in the Public Accounts Committee, were operating and it therefore became necessary, by virtue of that decision of the Supreme Court, to amend the legislation dealing with the powers of the commission.  Yet, if I understand what we have before us correctly, we seem to have given the examiner certain powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The powers, at first sight, look disturbingly like the ones which were quashed but I am sure the Minister <Col N="670" /> must have been properly advised to amend them in a manner which would make them acceptable to the Supreme Court.  I should like him to tell us something about the changes in wording that were necessary and also why the Bill, as amended, purports to give the examiner these powers but does not seem to amend the powers of the commission which I had understood needed to be amended by virtue of the Supreme Court decision.  The fact that the Minister has not amended them suggests that I must be wrong.  I must have got the wrong end of the stick but if I have got the wrong end of the stick it is possible that other people have too.  Perhaps he would deal with the matter of the decision in the Haughey case, its implications for the Fair Trade Commission, the extent to which it makes necessary the amendment of the powers of the commission, why no such provision is included here and whether the wording of the powers given to the examiner is such as to get round the difficulty that arose in that case.  I think it would be useful for us to hear something about that because if we are to tackle this Bill on Committee Stage we would need to be fully informed by the Minister on these aspects of the matter.</P>
    <P>This arises in the Schedule and in section 7 also.  I think my notes have misled me here.  Perhaps the First Schedule does effect this amendment. Is that the position?  Is it the case that the First Schedule is designed to retrieve the position arising from the Supreme Court decision?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, perhaps, the Minister would tell us something about the changes that have taken place in the wording and what changes were necessary and why he believes the wording as we now have it would stand up in the Supreme Court.  If I have gone wrong in my approach there, the Minister can put me right. We need to hear something about the Schedule and its significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister, when he is replying, will tell us something about the kind of procedure which is envisaged in section 15 for dealing with <Col N="671" /> cases where an owner of premises does not permit an authorised officer to enter and inspect.  As I understand it, it would appear that the position is that if he refuses to allow this, the authorised officer may apply to the High Court but it goes on to suggest that the owner of the premises or the person on whom an authorised officer makes a requirement under this section may, if he refuses access to the officer, within seven days apply to the High Court for a declaration under this section.  I must have misread this in some way because I have never before come across the position where somebody who finds himself put upon by an officer of the public service and objects to an intrusion is required to go to the court to take action against the Government. It seems a curious way of dealing with the situation.  Perhaps I have got it wrong but it is something the House would appreciate the Minister explaining in his reply.</P>
    <P>Having made those comments, the Bill in general seems acceptable.  It seems a good Bill.  Both the extension of the activities of the Fair Trade Commission and the appointment of an examiner to speed things up seem worthwhile reform.  They are reforms that have not been adequately explained certainly as regards the appointment of an examiner.  I hope the Minister will tell us more about that.  This Bill in its general terms is welcome but I think we are entitled to get a fuller explanation of a Bill of this kind when it comes before us.  The system under which we have to wait for the Minister's reply to find out what is in the Bill must, the Minister will agree, have detrimental effects on the quality of the Second Reading speeches that have to be made in partial ignorance of the facts of the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a very useful discussion of this Bill on Second Reading and a number of quite pertinent questions have been asked.  Most of the contributors to the debate seemed to get around to dealing with details of the Bill which possibly can be more far-reachingly dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="672" /> One of the principal factors in the Bill is that the powers of the old Fair Trade Commission are being changed in that we are now creating the position of examiner who can on his own or on the initiative of the Minister for Industry and Commerce decide to carry out various investigations into fair trade or practice in relation to sales and services with the exceptions mentioned in section 1 (1). This, in a broad way, changes the existing system whereby the commission is both prosecutor and judge. The Fair Trade Commission at present has power to carry out an investigation, have a full examination and inquiry, and subsequently come up with its recommendations.  I think it was Deputy Cooney who drew attention to the fact that there is not any provision in the Bill for appeal from the recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission formerly known as the Fair Trade Commission. The Fair Trade Commission was created arising out of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1953.  There was not an appeal from its recommendations in the intervening years.  Now the Restrictive Practices Commission is put in a better position in so far as it is not responsible for pursuing the inquiries leading up to the actual formal hearing.  Those will be done by the newly created examiner and I take it his staff and the new commission now sits by way of holding court with the examiner making his submissions on the one hand and the interests affected making their replies on the other.  This is the big factor in this Bill together with the inclusion of services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan in welcoming the Bill agreed that, in general, it was a very helpful and beneficial piece of legislation.  He queried the advisability of having just one man selected as examiner and suggested that initially the examiner should consult maybe the chairman of the commission with representatives of manufacturers, traders, consumers and some similar groups before he decided to recommend an inquiry.  This was one interpretation I took from his contribution.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I was under the <Col N="673" /> impression that he suggested that instead of an examiner, the initial inquiry group could be a group of three or four persons representing, perhaps, manufacturers, housewives, trade unions, and so on.  This is a rather impossible proposition.  The examiner has to carry the odium of initiating and pursuing inquiries and there is the problem that I referred to earlier of the fact that the Minister has to carry the odium of selecting the examiner in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged that the examiner will be in close touch with the interests concerned in any case and will be fully aware of their point of view.  Certainly, it would be undesirable that this arrangement should be formalised by writing into the Bill an obligation to consult formally the various interests. As I see it, an examiner could not possibly put a case to the Restrictive Practices Commission for serious inquiry without first doing justice to himself and to his case by having made all the necessary inquiries from the interested parties that Deputy Donegan has mentioned.  If the Deputy has further views in this regard, it might be no harm to air them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In regard to the formulation of fair trade practices, Deputy Donegan did see a difficulty.  He talked about black areas, grey areas, white areas.  He referred to a practice that might loosely be described as a restrictive practice, such as the practice on the part of manufacturers of using sole agencies in small towns and double agencies in bigger towns, as for instance in the case of bottled gas companies or clothing manufacturers.  There is this type of practice even in the boot and shoe trade.  Deputy Donegan was worried that an examiner of the Restrictive Practices Commission might find that in their effort to be seen to be absolutely fair they might be forced into the position of having to make regulations which would enable a person in the distributive trade to demand supply from a manufacturer even if that manufacturer did not regard it as an economic proposition to sell his commodity in single units rather than by the dozen or the gross.  The existing <Col N="674" /> Fair Trade Commission has recognised the principle of sole agencies or a restricted number of retail outlets in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>The question as to whether a sole agency is justifiable or not depends on the circumstances of the case.  It is considered that it is best to leave the matter as at present for decision in the light of the facts revealed in any specific inquiry.  The need in the case of certain products to ensure adequate after sales service could be a factor justifying restriction of sales to specified outlets.  These were spelt out by Deputy Donegan and Deputy O'Leary.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that a manufacturer, in order to maintain the good name of his product, must be absolutely sure that the distributor is able in the normal course to follow up the sale by adequate after sales service in those cases where that type of service is required.  It will be found that the Restrictive Practices Commission, like the Fair Trade Commission up to now, will adapt itself and will continue the same approach in similar cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan and Deputy Hogan referred to the effect of the Third Schedule.  This schedule is merely for the guidance of the commission, the examiner and others.  As Deputy Hogan said, it is a pretty exhaustive series of definitions.  An action listed in the Third Schedule is not <i>per se</i> an offence.  It is only when the commission has made a report and the Minister has made an order and the Oireachtas has passed the Bill to confirm that order that the provisions come into force in relation to a particular trade or group.  This is why I emphasised in my opening address that fair trading rules have no legal force and that it is not intended to give them any in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Fair trading rules are somewhat different from orders made arising from a report of, up to now, the Fair Trade Commission, and following this Bill, the Restrictive Practices Commission. There is an arrangement whereby the commission can at any time make their fair trading rules, not having the force of law, but to establish <Col N="675" /> codes of conduct which, if adopted by the persons concerned, would obviate the need for a public inquiry. I can envisage more and more fair trading rules being created arising from the passing of this Bill.  This is the type of arrangement that is arrived at following a detailed examination by the examiner.  I foresee that there will be far more &mdash; and it is my object in this legislation to arrange to have far more &mdash; acceptance of fair trading rules rather than full-scale investigation by the Restrictive Practices Commission into unfair practices followed by ministerial order which must be confirmed by the House.  It is a far better arrangement if alleged unfair trading can be examined and fair trading rules can be devised.</P>
    <P>Many manufacturers and traders who are willing and anxious to act fairly and reasonably in their businesses may find that in the absence of general agreement as to what is fair and reasonable, their competitors may take unfair advantage.  Therefore, a code of fair practice for a trade should attract general support.  A trader would feel able to support the code and would not feel that he was putting himself at a disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> his competitors.  One of the purposes of having discussions between the examiner and representatives of any trade is that fair trading rules may be devised without having to ask the Minister to make orders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Donegan referred to a problem which had arisen in regard to the purchase of a second-hand car.  The question of the exclusion of liability clauses in agreements of that nature is at present being considered in the context of the proposed Consumer Protection Bill.  It is something that I am examining at the present time and I hope to be able to introduce it in the Dáil at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright, I think, also referred to cars in this context.  What I have said in relation to Deputy Donegan's remarks covers the contribution of Deputy Enright in this regard.  Both Deputy Donegan and Deputy FitzGerald referred to mergers in two <Col N="676" /> different contexts.  Deputy Donegan wondered if the blocking or the encouragement, as the case might be, of mergers, was dealt with in this Bill.  I have already indicated more than once in the House that I have a Bill in preparation at present dealing with mergers and the creation of monopolies. The present Bill deals with restrictive or unfair practices on the part of mergers, monopolies and so on but the actual legislation to deal specifically with and to provide for investigating proposed mergers and the creation of monopolies is another and separate piece of legislation which I also hope to bring before the House in a reasonable time.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary compared the examiner with some version of an ombudsman and, in a joking manner, got across the message that Ministers and even governments may in endeavouring to avoid issues have recourse to the creation of an economic ombudsman, as he described him.  I do not look on the examiner as an ombudsman but, as I have already said, as a man who will have the opportunity of investigating more complaints far more speedily than the previous Fair Trade Commission.  He will fulfill a very useful function between the consumer on the one hand and the manufacturer, the distributor or the professional or person otherwise providing a service on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was rather worried about the selection of the examiner and emphasised that I should look outside the public service for the ideal man.  I indicated in opening the debate that I proposed to be extremely careful about this appointment and my range of selection will certainly not be confined to the public service.  The Deputy suggested in his own way that I should select a trade union official and promised he would be as successful as a result of his experience in keeping down costs and prices as he was in attaining the maximum return for the workers he had represented.</P>
    <P>One of the functions of the Restrictive Practices Commission is to endeavour to ensure that there is proper competition but it is not specifically <Col N="677" /> its function to keep down prices although it can be a contributory factor in that respect.  The National Prices Commission have the specific function of examining prices and, as the Deputy knows, the trade union movement is represented on that body. I fear the Deputy's recommendations regarding the appointment of the examiner would not be the criteria I would apply to the examiner in the context in which I would see him.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick of Dublin expressed the hope that the examiner would have authority to investigate cases where discounts were given which could lead to restrictive practices. He mentioned that at present there is an arrangement whereby, perhaps, the supermarket purchaser can exercise quite significant influence on the manufacturer because of the size of his order and can, perhaps, force a manufacturer to reduce a price and so also force that manufacturer to increase the price of the same product to the smaller purchasers because of the need to build up his profit from that source, having sold at a slightly lower rate than he should have applied in the case of the power purchaser in the supermarket.  This is one feature of business that I think will merit investigation by an examiner under the Restrictive Practices Commission.  Reports have reached me from time to time that large purchasers have such influence with a small manufacturer that it is conceivable that they could put the small manufacturer out of business if they withdrew their order from him.  They can, therefore, get themselves into the position where they become so powerful that they can dictate to a considerable extent the price at which the manufacturer must supply the large purchaser.  If the supermarket purchaser is taking 33? per cent or 50 per cent of the output of a small manufacturer this forces the small manufacturer to try to recover his losses and redeem the position by increasing his charges to the other group of people who purchase the remaining 50 per cent of his goods.</P>
    <P>I have no confirmation of this apart from having heard the allegations from <Col N="678" /> time to time, but it is an aspect of this business that I should certainly hope the new Restrictive Practices Commission would have an early opportunity of investigating fully.  I am mindful of Deputy Fitzpatrick's remarks because, obviously, his contribution was fully in accord with one or two reports that have come to me in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the vulnerability of small shops competing with supermarkets.  What I have been saying, arising from Deputy Fitzpatrick's contribution, was not related exactly to that.  I have said in various speeches that changes in retail structure were inevitable but it was clear there would always be room for the small man and I would endeavour to see that while supermarkets and other large traders would be allowed to make legitimate use of their trading strength, they would not be allowed to use their power unfairly.</P>
    <P>I look upon the present Bill as specifically providing that unfair or restrictive practices can be dealt with. I have an open mind as to how this could be done.  Deputy Donegan drew attention to this in dealing with my opening remarks about small businesses: I have no intention of introducing legislation which would deprive the consumer of the opportunity of getting the finished product at the lowest possible price.  That would, I think, be very wrong.  What I am saying is that I want to make sure that we shall not have a situation in which the overall distribution of consumer goods results &mdash; this ties in even with the monopoly situation I mentioned a few months ago &mdash; in 90 per cent consumer goods being sold by three or four large cartels who in turn can eventually find themselves able to get together to fix the final retail price to the disadvantage of the consumers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright said that unfair practices were quite commonplace with supermarkets and something should be done about it.  It would be very wrong if what I have already said should convey the impression that I have found that the supermarket owner in the sale of his items to the consumer at the cheapest possible price is guilty of an unfair practice.  I do not say <Col N="679" /> that.  I am most anxious to see the article being sold at the most attractive price to the consumer.  I have said if the power of the big buyer is used to the disadvantage of the manufacturer forcing him to sell the balance of his goods at an inflated price in order to try to balance for the losses he has made through having to sell to one or two customers at less than economic prices this is an unfair practice.  It would be very wrong of me to convey that I should take steps to cut across the actions of supermarkets at the present time in offering their goods at the most attractive prices to their customers.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the various exclusions and I will try to deal with them collectively.  I also want to say something further about the small trader.  Deputy Hogan asked a straightforward question as to how I saw this Bill helping the small trader. A straightforward answer is that it empowers the examiner and the commission to deal with unfair practices.  If a chain of supermarkets were to try to use their buying power to get discount that would not be available to others, something could be done about this under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Begley wondered whether dancehalls and the engagement of big bands might come within the ambit of this Bill.  Dance bands will come under this Bill and any unfair or restrictive practices could be investigated.  Certainly if a proprietor of a chain of dancehalls would not allow a band to accept an engagement this would be restrictive.  The question of charges by dance bands is a matter for price control and the Prices (Amendment) Bill would be the appropriate measure to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to the question of insurance.  This is something which could be investigated under the terms of the Bill.  He said that it was likely that the Minister, when replying, would draw attention to the fact that there is an inquiry going on and that he would hide behind this inquiry.  I do not think &ldquo;hiding behind&rdquo; is the appropriate expression to use in this regard.  There <Col N="680" /> is an exhaustive inquiry in progress on insurance at the present time.  I expect a number of problems which have been raised may be resolved by this inquiry.  I certainly hope that many useful suggestions and much advice will come from this inquiry.  I hope we will be able to come up with some type of solution that would obviate the necessity for the matter to be taken to the Restrictive Practices Commission within the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney queried the meaning of the words &ldquo;common good&rdquo; in section 7 and wondered if it should be defined.  The expression is taken from the Constitution where it is not defined.  The common good might be affected in any one of a number of ways.  Paragraph (e) of section 7 requires the commission to furnish a report as to the reason for its conclusion. If anything is found to be against the common good the reason for the finding would have to be given.  If a practice is considered to be against the common good that practice and the reason for it would have to be outlined in the report by the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney said there should be an appeal body above the commission. If the commission were the last word it is quite possible an appeal body might be desirable.  However, before anything the commission initiates can have the force of law, I must give effect by order to it.  The Oireachtas has also to pass the subsequent measure giving approval to the order before it has the force of law.  This provides safeguards against any unwise or unfair action by the commission. The general overall acceptance by the Houses of the Oireachtas of the orders that have been made over a period of 20 years is proof of the efficacy and the usefulness of the system that has operated up to now.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier today regarding the enactment of the previous Bill, in many cases the orders are almost a matter of form in that the recommendations not only have been accepted but have been implemented before the Bill came to the House. We had the original Bill in 1953, there <Col N="681" /> was an amendment to the Bill in 1959, and Deputy Donegan agreed it was time to have another look at the matter.  There has not been any experience of a miscarriage of justice arising from the recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission and the subsequent orders made.  At this stage I do not see any great need for a court of appeal that might have the power to override the recommendations of the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hogan and Deputy FitzGerald raised the matter of the powers of the examiner regarding firms outside the jurisdiction of the State.  The examiner will have power to investigate in the State any aspect of the supply and distribution of goods and the provision of services by those firms.  He can use his powers to obtain relevant information from firms in this country or from agents of foreign firms operating here.  As I have indicated, the examiner will have no power in the international field but he will be able to obtain information from his opposite numbers abroad.  Deputy FitzGerald drew attention to this kind of situation and the question of the necessity to deal with this matter in an EEC situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney said he could see no provision in the Bill for the giving of financial aid to what he called the defendants, the people against whom the examiner would be moving. Having studied the record in this matter, I have found no case where there has been any volume of complaint by the people whose practices were being examined.  To my knowledge, there has been no demand for compensation or financial aid in regard to this matter.  Provision was not made for it in the Bill and when Deputy Cooney mentioned the matter it struck me it was a matter I might consider.</P>
    <P>In fact, the question of expenses and costs would arise only in the event of the examiner deciding to pursue a case and asking the Restrictive Practices Commission to investigate an alleged restrictive practice.  If a restrictive practice is in operation, or is suspected to be in operation, the public interest demands that it be investigated <Col N="682" /> fully.  I do not think that the opening of purse-strings to make expenses or financial advances available to the affected parties is altogether desirable but I shall have a look at this aspect of the matter between now and Committee stage.  I have not considered the matter because, to my knowledge, there have not been complaints from the affected parties.  However, arising from the dual responsibilities in this regard that there can be more activity arising from the operations of the examiner, there is a possibility that there might be justification for looking into this aspect.  Apart from that, I should not like to commit myself any further at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy FitzGerald drew attention to the exemption the Bill appears to give to State bodies.  Certain types of business are exempted, not because they are primarily operated by State companies but because there are already means of supervising their operation. Many of the State bodies will come within the scope of the Bill.  In fact, the Fair Trade Commission are preparing to carry out an inquiry into the scrap steel industry which involves Irish Steel Holdings.  This is something which has been threatened for quite a while.</P>
    <P>I have no specific arrangement whereby I deliberately exclude State bodies.  In fact, where there are exclusions the State already has the means of supervising the conduct of the various State bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In relation to the ESB the exclusion relates only to electricity supply and not to any other activities of the ESB.  Section 1 (1) (c) refers to the supplying of electricity and automatically that is read to mean the exclusion of the ESB.  It is specifically the exclusion of electricity supply only and not any other activities of the ESB. If the existing provisions in relation to the supply of electricity were found inadequate it would be for the Minister for Transport and Power to act by way <Col N="683" /> of amendment to the Electricity Supply Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Transport and Power is responsible for the Electricity Supply Act.  An arrangement whereby the State subsidises the provision of electricity to smallholders in rural areas or in the underdeveloped western areas &mdash; an arrangement whereby they are specially subsidised when installing electricity, or any arrangement which would supply electricity to them at a cheaper rate&mdash; in the normal course of fair trading could, and would, be frowned on because it might be suggested that everyone was not being treated equally.  It might be frowned on if people in the Aran Islands were given special provision. I would imagine that if three very level-headed people studied the economics of the situation and discovered that it was not as economic to supply electricity to the Aran Islands as to the city of Dublin, they might find that it was improper for the ESB to treat the islanders as they are treating them or as they might be proposing to treat them.  I offer that off the top of my head.  I have not studied it.</P>
      <P>Some questions were asked in connection with banking.  My understanding from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, is &mdash; and this is why it is not included in this Bill &mdash; that in the Central Bank Act, 1971, there is power to control the banking business, Deputy Cooney and Deputy FitzGerald referred to this.  My remarks are by way of reply to both of them.  Deputy FitzGerald referred to Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty dealing with competition.  He said he was surprised that the Bill did not make the necessary provision in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that certain further provisions will be necessary.  The Restrictive Practices Commission will have to be designated as a competent authority for certain purposes.  With the coming referendum in mind I do not think it would be desirable to put something into a Bill at this stage without knowing <Col N="684" /> what the outcome will be.  I felt that this could be left over until Committee Stage or until the Bill is being dealt with in the Seanad when it could be amended.  If the Bill has passed through both Houses we can introduce a short Bill covering the requirements of Articles 85 and 86 of the Rome Treaty.  If a majority of the people vote in favour of EEC entry, various pieces of legislation will have to be introduced.  I do not visualise any difficulty in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's views on a number of items.  In my opening speech I tried to deal briefly with the various sections of the Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to my lack of ingenuity. Deputy FitzGerald also asked what change had been made in the First Schedule arising out of the Supreme Court judgement in the Public Accounts Committee case.  The fault found with the existing Acts was that they purported to empower the Fair Trade Commission to decide that an offence had been committed, leaving to the courts the task only of deciding what the penalty should be.  This Bill leaves it to the courts to decide whether an offence was committed and, if so, what the penalty should be.  The Attorney General advises me that the new version meets the Supreme Court ruling in this regard. <Col N="685" /> The Bill will be fully discussed on Committee Stage.  I should like to compliment those who contributed to the Bill.  Deputy Hogan and Deputy Cooney questioned the advisability of covering professional services in this legislation.  Deputy O'Leary drew attention to the fact that it took a long time for the recommendations of the National Industrial and Economic Council to be put into effect.  One of their recommendations in 1967, and repeted in their Report on Incomes and Prices Policy, Report No. 27, in 1970 following their Report on Full Employment in January, 1967, was that the services should be taken into account by the Fair Trade Commission. In January, 1967, they said that the activities of the Fair Trade Commission had been mainly confined to distribution.  They said:</P>
      <P>In our view, it is desirable that there should be procedures for referring to the Fair Trade Commission for examination restrictive practices between persons or firms included in the &ldquo;Other Domestic&rdquo; sector of the economy so that measures to raise the degree of competition in these activities could be devised.</P>
      <P>I am quoting from paragraph 95 of the Report on Full Employment, No. 18, of 31st January, 1967.  They said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of these services which industry requires must by their very nature be produced in Ireland; examples are legal, auctioneering <Col N="686" /> and architectural services, the services of insurance, banking and other financial institutions, building, electricity, gas and water.  These services are and always have been largely sheltered from external competition. It is therefore important that there should be competition among those supplying these services in Ireland, to ensure that they will be made available as cheaply as possible to the industrial sector.</P>
    <P>In their Report on Incomes and Prices Policy, No. 27, of 20th February, 1970, the NIEC said:</P>
    <P>Despite free trade, the services sector of the economy will continue to be largely sheltered from competition and an extension of the powers of the Commission to cover this sector is desirable.</P>
    <P>That is, the Fair Trade Commission. Deputy Cooney questioned the advisability of covering these services and I am pointing out that the NIEC recommended that they should be included in any further legislation in connection with Fair Trade.  I want to thank the House for contributions which were generally constructive in this debate.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

However, legislation has been drafted and can be introduced at short notice banning the flying of aircraft over the country at supersonic speed.  The Minister for Transport and Power would propose to introduce the legislation to the Houses of the Oireachtas at a point where reports of sonic boom experiments undertaken with supersonic aircraft on test trials clearly indicate that the boom would be obnoxious and inimical to the tranquility of the Irish countryside.</P>
      <P>Should regular services by supersonic aircraft be established prior to there being a clear indication of the effect of the boom such services might cause, the legislation will be introduced and later made operative by Ministerial Order when that course proves necessary.</P>
