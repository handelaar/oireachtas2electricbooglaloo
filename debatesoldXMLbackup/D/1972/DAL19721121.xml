      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach really believe that it is fully understood abroad and, if it is, why is there such sympathy and so much money coming into the country to buy arms and so on, and why was it necessary for the Minister for Justice to go over to America recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows <Col N="2004" /> there are outmoded and irrelevant emotional ideas among some people in the United States about what is happening in the North of Ireland. One of the reasons for the Minister for Justice making that speech was to try to correct that situation.</P>

      <P>The latest available information is that obtained from the 1966 census of population and, because of the groupings used in classifying the material, it is not possible to draw a dividing line at £5 valuation.  The number of farmers with holdings of between £4 and £7 valuation was 17,744 while the number with holdings of valuation £7 or over was 160,228.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No official population projections are published for the State.  However, projections are requested from time to time by the OECD and the most recent projections which were supplied to that organisation last year cover the period up to 1996.  Two projections were made, one assuming that net emigration would gradually decline from the 1966-71 level and the other assuming zero net emigration over the entire period.  On the former assumption the average annual rate of population growth obtained for the period 1971-96 is 1.0 per cent and on the latter assumption, 1.3 per cent.  It should be noted that the results obtained in such projections are very much dependent on the assumptions on which they are based, particularly in regard to such factors as mortality, fertility, marriage and emigration rates.</P>

There is no provision for payment of allowances for the care in their own homes of severely mentally handicapped children. Such children are covered as regards health by the same provisions as other categories and in addition may obtain any necessary drugs free of charge.  There is also provision for payment of financial assistance to families in necessitous circumstances, and in the case of persons over 16 years of age, the disabled persons maintenance regulations provide for payment of allowances to disabled persons who cannot maintain themselves and whose near relatives cannot maintain them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has mentioned over 16 years of age and I am aware of that.  However, is he aware that in some cases, particularly of severely handicapped children, mentally and physically, where they are cared for at home, this can be a great strain on parents, particularly on parents of limited means?  Does the Minister agree that an allowance should be made available to the parents of those children?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that they will continue for the next 20 years to take the normal quantities (about ½ million tons of sodpeat and 2¼ million tons of milled peat) at the existing peat fired generating stations and that the annual total of milled peat consumed will increase to about 2¼ million tons when the Shannonbridge No. 2 generating set is commissioned in 1976.</P>
      <P>A small trade in briquettes has developed in Northern Ireland and Britain, mainly to Northern Ireland. Exports in 1971-72 were about 7 per cent of total sales of briquettes.</P>
      <P>A weekly average of 4,600 was employed by Bord na Móna in 1971-72 and it is expected that this will gradually increase to 4,800 over the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have no legal power <Col N="2018" /> to influence the choice of fuel in the private sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>As regards the public sector, it is long-standing policy that the ESB accord the maximum practicable load to the peat-fired generating stations.</P>
    <P>In connection with the rest of the public sector the Government decided in 1960 in response to proposals by my predecessor as Minister for Transport and Power that each Minister should endeavour to ensure:</P>
    <P>(1) that, to the utmost practicable extent, the following native fuels, namely, turf, Irish coal and electricity, should be given preference for use by his Department and by all local authorities and institutions, semi-state bodies and other organisations which are associated with him or which he is in a position to influence in this regard; and</P>
    <P>(2) that such bodies or organisations contemplating the erection of new buildings or the reconstruction of old ones should consult with Bord na Móna and/or the Electricity Supply Board at the earliest practicable stage with a view to giving these boards ample opportunity to demonstrate the practicability of using turf or electricity.</P>
    <P>This is still the policy.  The use of coal and turf involves serious practical and economic difficulties in some locations. In the circumstances, I have appointed a small committee to examine and report on measures to maximise the use of native fuel in the public sector.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 to 25 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>A statement by Bord Fáilte has already been published in which the board indicated that in late 1970 and early 1971 representatives of Bord Fáilte, CIE and the air companies had discussions with a consultancy firm in relation to a consultancy project on marketing and promotional activities in tourism fields to be carried out for these bodies on a basis to be arranged between them.  As the board has indicated, the project did not, in the event, proceed beyond the preliminary stages. The consultants claimed £28,848 for fees and expenses incurred on preliminary work.  As the proposed consultancy related to tourism, Bord Fáilte undertook responsibility for dealing with this claim and eventually settled it for £10,000 without admission of liability.</P>
      <P>My Department was not asked to authorise the payment to the consultants. The report and accounts of Bord Fáilte were received and have been presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am informed by Bord Fáilte that the reasons for the delay included problems relating to the reconciliation of statistics &mdash; which were not published until September &mdash; and the finalisation of the accounts.</P>

      <P>Title to a widow's contributory pension is not affected by income, irrespective of its source.  The keeping of boarders does not, of itself, disqualify a widow from receiving a widow's non-contributory pension.  All non-contributory pensions are, however, subject to a means test and the net profit derived from keeping boarders, due allowance being made for all the expenses involved, is assessed as means.  The profit thus assessed may affect the rate of pension payable.  I should mention that in the case of such a widow with dependent children, her yearly means are reduced by £78 per annum in respect of each dependent child.  Amendment of the existing provisions, which would require legislation, is not at present contemplated.</P>

      <P>There could be several reasons, and, without knowing the circumstances it is not possible to say what the particular reason might be in the case which the Deputy has no doubt in mind.  Apart from the possibility of increased means the method of assessing means for old age pension purposes differs in some respects from that for widows' non-contributory pension. In this connection, I would refer the Deputy to my reply to a question on 24th November, 1971, at column 245, Volume 257, No. 2 of the Dáil Official Report.</P>

      <P>Credited contributions are allowed in respect of contribution weeks of duly notified incapacity for work and the granting of credits in respect of medical certificates submitted presents no problem in the vast majority of cases.  The Department must, however, reserve the right to satisfy itself as to incapacity in any particular case and as to the fact that the insured person has refrained from work during the period of certified incapacity. In the normal course credited contributions allowed in respect of incapacity are valid for all benefit under the Social Welfare Acts, including unemployment benefit.  Where, however, contributions paid by an insured person are reckonable only for the purposes of widows' pension, credited contributions allowed to that person would be reckonable only for qualification for such pension.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2023" /> During the past year I have made regulations under the Factories Act dealing specifically with the protection of workers' health from risks caused by carcinogenic substances, radioactive materials and asbestos.  I have power under the Factories Act to make regulations dealing with substances such as certain types of lubricating oils which could possibly cause cancer but the difficulty is to identify with certainty, the types of oils concerned.</P>
    <P>Following the recognition of oils such as cutting oils, soluble oils and oils used in metal rolling and hardening as possible sources of danger, the manufacturers of lubricating oils have reformulated their products and the oils which are marketed at present in this country are claimed to be free from cancer producing agents.  However, the problem is complex and is still the subject of international research. One of the major difficulties is the long period of exposure which may elapse before the presence of cancer can be diagnosed with certainty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that retailers who pay their wholesalers on a cash basis have to meet VAT charges at the point of purchase of goods for retail sale; that such retailers are at <Col N="2026" /> a serious loss as compared to the position that applied under the turnover and wholesale tax laws; and if he proposes to redress this position, by amending legislation if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the former sales tax system registered retailers were accountable for the retail turnover tax on their sales and were entitled to obtain their business supplies free of turnover tax.  Wholesale tax where it applied was included, however, in the price which the retailer paid to his supplier.</P>
      <P>It is an essential feature of a value-added tax that tax is chargeable on all business transactions and that each registered person takes credit against his own liability for the tax invoiced to him by his suppliers.  Accordingly, a retailer bears value-added tax on his purchases but is entitled to a credit for it against the tax on his sales.</P>
      <P>I do not accept that this position puts retailers at a serious loss where they pay cash to their wholesalers.  A retailer has certain benefits under the value-added tax as compared with the situation under the retail turnover tax because (a) he gets credit for the wholesale tax which he suffered under the previous system on his business equipment, repairs, <i>et cetera,</i> and (b) he has the use of his receipts from sales for an extra month because of the two-monthly accounting period for VAT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, in the case of small retailers who pay cash, if you take a multiple of £100, for every £100 which they formerly paid, they now have to pay £105.26 at the point when they are ordering the goods and paying for them in cash; whereas under the turnover tax system, if they were registered, they had not to pay turnover tax for at least a month and maybe longer if they did not happen to dispose of the goods because it was on a turnover basis.  If they had them for three months, they did not have to pay until they had the turnover on the goods. Will the Minister agree that, far from having the advantage of an extra month's credit as he stated on radio, they are suffering a loss, and in many cases a fairly serious loss, and that this <Col N="2027" /> occurs in the main in relation to very small traders who work on a cash basis and that it is hitting the poorest of the retailers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that. What the Deputy says is true in regard to certain retailers who are now paying 5.26 per cent on purchases for cash where they did not do so before.  That is correct.  It is also true that the number of retailers who do this is relatively quite small and it is further true that they have an additional month's credit which they did not have before.  I do not think the Deputy would suggest that they go to make purchases only once every three months and that suggests that the extended period of accounting for VAT is certainly of benefit to them.  Thirdly, the Deputy will be aware of the fact that the system which operated previously was one which certainly led to abuse and was abused by people purchasing the goods from the wholesaler for cash and giving a false registered number as a result of which they did not pay any tax at all.  That loophole has certainly been closed under VAT.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries how the <Col N="2041" /> method of brucellosis eradication in this country compares with that being adopted or already successfully completed in other countries of the enlarged EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 59, 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>The EEC has not adopted any common measures in regard to the eradication of brucellosis but has adopted a directive governing trade in cattle between member countries.  The directive sets out certain minimum animal health requirements.  As from 1st January, 1973, Irish cattle exports will be required to comply with these requirements subject to the concessions negotiated prior to the signing of the accession treaty.  The general implications of the directive for this country are indicated in the White Paper on the Accession of Ireland to the European Communities and the supplement thereto which were laid before each House of the Oireachtas in January and February, 1972.</P>
      <P>From the information available, I understand that brucellosis has been virtually eradicated from Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg and Holland. Eradication programmes are in operation in the remaining member states. As the Deputy may be aware, Northern Ireland has already been declared free of brucellosis.  The terms of the directive apply, however, irrespective of the stage which eradication has reached in the importing or exporting countries.  Only cattle from brucellosis free herds may normally be imported by member countries for breeding or profit but a consignee country may grant an authorisation to permit the entry of animals under 30 months of age for meat production from a non-brucellosis free herd. Animals from such herds may also be admitted for immediate slaughter.  In all cases a pre-export test is necessary except for young animals and animals from a brucellosis free herd which are intended for immediate slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The method of brucellosis eradication in this country, systematic testing, slaughter of reactors and control of <Col N="2042" /> vaccination, is generally similar to the methods followed within the present Community as well as in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, particularly in the south, brucellosis is rampant, that there is no control whatsoever, that affected animals are taken from mart to mart and sold in the open market, causing further spread of the disease, and that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have not taken action in this matter?  Is he further aware that as a result of brucellosis being so prevalent there, animals are excreting the disease on the milk, thus affecting human beings, that some tourists were affected and that this had a very bad effect on the tourist trade? Is he further aware that this matter has been brought to the notice of the Department time and time again by the Cork County Animal Health Committee and that no action has been taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Why would the Department not allow farmers in any part of the country to engage voluntarily in the eradication scheme, as it did in the case of the bovine TB scheme, which started in five or six counties and farmers in other counties could voluntarily participate?  If farmers are selling affected beasts on the open market, other animals are contaminated, as Deputy Creed has said. If farmers could voluntarily engage in the scheme reactors could be sold to the Department.  The Minister should look into this matter immediately.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary why the Department allow a beast that has contracted the disease to be sold from a farm in any part of Kerry.  When that beast aborts, the idea is to get rid of her.  She is brought to a market and may contaminate a number of beasts. She may be sold to some unfortunate farmer who has 100 cows free of the disease and she contaminates all.  Why not have a voluntary scheme whereby a farmer could apply to the Department, get his compensation and have the affected animal taken to the factory for immediate slaughter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>The introduction of this measure represents a further significant step forward in the development of our social insurance system.  It is designed to make adequate provision against loss of income by insured workers and their families during periods of sickness or unemployment.  As Deputies are aware, the loss of income suffered by a person during periods of sickness and unemployment has up to now been catered for by payment of flat rate benefits.  Down the years these benefits have been regularly improved not only in the matter of provision for dependants and in duration of payment but also in the levels of payment which have been increased at a rate very considerably greater than the rate of increases in the cost of living.  The main defect in these flat rate benefits is that they are not flexible enough and cannot be adjusted or shaped to provide adequately for the different needs of persons who, when working, had not the same levels of earnings and, as a result, had widely differing financial commitments related to their levels of earnings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases, particularly at higher pay levels, the rates of benefit are not sufficiently high to enable insured persons to maintain anything approaching their accustomed standard of living during longer periods of sickness or unemployment.  To increase the flat rate benefits to a level which might be regarded as adequate for the higher paid workers would, however, require such an increase in the contribution rates that these would be a heavy <Col N="2050" /> burden on the lower paid worker. Further, very high flat rate benefits could have the undesirable effect of giving lower paid workers, when unemployed, such a high proportion of their wages as to deter them from seeking work.  The purpose of this Bill is, therefore, to improve the position in this respect by relating both benefit and contributions to earnings to some degree and to provide rates of benefit which will better enable persons to maintain, during sickness and unemployment, a standard of living reasonably close to that to which they have been accustomed.</P>
    <P>Although, as I have said, this Bill is a significant step forward in the development of our social insurance system, I am fully aware that there is nothing very novel in the idea of pay-related benefit.  It is a feature of the social insurance schemes in one form or another of many countries including Britain and it has been my intention for some time to introduce such a scheme here.  In the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development it was included among the social insurance schemes scheduled for introduction but, for reasons which I shall explain, it has only now become a practical proposition.</P>
    <P>The main problems in setting up a scheme of pay-related benefit are the collection of contributions based on pay and the obtaining of accurate, reliable, and readily accessible information as to annual income on which to calculate the benefit.  It is essential for the purposes of such a scheme that the earnings of persons covered should be fully and clearly recorded and readily accessible for the purposes of both collection of contributions and payment of benefit.  In the PAYE and associated methods of collecting income tax from employees the Revenue Commissioners have machinery under which accurate records are available of the earnings of the majority of persons employed in this country.  Some classes of employees are not included, however, and I will refer to these later.</P>
    <P>If the machinery of the income tax collection system were not to be made available for the purposes of <Col N="2051" /> this pay-related social insurance scheme, then a separate system of collection and of record-keeping would have to be set up by my Department for these purposes.  Such a procedure would be an unnecessary duplication of work in the public service and would place an intolerable burden on employers by requiring them to furnish the same information twice.  It would have been feasible but it would have been costly and involved further delay as it would have entailed the setting up of a separate computer installation in my Department for which not only special accommodation would have to be provided but also additional specially trained staff.</P>
    <P>Some work was, in fact, done in this connection but this only brought out more clearly the magnitude of the problems a separate installation would involve and the extent of the extra burden which would have been placed on employers.  The setting up of a separate Departmental computer installation for the purposes of this particular scheme was not therefore considered a reasonable alternative to using the income tax collection system for the purposes of a pay-related benefit scheme.  However, as the Revenue Commissioners themselves have only recently reached the position where they could undertake the collecting of pay-related contributions and, at the same time, furnish the information needed to pay benefit, it has only now become possible to introduce the pay-related benefit scheme provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The scheme of pay-related benefit in this Bill is designed to provide a new benefit, under the social insurance system, which will supplement unemployment benefit in the case of unemployment and disability benefit and maternity allowance in the case of incapacity for work.  A person who is entitled to disability benefit may, because his incapacity is due to an accident at work or a specified occupational disease, be in receipt of injury benefit under the occupational injuries scheme in lieu of disability benefit and it is intended that pay-related benefit will be payable <Col N="2052" /> in such a case also so long as the person involved has an underlying entitlement to disability benefit.</P>
    <P>The existing flat rate benefits mentioned, including amounts for adult and child dependants, will continue to be payable under the same conditions as at present.  Where, however, the incapacity for work or unemployment lasts for longer than a fortnight, the flat rate benefit will be supplemented by pay-related benefit, which will be at the rate of 40 per cent of that part of the claimant's average weekly earnings, in a previous income tax year, which lies between £14 and an upper limit or ceiling, yet to be fixed.</P>
    <P>The average weekly earnings of all industrial workers in the quarter ended 30th June, 1972, was approximately £23.  A single person earning this amount will receive £3.60 by way of pay-related benefit, plus £5.55 by way of disability or unemployment benefit, making a total weekly benefit payment of £9.15.  A married man earning £23 will receive total weekly benefit of £12.90 if he has no dependent children, £15.60 if he has two children and £18.60 if he has five children.  The average weekly earnings of adult male industrial workers in the same period was almost £30.  Under the new provisions a single man in this category will receive £11.95 total weekly benefit.  A married man will get £15.70 if he has no dependent children, £18.40 if he has two children and £21.40 if he has five children.</P>
    <P>I should explain that the 40 per cent level was chosen after an examination of the real value of various levels of pay-related benefit in terms of replacement of net pay lost during periods of sickness or unemployment.  Very few workers take home the full amount of their pay.  Stoppages of various kinds are almost invariably made and these include statutory deduction in respect of social insurance contributions and income tax.  These statutory deductions, which arise out of payment of remuneration, are not made during weeks of unemployment or sickness so that during such weeks income replacement by way of benefit need not take the amount of the deductions into consideration but should properly relate only to the person's <Col N="2053" /> net or take home pay.  As I have indicated the main purpose of having benefits related to pay is to enable the recipient to maintain, during periods when he is not at work, a standard of living reasonably comparable to that which he normally enjoys.  Children's allowances, where payable, are part of the family income and are paid whether the beneficiary is earning or sick or unemployed, and it is reasonable to add these payments both to the level of take home pay and to the level of benefit in determining the real value of the pay-related benefit in maintaining the beneficiary's standard of living.</P>
    <P>The 40 per cent of reckonable earnings in excess of £14, when added to the flat rate benefit payable, provides in the case of single persons, replacement of at least 50 per cent of net pay at all pay levels while, in the case of married persons, the level of replacement is higher because of the addition of increases of flat rate benefit in respect of dependants.  The level of replacement of net pay, for example, at average weekly earnings of £30 would be approximately 65 per cent for a married man, 70 per cent for a married man with two children, and 75 per cent for a married man with four children.  At earnings of £20 the level of replacement would be higher still, being 70 per cent for a married man 78 per cent for a married man with two children and almost 90 per cent for a married man with four children.</P>
    <P>It will be seen, therefore, that in the case of married men with families, the highest proportion of net pay will be replaced in the cases of those with the largest families and the lowest pay, and the proportion will decline as the levels of pay rise and the size of the family decrease.  It could happen in the case of persons with large families whose reckonable weekly earnings are low that, when the amount of pay-related benefit is added to the flat rate benefit, the total amount payable would exceed the average weekly earnings on which the benefit was based.  As the object of the scheme is to enable a person to maintain his standard of living it would seem illogical if the scheme were to provide for his income, during periods of <Col N="2054" /> sickness or unemployment, to be supplemented to a higher level than when he was working.  This can be prevented by putting a ceiling or wage stop related to a person's pay on the total amount of benefit that could be paid to him and there is provision to do this by regulations.</P>
    <P>I should like to explain that the lower limit of reckonable weekly earnings of £14 was chosen for pay-related benefit purposes because the present level of £5.55 weekly for flat rate disability and unemployment benefits for a single person represents approximately 40 per cent of £14 and a still higher percentage of normal take home pay in such a case.  A single person earning less than £13.88 receives by way of flat rate disability or unemployment benefit more than 40 per cent of his earnings or more than 50 per cent of his net or take home pay.  A married man in this category receives as flat rate benefit for himself and his wife at least 75 per cent of his net pay.  If he has children he receives a considerably higher proportion by way of replacement income.  This varies from at least 95 per cent if he has a wife and two children, to well over 100 per cent if he has more than two children or has been earning significantly less than £14 weekly; and there is no wage stop in the case of flat rate benefit.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, nothing discriminatory as has already been suggested in some quarters about the adoption of the floor of £14 a week proposed to be adopted in this scheme.  It is a simple matter of arithmetic and commonsense, because obviously if pure pay relationship were applied to the lower ranges of weekly earnings the workers concerned would suffer a greater reduction in income when sick or unemployed than they now do under the flat rate benefit system.</P>
    <P>The ceiling, or upper limit of pay, which will be taken into account for benefit and contribution purposes has not been provided for specifically in the Bill and it is proposed that it be prescribed by regulations.  The level of this ceiling cannot yet be decided as the remuneration limit for the compulsory insurance of non-manual <Col N="2055" /> workers, which at present stands at £1,600 a year, affects this question.  As I have already announced on more than one occasion, I am anxious to have this remuneration limit abolished and I hope to be in a position to introduce legislation for that purpose shortly.</P>
    <P>If this limit were to stand the ceiling or upper limit on reckonable weekly earnings for pay-related benefit purposes could not exceed the weekly equivalent of £1,600 a year, since if non-manual workers over that limit are excluded from compulsory insurance there would be no case for including the earnings of manual workers above that level for pay-related benefit purposes.  When the limit is abolished I will be able to prescribe a ceiling on reckonable weekly earnings for pay-related benefit purposes which will be related to the general level of wages at the time the scheme commences and which can be changed from time to time in line with changes in that level.</P>
    <P>The average weekly earnings which will be used for the purpose of calculating the amount of pay-related benefit payable to a person will be based on his actual gross earnings from his employment which are reckonable for income tax purposes.  These earnings will include all amounts paid as salary, wages, fees, arrears of pay, bonuses, Christmas boxes, overtime, commission, pay during sickness, holiday pay, &ldquo;danger&rdquo; money, &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; money, &ldquo;tea&rdquo; money, &ldquo;tool&rdquo; money, which are taken into account by the Revenue Commissioners as earnings for income tax purposes.  The Revenue Commissioners will furnish to my Department all the necessary information, which will already have been recorded regarding earnings, so as to enable pay-related benefit to be calculated and paid.  The information to be furnished in this regard will, of course, be restricted to the minimum necessary to enable the benefit to be paid, probably to the person's total gross earnings for the relevant income tax year in each case.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that objection to the use of earnings in a previous income <Col N="2056" /> tax year may be raised on the grounds that they relate to a past period and take no account of the rises in pay levels in the meantime. In fact, as it will be some months after the end of an income tax year before records of earnings become available, the gross earnings to be taken into account for benefit purposes may not be those in the most recently completed income tax year. However, to meet the difficulties there is power to prescribe by regulations the manner and the basis of calculation of reckonable weekly earnings for the purposes of pay-related benefit and it is intended that this power will be used to inflate reckonable weekly earnings so as to broadly compensate for the effects of the time lag.</P>
    <P>Since the pay-related benefit will be paid as a supplement to flat rate benefit and will not be payable if there is no title to the flat rate benefit, it will not be necessary for a person to make a separate claim for pay-related benefit but he will be required to furnish whatever information is needed to ascertain the amount of his reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year.  In straightforward cases, and these should be the vast majority, all that the claimant will be required to supply will be his income tax registered serial number but in other cases he may be required to furnish further information by way of confirmation, or in cases of doubt or difficulty.  It is the intention to integrate the payment of pay-related benefit into the existing system for the payment of flat rate benefits so that both the flat rate and pay-related benefits will be paid together in one weekly payment.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit will be payable for not more than 147 days of unemployment during any period of interruption of employment, provided the claimant is in receipt of unemployment benefit.  It will also be payable for a similar maximum of 147 days in respect of incapacity for work during any period of interruption of employment if the claimant is entitled to disability benefit.  The payment in respect of incapacity for work may be <Col N="2057" /> made with occupational injury benefit if the claimant would otherwise be entitled to disability benefit or maternity allowance.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit will, in the ordinary course, begin to be payable after the claimant has been incapacitated or unemployed for two weeks, which period will include the existing three waiting days for flat rate benefit.  And here I must emphasise that the new benefit is not intended for shorter-term periods of incapacity or unemployment during which flat rate benefit will be payable, as normally these should not seriously affect the claimant's standard of living.  It will continue to be paid, up to the maximum in either case of 147 days, for as long as the beneficiary continues to be entitled to flat rate benefit but, if the flat rate benefit should cease to be payable before the 147 days are completed, the pay-related benefit will also cease.</P>
    <P>In the normal course a person claiming flat rate unemployment benefit will have three waiting days of unemployment before any benefit becomes pay-related benefit with unemployment benefit for 147 days after a 12 day waiting period which will include the three waiting days for the flat rate benefit which I have already mentioned will bring the beneficiary up to the same point where he has been paid 156 days flat rate unemployment benefit. Similarly payment of pay-related benefit with disability benefit will normally cease at the point where the person has been paid 156 days disability benefit.</P>
    <P>I should now like to say a few words about the financing and scope of the scheme.  It is provided that the cost of the pay-related scheme will be borne by contributions shared equally by employers and employed contributors. The contribution will be pay-related and thus the cost of the scheme will be spread equitably over all pay levels between £14 a week and the ceiling to be fixed for benefit purposes.  I am <Col N="2058" /> satisfied that the Exchequer should not have to contribute towards a scheme which is designed to provide the greatest benefit for higher paid workers and from which lower paid workers are excluded and so the pay-related contribution levied on employers and employees will be set at a level adequate to cover the total cost of the scheme.  For the same reason I do not consider that employers should be asked to pay a higher proportion of the pay-related contribution than an employee.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, it has been arranged to have the pay-related contributions collected by way of the income tax machinery of the Revenue Commissioners and paid into the social insurance fund and the nature of the pay to be taken into account for pay-related contribution purposes will be the same as for benefit.  Instead of using the earnings in the preceding tax year, however, the contributions will be based on and collected from a person's actual earnings in the income tax year then current.  These earnings will, of course, be the earnings which will be the basis of the person's entitlement to pay-related benefit in a subsequent year.</P>
    <P>It has not yet been possible to make a really firm estimate of the cost of the scheme because of lack of detailed information regarding pay levels of employees.  My Department have, however, very recently been supplied with better information on pay levels and this is being processed in order to cost the scheme more accurately and to determine the level of contribution that will be required to meet that cost.  Also being examined in this connection is the detailed manner in which the contribution will be collected through the income tax collection system.  I may say here that largely for technical reasons this may involve collection through the PAYE system of pay-related contributions from pay below £14 a week but if so there will be a consequential adjustment of the flat rate contribution for the classes of insured persons concerned.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of the ceiling of reckonable earnings yet to be determined another problem still not <Col N="2059" /> fully resolved is that of financing the scheme in the initial stages.  I will refer to this later.  It is not, therefore, possible at this stage to determine the rate of contribution.  Subject to what I have already said, the cost of the scheme has, however, been estimated to be of the order of £7 million to £8 million a year and the rate of contributions is expected to be about 3 per cent of reckonable earnings, of which 1½ per cent will be payable by the employer and 1½ per cent by the insured person.</P>
    <P>The contribution rate as finally determined will be prescribed by regulations as will also the ceiling of pay up to which contributions will be levied.</P>
    <P>The scheme will apply to all insured persons in respect of whom the ordinary full rates of flat rate employment contributions are payable under the existing social insurance system.  The scheme will thus cover most persons who are in industrial, commercial and services type employments.  These are estimated to number about 680,000 persons at present.  When the remuneration limit of £1,600 a year for compulsory social insurance is removed this number will be increased by an estimated further 30,000 persons.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed, at the moment, that persons whose insurance at present covers them for disability and unemployment benefit, but for whom special lower rates of flat rate employment contributions are payable, will come within the scope of the scheme at its commencement.  The main groups thus excluded will be male agricultural workers, numbering about 38,000 and female agricultural workers and domestic employees who are estimated to number about 15,000.</P>
    <P>The principal reason for the exclusion of these workers is that it will not be possible within the income tax collection system at present to collect pay-related contributions from them or to provide the information regarding their earnings which would enable pay-related benefit to be calculated.  There is provision, however, for power to bring into the scheme by regulations classes of employees other than those in respect of whom the ordinary rates <Col N="2060" /> of employment contributions are payable and the coverage of the scheme could be extended to those classes by regulations as soon as it proves feasible to do so.  Any decision in this matter, however, would revolve largely on how pay-related contributions could be collected from the particular class of employers being considered.  There is also power in the Bill to exclude any class of employees whom it may not be desired to have within the scope of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The scheme will be brought into operation by an order or orders which will be made by me and different dates may be fixed for the commencement of payment of the benefit and the commencement of collection of contributions. I am anxious that the scheme should be brought into operation as soon as possible but the Revenue Commissioners are unable to undertake the collection of the pay-related contributions from a date earlier than 6th April, 1974 which is the start of an income tax year.</P>
    <P>The commissioners will also be commencing from that date the collection of pay-related health contributions from various categories of persons including those insured under the Social Welfare Acts.  However, while the date of commencement of collection of pay-related social insurance contributions will be 6th April, 1974, it will, I hope, be possible to commence payment of pay-related benefit some months earlier and to this end I am consulting with the Minister for Finance with a view to determining the earliest date from which this can be done having regard to the usual budgetary considerations.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, provision in the Bill for advances of moneys from the Central Funds to the social insurance fund to enable this to be done.  Any such advances would be on a repayment basis but the amounts of any such advances which may be required, the terms of repayment and the effect of such repayment on the level of contributions have yet to be decided.</P>
    <P>As I said at the opening of my statement, the proposals in this Bill represent a significant advance in the development of our social insurance system.  Not only are they important <Col N="2061" /> in regard to the increased benefits they will provide and because they constitute a major advance towards bringing our social security code into line with the social codes of the EEC and other countries, but they will pave the way for further appropriate developments in our social security code in the wider field of long term benefits and pensions.</P>
    <P>It is my intention as soon as this new scheme has got off the ground and is operating smoothly to utilise the experience gained and the basic machinery established under it to introduce at the earliest feasible date complementary schemes of pay-related contributory old age, retirement, invalidity and widows pensions. I should sound a warning, however, that even with the best will in the world these proposed developments cannot be brought about overnight and any such changes must in the ultimate be considered in relation to general financial and economic circumstances and developments in other services.</P>
    <P>I hope that the explanations I have given here coupled with the information contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill will give Deputies a fuller understanding of the proposals in the Bill which are, of course, highly technical and specialised.  I know that some criticism has been made of the length of the Bill as if the length of any Bill <i>per se</i> was a matter of supreme importance, and of the time taken to produce the proposals since they were first adumbrated in the Third Programme for Economic and Social Development.</P>
    <P>The text of the Bill of itself is merely the tip of the iceberg and gives no idea of the amount of work which has gone into the consideration and development of the proposals in it or of the major financial and administrative problems to which solutions had to be found before the introduction of such a scheme could be contemplated in full confidence that it would be a practical and viable proposition.</P>
    <P>A great deal of what I may call the &ldquo;nitty gritty&rdquo; details of the scheme <Col N="2062" /> will appear in regulations to be drafted under the provisions of the Bill.  Development of the procedures for collection of contributions and also for the payment of the supplementary benefits has already entailed a great deal of work both in the office of the Revenue Commissioners and in my own Department.  At this stage much still remains to be done but Deputies can rest assured that the regulations, the provision of necessary additional accommodation and the recruitment and training of additional staff will all have been dealt with in good time to enable the scheme to be satisfactorily launched.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, with great pleasure that I recommend this Bill to Dáil Éireann for its early and favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>To take up where the Minister left off, I should like to see a speedy passage of this Bill through the House and an early implementation of its provisions.  I shall comment only briefly on it now because I hope to table some amendments.  I welcome the Bill on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. It is something we have been advocating for some time.  I accept part of the Minister's explanation of the delay in introducing the Bill.  I want to welcome it as far as it goes but I want to condemn it for what is not in it.  However, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to introduce pay-related benefits as part of our social insurance scheme.  This is desirable because the amount paid by the Department of Social Welfare to a person who is unemployed or ill should be related as closely as possible to his income when he was working.  The 40 per cent of the income over £14, added to the flat rate of unemployment and disability benefit and maternity allowances, will be a great help to people in receipt of these benefits.  As the Minister has said, it is a matter for employers and employees to make the contributions available so that it will be possible to have a pay-related income in the event of unemployment or illness.  The Exchequer is not paying one halfpenny towards providing those services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very difficult to discuss social <Col N="2063" /> welfare on the narrow lines of the Bill because all categories of social welfare benefit are closely related.  The Department of Social Welfare is closely related to other Departments: for example, to the Department of Local Government which is responsible for housing.  I would condemn the Government because they have not stood back and taken a long hard look at the problems in relation to social welfare, particularly the way in which other Departments affect the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;the Departments of Health, Education, Labour.  Our approach to improving social welfare benefits has been piecemeal.  It will be necessary, at some stage, to examine in detail the way in which we can improve the lot of people who are depending on social welfare benefits.  It is very necessary at this stage, even in the short term, that there should be improvements in the benefits paid to all social welfare recipients.  Fine Gael believe in the concept of community responsibility to ensure that our people are entitled, as a matter of right and not of charity, to an adequate standard of living and that this standard should not be depressed as a result of ill-health, unemployment or other misfortune that can happen a family in the normal course of events.</P>
    <P>For too long priority has not been given to reforms in our social welfare system.  The neglect is illustrated clearly by the fact that in recent years social welfare benefits have been increased each year at budget time and at other times during the year but, as I said in my speech on the Estimate, the benefits paid have been outstripped by the rapid increase in the cost of living.  This is the problem which we have not tackled.  The Government must not alone concern themselves with the increase in wealth and economic expansion, they must ensure that there is an equitable distribution of the wealth created and that the wealth will be redistributed for the benefit of the poorer sections.  There is, as everybody realises, and the position is getting gradually worse, an ever-widening gap in this country between the rich and the poor.  The rich are getting richer every day and the poor are getting <Col N="2064" /> poorer.  The present Government have for far too long concerned themselves with political problems and have paid no attention to the end result of the creation of greater wealth and of economic expansion.</P>
    <P>I claim that social and economic expansion should go hand in hand.  I know it is very difficult in a country such as ours with the high ratio of dependants to workers due to emigration, the large size of Irish families and the high rate of unemployment that exists at present.  This has the effect of requiring the application of more resources, of making a greater charge on the Exchequer to provide the benefits which are so badly needed. Because we have a problem of high unemployment and emigration, far more resources must be devoted to social purposes to provide any level of social benefit per recipient.  Another factor which has added to this problem is the abnormally high number of people in institutions.  I agree with Deputy Desmond that the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare should go hand in hand and should be under one Minister. Here we have an abnormally high number of old people in institutions who would be far happier in their own homes but we have never examined this in depth.  What we should be aiming at is to reduce, as far as possible, the number of recipients and increase the amounts payable to them.  There are in institutions people in receipt of social welfare benefits.  The rate is not adequate to keep them in their own homes.  Hence there is the cost to another Department of providing accommodation for those people.  The fact must be faced that our present social-welfare system is based on how little we can give them rather than on how much.  This system is not alone antiquated and inefficient but unjust.  It leaves far too much to voluntary organisations who are doing a considerable amount of work to help those people who have not an adequate income.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the statement made in relation to social welfare by the Council of Bishops set up to examine this problem.  It is about time <Col N="2065" /> they did it, and I want to quote and extract from the report on it in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Monday, 20th of this month.  It says:</P>
    <P>According to a dietitian, the minimum cost of providing an adequate diet for a family with four children priced in three Dublin supermarkets worked out at £10.41½ per week.</P>
    <P>Since we are not doing anything about this situation, we are condoning families being committed to this low income.  This is a problem that must be tackled but not in a piecemeal way. We in the Fine Gael Party welcome the Bill as introduced here.  However, the benefits should be extended to other social welfare recipients.  I have in mind widows with families, who are finding it very difficult to exist on the income they have.  If a breadwinner dies, his widow and young family are compelled to live on approximately half the income they had prior to the tragic loss of the breadwinner.  The widow's income should be related to that which her husband had.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that there is a phased contribution.  I am not too concerned about it from the employer's point of view but in the case of lowly paid workers with a number of deductions from their pay packed, a pay-related contribution will help in no small way.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to see in the Minister's speech&mdash;I was not able to follow it as fast as he was reading it&mdash; that he has in mind the removal of the £1,600 limit.  This is something the Minister should do as soon as possible. I should like to see the social insurance scheme extended to self-employed people, extended to a far wider range of people than it is benefiting at present, and particularly to farmers.  There is a problem in regard to the farming community in that they are very slow to hand over their right to a farm to the son.  It is a great social problem, and the reason for it is insecurity. If they are included in the social insurance scheme it will provide security for them when they reach the age of 65 and they will be more inclined to hand over the farm to the <Col N="2066" /> son so that the son can get married and carry on the business as before.</P>
    <P>In the explanatory memorandum which the Minister has circulated I find under one section that there will be a waiting period of two weeks, including the existing three waiting days, in the case of both incapacity and unemployment, before pay-related benefit becomes payable.  Do I take it that when somebody becomes unemployed or ill there will be a delay of two weeks and three days before benefit is payable?  The greatest complaint I find people who have made application for benefit have is the long delay before the decision is reached, particularly in regard to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>Where an application is made and where it is determined after some time that the applicant is entitled to benefit or in cases where the application has failed, generally he is not notified that he would be entitled to unemployment assistance.  There are complaints every day of the delay in reaching decisions. I notice from the Minister's speech that this is something with which he is dealing throught the Revenue Commissioners. I can envisage some delays here as well and that it would not be feasible at this stage to set up a special computerised system for determining who is entitled to benefit.  However, the Minister should consider in the future the provisions of some means of eliminating the delays.  Unlike other people who are better off, those in receipt of social welfare benefit find it difficult to get credit from the grocer or anyone else.  If the Minister could do something in that respect he would be doing a great service to those in receipt of benefit from his Department.</P>
    <P>Again I welcome what is in the Bill, and I intend to put down some amendments to it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this constructive piece of insurance legislation which reflects the proposals of the labour movement in the Republic and on the island as a whole.  It reflects our persistent demand for the introduction of a comprehensive pay-related system of social insurance.  I think it is instructive enough for this House to look back <Col N="2067" /> very briefly and remind itself that as long ago as October, 1949, the then inter-party Government published a White Paper on social security and then proposed that social insurance should be extended to cover every person over 16 years working for an employer.  Twenty-two years later this policy is being implemented slowly. This is instructive in the context of social change.  It shows the slowness with which our society reacts to the entirely legitimate demands of more enlightened politicians.  The late Mr. Willie Norton, when he was Minister for Social Welfare in 1949, was farseeing in his suggestions.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, with a number of substantial reservations.  I wish to point out emphatically that it looks as though we will get from the Minister a commencement date for the Bill.  It looks as though the commencement date will be not earlier than January or February, 1974.  The Minister will not dispute that.  It will be earlier than the commencement of the tax year of 1974. Lest the euphoria of the Fianna Fáil Party should carry them away at the time of the next Árd-Fheis, the insured workers of this country should be told now that the Bill will not be in operation officially until April, 1974, at the commencement of that tax year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that was the date of collection of contributions, but that the benefits would be come in before that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months earlier. Being aware of how the Department of Finance reacts, I am sure the Minister had to choose his words carefully when he stated that he hoped it would be possible to commence payment of benefits some months earlier.  I would estimate that they would be paid in January or February, 1974.  That would look all right in a May or October election.  It would solve the problem reasonably well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been waiting for this Bill for about three years.  The first hint of it came from the official Government attitude about three years ago. The Bill has now come.  I did not hold out much hope that it would be in <Col N="2068" /> operation in April, 1973.  I would not expect that the Revenue Commissioners would have been able to resolve the very difficult problems in connection with the introduction of the collection.  I suggested in a statement which I made on 10th November that we might have to wait until April, 1974, for the commencement of the operation of the Bill.  It is important to point out that there will be a considerable time-lag before the benefits are paid.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister and to his Department, because of the very cool reception which this Bill got, because of the confusion surrounding the publication of the explanatory memorandum and the Bill itself and, more particularly, the Minister's briefing of the newspapers, a great many questions were unanswered.  I am glad to note that the Minister has stirred himself in no uncertain manner and his Department have produced a comprehensive brief for the Deputies explaining the intricacies of the Bill.  This Bill, particularly on the actuarial side, is difficult to follow.</P>
    <P>I would have thought that the Minister might have told us the estimated numbers of beneficiaries in terms of trends over the past two or three years.  About 55,000 persons get disability benefit.  Also, about 3,000 persons get occupational injuries benefit. These people will benefit under the new Bill.  A figure should be readily available of the estimated number of persons who will be in receipt of unemployment benefit in 1974.  This figure may be 30,000 or 35,000 persons.  It would be interesting to know on what actuarial data the Department were working when estimating the cost of the benefits.  In 1974 there may be 55,000 or 60,000 people receiving disability benefit.  At that stage there could be 3,500 people in receipt of occupational injuries benefit, and 35,000 or 40,000 in receipt of unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>These are the totals on which the estimates are being made.  I would be interested to hear precise statements from the Minister about these matters. It is difficult to estimate the number of people who will be in receipt of <Col N="2069" /> maternity benefit in two or three years' time.  The Minister could, perhaps, tell us the total number of maternity benefit recipients at present.  These people will benefit from this Bill.  The Minister did not give the totals in his Second Reading contribution.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to elaborate on the thinking behind the two weeks' waiting period.  This would come as a rather gratuitous statement from the framers of the Bill to the many insured workers.  I appreciate the thinking behind the three days' waiting period but we are now to have in addition to that three days' waiting period for flat rate benefits the two weeks' period of stoppage.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Where, however, the incapacity for work or unemployment lasts for longer than a fortnight, the flat rate benefit will be supplemented by pay-related benefit ...</P>
    <P>The Minister stated subsequently that the real value of the pay-related benefit is to maintain the beneficiaries' standard of living.  I submit that very frequently one finds workers on short time in certain industries who may be out of work for two weeks.  They may be transferring from one employment to another over a period of two weeks. As we know, in a modern, sophisticated, expensive, industrial economy, if an insured worker is on flat rate employment benefit, or if he is sick for two weeks and is on flat rate disability benefit for these two weeks, this can have a fairly catastrophic effect on his standard of living in the sense that the standard of living of most people is affected week by week.  This is my experience even on £2,500 a year as a public representative.</P>
    <P>Most workers are unable to meet their normal rent, food and credit commitments in those two weeks even on flat rate benefit.  Therefore, I am wondering what is the thinking in the Department behind the two weeks, what one might call, penalty clause in the introduction of pay-related benefits. I did not bring with me the British handbook or the Northern Ireland handbook.  I would ask the Minister to compare the situation here <Col N="2070" /> with that in Northern Ireland.  Only recently I received the new British Social Security Bill.  Frankly I have not had time to go through it.  Notwithstanding the fact that this Bill is very closely modelled on the British approach, there should be some further public explanation of the two weeks' waiting period for payment of disability, unemployment and maternity supplementary pay-related benefits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The British waiting period is approximately the same.  They call it 12 days, referring to working days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never been entirely convinced about the three-day waiting period, although I accept that there has to be some time lag.  Many industrial workers may take umbrage at the idea of having to wait for 12 days before getting their pay-related benefits.  I hope the Minister will comment on this matter by way of justification.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to elaborate further on the thinking behind the lower limit of reckonable weekly earnings.  I understand that £14 a week has been chosen as the lower limit and that up to £14 a week flat rate benefit will be paid.  While a good deal of internal research has been done in the Department of Social Welfare&mdash;I have no doubt about that; in fact, the Department are better than people think&mdash;on the fixing of the lower limit of £14 a week, nevertheless I want to repeat the assertion I made when the Bill was first published, that this sounds to me rather discriminatory particularly against women workers.  I would ask the Minister to deal with that matter also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are still a large number of women workers in the State at the £14 a week earning point.  They pay relatively higher insurance contributions than men and it appears that they will suffer under this Bill.  I should like to know why the figure is £14 a week.  I am not convinced that the low point has been struck sufficiently low.  In Northern Ireland and Britain, under pay-related benefits, the supplement is one-third of average weekly earnings between a£9 and £30, providing total <Col N="2071" /> benefit does not exceed £85 of average weekly earnings.  This is only by way of oblique reference to another lower limit of £9.</P>
    <P>I suggest that there is a section of insured workers earnings up to £14 a week who will not benefit in any way from this Bill.  This is a large section of workers, mostly very young people in industry and women workers.  They have very low earnings.  They work in what might be called the more exploitable industries, such as the personal service industries.  Workers earning up to £14 a week will not benefit under this Bill.  Those who will benefit are workers with £14 a week plus, up to an as yet unknown ceiling.  Therefore, the Minister must exercise extreme care in the selection of the lower limit of £14. While I appreciate some of the reasons given, I do not think they are entirely convincing when one considers individual categories of workers on the lower ranges of weekly earnings.  We could benefit from the Minister's observations in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be more explicit about his definition of the relevant income tax year.  Since the Bill will not come into effective operation until early 1974, we should at least try in the Dáil to indicate the precise tax year.  Nowhere in the Bill itself is there an indication that the previous tax year is the actual year in mind.  Therefore, there is a lack of precision in the Bill.  While we appreciate that gross earnings will be taken into account for benefit purposes, and that the Minister may in some circumstances be obliged to calculate them not necessarily on the most recently completed tax year&mdash;this may happen at the end of a tax year&mdash;nevertheless a major criticism of this Bill is the multitude of areas in which definitions are not given, for example, a definition of reckonable weekly earnings or of the relevant income tax year.  I do not think it is good enough, particularly in respect of legislation which will not come into effect until the beginning of 1974, that we should be left in the dark on those issues.  This is a typical approach.  I do not blame the public servants but I do blame the <Col N="2072" /> politicians who cannot make up their minds.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech on Second Reading conveyed vastly more information in relation to the definition of reckonable earnings than what is in the Bill and that is a rather odd situation in which to find oneself when discussing a piece of legislation.  At no stage in the Bill is it set out as the Minister says at paragraph 9 of the explanatory memorandum, that the amount of pay-related benefits payable to a person will be based on this actual gross earnings from his employment which are reckonable for income tax purposes.  We well know that the Revenue Commissioners are quite capable of absolute expertise in the definition of gross earnings but these forms of definitions should have been written into the Bill.  I well remember the Minister being interviewed by Pat Sweeney the day the Bill was published. He was putting questions to the Minister as to persons out of works, persons involved in an industrial dispute whose earnings dropped and what was meant by earnings over a specified period and the Minister replied that perhaps it may be and may not be.  I do not blame the Minister because it was not in the drafting of the Bill but it should have been.  We should have that kind of information because that is what the industrial worker wants to know.  That is the basis of his analysis of the Bill and a definition of reckonable earnings should therefore be included. I ask the Minister to have a careful look at that in this further consideration of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should specifically include male agricultural workers within the scope of the Bill.  There are 38,000 of them specifically excluded and I think it is disgraceful that they are excluded, that agricultural workers, a group of lower income employees in the primary industry of the State who are insured should be excluded.  I would point out also, that another 15,000 workers, female agricultural workers and domestic employees, are excluded. This is a situation in which 53,000 insured workers, those perhaps most in need of pay-related benefits, particularly <Col N="2073" /> disability benefit and, indeed, unemployment benefit, with the lowest incomes, are excluded.  I do not accept for a moment that it is impossible in this computerised age to devise a parallel supplementary system of collection of the contributions from the earnings of such workers.</P>
    <P>The principal reason given by the Minister for the exclusion of these workers is that it is not possible, within the current income tax collection system, to collect contributions from them.  I accept that there are difficulties but in equity and in justice, these workers should be brought within the scope of the Bill.  Why not bring them in now and if in January or February of 1974, when the precise collection system will have become more publicly obvious, the whole thing became impossible the Minister could then exercise his power of regulation, if he so wishes and possibly exclude them.  I am not suggesting he should but it is better to include people first rather than exclude them first, hoping in the distant future in the days of the computer data banks, to bring them within the scope of the Bill.  In practice as we well know, such groups find themselves never brought within the scope of the Bill so that they will be out in the cold once again.  In fairness, the collective intelligence of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare should be exercised on that problem with a view to devising a system of bringing them within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I make a further and different point in relation to the cost of the scheme. The insured workers and the employers should be under no illusions about the cost of what is being proposed. It will cost £7 million to £8 million.  I suppose that at the current rate of inflation&mdash;and it is ironic that when Willi Brandt can find himself in the middle of a general election campaign with a 6 per cent rate of inflation, we are happy if it is below 8 per cent or as it is now running, 8 or 9 per cent&mdash;by the time it is in full operation in the middle of 1974 that figure may well be £10 million, or of that order.  The substantial cost of the scheme should be borne in <Col N="2074" /> mind and the basis of the contribution proposed by the Government should be very much borne in mind by industrial workers and employers.</P>
    <P>I suggest that we have had an unfortunate contribution from the Minister in terms of the cost.  The Minister has relied on what one would call the conventional wisdom of the Department, that the employer will pay 50 per cent and the insured person 50 per cent and, in this instance, the State proposes to pay nothing.  I suppose that since general taxation falls heaviest on those who pay income tax and PAYE and on insured workers, and the contribution of the State would have to be recouped from the insured workers, the reluctance of the State to contribute further is perhaps understandable since we would be passing it on for the most part to industrial workers.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that it is contrary to the established trend in the EEC and in the UK to expect merely a 1½ per cent contribution from both the employer and the insured person. In a scheme of this kind in the Common Market one finds the contribution ratio to be in the region of 2 per cent from an employer and 1 per cent from an insured worker.  The Minister should indicate to the House what the order of contribution would be.  However, we can come to that later.  I would point out to the Minister that there is no indication whatever in the Bill of the basis for contributions from employers and employees.  There is no indication in the Bill that the contributions towards the social insurance fund and the rates of payments from reckonable earnings will be on the basis of 1½ per cent from both the employers and the employee.  There is no indication that the contributions shall be on an equal basis.  That is another deficiency in the Bill as proposed.</P>
    <P>I am becoming increasingly disturbed in the House at the extent to which we receive legislation with the regulation concept, that is that the Minister may, by order, prepare regulations and so on.  This is political laziness.  It is nothing more than administrative convenience, and in the long run it will <Col N="2075" /> result in the Order Paper being composed of more orders and regulations than proposed legislation.  The Minister should point out to workers the precise amount that will be expected from them, and he should also let employers know what their contribution will be.</P>
    <P>I approve of the principle of collection of income tax under the PAYE system.  I accept that there is no other way of doing it.  I would ask the Minister whether there is any kind of social insurance policy programme within the Department at this stage.  Midway through the Second Reading of this Bill we are informed that we may expect legislation very shortly for the abolition of the £1,600 limit.  I am wondering where is the hen and where is the egg so far as the Department are concerned.  I am afraid that at this stage the hen is suffering from political paralysis, because I would have thought that the priority in social insurance would be the general extension of social insurance above the £1,600 limit and to carry that extension to retirement pensions, to old age contributory pensions, to mortality benefits, contributory widows' pensions, invalidity pensions and so on rather than to produce this kind of Bill which is confined to unemployment, disability and maternity benefit with a ceiling as yet unknown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The reasons for this have been given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not very convincing.  It is my belief that there has been a good deal of pressure on the Minister in recent months to produce some social welfare Bill and that this is the result.  An amazing feature of the Bill is that the upper ceiling limit is not known.  I appreciate that the Department have only now received further information in respect of pay levels in Ireland generally, but the non-insured worker in the state who is outside the £1,600 limit will be anxious to know why he is not covered by this Bill.  I do not wish to see a situation whereby at the end of 1973 the Minister will then produce the upper ceiling limit.  People are entitled to know now <Col N="2076" /> what is the ceiling.  If it transpires that in the middle of 1973 we need a new limit one could be brought in then, but let us fix something now on a definite basis because the present Bill in that regard is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>Without in any way sounding mealymouthed, I welcome the Bill as a serious step forward in the history of social insurance in this country.  Leaving aside the work done in the Department, for which I have the greatest regard, nevertheless, after a great deal of political gestation in the Department the Bill is still vague and rather inadequate in many aspects.  Of course, the Department can react only to political pressure and demands.</P>
      <P>We intend tabling several major amendments on Committee Stage.  We hope that these amendments will be accepted by the Minister because, together with amendments that may be tabled by Fine Gael, they will strengthen substantially the introduction of a universal system of social insurance in this country.  There is nothing in the Bill for anybody who is earning less than £14 per week.  The Bill contains nothing for a self-employed person or for the small farmer.  It is my hope that in time we shall have the principle of comprehensive insurance here.  I see major difficulties in respect of farmers and self-employed persons, particularly in regard to the collection of contributions, but these difficulties must be faced in the 1970s.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will accept the amendments in the spirit in which they will be offered.  When the Redundancy Payments Bill was going through we managed to wring several important amendments from the Minister&mdash; although I recall Deputy Haughey subsequently claiming credit for those amendments, but I do not recall him tabling them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with those other speakers who have congratulated the Minister on the Bill.  It signifies a new dimension in social welfare policy in this country.  Deputy Desmond implied a greater tribute to the Minister than I could pay him when he suggested that he had filched Labour Party policy.  I do not accept the truth of that assertion but it is a recognition of the good qualities of the Bill.  The Bill represents progress in the sphere of social welfare.  On Second Stage Deputies may suggest means of improving the Bill and when we do so the Minister will recognise that we are trying to be helpful.</P>
      <P>There is the case of the benefits payable to a man who has a wife and children, one or more of whom may be handicapped.  At present there is no special provision in our social welfare legislation for a handicapped child. Our social welfare code should recognise that special benefits should be given towards the upkeep and education of handicapped children of a family.  That would be in accordance with our philosophy.  The Fianna Fáil Party since its foundation has tried to develop a comprehensive social welfare system.  It is a matter of pride that we were the first in these islands to introduce the children's allowance. It would be a step forward if provision could be made in this Bill to help a man benefiting under the Bill who has one or more handicapped children.  It is a principle of social welfare that the neediest must get the greatest benefit.</P>
      <P>I realise that tremendous work has gone into the preparation of the Bill. It could be described as an actuarial exercise.  The availability of computers and a highly efficient civil service makes the task of assembling necessary information less difficult.  It should be possible to spotlight areas of greatest need so that they can receive the greatest benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that voluntary contributors to the social welfare fund are not covered by the Bill.  I realise the difficulty involved in their inclusion at <Col N="2078" /> this stage.  The Minister has said:</P>
    <P>As I have already announced on more than one occasion, I am anxious to have this remuneration limit&mdash;that is, the £1,600 a year&mdash; abolished and I hope to be in a position to introduce legislation for that purpose shortly.</P>
    <P>Many voluntary contributors earn more than £1,600 a year.  They pay fairly heavy contributions to the fund, for which they do not get a great return.  Most of them are voluntary contributors in order to provide a State pension for their widows.  I take heart from the reference the Minister made to his desire that the £1,600 a year limit should be removed.  I hope to see the day when there will be no limit for social insurances purposes.  In the meantime the resources of the State must be directed to the areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that girls in domestic employment are not covered by the Bill.  There is great demand for girls for domestic work.  The status of domestic work has changed.  Girls in domestic employment will be disappointed at not being included in this legislation.  They pay social welfare contributions.  Their case should be considered.  There are other categories also that should be included.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a magnificent effort in this legislation.  A few adjustments would improve the Bill.  It might be difficult to cover the self-employed in this Bill but certainly domestic servants should be included. I realise that if it had been a simple matter to include domestic servants, the Minister would have included them.  However, it is no harm to record our concern for them and for other classes who are not included.</P>
    <P>I understand that there is a certain number of unclaimed benefits.  Might I suggest that the money that is unclaimed could be used for the purpose of paying extra benefit in the case of the handicapped members of a family to whom I have referred?</P>
    <P>There have been calls from churchmen during the week for a minimum wage.  The difficulty about providing a minimum wage is that unscrupulous <Col N="2079" /> employers might make the minimum the maximum.  Such a development would not be welcomed by trade unions or anybody else.  There are certain basic standards which must be maintained.  The Government, in successive budgets, have raised the standard of social welfare for the aged, the blind and widows and orphans. This Bill represents further progress. The Bill may be criticised for alleged shortcomings but the economy must be developed so as to provide increased State funds for social welfare purposes.</P>
    <P>One can recall that greater benefits were not paid ten years ago, not because any Government did not want to pay them but simply because the money was not available.  It is a very good sign of the progress made since that the Minister can now bring in a pay-related benefit Bill.  There are still worrying cases on the social welfare scene and one can still point out the delay in payment in that Department but these are isolated instances.  The cover given by the Government in the social welfare code is increasing all the time.  I am confident that we shall have legislation, as the Minister said, later which will be a further step forward. We cannot be complacent and we must maintain our sense of proportion in regard to the financing of such schemes by the State.  It would be easy to increase the contributions payable by the insured and the employer but it would not be, perhaps, the most equitable way to do it.  The lower paid worker, for instance, pays the same amount for his social welfare stamp as the man who is just under the £1,600 mark.  Many years ago I suggested in the House that in order to give the lower paid worker an extra benefit we might try to reach the stage where he would not pay any contribution to the social welfare fund. Each year there is a plea to help lower paid workers but it is not easy to do so because higher paid workers fight to maintain the differential.  If the State were to waive the social welfare charge in the case of the lower paid worker he would save £1 a week or more and the higher paid workers <Col N="2080" /> could scarcely suggest the differential was being affected.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister again on this Bill and on the promise it contains of further improvements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the generally good reception this Bill has received.  None of the criticisms levelled against it relates to the general principle which has been accepted on all sides of the House.  That is encouraging.</P>
      <P>There was criticism of the delay in introducing the Bill and criticism that the coverage did not extend this time to agricultural workers and domestics. The two weeks' waiting period was criticised and the £14 floor limit and it was suggested that the scheme should be brought in earlier that April, 1974. It was also asked why the ceiling was not being given at this stage and whether the estimation would be based on real earnings and if the figure would take account of sickness, strikes and other factors which result in persons losing part of their earnings in the previous year.</P>
      <P>To deal with these points in a general way I shall take the last one first.  As is done in the United Kingdom generally, pay must be based on the real earnings, what the person actually earned and paid tax and contributions in respect of in the previous year.  It will not be notional earnings, what the person would have earned if he had been working all the year.  Periods of sickness or unemployment will not be considered as periods of earnings.  It will be actual, real earnings on which income tax and contributions have been paid that will count for pay-related benefits.  This is the system used in other countries where this type of scheme operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agricultural workers are not included at this stage because I could not get the Revenue Commissioners to agree to go that far.  I was glad to be able to get a collection system going for the limited scheme I am now producing in the knowledge that we shall gain experience.  This is most important: this is a complete breakthrough to a new system of collection and payments <Col N="2081" /> and experience will help us to get the scheme off the ground.  I was glad to achieve this after a long delay occassioned by the tremendous amount of research, assessing and examination involved.  The important point about the Bill is that it is breaking important new ground.  After we have gained experience in the transition period, the inclusion of other categories will not pose any great obstacle particularly in view of my desire to have our own computer system installed as soon as possible.  A number of considerations arise there: space is one of them and suitably trained personnel is another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister had the computer installed would he include agricultural workers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be possible then; by that time I hope we would be well ready for a more comprehensive application of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The £14 floor was brought in because pay-related benefits are reckoned at 40 per cent of the earnings and the flat rate benefits at present are approximately 40 per cent. We are sticking to that as a reasonable level but the Bill provides that this level may be adjusted at any time. I do not think anybody is unduly worried that the ceiling is not stated. This ceiling is fixed for us at the moment at £1,600 but if we remove that limit, as I propose, then we shall have to fix a new limit.  It would be rather speculative to mention a limit at this time.  All the other basic essentials are given in the Bill as to the percentage to be collected in contributions and the percentage to be paid so that the upper limit is not of particular importance of relevance at this stage.</P>
      <P>It was understandable that a waiting period of two weeks should be fixed. It would hardly be worthwhile having a shorter period.  The period of two weeks was considered a reasonably short period during which time the recipient would get the flat rate benefits, as he did previously, and would not be unduly inconvenienced as a result of being laid off for that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2082" /> One of the criticisms made was that we have been talking about this Bill for a long time.  This is so.  It is easy for people on the Opposition benches to make suggestions and proposals but when I talk about something I must produce legislation or adopt measures to carry out what I propose.  However, irrespective of what some people may say, we must have regard to our resources.</P>
    <P>One cannot fail to notice various organisations of lay and church men who make laudable proposals with regard to what should be done.  One cannot blame these people for making the suggestions but I should like to point out that it is the Government who have to provide the resources that will be required.  One day some section suggests that we should concentrate entirely on solving our housing problems to the exclusion of all other matters; another day another group suggests that we should devote all our resources to education.  We have to deal with all these matters and the question of priority must be taken into account.  One service cannot get exclusive attention; if housing, education, the provision of public amenities and health could be pushed into the background and all the money given to me I could produce the most grandiose social welfare scheme.  However, all the other items must get their share of the national resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond had published a nicely-written article in a Sunday paper recently but I should like to point out that he resorted to one of the oldest tricks, namely, he used the figures that would look best from the point of view of the Opposition.  He gave the percentage of expenditure on social welfare during a period of seven or eight years as a percentage of total budgetary expenditure.  He quoted this figure at approximately 17 per cent but he did not give the base from which it was derived.  Naturally 17 per cent of £30 million is much less than 17 per cent of £60 million.  In no case did the Deputy give the base and, while I do not question his right to present his case in this manner, I should like to point out that it is one of the oldest tricks in the trade.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> The GNP is regarded always as a fair means of assessment of the amount that is spent.  I am referring to this in the context of the suggestions that have been made regarding the type of social welfare scheme we should have now.  It is easy to outline the course which it is hoped would be followed with regard to social welfare but in the implementation of a comprehensive scheme regard must be had to the availability of resources and to the other items that must also receive attention.</P>
    <P>In considering the figures for the year 1959-60 to the present time in connection with the expenditure on social welfare as a percentage of GNP one finds interesting data.  In 1959-60, the GNP was £638 million and the percentage for social welfare was 5.1. In the current year, GNP is an estimated £2,138 million and the percentage for social welfare has risen to 7.2.  This illustrates the rapid progress that has been made in the scope and rate of social welfare.  The figures I have given are incontrovertible and I would recommend them to people who make suggestions regarding our social welfare scheme.  These people should study the figures I have given regarding the redistribution of the national wealth.</P>
    <P>People who make comparisons between our country and other States with regard to the redistribution of national wealth should keep in mind what these other countries consider as social welfare services.  We take figures relating to actual social welfare payments; we do not include education, other pensions that are paid in the public service, we do not include the cost of housing or sanitary services. We do not include many of the items that could be regarded as coming under the heading of social welfare. We include only the payments on the income support side and payments for retirement and for other contingencies affecting persons in employment and the welfare classes.</P>
    <P>By any comparison our record is excellent and will stand up to any test.  I should like that some tribute be paid to the progress we have made in the <Col N="2084" /> short period since the introduction of social welfare benefits into our annual budgetary considerations.  We have long since passed the stage when we regarded the rate of development in social welfare as being tied completely to the rate of economic expansion.</P>
    <P>The recent conference in The Hague which I attended had to do with social planning as part of the general programme which any country would adopt irrespective of the likely economic expansion or increase in national income over a period, with the realisation, of course, that the resources had to be there.  It is also recognised that good social planning is a contributory factor to economic development.</P>
    <P>We recognise that but we cannot lose sight of the fact that we must provide the means and that we cannot go too far in the direction of imposing taxation in order to redistribute the national wealth at any given time.  Deputy Desmond asked the plans the Minister for Social Welfare has in regard to social welfare development. I have given those plans on other occasions and I have said that I have deliberately refused to produce a White Paper because when it is produced people are likely to expect it to be implemented straightaway.  Of course, the rate at which progress can be made in these matters cannot be accurately predicted from time to time.  The only thing we can say is that here the rate at which we are picking up is becoming greater each year.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before us opens a new road to further development which I regard as being all-important.  It is the beginning of a comprehensive system of social insurance which I hope we will be able to apply to the entire community in the shortest possible time.  When we have reached that stage we will be able to get away from our old problem of means tests in the matter of qualification for assistance benefits.  Such means tests have had to be applied to non-contributory benefits paid to persons who do not contribute to such benefits.</P>
    <P>I have been asked by Deputy Desmond for certain figures.  I was <Col N="2085" /> asked for the numbers likely to benefit at any time.  The number in respect of disability benefits is 14,000, unemployment is 21,000, maternity allowance, 1,450 and occupational injuries, 450.  As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, occupational injury beneficiaries as such would not qualify for pay-related benefits.  We must remember that the two weeks' waiting period comes into effect here.  Persons who have less than £14 a week would not be in the pay-related system.</P>
    <P>I cannot resist having a crack at Deputy Desmond and his reference to the 1949 White Paper brought in by a coalition Government.  That did not include pay-related benefits.  As a matter of fact, it regarded flat rate benefits as sacrosanct.  When this Government came back to power in 1954, it was not bothered with any more. However, we will forget about the bad old days and think about the future.</P>

      <P>We are now making rapid progress.  We are glad to see this and to see growing awareness on the part of the public generally of our desire to have a fair proportion of the national wealth redistributed towards helping the weaker sections.  As long as there are people prepared to accept this as part of our social welfare pattern, who are prepared to accept it as a Christian as well as a moral obligation, we will have the necessary means to provide for those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to provide themselves with an adequate living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates which we pay at any given time will always be a matter for criticism. If I were on the other side I would be inclined to say that an increase at a certain time was not enough.  Of course, we will never reach the stage when somebody will say: &ldquo;You are giving too much&mdash;we would not give as much if we were in power.&rdquo; The easiest thing to do from the point of administration is to increase existing rates.  Of course, it is not easy from the financial point of view but, administratively it does not cause any great difficulties.  I do not know whether the <Col N="2086" /> House appreciates how difficult it was to prepare and to bring this Bill before the House.  If I were to wait until everything was rolled into this legislation we would be waiting a long time.  It is as simple as that.  I am particularly glad to have this Bill at this time because it marks the beginning of a new era in social welfare based on a more equitable system which will be in keeping with many of the schemes with which ours has been compared.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there will always be people too ready to challenge our figures and to compare them adversely with those elsewhere, with those in Britain and the Six Counties.  I would point out that here we do not collect contributions from everyone between the age of 16 and the time he retires. If we proceeded to do that, our social welfare structure would be considerably stronger because the fund from which we disbursed benefits would be considerably larger.  I have been asked what it would cost to bring our services up to the level of the British. In the matter of the existing schemes it would not take much.  However, many people misinterpreted my reply. Pay-related schemes and supplementary schemes in Britain were produced. I would say to those who try to denigrate the system we have that they should look at the rapid progress we have been making in the past ten years, to look at the amount we distribute as a percentage of gross national product. We must always have regard to the number of persons receiving benefits at any particular time.</P>
    <P>I am not making excuses for the Department.  I do not like undue delays in any scheme but I was glad that some speakers today recognised that the Department have a difficult job in that they are dealing with huge numbers and the percentage of our Vote which goes to administration compares favourably with any other Department of State.</P>
    <P>The Bill was referred to as being in line with British legislation.  That is true.  It is not merely in line with British legislation in this respect; it is pretty well in line with the legislation of other countries which have <Col N="2087" /> pay-related benefits.  I do not see anything wrong with having a look at what other people are doing, copying what is good and discarding what is not.  We have that benefit.  We have not always done that in social welfare. We had schemes here which they have not yet got in any other country.  As Deputy Moore said, I think, we were the first to produce a non-contributory widows' pension scheme and our children's allowance scheme was among the first, if not the first, produced anywhere.  We did not have to wait to copy from anybody with regard to many of our schemes.  That is not to say that I would not be prepared, at all times, to have a look at other countries' schemes, to see what is good in them, what would be applicable to our conditions here and what would be useful and suitable to our circumstances.</P>
    <P>The main objective of any Minister for Social Welfare is to do, as rapidly as he can, what is necessary to give a reasonable standard of living to those who lag behind through no fault of their own&mdash;due to illness, unemployment, old age, disability, widowhood, invalidity and so forth and to do the best he can at all times, having regard to the resources available to him, for these needy sections.  It is not coming out of the Minister's pocket; it is not coming out of the pocket of the Government; it is a matter of how much we decide to take from the people, from the national purse, how much of the national income we decide to redistribute at any particular time so that we may give better payments to these people.  I am delighted that we have unanimity in the House and outside it with regard to the rate at which we should progress in this respect.  I can assure the House that it will not be my fault if we do not move rapidly towards a scheme of which we can be proud in the overall payment of social welfare in the future.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go léifear an Bille anois don Tarna hUair.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Sé cuspóir an Bhille ná fo-alt (7) d'alt 16 den Acht um Bainistí Chontae, 1940 a athghairm ionas go mbeidh ceapacháin mar ráta&mdash;bhailitheóir chontae déanta sa tslí chéanna agus a déantar ceapacháin eile sa tseirbhís áitiúil, sé sin de thoradh comórtais iomaíochta.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to repeal sub-section (7) of section 16 of the County Management Act, 1940 so that the selection and appointment of county rate collectors will be made in the same way as other appointments in local authorities, on a merit or competitive basis.</P>
      <P>At present appointments in local authorities, with the exception of county rate collector, are generally made either by the county manager in accordance with regulated procedures and methods of selection or on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The reasons for the exception which was made in the case of county rate collectors are not clear but it has been argued that county rate collectors are normally past school leaving age when they are appointed and that the office of county rate collector does not require the qualities that are best assessed by competitive examination or interview.  It could also be said that the appointment of rate collectors is related to the council's control of financial and rating matters and that it is important that a local man be selected who will have a knowledge of and be sympathetic with local conditions and the financial circumstances of the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of county rate collectors has been a controversial issue down through the years.  The question was raised in an Adjournment debate in the Dáil on 18th April last when I said that when the House gets an opportunity to discuss legislation dealing with the general question of the powers and functions of members of local authorities, the <Col N="2089" /> matter would fall to be discussed in that context.  I had the matter further considered and in the light of views submitted by many people, including councillors, I came to the conclusion that it was time to change the system. The arguments against the system are well known&mdash;a system of appointment made by vote of elected members of local councils does not readily lend itself to the detailed procedures and controls which would ensure that selection is made on merit alone.  As things now stand, there is scope for canvassing and unreasonable pressures may be exerted on the elected members. The alleged abuses and malpractices which are reported in the newspapers from time to time reflect no credit on the system and I think that it is fair to say that the system has proved an embarrassment to councillors over the years.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the ill effects of the present system of appointment far outweigh any advantages which may be present.  The traditional arguments advanced in favour of the system are marginal and not really sustainable&mdash; this is proved conclusively by the fact that rate collector appointments in towns and cities are made in the normal way; they present no problem and the officers appointed are equally as efficient as their counterparts in the county councils.</P>
    <P>The enactment of the Bill will leave the way open to revise the regulations which govern the making of appointments so as to ensure that all rate collector posts are filled on the basis of open competition following advertisement in the public press&mdash;with the exception of such posts as may be filled by the promotion of serving staff.  I hope to have the regulations in operation as soon as the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>The view has been expressed that, in future, county rate collector appointments should be made through the agency of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  This is a possibility, but I have reservations about filling posts at this level through a central agency.  It is doubtful if the holding of competitions on a national basis would be warranted for posts at this level with all that a national competition <Col N="2090" /> involves&mdash;travelling to Dublin and so on.  The general approach to this question has been that senior posts should be filled through the Local Appointments Commissioners and that as you go down the scale to the less senior posts local competitions are the best and most suitable and expeditious.</P>
    <P>Although criticism of the present method of appointment of county rate collectors has continually been made over the years, the principal reason why this proposed change has not been made up to now is, in all likelihood, that it takes away a power from the elected members.  However, I feel that this is not the kind of power which the average county councillor is seeking when he offers himself to the electorate and I am quite satisfied that most councillors will be glad to be divested of this particular function relating to individual staffing appointments.</P>
    <P>It is, as I have said, my view that appointments of county rate collectors should be made strictly on the basis of merit and I feel that the time is now opportune to make the change and that it should be made as soon as possible.  It was for this reason that I had the matter covered in a separate Bill which I now commend to the House and ask that it be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann declines to give a Second Reading to the Bill on the grounds that the appointment of rate collector should be made a function of the Local Appointments Commission under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926 instead of making it merely an executive function under the County Managements Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Local Government in the opening paragraphs of his speech in English that appointments of rate collectors should be made on merit.  The Minister reaffirms that in the concluding paragraph <Col N="2091" /> of his speech where he says that rate collectors should be appointed strictly on the basis of merit and feels that the time is opportune to change the law in regard to the appointment so as to implement these sentiments.</P>
    <P>I entirely agree with those sentiments and it is for that reason I have put down this reasoned amendment to the Second Reading to invite the House to reject the Bill as at present drafted and to invite the Minister to redraft it so that these appointments will be made pursuant to the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.  I hope before I conclude to satisfy the House that there is no obstacle whatever in the way of handing over these appointments to the Local Appointments Commission and at the same time ensuring that a local man will be appointed, thus preserving local knowledge and that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the Bill goes through as it is and if the appointment is merely declared to be an executive function, what up to now has been a political appointment carried out in public and has been seen to be a political appointment will still be a political appointment in many cases&mdash;and I stress &ldquo;in many cases&rdquo;&mdash;but will not have the virtue of having been carried out before the public and the press.  It will be a political appointment made over the telephone by the Minister or some of the Minister's henchmen.  Those may be strong words but that is exactly how I feel about the Bill as drafted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i>&mdash;&mdash;that he intended to hand these appointments over to the Local Appointments Commission.  However, he had second thoughts or perhaps the party at various levels had second thoughts and he decided that he would not go the whole way but would make it an executive function and still keep his hand in the pie.  That is the reason why I have put down the amendment I have put down.</P>
      <P>The history of the appointment of rate collectors is more or less as outlined by the Minister.  When the County Management Act, 1940, was passed and when most appointments were handed over either to the Local Appointments Commission or to the county manager, the position of county rate collector was retained as a reserved function, and it has been operated on a political basis since then.  The Fianna Fáil Party have been in control of the majority of the county councils for most of that time, although at the last local elections they lost control of the great majority of the county councils.  However, as I say, these appointments were operated on a political basis, and the present Government party in particular operated their majority, when they had it, in a ruthless fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can bring the Minister back just 20 years to appointments which were <Col N="2093" /> made in County Cavan on the 9th February, 1952.  At that time the Fianna Fáil Party had 13 members out of the 25 members on Cavan County Council, and on the 9th February, 1952, they appointed seven rate collectors, each and every one of them being a Fianna Fáil nominee, most of them by a majority of 13 to 12, but a couple of them on the casting vote of the chairman when one Fianna Fáil member on a couple of occasions declined to vote for personal reasons.  When it came to the last rate collector on that occasion, the religious minority asked for one appointment out of the seven and a member of the Minister's party retorted: &ldquo;No surrender.  Get on with the appointment.&rdquo;  That was an unfortunate remark to make in a Border county.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to that, there was another appointment made and the man appointed on that occasion was the only applicant who failed to sit for the qualifying examination, simple though it was at the time.  That has been, by and large, the method of filling these rate collectorships over the years.  It is true, and I do not deny it, that the Fine Gael Party took its share of these appointments when it got them as long as the system prevailed, because otherwise it was a matter of handing over the entire rate collectors of this country to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>When the powers that be in 1940 reserved this function to the elected representatives of county councils, it made a very significant decision.  The Minister has said that these men were usually above school going age or had left school quite a few years when they were appointed and that there were other considerations why they should be appointed by the local authorities rather than by a competitive examination.  I think it was the type of appointment that perhaps should not have been left in the political arena, because as well as collecting rates and performing other functions, these rate collectors were responsible for the compiling of the electors' lists; in other words they were doing valuable political work for the party to whom they thought they <Col N="2094" /> owed allegiance.  These men were appointed&mdash;and let there be no doubt about it&mdash;as a monetary reward out of public funds for political services rendered or to be rendered in the future.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to justify this system, but if it had a redeeming feature it was that this was done in public. It was recognised as political patronage. The vote on the question of who would be appointed was carried out on a political basis.  There was no make-believe or sham about it.  There was no &ldquo;behind the door&rdquo; operation about it.  Everybody knew it was a political appointment That was the only redeeming feature it had, if that was a redeeming feature.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a public demand for a change in the system.  Other appointments are being made to public positions on a political basis.  Nowhere is that more rife than in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I know that the Minister is not in charge of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I wish to make a passing reference to these appointments. Everybody knows that all the sub-postmasters in the country are appointed on a political basis. Auxiliary postmen are appointed in the same manner.  These appointments are not made in public.  A board is set up to appoint auxiliary postmen.  It is well-known that the man who has obtained sixth, seventh or eighth place on the recommended list may get the appointment while the man who gets first, second, third or fourth may be passed over.  The same thing happens in regard to the appointment of sub-postmasters. Their appointments are every bit as political as those of rate collectors.  If the Minister feels indignant about that statement and contradicts it, his contradiction will not be taken too seriously by the people who know those who are appointed and how they were appointed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> It is a matter of Government and of general policy.  I will not go into this in detail.  There are certain grades in the Department of Social Welfare which are political appointments.  This also applies to the Department of Labour.  The Office of Public Works is reeking with political jobbery.  Appointments at important levels are made there on that basis.  I do not suggest that all county managers are subject to pressure.  In fairness to them, many of them are men who carry out their jobs well and are not subject to political pressure from the Department of Local Government.  I believe there are managers who were political appointees themselves and who answer the whip of the local Fianna Fáil boss in regard to the filling of local offices by filling them with every political Fianna Fáil hack that can be got.  The Minister may deny this, but the people in general have their own views about it.</P>
      <P>Boards have been set up in the past, and before the closing date for the receipt of applications the local people could say who would get the appointment. I have no faith in these boards.  I ask the Minister for Local Government to be sincere and to hand these appointments over to the Local Appointments Commission which has worked well since it was set up in 1926.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This Bill is all about shady history. The young man said: &ldquo;We had better <Col N="2097" /> get out the ballot papers&rdquo; but the county secretary said: &ldquo;What ballot papers?&rdquo;.  The county manager said that cottage tenants were to be appointed by sending out ballot papers to the local Fianna Fáil councillors and appointing their nominees.  I believe that appointments should be made on merit alone.  This is more important now than ever before.  The Government take credit for free post-primary education.  I give them credit for that. Having enabled young people to pursue post-primary education it is most frustrating for these young people to find that it is not what they know but who they know that gets them appointed.</P>
      <P>I believe that the youth of the country will not stand for this sort of political jobbery any longer.  That is why I invite the Minister to accept my suggestion, and give an undertaking to the House that on Committee Stage he will bring in an amendment to section 2 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, adding to the definition of &ldquo;offices&rdquo; to which that Act applies the office of county rate collector. That is a simple amendment which he could make, which would make it obligatory on the county council, when appointing a rate collector, to refer the appointment to the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal rather briefly with the authority of the Local Appointments Commission.  The Local Appointments Commission operate under the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926.  Under this Act it is necessary for local authorities and county councils to refer to that commission for appointment vacancies which occur in certain offices.  Those offices are defined in section 2 which reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  In this Act the expression &ldquo;office to which this Act applies&rdquo; means and includes&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the chief executive officer under every local authority, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  every office and every employment (not being an office or employment as a teacher) under a local authority the qualifications <Col N="2098" /> for which are wholly or in part professional or technical, and</P>
    <P>(c)  all such other offices and employments under a local authority as the Minister shall from time to time with the concurrence of the Commissioners declare to be offices to which this Act applies.</P>
    <P>(2)  Every question or dispute as to whether any particular office or employment is or is not an office to which this Act applies shall be decided by the Minister after consultation with the Commissioners and such decision shall be final and conclusive.</P>
    <P>That section has been amended from time to time since 1926 and, broadly, it now includes county managers, town clerks and, secretaries to joint bodies.  Many town clerks are in receipt of salaries which are much less than the salaries of rate collectors. Many town clerks are carrying out employment with much less responsibility than rate collectors, and handling much smaller sums of money than rate collectors.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b) of the section which I read out now covers professional officers such as engineers, architects, town planners, wholetime law agents, solicitors, quantity surveyors, valuers and chief executive officers.  Included in paragraph (c) are such officers as accountants, accounts clerks, city treasurers, city librarians, county librarians, borough librarians, urban librarians, librarians with library committees, assistant directors and librarians, public relations officers, personnel officers, curator, Dublin Municipal Gallery, deputy city librarians, accountants and, senior administrative officers.  I understand, too, that another very local office is filled by the Local Appointments Commission, that is, the office of county coroner and coroners who serve only portion of a county.  I can see no objection in referring these appointments to the Local Appointments Commission.  In fact, I see every virtue in it because it would remove these appointments once and for all from the political arena.</P>
    <P>The Minister said it was important <Col N="2099" /> that local men should be appointed. With that I agree.  I believe that for a rate collector local knowledge is a good thing to have.  There is no difficulty about handing the appointment over to the Local Appointments Commission and still preserving the requirement of local knowledge.  All the coroners are local men.  Section 7 of the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, enables the Local Appointments Commissioners to declare qualifications.  It reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Whenever a local authority or the Minister requests the Commissioners to recommend a person for appointment to an office to which this Act applies the Commissioners shall with the consent of the Minister prescribe the qualifications as to age, health, character, education, training, experience and (where in the opinion of the Commissioners the duties of the office so require) sex for such office.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Commissioners if they so think fit may at any time, with the consent of the Minister and after such consultation as may be possible or convenient with such associations or bodies as the Minister for Local Government and Public Health may consider to be representative of local authorities, prescribe generally the qualifications for all offices comprised in any particular description, class, or grade of offices to which this Act applies and may so prescribe generally any qualification which they could prescribe specially under sub-section (1) of this section in respect of any particular office comprised in such description, class or grade.</P>
    <P>(3)  Before recommending a person to a local authority for appointment to an office to which this Act applies the Commissioners shall satisfy themselves in such manner as they think proper that such person possesses the qualifications prescribed under this section for such office.</P>
    <P>In my opinion there is nothing in that section to preclude them from prescribing a local resident and, if <Col N="2100" /> there is, it is a very simple matter to amend the section to enable a local residence qualification to be prescribed.</P>
    <P>Obviously the Minister has decided to amend the legislation in regard to the appointment of rate collectors because there is a public demand for it. The public demand is that the appointments should be taken out of the political arena.  The Minister said that in the past there was wholesale canvassing of county councillors.  In the past it was necessary to canvass 25 county councillors on an average in most counties and sometimes to canvass far more.  If the method is changed now, endless local and national pressure will be brought to bear on county managers whether they yield to it or not.  They will be canvassed by TDs and by Ministers.  The wishes of Ministers will be conveyed to them over the telephone and they will be left in an impossible position.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister has made any case at all for refusing to accept my reasonable amendment, of which he must have had notice, to hand this appointment over to the Local Appointments Commission instead of merely declaring it an executive function.  If the Minister gives such an assurance, he will be doing a good job of work in this area.  He will be removing political influence, political jobbery, from this sphere of appointment.  If he does not, in my opinion he will be seen to be engaging in nothing more or less than a bit of political gimmickry, a bit of political play-acting, by pretending to remove this important appointment from the sphere of politics when everybody will believe that political influence will still prevail and still control the appointment.</P>
    <P>I think I have made the position quite clear.  I am with the Minister 100 per cent in his decision to amend the law and I agree with him that most county councillors will be glad to be rid of the job because they do not want it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I believe also that county managers will not welcome its being handed over to them and I think the ordinary and sensible solution of the matter is to treat it as a major post in a local authority, carrying in many cases more than £2,000 and hand over to the appointments commission the filling of the job.</P>
      <P>The Minister has spoken about travelling to Dublin.  There is no reason why everything should be done in Dublin.  There is no reason at all why the Local Appointments Commission should not travel down the country, sit in some regional centres, have the interviews conducted there and the applicants assessed there.  The argument made by the Minister against giving the appointment to the Local Appointments Commission simply does not hold water.  The Minister says:</P>
      <P>This is a possibility but I have reservations about filling posts at this level through a central agency; it is doubtful if the holding of competitions on a national basis would be warranted for posts at this level with all that a national competition involves&mdash;travelling to Dublin and so on.</P>
      <P>I say, prescribe a residence qualification; do not hold the interviews in Dublin; hold them in regional areas. The Minister says:</P>
      <P>The general approach to this question has been that senior posts should be filled through the Local Appointments Commissioners and that as you go down the scale to the less senior posts local competitions are the best and most suitable and expeditious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given a list of people already appointed by the Local Appointments Commissioners, including coroners, town clerks of small urban areas and so on, and I see no reason at all why the Minister should not accept the suggestion contained in my amendment of handing the appointment over to the Local Appointments Commissioners.  If he does so, he will be seen to be serious in what he says he has set out to do, to take politics out of this appointment, but if he does not, he will be seen to be <Col N="2102" /> merely pretending to take politics out of it but to keep the influence of the politicians in it.</P>

      <P>This is a very important piece of legislation, seeing that it proposes to take away one of the last effective functions of local authorities. The only effective role county councillors have been enabled to play in recent years was in respect of the appointment of rate collectors with which this Bill deals and the actual striking of the rate.  All other functions were the executive functions of the county manager and in this instance we are taking away this function which county councillors enjoyed over a long number of years.  Having regard to its importance, it is a matter of amazement to me to observe the Minister sitting alone in the Fianna Fáil benches. There is not one member of his party behind him on this occasion.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a reflection, and a very serious reflection, on all the rate collectors appointed under the old system.  I am aware of the system of appointment and I am well aware that in the main these people secured these plum offices by reason of the political role they played in a given political party.  A position such as this was regarded as one of the plums of local politics, but be that as it may, the vast majority of them have been honourable men who have carried out their work conscientiously and well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some who fell by the wayside but the vast <Col N="2103" /> majority were men of integrity, of honour and of honesty who performed a very fine public service.  They knew the local populace; they knew the time when he or she could meet the rate demand and they did not apply undue pressures.  They were loth to serve civil bills.  The method of office collection was tried in many counties, to my knowledge, and was not regarded as effective or efficient as the rate collector method.  I would hope that when it comes to amending legislation of this kind, we would not by implication reflect on the character and integrity of the existing appointed rate collectors.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Bill is a reflection on members of local authorities because it is clear that this amendment in relation to the appointment of rate collectors is coming about now because of the evidence which the Minister has of the unsavoury practices which have been going on, the incidence of canvassing, of unreasonable pressures and the alleged abuses and malpractices which have been reported from time to time.  Again, there is an element of truth in this and those of us who have served on local authorities cannot deny it.  These unsavoury practices have raised their ugly heads on occasions.  To say that all members of local authorities were so inclined would be a libel on these good men and women.  Let me say in defence of my colleagues who are members of local authorities that these men serve their people conscientiously and well.  They are men of character and integrity who would never resort to any sort of malpractice.  They are people who set their faces steadfastly against becoming involved in any malpractice in the appointment of rate collectors.  Therefore, let us ensure that the vast majority of dedicated public representatives are not besmirched in any way because of the misdemeanours of the few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister brought this Bill before the House now, especially since it is contemplated to have an entire restructuring of local government.  I do not know what was <Col N="2104" /> the urgency in this case.  In order to be fair to the members of local authorities who have done their duty honourably, the Minister might have had the courtesy to consult local authorities before deciding to take from them this last remaining executive function of theirs.  It was discourteous of the Minister to proceed to draft a Bill without having regard to the wishes of members of local authorities in this matter.  The Minister tells us that he consulted certain people, including councillors, in the matter.  I would have preferred him to have informed local authorities of his intentions.  Had he done so he would have had some very excellent suggestions to help him in resolving this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question of the office method of collection as against the method of collection by ratepayers. I know this system has been tried in many counties but that there were certain misgivings concerning it. The existing conditions of employment of rate collectors leave much to be desired. The Minister will appreciate that some of them have what they refer to as lucrative &ldquo;books&rdquo; whereas others have &ldquo;books&rdquo; that cannot be regarded as being lucrative.  The workload varies greatly as between one rate collector and another.  One collector may cover a very large area and, consequently, command a very high rate of remuneration, while a man covering a relatively small or poor area would be endeavouring to exist on a very low rate of remuneration. We would like to see something done towards equalising the workload and striving towards uniformity in respect of remuneration generally.  Also, when a vacancy occurs, existing ratepayers should be given first preference so far as the allotment of a good &ldquo;book&rdquo; is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are led to believe that the Minister's motives in this matter are most honourable and that the purpose of the exercise is to set aside what seem to be certain malpractices in the present system.  However, the present system has been in operation for many years under Fianna Fáil and it seems to me that the system was all right down through the years when Fianna Fáil commanded majorities in most of the county councils and these plum jobs fell invariably to Fianna Fáil nominees.  It is significant to note that that majority which Fianna Fáil maintained down through the years has been lost in many areas, that now they see the plums of office falling to other parties.  In other words, they have reached a stage where there is <Col N="2107" /> nothing further for them in this system and, rather than allow the rate collector positions to fall to other parties, they have introduced this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister would not dare to introduce this legislation if his party were in control of the majority of councils because it is clear to me that the Fianna Fáil public representatives would not allow the Minister to proceed along those lines. These were very coveted positions. The element of canvassing that went on is well known.  It did not matter a damn what canvassing took place, one knew in advance, by virtue of the majority that any party or combination of parties had on a county council, how the appointments would go.  The most ardent supporter of the party invariably got the recommendation. He went through the mock process of appointment.  He was eternally grateful to his party for having appointed him and acted as an agent for that party evermore.  This is how it has been in every area.</P>
    <P>Rate collectors occupied very important positions in public life.  They were in constant touch with the ordinary people&mdash;the poor, the rich, the farmer, the householder, the shopkeeper&mdash;in collecting rates.  They also had other duties to perform.  Invariably they were the people who drew up the census of population, the register of electors, and the like.  They were in constant touch with the people, in every sense of the word. They did untold good for the party and irreparable damage to their political opponents, especially at election time.</P>
    <P>These were lucrative posts in that they were part-time and invariably rate collectors had businesses on the side.  They were tremendously importants posts, politically speaking.  The rate collectors so appointed never forgot their allegiance to the political party that put them there and they worked enthusiastically and dedicatedly thereafter for the advancement of that party, by fair means and foul.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are not sorry to see the system ending because, being the minority party unfortunately, <Col N="2108" /> there were very few appointments of this kind which fell to our people.  The appointments went in the main to Fianna Fáil party men and in many instances to Fine Gael.  Very few went to Labour, thank God.  The abolition of the system in this instance does not worry us.  We want to see clean administration in public life and would support any legislation along those lines.</P>
    <P>In his rather short statement the Minister mentioned that he proposed to introduce the regulations soon.  The regulations in this matter are the most important aspect.  We should like to see these regulations or to hear about them as quickly as possible.  The Minister should give us the fullest possible information when he is replying to the debate as to what these regulations will be so that we in these benches can make up our minds as to how best to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick of Fine Gael has an amendment down indicating that the wisest and most effective means of selection of rate collectors would be via the Local Appointments Commission. Obviously, there are other ways.  There is the Minister's way of giving the right to the county manager to appoint a local selection board. There is merit in that suggestion also. We are anxious to see the regulations so that we may view the matter in proper perspective.</P>
    <P>As one who was chairman of a local authority, South Tipperary County Council, on a number of occasions and had the dubious pleasure of presiding over the appointment of rate collectors and of seeing the procedure adopted there and the little regard there was for qualifications or anything else, I know that almost anyone who proffered himself or herself, providing he or she had a sufficient number of councillors to back him or her, was accepted.  There were no standards laid down.  There was no proper yardstick applied in determining who would get the position.  Qualifications, character or anything else did not count.</P>

However, if we can be assured that when a vacancy arises and the matter is referred to the Local Appointments Commission the position would be confined to applicants from the local area, this would be all right.  We understand, however, that the Local Appointments Commission advertise on a national basis and applicants from the whole country could apply for a rate collectorship in Wexford, Tipperary, Kilkenny, or Waterford.</P>

      <P>Before the Parliamentary Secretary came in I had paid tribute to rate collectors, irrespective of party.  The Parliamentary Secretary should read my speech.  I paid tribute to them all as men of integrity. There were lapses here and there.  I could name the parties involved and the political parties involved, if I am put to it.  It is all right if it is to go to the Local Appointments Commission, but it is very important that the positions should be confined to local applicants because it is only local persons who would know local needs and would be in a position to deal with ratepayers in a humane fashion while collecting the maximum rate for the local authority.</P>
      <P>There is merit also in the suggestion by the Minister that it should be left to the county manager to establish a board.  To my personal knowledge these boards invariably are representative of people from outlying areas outside the county or the borough or the urban council.  I do not wish to cast any aspersions on the county managers.  I have operated under them.  They were most conscientious men in this matter and so far as they could they appointed&mdash;and were careful to do so&mdash;the most neutral board, drawn from very wide areas in some cases, so as to ensure impartiality. The system has worked well in respect of appointments to junior posts.  From the previous method of appointment I would regard the rate collector post as a rather junior one but a very onerous one now in the matter of the large amount of money for which he is responsible. Having heard the Minister on the regulations we shall make up our minds as to whether we shall support the Local Appointments Commission proposal or the local selection board proposal.</P>

      <P>Members of local authorities will not shed any tears about the implementation of this Bill and the change in the method of election of rate collectors.  This has been a source of embarrassment to us in the past and we very much want to have a fairer system of appointment.  We hope that by the time this Bill is finally passed we shall have a measure we can all be proud to stand over as public representatives.  My concern in my remarks was in regard to the fact that the Minister proceeded to draft the Bill without reference to the members of local authorities.  Since it was one of their last effective functions it did merit the courtesy of consultation and of ascertaining of views beforehand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2112" /> We support the principle that the change should take place.  We shall reserve our views as regards the means to be used whether it will be the Local Appointments Commission or the appointments board under county managers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EugeneTimmons" hpid="Mr. E. Timmons Mr. E. Timmons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome and support this measure.  As a city representative in the Dáil and a long-standing member of the local authority I can say that it is one of the anomalies of the local government system that in the city area a local representative could not appoint anyone to an office.  I think it is widely accepted and would be generally welcomed by the nation as a whole that this much needed local government reform has been decided on by the Government.  In my experience at least it was a by-product of the evolution of local government that elected public representatives bore the suspicion that they were open to undue influence from one section or another regarding the discharge of their public duties.</P>
      <P>Under the City and County Management Act&mdash;I am speaking for Dublin city&mdash;public representatives have no say in the appointment of any servant or official of the local authority.  The introduction of the City and County Management Act many years ago removed all hint of suspicion in regard to the city representatives that they could play a role in the appointment of officers or others to posts that became vacant.  It was an anomaly that has, in my opinion, existed too long that elected representatives in this city, say, could not appoint anybody while in adjoining areas, because it was a county entity, councillors could meet together and make appointments.  It must have been a very frustrating situation for long-standing members of local authorities to see such a situation persisting.  We have now come to the stage where the public generally recognise that service in a local authority demands a certain standard of education and intelligence and other qualifications and that people appointed to those posts naturally seek promotional opportunities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole system of county councils <Col N="2113" /> appointing people to positions as rate collectors denied an opportunity to long-serving officials, men who had given all their lives to discharging duties efficiently.  In my opinion it was not conducive to proper and dedicated service by officials that this system should obtain.  I welcome this reform on the ground that it widens the scope for promotion for officials of local authorities.  It will enable officials of local authorities to participate in examinations that may be set by the county manager or to attend for interviews.  In this city there has been confidence in the city manager. An interview board was set up to interview applicants for any vacant post of rate collector and there has never been any criticism expressed about this matter.  The men who have been appointed have carried out their onerous and sometimes distasteful work in a most efficient manner.  It encourages staff in a local authority to know that some day they will have an opportunity of gaining promotion to the post of rate collector.  I welcome this reform because it has ended an anomaly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little more in this Bill than the naked eye can identify readily.  The Bill is ill-conceived and has been presented in a most suspicious manner.  I am suspicious because I understand the Minister will introduce further legislation for the strengthening of local government in which additional powers will be vested in rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not know what these additional powers will be as yet, but here we have the Minister introducing this legislation and appearing with white gloves, if I might use an old court phrase.  He is appearing with white gloves, taking on the role of Simon Pure.  After a long period of Fianna Fáil government it appears they have woken up to the fact that there is something wrong in connection with the appointment of rate collectors. Why has the Minister introduced the Bill now?  If he was so concerned with the integrity of appointments, why did he not introduce this legislation <Col N="2114" /> after the last local government elections? Why did his predecessors not introduce this legislation 20 years ago?  It is reasonable to ask what has prompted the Minister to introduce the legislation at this stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to Government policy generally we know that jobs and appointments usually are a good barometer in gauging political strength throughout the country.  I would put one point to the Minister.  Last June there was greater co-operation in voting for the election of chairmen, vice-chairmen and mayors than there has been for a considerable time; the anti-Fianna Fáil vote on the various councils began to make itself felt. This fact, together with the possibility of further responsibilities for rate collectors, has made the Minister aware of the fact that if the present system is continued the majority of members of local authorities will appoint people who are opposed to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>This Bill is offensive to county councillors and is grossly offensive to rate collectors who have been appointed under the present system.  If there have been abuses&mdash;there have not been any in my county&mdash;the Minister has an obligation to give the House whatever evidence he may have submitted to him by certain parties he has failed to identify.  I am sure the Minister will agree that county councils are on the way out. The Minister is now carrying out Government policy in the establishment of bureaucratic control over local authorities. We are at a stage now when national legislation will be made outside this stage and local government as we have known it will be administered by people who are not the elected representatives of the people.</P>
    <P>Up to now county councils had little rights in relation to appointments but all that is left for them now is the appointment of a clerk to an old age pension sub-committee.  Is the Minister suggesting that every county councillor is a dishonest man?  Is he suggesting the councillor is living on corrupt proceeds, that he is extracting money from applicants for jobs? That is what this Bill conveys to me.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2115" /> There are men in public life, in local councils throughout the country, who have never tainted their hands.  They are to be found in all political parties. They are of the highest integrity, men whose votes cannot be bought, men who are above suspicion.</P>
    <P>Of course in every plot of carnations one will find a dandelion or two. It is the same in public life.  There will be one or two people who will not live up to the general standard of integrity.  However, the electors have their remedy.  They need not send such men to the council chamber or to the Dáil.  That is what democracy is about.</P>
    <P>We now find that the whole structure of local authorities is to be changed.  At present the only functions local authorities have is the right to appoint rate collectors, the right to appoint clerks to old age pension committees, and their functions under section 4 of the City and County Management Act.  All other functions are in the hands of the bureaucrats. I venture to forecast that in the promised reformation of local government local authorities will lose their present functions under section 4.  This is in full accord with what the Minister has said, based on a report by McKinsey and others.  He can act in the way his predecessor did in regard to Dublin where at the moment there is neither council nor mayor. Through this Bill the appointment of rate collectors is to be put in the hands of county managers.</P>
    <P>As a member of my local county council during the past 30 years, I do not know a single councillor who has not stood up solidly and splendidly to his responsibilities in regard to appointment of rate collectors. None of them has ever been known to have acted in any suspicious or corrupt manner in regard to his vote for rate collectors.  I myself have voted for numerous people, some successful and some unsuccessful, but in 30 years I do not know of any members of my council who was offered a penny piece for his vote.  All of them have fulfilled their obligations according to their <Col N="2116" /> consciences.  Of course I have known councillors to step out of party line in order to support a candidate in special circumstances.  I have seen councillors to support the widow of a rate collector in order that she might have the financial resources to bring up a family God had blessed her with. I have not known any dishonest rate collector appointed in my area but I have known a hell of a number of questionable appointments by the Local Appointments Commission and by county managers.  If it can be said that all councillors are not saints it can equally be said of county managers and the Local Appointments Commission.</P>
    <P>Why the haste with this Bill?  One would imagine that the Minister for Local Government would have consulted local authority interests, that he would have sat down with such bodies as the General Council of County Councils to have worked a system of appointing rate collectors. He could have arranged, for instance, for a statutory selection board of councillors in each area who would recommend a candidate to the county manager.  He could have arranged for the appointment of three suitable local authority members to consider and to recommend candidates to the county manager.</P>
    <P>I can relate a case which I referred to the then Minister for Local Government. It refers to a certain county secretary who would not allow anybody into his office who had anything to do with <i>The Irish Times</i> or <i>The Irish Independent</i>, but who could go in there waving <i>The Irish Press</i>.  That man had said: &ldquo;I will not be too long county secretary because I will be the next to get the job of county manager&rdquo;.  When I reported this to the then Minister he told me that could not be so, that there was no such vacancy.  Within three months, however, there were transfers and a vacancy was declared and that county secretary was appointed county manager.  In case there may be inquiries about this, may I say that that appointment had no connection with my constituency. The Minister for Local Government at that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I know we are dealing with the appointment of rate collectors, not county managers, but this Bill gives the county manager the right to appoint rate collectors and I was about to challenge the present method of appointment of county managers.  In this country there are county managers who are grateful for the graces bestowed upon them by Fianna Fáil and who return those graces a hundredfold in all the appointments they make, all of which must come from the ranks of Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for this Bill is the fact that Fianna Fáil are losing ground in local authorities and cannot capture the appointment of the rate collectors.  In my own county the Fine Gael Party have an overall majority. Since the last local elections Fianna Fáil are not getting the jobs and when Fianna Fáil are not getting the jobs they come into this House to present themselves with white gloves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and cry, and moan and appeal for integrity. When they have the majority, integrity is 100 per cent; when all the appointments are Fianna Fáil, it is all right; but when it comes to appointments by any other party there is corruptions, there is deceit, there is dishonesty, there is bribery.  If it is Fianna Fáil, it is in accordance with integrity and honesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill stinks.  This Bill is depriving honourable councillors of the right to discharge fairly and impartially the duties which have been assigned to them under the City and County Managers Act.  This Bill is declaring that all those who have been appointed rate collectors up to now have got their positions by suspicious methods and means and that the councillors who voted for them did so for suspicious reasons.  Can any sane Minister for Local Government come into this House and say that every county councillor in Ireland is unworthy and unfit to cast his vote for whoever he thinks will be the best and most highly <Col N="2118" /> qualified person to collect rates within the county?  This Bill says that the county councillors are irresponsible, that they are weak, that they fall into temptations, that they stretch out their hands and take the bribe.  That is what can be read from this Bill. Maybe the Minister knows from the Fianna Fáil councillors what goes on, but I can assure him that there are councillors not associated with Fianna Fáil who never took the bribe and who always voted fearlessly and courageously for whoever they thought was the best and most highly qualified person.  Maybe there have been disclosures to the Minister by his own party councillors.  Perhaps that is who he was referring to as having made suggestions and representations to him in relation to these appointments.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that canvassing goes on.  I was at a function in Salthill in the Minister's city last Sunday night.  The Minister himself was referred to as an energetic and able canvasser in Galway city and county when seeking votes for himself and for his party colleagues.  I want to ask the Minister what is wrong with canvassing.  Perhaps there are some public representatives who do not wish to be troubled by a call from a canvasser. A person canvassing for appointment presents himself.  By speaking with him one gets to know his standard of intelligence, by questioning him one gets to know his educational qualifications and by further questioning one gets to know his family background.  Unless there is some method, how is a public representative to know the type of person for whom he should cast his vote? There is nothing wrong with canvassing. In my lifetime I have been canvassed by numerous Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour supporters and by people who support no party.  I was always glad to see them and made up my own mind, recorded my vote and always stood up to the responsibilities entrusted to me as a local representative. That is why I feel that the canvassing of county councillors was not worse than the canvassing of the golf course to get the county manager's golfing comrades to whisper a word into his ear.  There have been <Col N="2119" /> more appointments made in the golf clubhouses of this country than ever have been made in the council chambers or courthouses.  There have been more appointments made in other places.</P>
    <P>If county managers are now to have the appointment of rate collectors, the canvassing will not be at the doors of the county councillors, the canvassing will be on a golf course or in a rugby pavilion or wherever the county manager may resort.  That is where appointments will be made because many of the Local Appointments Commission appointments are made in golf clubhouses and rugby pavilions. Surely if there is a system to be devised for the appointment of rate collectors there ought to be a general review of the method of appointment of other people in the local service as well.  I hope the Minister will make some reference to that.  I know it does not come under this legislation but I feel that there is nothing crying out to the wide heavens for vengeance so much as the Fianna Fáil method of appointment of district justices and others to the bench in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>But here, in relation to the appointment of a rate collector the right of expression of local opinion is to be taken from the councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that under this strengthening of local government, to use a ministerial phrase, in the future rate collectors will have a new name and additional duties will be assigned to them.  Why has the rate collector always been so important for Fianna Fáil?  He is an important individual in his area because in addition to collecting the rates he has other duties to perform.  He makes <Col N="2120" /> his recommendations in compiling the electors list for the register of electors, and my experience is that the Fianna Fáil rate collector loses no time in having removed from the list the name of anyone who leaves the area or who dies, but in many areas you will see on the electors' list the names of Fianna Fáil supporters who are either dead or have left the district.  Maybe that cuts both ways; I cannot say, because in my constituency there are not enough anti-Fianna Fáil rate collectors to enable one to know that.</P>
    <P>As well as being responsible for assisting in compiling the electoral list, the rate collector is also asked to report on the waiving of rates for certain poor people.  If he is a Fianna Fáil rate collector, he will immediately recommend that no rates should be collected from X, Y and Z because they are Fianna Fáil, but that they must be collected from A and B because they are not Fianna Fáil.  The rate collector is also asked, in many cases, to express an opinion on the suitability of a person to occupy a council house.</P>
    <P>All these appointments in recent times have been going from Fianna Fáil to Fine Gael and Labour.  In case Fine Gael or Labour might benefit politically from the efficiency of a rate collector appointed through the votes of their councillors, Fianna Fáil are now saying: &ldquo;We had better call a halt, because the electors' list will be in danger; the voters' list will be in danger; the waiving of the rates will be in danger; and the recommendations in respect of certain persons who purchase vested houses, for whom the manager makes an order on the recommendation of the rate collector, will all be in danger.  Therefore, the best thing we can do is to stop this method of appointment, and adopt our own method.  If we appoint the county manager and we are in power, in return for that the county manager will bestow upon us the benefit of appointing the rate collector who is favourably disposed politically.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is why I look upon this Bill with the gravest possible suspicion. The Minister may say it is only someone with a very warped mind who <Col N="2121" /> could pick that out from the Bill, but I am doing so after 30 years' experience of dealing with managers, viewing the Local Appointments Commission system of appointment and the present method of appointing rate collectors. Why did the Minister for Local Government not ask councillors for their views on this matter? Did he get any reports or expression of opinion from the McKinsey people on this, who were given £140,000 for making some little inquiries in relation to health boards?  Was any commission set up?  Were there any consultations or discussions before this Bill was drafted?</P>
    <P>This Bill has been drafted in haste for some purpose, and the purpose is that it has to be passed into law before the new legislation strengthening local government comes in.  As well as that, within the next year or 18 months a large number of rate collectors will be retiring, and they will be retiring in areas where Fianna Fáil have no majority.  Rather than give to councillors opposing Fianna Fáil the right to fill the vacancies, they are handing it over to the county manager, because if they whistle the tune, the county manager will respond with a favourable jig to the tune.</P>
    <P>I challenge the Minister for Local Government to tell us the number of rate collectors who will be retiring during the next 18 months.  Quite a number of them are retiring, and Fianna Fáil cannot fill their jobs.  They have a dog in the manger attitude: if we cannot fill them, nobody else will; the only other way we can do it is through the Local Appointments Commission. Have our own lads there to recommend our own lads.  That system is supposed to be all right according to some people.  That system has produced worse results in relation to appointments than the system whereby the councillor declares himself publicly in a courthouse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in a courthouse. I am glad the Deputy reminded me of that.  The public house appointments are those that are usually made by the others who have the right to <Col N="2122" /> make appointments.  I am not at all afraid of the expression of opinion in a public house.  That is where you are able to feel the pulse of the public. What I am afraid of is the appointment that is made in the golf clubhouse, and goodness knows I have seen enough of them made over the past 30 years, and I have seen them being failures.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister for Local Government how many rate collectors appointed by councils have ever been charged with embezzlement of public money?  I venture to say that the answer is practically none.  Members of local authorities regard themselves as having a high degree of responsibility to the public and, therefore, they have appointed what they believe to be the most suitable people for the appointment. I do not know everything about the regulations the Minister will make when this Bill is passed, but I do know that a system of appointment by the county manager will not produce the best type of person.  If the Minister for Local Government says that this system will do away with canvassing, it means you will only have to canvass one person under this Bill, but under the existing system, as Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan, says, you may have to canvass 20 or 25 people.  The weight of influence is increased.  It is easier to swing one person than to swing 25.  For that reason I cannot understand why the Minister for Local Government has not consulted local authorities and told them he was introducing a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The creation of the post of rate collector is a matter for the local authority concerned.  Local authorities should remember that it is still a function of the councils, even after this Bill becomes law, to create the post of rate collector.  The method by which rates must be collected and the decision as to whether there will be rate collectors at all will be matters for the councils to decide.  The country councils, seeing the suspicious manner in which this Bill comes into Parliament, must decide&mdash;the Minister will not trust councillors to appoint a <Col N="2123" /> proper person as rate collector&mdash;to discontinue the collection of rates by rate collectors and to have the rates paid in at the council offices in the same way as the Land Commission annuity must be paid into the Land Commission.  Ratepayers cannot be more numerous than ESB subscribers. Every ESB bill must be paid into an ESB office.  I will use influence with my council to ensure that when these appointments have been taken from us we will no longer collect rates. There would be a suggestion that we are no longer honest people, that the cloud of suspicion hangs over us all and that we fall for bribes and accept them.  The rates will be paid into the local office.  If we cannot make the appointment, we will do everything we can to hinder Fianna Fáil from making it no matter what means the Minister devises to capture the posts for the purpose of manipulating the electors' list in areas where Fianna Fáil have lost power, authority and respect.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a barometer telling us that Fianna Fáil are sinking in rural Ireland.  The most hopeful sign in the Bill is the fact that Fianna Fáil must be cracking up completely because the prospects of winning the next local elections must be zero or they would have left the appointment of rate collectors in the hands of local councils. The reason this Bill is brought in is that there are no more jobs in it for Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not think it worth while to sit down and write a short letter to the General Council of County Councils asking them to hold a special meeting to consider all aspects of the appointment of rate collectors and to make recommendations as to a method by which the expressed opinion of the elected representatives could have been considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made a number of suggestions in which the involvement of the local authority could still have an influence in the appointment of rate collectors <Col N="2124" /> by recommending three names to the county manager and letting him appoint one of the three.  At least that would involve the council with the manager and could be described as real local government.  Local government as we know it, as we knew it and as we are likely to know it from McKinsey and company, means that one can drop the word &ldquo;local&rdquo; from local government and describe the system as government by decree of bureaucrats from the Custom House, in other words, dictatorship.</P>
    <P>The Minister is wondering why there is not greater interest in local affairs and why local authorities are not displaying greater interest in their work.  Is it not correct to say that local authorities have practically no functions except to sit and talk?  Nothing practical can be done because they have no power.  It is a waste of time to have a county manager at the appointment of rate collectors or at other appointments listening to the views of councils, when he can turn around and do what he likes after they have finished talking or are tired of talking.</P>
    <P>The making of appointments by interview boards is, in my opinion, a political sham.  I have seen many of these boards at work.  I do not know whether other public representatives have gone to the same trouble as I but I have always found out in advance who was on these boards.  I never had any trouble doing so.  The appointment that is made openly and publicly cannot be questioned, but I dread the appointment behind closed doors.</P>
    <P>I dread the appointment made behind closed doors.  The appointment made behind closed doors has been responsible for depriving many a suitable qualified person of a good job to which he was entitled, either because of his political beliefs or because he was not a member of the same club or the same society with which the majority of the interview board were associated.  You cannot get at 25 men together no matter how you try, but it is not too difficult to get at one.  It is easier to get at four appointed by the one if you can get <Col N="2125" /> at the one to instruct the four.  Let nobody believe that that has not gone on.  It has gone on; it is going on; and it is being encouraged.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what is the position of the county manager when he has the power of appointment under this Bill to appoint a rate collector, if he gets a call from the Custom House from the Minister recommending Mr. X for the job.  The county manager will count ten before he turns down the Minister's recommendation.</P>

      <P>Take the case of my constituency.  What happens when the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes in to make a recommendation and says the Minister for Local Government sent him in to make it?  That will carry a certain amount of weight in the mind of anybody who has the sole power of appointment, more particularly when promotions and other appointments are involved, when the Custom House will become involved again with those who will have the additional powers. It is all very fine for the Minister to assure us that he has not interfered with any county manager, and that he will not interfere with any county manager in using his discretion to make these appointments.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I do not know the Minister sufficiently well but I recollect the former Deputy MacEntee as Minister for Local Government for a long time and numerous other Fianna Fáil Ministers.  As I have said, maybe this is the pure angel Minister with the white gloves.  I do not know. Maybe this is he.  Maybe we have seen him at last in the Custom House, an honest man.  I doubt it.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have a quorum now because I desire to make a plea to members of the Government party to express their views on the fact that one of the few remaining powers which members of <Col N="2129" /> local authorities have is disappearing from them under this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that he has had representations from certain persons or associations unknown.  He has not disclosed the source of his information nor has he put the information on the records of the House.  I have to put it to him that he should have consulted the General Council of County Councils to see if an alternative method could be worked out to taking the appointments completely from the elected representatives and vesting the authority as an additional vesting of authority in bureaucrats. For that reason I feel that an expression of opinion as to the method of appointment, the quality of the appointment and the high standard of efficiency of our rate collectors should be put on record.  I am convinced that all those people who have devoted the best years of their lives to the public service have rendered an excellent service to the country and to their respective counties.  By the introduction of this Bill, the Minister is officially declaring that they are unworthy to make an appointment, that they are dishonest in their methods and liable to fall into any temptation in connection with the exercise of their votes. That in my opinion is a serious slander on public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I never said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Bill conveys.  This Bill has been rushed in without consultation with county councils, without consultation with the General Council of County Councils, on evidence which the Minister has which he has not disclosed or told us anything about, except to state that certain representations were made to him.  Is there any harm in asking him by whom and on what grounds?  Has he evidence of dishonest appointments in relation to rate collectorships?  He may have and if he has, let him put it on the records of this House because I would like to know what people would be sufficiently influential to warrant the introduction of a Bill by making representations to the Minister.  Might <Col N="2130" /> I ask the Minister whether it was the Association of County Managers that may have made the recommendation to him?  Was it an association?  Can he disclose the identity, or must it remain a secret, of the people to whom he has referred who made representations without being invited to do so?</P>
      <P>Is it not only right and fair that the county councils should be asked to express an opinion because the vast majority of county councillors are honest men, doing a job free, gratis and for nothing, who never took a penny from anyone in their lives and would not do so.  This Bill is a reflection on their integrity and a reflection also on the integrity of the rate collectors already appointed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon it as such a reflection.  If the Minister now says that the method by which these rate collectors were appointed by the votes of councillors is wrong, that it was suspicious, all those rate collectors appointed under the old system are under the suspicion that they have got their jobs through irregular methods because the present system whereby the council make the appointment is now looked upon as an irregular method of appointment. Therefore all rate collectors to date have got their appointment by and through irregular methods and county councillors must now live under the shadow of having fallen for the bribe in connection with these appointments. As a member of a county council for 30 years, I was never offered a penny piece in my life by anybody seeking such a position, and that goes for the big bulk of county councillors in this country today. They are honest men, men of integrity, whom the Minister does not and will not trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He has his reasons for not trusting them and this is that under legislation which has already been conceived and is on the cobweb-surrounded shelves of the Custom House, additional duties are to be performed by rate collectors under the new local government legislation which we hope to have some time in the spring.  We will make <Col N="2131" /> secret service agents out of the rate collectors and the first move is the taking of the appointments of these people from the hands of local representatives and putting it into the hands of the bureaucrats again.  I object very strongly to the fact that local government now give us only section 4 of the County Management Act&mdash;that is all that remains&mdash;and the appointment of a clerk to an old age pensions committee.</P>

      <P>We do our job in local government and while that section is on the statute book, we will use it.  While we had the appointment of rate collectors, we used it and were never afraid to do so, and every appointment we made would stand the test of opinion inside and outside the courthouse.  That goes for the big bulk of appointments in this country and therefore I do not know why we have the haste and the anxiety and the waving of the flags of honesty over the Custom House so suddenly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I view this legislation with the greatest suspicion.  It is ill-conceived and evilly disposed in depriving local representatives of a democratic right which they have exercised as elected <Col N="2132" /> representatives and in a manner authorised by the electorate in accordance with the laws of this country.  Any-legislation which diminishes the right or the authority of the county councillor weakens local government.  Any legislation which weakens the authority of this House, as we have seen in the past week or ten days, weakens the strength and authority of this House in relation to those of us who want to see local government still functioning in some manner.  This Bill is going to be the means of lessening an interest in local government which I regard as most regrettable and wrong, but I want to put it on record that there are honest men in public life, men of sincerity and integrity, and I am sorry that this Bill casts such a very great suspicion on their conduct as public representatives. After their years, they deserve better and they deserve more, and if the Minister will not say it, let me express a word of thanks to the public representatives of this country who have done a first-class job, free, gratis and for nothing, when on numerous occasions there was not a single voice to express even a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; for their endeavours on behalf of the public.</P>

      <P>As one who has raised this matter repeatedly in the House I congratulate the Minister on introducing this essential Bill.  It is 17 years since this House had an opportunity of pronouncing on this issue. On that occasion in 1955 the Dáil decided by 77 votes to 18 not to amend the City and County Management (Amendment) Bill, 1954.  On that occasion, too, the House deemed itself to be satisfied with the then system of appointment of rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister used a tongue-in-cheek attitude when introducing the Bill.  His choice of language was unique.  He spoke of unreasonable pressures being exerted and he referred to alleged abuses.  He used the term &ldquo;mal-practices&rdquo; and said that the system has proved to be an embarrassment.  He spoke also of the ill effects of the system and of criticisms of it.  The Minister might have been more frank because it is the function of politicians <Col N="2133" /> to spell out clearly what these words and phrases mean.  If by &ldquo;undue pressures&rdquo; it is meant there has been bribery in the appointment of rate collectors, the Minister would be nearer the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the Minister would have been nearer the truth had he said so.  If the Minister, instead of using the phrase &ldquo;alleged abuses&rdquo;, had said he was aware of there being party political patronage whereby those who were &ldquo;well got&rdquo; in their parties were given those jobs, he would have been nearer the truth. If, instead of using the term &ldquo;embarrassment&rdquo;, the Minister had said that the system was a public scandal, he would have been nearer the truth, just as he would have been if he had said that democracy in this country had suffered considerably because of the abuses under the system.  He might have mentioned, too, the ill effects of the system on the democratic structure of the country.</P>
      <P>I am well aware&mdash;my heart bleeds for Deputy Flanagan in this regard&mdash; that the majority of appointments in the urban areas are unquestionably above board.  For example, in the Dublin area rate collectors are appointed by a committee of selection, by an impartial interview board comprising representatives of the legal, valuation and personnel departments of Dublin Corporation.  Candidates undergo an elaborate system of interview, and internal competition, and basic educational standards apply. Therefore, there is no problem in this respect in the urban areas.  In rural areas, too, many of these appointments are above board, but we would be utterly hypocritical here if we were not to admit that on occasion in county council areas there has been rank corruption, bribery and party political pressure in so far as these appointments are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be honest about this.  No political party in Dáil Éireann, whether in Government or in Opposition, can claim any exemption from <Col N="2134" /> those charges.  I have seen it happen in my party.  I have known allegations of corruption, of bribery, of the passing of money and the people being favoured specially, even in my own party.  To my shame I must admit that.  I have known these things to happen in Fine Gael and in Fianna Fáil.  One does not require the privilege of the House to make that assertion. I have seen it happen in particular in relation to so-called Independents who are in a very special position whereby, if they hold the balance of power, they may get a year's salary for the rate collectorship instead of the couple of hundred pounds which a county councillor might be wont to demand for his vote.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the appointments and I do not require disappointed candidates to come to me and make that allegation.  Therefore, I regret to have to say that some of the wailing and the crocodile tears we have witnessed here tonight regarding the divesting of certain local <Col N="2135" /> councillors of their functions may be for the loss of power, prestige, political patronage and, in some instances, the loss of earnings.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill.  The exercise is a healthy and a valuable one.  To put the matter in its proper perspective, I believe that the overwhelming majority of county councils will welcome the Bill.  The local government union have pointed out at successive annual conferences the need for a substantial change in the system.  I do not know whether we will have a local system set up by a county manager. The Minister has been remiss in not having spelled out the kind of regulations he has in mind.  I would like him to tell us how are the interview boards to be set up and how the appointments are to be made, the basic educational qualifications required, the promotional outlets arising and so on.  All these are issues on which the Minister has been silent. If the Minister were to elaborate on the regulations to be made, the earlier reservations we had regarding the function of the Local Appointments Commission would be mitigated substantially.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have been more frank with the House in spelling out what is meant precisely by the phrases to which I have referred already.  Deputy Andrews reminded me that this is not merely a question of party political tactics.  For example, Deputy Niall Andrews, who is a member of Dublin County Council, has called for the introduction of a new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, Deputies on all sides, particularly those who are members of county councils, will welcome this Bill.  Its enactment will result in the rate collectors having a cloud lifted from them, a stigma they have had to endure because of the scandalous system of appointment.  Of course, the overwhelming majority of rate collectors were selected in a manner that was entirely honourable, <Col N="2136" /> but in the case of from 5 per cent to 10 per cent of those appointed there was corruption of the worst kind, but that corruption will cease as a result of the passing of this Bill.  When I hear of one prominent Fianna Fáil Deputy in Galway County Council protesting faintly about the loss of power I know that the Minister is doing a good day's work and that the introduction of the change is long overdue.  The passing of the Bill will render democracy more effective in this country.</P>

      <P>It is most regrettable that Deputy Desmond, who has never served an hour on a local authority, should see fit to make such serious charges against public men who, I would say, in 99 per cent of cases have given dedicated service to the people they represent.  I have been a member of a local authority in County Dublin for a number of years and I have never known of bribery and I have never known of attempted bribery during those years.</P>

      <P>The Minister concluded his speech by saying:</P>
      <P>It is, as I have said, my view that appointments of county rate collectors should be made strictly on the basis of merit and I feel that the time is now opportune to make the change and that it should be made as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>What is merit in the matter of the appointment of a rate collector?  It is one of the most difficult appointments one could make.  From the salary point of view, there are many people who have degrees and who are not able to get as good a job.  The question of whether a man would be a good rate collector or not cannot be decided on academic qualifications. Where does one start?  The main requirement in a rate collector is honesty.  You require a person who is reasonable and who knows the circumstances of the ratepayers in the particular area and who will be reasonable in dealing with them.  That is the reason for having rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There would appear to be great <Col N="2139" /> support for the suggestion that the county manager should make the appointment.  That suggestion is supported strongly by members of the Labour Party here.  History proves that system to be wrong, certainly in the case of the local authority of which I have been a member for a long time.  There was a time when, like Dublin Corporation at the moment, Dublin County Council was suspended for a period of three or four years.  During that period the commissioner appointed three rate colectors and the three of them went wrong.  There is no similar history in regard to the political appointments over the years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the name of the commissioner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The three that the commissioner appointed all went wrong.  The politicians are supposed to be a crowd of dishonest crooks and are being castigated as such, openly in this House.  Whatever people may say about them, the people they appointed, certainly in the county in which I have been a member of the local authority for a long time, were honest men and reasonable men, on the whole, and it did not matter which party got the appointment.</P>
      <P>I realise that these jobs should not be filled on a political basis but, then, as long as the system is as it is, that is the way it will be done.  I am at a loss to know what system will produce the best results which, in the last analysis, is what matters.  It is difficult to say that the man who has not academic ability should get no plum.</P>

This proposal has not been introduced by the Minister for Local Government and by the Fianna Fáil Party because they were dissatisfied with the system. It is wide open to suspicion.  The Fianna Fáil Party have a reputation for jobbery.  This is an effort to pretend that they are now prepared to purge themselves of all this, that they are turning over a new leaf, that there will be no jobbery in future, that they will not interfere in any appointments.

They know they have lost control of the local authorities and that <Col N="2141" /> we in Fine Gael have 84 extra members of local authorities since the last local elections, that we have control of most of the councils and that we have supported the change here this evening.  The reason why they have done it is that they are no longer able to make these appointments and they have agreed to come in here and, through this whitewashing effort, give the impression that Fianna Fáil are taking on a new look.  I am not convinced that Fianna Fáil are taking on a new look.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the suggestion is made that the function should be left to the county manager.  I shall not say that county managers are all dishonest men&mdash;certainly not&mdash;but I am not happy that if the matter is left in this way the best possible job will be done.  The setting up of the panels will be extremely important and there should be rules and regulations to ensure that there is an impartial assessment of applicants and that they should not get the jobs on academic qualifications because if they do, many honest, deserving men will be deprived of them.  I have known many men who had very limited academic qualifications who did first-class jobs as rate collectors and served the country well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonovan" hpid="Dr. O'Donovan Dr. O'Donovan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The inclination is to set up a competition on the basis of academic ability and it is very difficult, when making an appointment, not to have this in mind or to rule it out.  First, I think the appointment should be kept fairly local, if possible, within the service which itself requries the office, local enough for the people making the appointment to know above all that this is an honest <Col N="2142" /> candidate and has a family history of honesty, and also that he is a reasonable person and a good mixer who will have regard to difficulties, perhaps temporary, which people have from time to time, people who will pay up when they get over these difficulties.</P>
      <P>Various recommendations have been made.  There has been talk about office collection.  We tried that in County Dublin and it has not been successful.  Deputy Flanagan seems to think it would be successful and it may have been a success in other counties but our difficulty was that we had a very low percentage collection when it was done through the office.  It was never possible to find out the cost of having the job done by means of office collection because there were people engaged part-time on that collection and we could never get the true figure.  We never had a county manager who would say: &ldquo;This is the cheap and the right way to collect rates.&rdquo;  Actually, the county manager himself recommended us to get away from this system and appoint rate collectors because they gave a far more satisfactory collection.  I believe collecting by rate collectors is as cheap as any other system and is better and more reasonable when you appoint the right people.  I favour continuing appointing rate collectors and I believe nobody will lose on it: it is the right system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the recommendation made by our shadow Minister for Local Government, Deputy Fitzpatrick, is probably the right one; that the Local Appointments Commission should make the appointments: the reward for the job is in that bracket.  I hope they win look for the characteristics and qualities that should be in a rate collector, honesty, good mixing ability, reasonableness and dependability.  I agree that the matter should be divorced from politics but I should be the last to say that the vast majority of appointments made by politicians in the past were bad ones. They certainly did not prove to be bad appointments in County Dublin. They were made on a political basis but, as Deputy Flanagan says, they were made openly and we had to <Col N="2143" /> answer for them.  We carried out a system which was there and which was the only legal system.  We had the courage to operate it and accept responsibility.</P>
    <P>No doubt we had recent appointments which drew much criticism and a good deal of print but it is only fair to say that vested interests were involved because the man who went into all the print and all the castigation of the public representatives who carried out their responsibilities under the law as it exists, had a vested interest himself.  Everybody knows that he had a vested interest in having a rap at the people appointed on that occasion. That did not give him the best motive for criticising a system with which none of us was wholly satisfied. The public representatives who operated the system did so to the best of their ability in the circumstances. It was often an embarrassment to them but they stood up to that.  It was one of these distasteful jobs where many of one's friends had to be disappointed&mdash;you made one friend and 20 enemies, perhaps.  When you must operate that kind of system you should not be rapped for having to do your duty by public representatives in this House acting as they did today, public representatives who, in the main, have never in their lives done an hour's work for nothing in a local authority.  I shall always stand up for the people I see spending so many unselfish hours working for the people because they are interested in the people and many of them have no hope and some no ambition of ever going any further in public life but want to provide a good public service for people at that level.  We should all admire these people and we should not use the privilege of this House to make all sorts of extremely ugly allegations about them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to associate myself with Deputy Clinton in his condemnation of the remarks by Deputy Desmond earlier this evening who made allegations about members of county councils.  I did not hear him perfectly but I think at one stage he said that he knew somebody who had <Col N="2144" /> been offered a bribe of one year's salary as a rate collector to obtain a post.  As long as I know county councils, and I have been a member of a corporation for six years and have been on the fringe of politics and I know many members of a county council over a great many years and I cannot say, of all county councillors of all political parties, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and Independent, that I know one who would accept a bribe to vote for a rate collector.  It is true that members of political parties go to their supporters on the councils and ask them to vote for them.  As this does not apply to county borough councils I am not speaking from first-hand information but I imagine what Deputy Clinton says is true, that for every friend you make, you make 20 enemies. Deputy Desmond should not have made those accusations here or else he should have been specific and named the case of the person whom he knew who accepted such a bribe or was offered such a bribe.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he had the matter further considered and &ldquo;in the light of views submitted by many people, including councillors, I came to the conclusion that it was time to change the system.&rdquo;  What councils did the Minister consult with?

      <P>The Deputy may not know it, but the gospels were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The Minister stated in his speech: &ldquo;As things now stand there is scope for canvassing and unreasonable pressures may be exerted on the elected members&rdquo;.  Deputy Desmond took exception to two words in the sentence and he extended it to mean the offer of bribes.  Members of political parties canvass support among their own county councillors when they are looking for these positions and, by and large, no matter whether the appointees were Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour men, the people concerned proved honest and courageous.  The fact that the people had local knowledge and were well known to ratepayers was a point in their favour.  I should prefer to see rate collectors appointed by the Local Appointments <Col N="2147" /> Commission, as Deputy Fitzpatrick suggested.  If this is done, there should be some way of advising the board to ensure that knowledge of local affairs and of the local people would be one of the qualifications required for rate collectors.</P>
      <P>The Minister also stated the following:</P>
      <P>The question was raised in an Adjournment debate in the Dáil on 18th April last when I said that when the House gets an opportunity to discuss legislation dealing with the general question of the powers and functions of members of local authorities, the matter would fall to be discussed in that context.</P>
      <P>The Minister has not waited to do this.  He brought in this small Bill to deal with one aspect of local government. Twice in the last month Ministers have brought in small pieces of legislation where major legislation is needed; for instance, with regard to the Constitution, instead of having a general review they have introduced legislation to amend one Article. Last month the Minister for Labour brought in a small Bill dealing with minimum hours of notice at a time when the whole sphere of industrial relations needs review.  This piecemeal change in the introduction of legislation should not be condoned.  Instead of having bits and pieces brought before the House every month, there should be a general review of the system of local government at the earliest date and we should be given a chance to discuss the changes that will be necessary.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, níl sé ar intinn agam labhairt i bhfad ar an gceist seo.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis na Teachtaí eile agus cuireann sé ionadh orm an caoi ina bhfuil siad ag iarraidh cos a choimeád in áit amháin agus an dara cos a choimeád in áit eile.  De réir mar a thuigim an scéal, fáiltíonn siad go léir roimh an mBille.  Glacann siad go bhfuil sé in ann athrú a dhéanamh ach tá Fine Gael ag ligint orthu go mbeadh sé níos fearr dá ndéanfadh an Coimisiún é seo in ionad an bainisteora.  Sin a <Col N="2148" /> bhfuil idir iad féin agus an tAire sa mhéid atá a dhéanamh aige.</P>
      <P>Admhaíonn siad go léir cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé nach ndéanfaí an ceapúchán seo amháin ag éirí as cúrsaí oideachais agus tagaim leo sa mhéid sin.  Admhaíonn siad cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé gur fear cneasta a gheobhadh an post, gur fear a bheadh ann a mbeadh eolas na h-áite aige, pearsantacht mhaith aige agus fear a thuigfeadh deacrachtaí na ndaoine a bhfuil orthu rátaí a íoc. Má tá siad dáiríre faoi sin, níl a fhios agam cén caoi gur féidir a chruthú go ndéanfadh an Coimisiún &ldquo;job&rdquo; níos fearr ná mar a dhéanfadh an bainisteoir de.</P>
      <P>Má tá siad chomh sásta sin leis na ceapacháin a bheith ann go dtí seo cén fá nach dtéann siad díreach in aghaidh an Bhille agus é sin a rá? Níl sin á rá acu.</P>
      <P>B'fhéidir go raibh an Teachta Desmond beagáinín ró-dhian ar na comhairleoirí ach, mar sin féin, deireann gach éinne nach raibh gach rud in ord.  Bhí nócha cúig faoin gcéad thar a bheith sásta go raibh gach rud i gceart.  Dúirt an Teachta O.J. Flanagan an rud céanna ach ní raibh sé á rá go raibh an t-iomlán i gceart.  Ceapaim go mbeadh áthas ar chomhairleoirí gan an dualgas seo a beith orthu.  Bheadh, abair, 20 iomathóirí i gcoimhlint maidir le post amháin agus bheadh ar na comhairleoirí ceann amháin acu a roghnú. Ceapaim nach maith leo an dualgas sin a bheith orthu.</P>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak here but having listened to previous speakers I was at a loss to understand the case they pretended to make against the Bill.  All seemed to be agreed that the existing system is not perfect.  We must accept that no human system will ever be perfect. There seemed to be agreement that here and there, at least, in the matter of rate collectorships things were not as they should have been.  However, I thought Deputy Desmond was a little too severe on the system&mdash;not the system, perhaps, but the unfortunate councils called on to operate the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would disagree with the point <Col N="2149" /> made that independent councillors were known to talk in terms of getting a year's salary.  That is possibly going too far and narrowing the channel to the extent that unwarranted and incorrect suspicion might be cast on independent councillors.  What appealed to me least of all was the attitude of the Fine Gael speakers who seemed on the one hand to be welcoming the new measure but at the same time indicating that they wanted the Local Appointments Commission to make the appointments. Deputies Clinton and Barry made the point, with which I agree, that the appointment of a rate collector need not necessarily be on academic qualifications. Then they spoke of the desirability for such appointees, first of all, to be honest and that they must be familiar with the areas and the people, that they must be the type of persons who would be able to extract the appropriate moneys from the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>How, then, could they continue to suggest that the best way to operate the system was to hand the appointments over to the Local Appointments Commission?  I disagree with that suggestion because the county manager is much more likely to be able to recognise the qualifications necessary.  It has been said that the bulk of rate collectors appointed under the present system have carried out their duties well. I see no reason to disagree, but that does not mean that the suggested new system will not produce men who will be able to carry out their duties equally well if not better.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Flanagan in his nostalgia and concern for the system that would now seem to be disappearing. On the other hand, I think that sentimentality and memories of the past are not sufficient grounds for retaining that which we are now seeking to change for something better. Most politicians will be quite happy to see the old system disappearing if for no other reason than that in the case of such appointments they had to select one man from up to 20.  Having cast their votes for one man, they alienated 19 others and while they retained the respect, admiration and sometimes the support of the man appointed, as <Col N="2150" /> that man advanced and became involved in his duties his appreciation disappeared.  Whether that is so or not, the system is disappearing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the present method there are two ways of appointing rate collectors.  In urban and corporation areas the appointment has been by the county managers, after applicants have been interviewed by a board set up by him.  In county council areas the method of appointment is by the votes of councillors for the various applicants.  In county council areas the present method does not take into account to any great degree qualifications of education or general suitability.</P>
      <P>The system has been used for many years and it should be looked at closely before it is abandoned.  When I became aware that the Bill was to be taken this week I took the liberty of consulting some of the collectors in an association in my county in order to find out the views of those people on the system now coming to an end.  Their secretary wrote to me this morning and I should like to quote briefly from that letter:</P>
      <P>Most of them are of the opinion that an appointments commission would be the best for all concerned. There are two disadvantages in this method, however.  It would mean that the appointments would be open to the Twenty-six Counties and perhaps candidates with a better knowledge of Irish would get the job. Also, as you know, integrity, local knowledge and knowing how to deal with the public are very important. The old system may have had its faults but it could be pointed out that rate collectors have had a very good record as far as honesty, <i>et cetera</i>, is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair for all of us to add that this is quite true.  The record of rate collectors appointed under the present system is as good as any you will find. The real criticism of the system is that the appointments were made on a political basis.  There is no criticism of the performance of the rate collectors of the present or the past in the present proposals.  The criticism on all sides surely is that one had <Col N="2151" /> to be a member of a political party or certainly a very strong supporter of a political party before one had any chance of getting a job as a rate collector.  I think I should declare my own interest in this because if anybody looks at Thom's Directory he will find that I am listed as a rate collector.  I did this job for 12 years but on my election to this House I gave it up and another person has now been appointed.  I was appointed to an urban area by the method which the Minister is now introducing for the whole country.  I suppose I naturally should agree with the method since I was chosen by it but I do think that the method is as good as that suggested by Fine Gael, that appointments should be made by the Local Appointments Commission.  I hold the view for the reason that my friends in Wicklow have stated, that the knowledge of the local area will obviously be more in the minds of people who are on that board, who are generally selected from adjoining county areas to make the appointment. The qualities and qualifications which, it has been stated on all sides here, should be paramount will be given the best consideration by that method of appointment.  Everybody is agreed that known integrity should be the first prerequisite of anybody being appointed to this job; secondly, a knowledge of the local area and, thirdly, some experience of dealing with the public.  For this reason people who know the area are the best people to make the appointment.</P>
    <P>The Bill, by its very introduction, does, in a way, cast some doubts on the method of the past and in that way casts some doubts on the propriety of the councillors in making those appointments.  My colleague on these benches was very honest and forthright when he made the assertions that he did make.  If he is aware that these things have happened there is no harm in his coming into the House and saying so.  He should, perhaps, have said those things before now, elsewhere.  When he became aware that these things were going on he should have made the accusations at that time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> I have given what I believe, and what many others believe, should be the qualifications for the job.  I would have liked to have seen the Minister take the opportunity to make more sweeping changes in the legislation and perhaps take into account promotion in the job.  Rate collection areas within the same county vary.  Will this new system mean that a person who is on a very low scale of pay will be at a disadvantage in securing a transfer to some more lucrative area?  I hope the Minister when he makes his regulations will give people who have done the job well some chance of being promoted when jobs come up in their counties.</P>
    <P>The criticism that the Minister did not consult members of county councils is valid.  If county councillors are to lose one of the few functions left to them they should at least have been consulted about it.  The Minister in this respect would have found that the vast majority of county councillors would be only too willing to give him this Bill and to agree with him that the method should be changed.</P>
    <P>The main criticism of the present system is not about the people who have been appointed.  They have proved by their energy in the job that they are capable of doing it exceedingly well.  It is one of the few jobs where the work of the individual can be measured accurately.  The collection of a warrant is usually produced at the end of March or early April.  In most cases rate collectors will be seen to be 97, 98 or 99 per cent efficient in doing their job.  I do not think there is any other category of workers who can show accurately their efficiency in that manner every year.  Deputies might be a bit embarrassed if we had to produce accurate figures about our efficiency in that way.  The criticism is simply that these men were appointed on the basis of their political affiliations.  If that method is being departed from in this Bill we should all welcome it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be a member of a local authority as well as a Member of the Dáil and I resent <Col N="2153" /> very much the remarks made by the Minister in relation to members of local authorities.  I shall quote the part of his speech to which I object. He said:</P>
      <P>The arguments against the system are well known&mdash;a system of appointment made by vote of elected members of local councils does not readily lend itself to the detailed procedures and control which would ensure that selection is made on merit alone.  As things now stand there is scope for canvassing and unreasonable pressures may be exerted on the elected members.  The alleged abuses and malpractices which are reported in the newspapers from time to time reflect no credit on the system and I think it fair to say that the system has proved an embarrassment to councillors over the years.</P>
      <P>I resent that.  The whole attitude of the Minister for Local Government and the officials in the Custom House is to downgrade elected representatives. I resent that very much and I am a member of Cork County Council.  We did not appoint any rate collector in Cork since 1966 when on one day we appointed four.  It took one full day to make four appointments and the Minister will have access to the minutes of that meeting and he will find that the appointments were not made on a political basis even though there is an inference in the Minister's speech that members of local authorities are engaged in malpractices.  I think the Minister should withdraw that.</P>

      <P>I saw one and I am <Col N="2154" /> sure the Minister had that in mind, too, and the Minister would be well advised to examine the circumstances that brought about that outburst.  I want to ask the Minister a question. We decided, as a result of that election in 1966, to which I have referred, that in respect of every other vacancy that would occur in Cork County Council for a position of rate collector, we would hand over the collection of that area to the office.  If this Bill becomes law and in the event of a vacancy arising, will the Minister then compel the Cork County Manager to appoint a rate collector?  Contrary to other people's views and opinions, we find in Cork that the office collection is far more effective and efficient and a far cheaper system of collection.  However, would the Minister say if, as a result of that decision, we will then be forced to fill the vacancies for rate collectors?</P>
      <P>I agree with the amendment proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I do not agree with the managerial system.  As everybody knows perfectly well, the Minister has great influence over managers and, as somebody said to me quite recently, the Minister for Local Government is magnetic as far as managers are concerned and has them under his thumb.  If the manager has the appointment of rate collectors, even though the manager be a very honest man, if the Minister took up the phone and asked that a certain person be appointed, I have no doubt but that the manager would accede to his request.</P>

      <P>I do believe it and I am convinced that the vast majority of the people believe exactly the same thing.  That is why I object to the system proposed in this Bill.  A special technique is required for the collection of rates and it is very necessary also for a rate collector to know the area in which he is collecting, the type of people, their family circumstances <i>et cetera</i>.  In Cork people can pay rates by instalments and this system operates very effectively.  It is easier for some ratepayers to pay by instalments <Col N="2155" /> than to pay a lump sum.  If we in the Cork County Council are forced to appoint rate collectors again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. It is very necessary to have somebody who knows the area and the people. I do not like this reflection on and this downgrading of local authority members. I happen to be chairman of the county committee of agriculture, and a report appeared twice in different papers in regard to a proposal made by a member of the county committee to change the system of appointment of agricultural instructor. When the member did not pursue this proposal it was stated in the newspapers that some members of the county committee would get as much as £40 for their vote.  It is deplorable that such a reflection is made on people who serve the public.  They have to go before the public when an election comes to seek re-election, and if they do not do their job properly they will not be re-elected.  The Association of Agricultural Advisers contradicted this allegation flatly and said that in regard to none of them who canvassed members was it ever suggested that a vote should be paid for, and I want to repeat that I resent this implication in the Minister's speech.  It is something that reflects on the members of every local authority, and this is not justifiable in my opinion.</P>
      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  I am fearful of appointments that are made behind closed doors.  I do not want to see a vacancy arising and that, as very often is done by the local Fianna Fáil cumann, the Minister would be instructed or advised to influence the manager in appointing a man whose name would be recommended to him.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill, and before going on to say anything about the proposed change I should like to pay tribute to the decisions taken by various county councils under the old <Col N="2156" /> system.  I think it is a measure of the collective responsibility of the members that the old system, despite the inherent difficulties in it, was a success in that it achieved a very high percentage intake of rates in the counties in which it operated.  I think, too that the condemnation made here this evening by Deputy Desmond is one that casts a very serious reflection not only on the few members of local authorities, if there are such, who are and possibly were tempted under the old system, but also on the many others who conscientiously operated that system and can stand before anyone today and say they never accepted anything from anyone to make up their minds as to whom they should vote for.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at some of the propositions coming particularly from the Fine Gael benches this evening in regard to their proposed amendment. On the one hand, they advocate that the only person suitable for this type of job would be someone who had a good local knowledge; in some cases he could be promoted from the local authority staff <i>et cetera</i>.  They must be aware and should be aware that if this type of candidate were to be selected through the Local Appointments Commission, the Local Appointments Commission would have to be influenced.  They must also know that the Minister has not got this power and that we take exceptional pride in that the Local Appointments Commission is not subject to influence and cannot be given the directive that has been indicated in supporting the amendment proposed by Fine Gael here this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other course which is open in determining who should be appointed to these positions&mdash;and I agree with Fine Gael here&mdash;in order to ensure that the new rate collector is a man who has local knowledge, as he must have, and has the other attributes which are necessary in dealing with the public in his new responsibility, is to leave it to the county manager who would in turn set up an independent interview board as is done at present in the corporations and urban councils throughout the country. I think the system has operated <Col N="2157" /> very effectively in the urban councils and corporations that I am aware of and I would not be in the least afraid for the county councils under this Bill.  It is strange that while the Opposition parties agree with this proposal and suggest that it is time to make the change, when the change is proposed to be made, the only reason the Government could have for it is that they have lost control of some of the local authorities.  It is very hard to understand the logic behind that kind of attitude, that &ldquo;we are in favour of it but if you do it, you are doing it for the wrong reason&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I commend this measure to the House.  I think it is one which is necessary and which in the long run is the most meritorious way of deciding who should be rate collectors in any given area.  I say that in the full knowledge of the fact that decisions taken by local authorities in the past were, to my knowledge, very responsible decisions and proved in the areas where they operated to be effective.</P>

He seemed to be under the impression that they are to be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission.  They are not.  They are now to be appointed by a body which the county manager will set up, a commission of his own. It is a well known fact&mdash;and let us admit it&mdash;that 80 per cent of the county managers are Fianna Fáil. They would not be in the positions they are in if they were not.  You take the telephone or somebody in the Custom House takes the telephone and whispers to all these people: &ldquo;We want so and so appointed&rdquo;, and because these higher officials have got into the positions they are in today through their association with the Fianna Fáil Party, a Fianna Fáil rate collector will be appointed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to put other words in your mouth and we can see the difference between them and what is in the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>
      <P>At present appointments to these posts are reserved by law to the elected members of county councils and in practice the selection of candidates is effected by ballot of the councillors.  This invariably involved canvassing of the members by or on behalf of the candidate, thus placing the members in an invidious position.</P>
      <P>If what they are publishing is wrong, we will read what you have said today. They must be great prophets if they were able two months ago to put into your mouth what you said today on this subject.  The only difference is that you became a little wiser and you decided that you could not get your appointments if you went to the Local Appointments Commission, so you had to alter that portion of it.  Let us see the similarity between what was in the <i>Irish Independent</i> and what was said today:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arguments against the system are well known.  A system of appointment made by votes of the <Col N="2161" /> elected members of local councils does not readily lend itself to the detailed procedures and controls which would ensure that selection is made on merit alone.  As things now stand, there is scope for canvassing and unreasonable pressures may be exerted on the elected members. The alleged abuses and malpractices which are reported in newspapers from time to time reflect no credit on the system and I think it is fair to say that the system has proved an embarrassment to councillors over the years.</P>
    <P>Is that not exactly what is in the Minister's statement?  There is very little difference and I want to know why you by inference reflect, or members of the Government&mdash;and the vast majority of them started off in local councils&mdash;reflect on councillors and members of local authorities and try to downgrade them?  They are the unpaid servants of this country.  We should give them credit. They do their jobs conscientiously and efficiently. Are the Government prepared to go the whole way?  Will they ensure that there is no canvassing?  Is it wrong for a judge to canvass members of the Fianna Fáil Cabinet?  Is it all right for them to canvass but wrong for a person to canvass a local county councillor for a post as a rate collector? What is wrong?  Why do chief superintendents seeking appointments canvass, with their wives, in different hotels throughout the land?  Sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses can canvass members of the Cabinet, Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries and Deputies.  Why is it right for such people to canvass and wrong that any individual should canvass a member of any county council?  Will the Minister explain that?  If he is not acting the hypocrite why does he not ensure that in future the judges, district justices, sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses cease canvassing?</P>

      <P>I am a county councillor.  The majority of county councillors would be glad to get rid of this system. It has proved a headache.  One could make one friend and ten enemies.  I defy the Minister to mention the Westmeath County Council.  Our party and the Labour Party have controlled it between us for the last 35 years.  We have not appointed a rate collector for 15 or 20 years.  The rates are collected through the office at one-third of the cost of collecting them through rate collectors.  Cork County Council, on which the Fianna Fáil Party are in the minority, are doing the same.  In Kerry County Council, where Fianna Fáil are in the minority, the rates are collected through the office.</P>

      <P>I would prefer to see the rates collected through the office.  I do not believe that anyone would be put out of employment because of that.  There has been talk about corruption in so far as Fine Gael are concerned.  Our policy was printed in 1965 and part of it was concerned with the prevention of corruption. In that document it was stated that Fine Gael believe that all public services should be administered and all public moneys expended in a completely impartial way and that national and local government should be brought under such control as to exclude all possibility of corruption, favouritism or political influence. Without prejudice to the future adoption of more general measures towards this, Fine Gael proposed to end the system of political appointments to certain posts.  We were in favour of that policy then and we are still in favour of it.  We still believe in a just society and that the people entitled to positions in this State should get them.  Those who went before us set up the Local Appointments Commission. If the Minister was in earnest <Col N="2164" /> he would have appointments made by that commission.  This would have proved to the House that the Minister was sincere in his outlook and that he wanted to put an end to corruption and favouritism.  The Minister has gone away from his own words in the last two months.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to see rates collected through the office.  This is done in Westmeath at one-third of the cost of collection by rate collectors.  If our ESB bills can be paid on demand and if rent can be paid on demand I cannot see why this principle should not apply to the collection of rates.  I object to the words the Minister used. He stated that the ill-effects of the present system of appointments far outweighed any advantages which may be present.  If the Minister believes that he is entitled to tell us about the ill-effects.  Nobody knows more than Fianna Fáil about the abuse of this system.  Is it not true that last year in Donegal a man who had not even the necessary qualifications and was turned down by the county manager was appointed as a rate collector by Fianna Fáil?</P>

      <P>While he was a member of that local authority quite a number of rate collectors were appointed.  One was the son of the Chairman of Galway County Council. Was that not political patronage? Many other rate collectors were appointed and the Minister knows as well as I do that in my time on Galway County Council&mdash;I was elected in 1967&mdash;only one rate collector was appointed who was not a political appointee.  Every other one was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party. Fianna Fáil fought like dogs among themselves as to who they would elect, and they need not deny that.</P>

      <P>If you were to check the present Fianna Fáil members of the Galway County Council and the previous Fianna Fáil members you would find that brothers, or sons, or family connections of those individuals hold the positions of rate collector in County Galway at the moment.  The Minister is dead smart when he decides to change the system.  Why is he changing it?  Simply because the majority of the county councils are not now controlled by Fianna Fáil.  He wants to introduce a system under which they can grab all the rate collectorships. The Minister cannot say he is introducing this new system to get away from political jobbery when he, as Minister for Local Government, can be associated with a scandal such as we have in Oranmore at the moment.</P>

      <P>They have to look after the register and, as far as I can see, they figure it out in such a way as is most advantageous to the political party which appointed them to their jobs.  Members of this House who are familiar with the rate collectors in their own counties will know that hardly a day passes that we do not see some of them up here.  They are in to this Minister, that Minister, or the other Minister.  Their sole purpose&mdash;those appointed by Fianna Fáil&mdash;is to do active party work on behalf of that party.  I am quite sure they were told in no uncertain terms: &ldquo;If you get this <Col N="2168" /> job you will play your part for the party.&rdquo;  They have done this successfully over the years.  I cannot for one moment go along with a Minister such as the Minister we have here at the moment, as I said already, associated with a scandal similar to that in his own constituency at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

They are told: &ldquo;If you do not, you will never get a chance again.&rdquo;  The Minister will use some kind of sanctions.</P>

      <P>I would defend the right to keep rate collectors in their jobs.  They are rendering a good service and are very helpful in the matter of collecting rates.  In many cases they apply for a relief of rates in respect of people who may be in financial difficulties and this is usually done before politicians ever hear of such cases.

      <P>At this stage I appeal strongly to the Minister to accept the Fine Gael proposal whereby the appointment of rate collectors would be a matter for the Local Appointments Commission.  Perhaps the Minister did not intend it, but he has cast a reflection on local authorities and that reflection is the inference that the councillors would bend if there was unreasonable pressure.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that as matters stand now there is scope for canvassing and unreasonable pressures. What does that mean?  He says that unreasonable pressure may be exerted on elected members.  The implication I take from that is that if certain pressures were brought to bear on county councillors, for instance, financial inducement, the promise of a new car or, perhaps, of a greyhound pup, the integrity of the councillors would be shattered and that they might yield to the temptation.</P>

    <P>(a) The introduction from 1st October, 1970 of the payment of retirement pensions at Post Offices to insured persons who have reached the age of 65, who have retired from employment and who satisfy certain contribution conditions could affect the comparability of the figures to some extent.</P>
    <P>(b) Comparison of the 1971 figures for Unemployment Assistance applicants with those for the other years is affected by the operation of the Employment Period Order in 1971. The figure for Galway is the one mostly affected but the figures for the other offices may also be very slightly affected.</P>
