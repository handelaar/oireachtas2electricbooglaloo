    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M. Dockrell Mr. M. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few brief remarks on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The Minister referred to the 22,000 people on the waiting list for telephones. He does seem to have on his mind, not to say on his conscience, the fact that there are 22,000 people waiting for telephones.  Not only in industrial and business circles is this something which reflects little credit on us, and does handicap those businesses, but also in the domestic field it makes a great deal of difference to people's lives, especially people in isolated places and elderly people, to be without telephones.  The Minister almost made an apologia on account of the lack of money which he is able to get for capital expenditure.  This lack of capital for telephones is something that he himself should remedy.  He should make stronger representations to the Cabinet for more money.  It reflects neither any great credit on himself nor on the Cabinet that they have not given this very vital money for capital expenditure.  We all know that the demands on the Central Fund are great but, at the same time, the need for telecommunications is something which is a great deal more important than many other things.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I should like to say that in the main the Department function quite well.  One sometimes heard complaints of lack of attention or courtesy in post offices but I do not think that now exists to the extent that it used exist.  I have never found anything but politeness and courtesy either on the telephone or in post offices and that is where the people were not at all aware that they were dealing with a Member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the speech of Deputy R. Burke.  Unfortunately I did not hear a good deal of it but I heard him make a contribution which has rarely if ever been made in quite the same way in connection with broadcasting and television.  The strange inter-relationship between news and communications and the Government of the day&mdash;whoever they may happen to be&mdash;and morals and political opinions or opinions which sometimes border on the political, is a subject <Col N="1581" /> which has not been discussed as much as it ought to be either in this House or in this country.  Deputy Burke did a very good thing in bringing out some of the difficulties and problems which lie in this particular field.</P>
    <P>We have had some almost acrimonious debates here on the question of how far the authority were going against political opinion but they have been from a political point of view mainly and there is an enormous field which really is not political but has to do with our type of society and our treatment of public figures in it who come before the microphone and camera.  I do not think RTE are at all the chief offenders in this way.  Other broadcasting authorities do it to a greater extent than it is done here but one has seen important people with a national message to deliver being harassed by an interviewer who possibly held different ideological views.  It is very difficult to speak on that aspect in this House.  It is more a subject for lectures at university or other teaching levels.  The public have to be protected against individuals who are broadcasting, even newscasters, slanting these things to suit themselves.  This comes out mainly when there is an attack on the Government.  The Government react violently.  We must remember in this regard that the important thing here is that those broadcasters are attacking our institutions.</P>
    <P>This happens to a greater extent in other broadcasting authorities.  We get a welter of politics when a political figure is attacked or harassed by a broadcaster.  We forget that it is only opinions which are put forward, which may not necessarily be the absolute truth.  When individuals speak on some of those programmes they do harm to themselves as well as to the cause about which they have been asked to speak. This matter must always be closely looked on by the RTE Authority.  At the same time they must not stifle genuine discussion.</P>
    <P>We will probably always have a situation like this in the RTE Authority and it must be faced.  It is very important to understand that it is only opinions which are being put forward. This has a greater impact on the <Col N="1582" /> public when it is a television interview. Deputies here must help in this regard by trying to see that fair play is given to everybody who appears on a television programme.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer to the RTE Orchestra which belongs to both radio and television.  It is a very fine orchestra which has been built up over a number of years.  In the view of competent critics it is improving all the time.  The RTE Orchestra has an international reputation of a high order.  I would like to see it appear more on television.  We get it very often on the radio.  I am aware that it is not always glamorous to watch somebody playing an oboe or the cello as the sideways movement is not always very graceful.  I notice when the orchestra appears on television that the camera moves away very quickly from such instruments.  They prefer to show shots of the harp.  This is a very beautiful instrument and is lovely to watch.  It has to be handled gracefully.  The camera usually keeps away from the trombone and some of the wind instruments.  A good orchestra is worth listening to and we should see the RTE Orchestra appear on television as often as possible.  My wish is that we get more of it.  It pleases me greatly to know that the Radio Éireann concerts are supported so well in Dublin and I expect they are strongly supported in the country also. These concerts which are given at the Gaiety are very good and the number of young people who attend them is an indication that music is not the prerogative of a music élite or of any particular age group.  Music appeals to citizens of all ages.  From reading the papers one realises how much the orchestra is appreciated, too, when it visits centres such as Cork and Limerick.</P>
    <P>The help given towards the Wexford Festival is greatly appreciated not only by the people of Wexford but by music lovers from many other places. In these difficult times for our country, when certain sporting events and other meetings have been cancelled because of unnecessary fears, musicians, who one might regard as being rather timid people, flocked to <Col N="1583" /> Wexford as usual.  Music is carrying for Ireland one of the finest flags that can be carried and one of which we can be proud.  I hope that support for the orchestra will always be given.  We have heard grumbles from time to time concerning the cost of supporting it but it is a living thing and is as necessary to the cultural life of our country as is our National Gallery and museums and it does not cost a tremendous amount of money.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the question of piped television.  I noticed yesterday evening that the Minister refused to be drawn on the number of pylons that had been erected throughout the country and around Dublin.  I doubt whether he would answer me either if I were to ask him how many have been erected and how many of those erected are in use.  I have been told that they have been erected in strategic places so as to prevent commercial concerns choosing these sites. Therefore, there would appear to be a type of dog-in-the-manger attitude; but I hope that is not the case because if people anywhere on the east coast are prepared to erect good aerials, they can receive at least four stations. Therefore, piped television will not have the effect of preventing people viewing the programmes on other stations.  In any case it would not be in the national interest to do so.  As one cannot build a paper wall around this country, neither can one build a negative electronic wall around it nor is it in any way desirable that that should be done.</P>
    <P>Irish nationalism, and by that I mean true nationalism and not the flag-waving type of nationalism, is a plant of stronger growth than merely preventing people from watching the programmes of television stations other than our own.  Some of these programmes are viewed for their cultural content while some of the comedy programmes that we see on these other stations are excellent.</P>
    <P>Piped television would bring to many people a type of trouble free viewing which for people in certain areas is difficult to obtain at the moment.  That goes for RTE also.  I am aware of the <Col N="1584" /> existence of a pylon which is only a few hundred yards away from a place I know very well.  It stands in the grounds of a convent in Mount Merrion but there is nothing either going into or coming from it.  I do not know its exact height but it would be capable of permitting superb reception to many people in that area.  When I tried to raise this matter earlier I was told that the Minister had no function in the day to day administration of the authority.  That is a type of parliamentary cliché because one might ask if he has not any such function, who has?  I hope the Minister will look into this particular matter in which Deputy Burke is as interested as I am.  Regardless of what the RTE people who conducted a survey in the area may say, I know there is a demand in Mount Merrion for piped television.  I hope that piped television will be increased generally.  Apart from any other consideration, it would be the means of saving many roofs and would improve greatly the skyline.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which I cannot discuss here but which I will put in this way: lest anyone be foolish enough to try to interest the Minister in broadcasting the proceedings of places which do not come under this Vote&mdash;it might be guessed that I am referring to this Chamber&mdash;I can be counted out.  For almost 30 years I was a member of Dublin Corporation. Although that body has been the subject of many attacks it was a very fine body and was staffed by very fine officials.  I understand its difficulties and I know its weaknesses.  The real work done by councillors in that body was done, in my opinion, at the committees where they met in private, where matters were not judged by a political standard but on the merits of the case.  Everyone sitting around those tables in various committees wants to do the very best thing for the citizens; yet when it comes to the monthly meeting, which is in the glare of publicity, to listen to that body you would think they spent all their time wrangling with one another.  Therefore, I would be very much afraid that the idea of broadcasting from <Col N="1585" /> here or from other places would lead to all sorts of difficulties and might change the face of the assemblies involved, and I would not be in favour of that.</P>
    <P>I listen a good deal to RTE sound radio, and having regard to the difficulties of a limited purse, and so on, they do very well; of course, so does RTE television.  However, I should like certain types of reports to be at a fixed time.  I am not interested in fat stock sales but I know people who are.  You have to listen through a welter of Northern voices screaming down the line, and sometimes they are cut off.  I am referring specifically to after the half-past one news.  You never know at what time the stock exchange prices are going to be presented. In the evening after 6 o'clock frequently they do not appear at all. Whether it is the fault of the stock exchange or the fault of RTE, one is left with the feeling that it was forgotten.  If there is a regular feature and it does not appear on a particular day, there should be an explanation. Listeners are not a bunch of children.</P>
    <P>Sometimes also you do not get the time signal and somebody will say that it is two and a half minutes after the hour.  That is not good enough. A time signal is a time signal.  I suppose it is better than nothing to get an explanation or at least a statement that it is now two minutes after the hour, but these signals should be exactly on time.</P>
    <P>With those few remarks on the television, the orchestra and the Department generally, I should like to say I find the Post Office officials very helpful. Ringing up out of the blue&mdash;they do not know to whom they are speaking&mdash;I find I am always treated with courtesy.  Our television does a good job considering the limited finances at their disposal and also considering that this is a country of extreme nationalism beside a country of what you might call liberal nationalism; the differences lie in our history.  Broadcasting, whether it be sound or television is, as Deputy Burke said, a liberal thing.  It cannot be confined, and sometimes therefore, it is hard for our people <Col N="1586" /> connected with these media to operate unless they are given the freedom of thought which, of course, Irish people love.  They also love a good argument and a good fight.  One has only to think of how they enjoy the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; which at times nearly becomes a bear garden.  Sometimes I become enraged and would like to throw something at somebody who is saying something of which I do not approve.  However, that is democracy, and I think Gay Byrne does a very good job; he gets plenty of kicks but he comes up smiling.</P>
    <P>That is a unique show and yet it does not fall into the errors&mdash;perhaps that is the wrong word&mdash;of that superb show of some years ago but which was in many ways a terrible show, &ldquo;That Was the Week that Was&rdquo;.  I think it pulled the Government down.  Perhaps that does not matter, but it did knock many institutions in our Western way of life. Whether that was good or bad I do not know, but the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; provides a Hyde Park Corner outlet, a sort of safety value for some of our extreme views.</P>
    <P>Our attitudes to television and broadcasting are changing all the time.  It is growing, and it is taking over a part of our life, whether we like it or not. Some of the contributions on television are superb.  It can produce plays, psychological through looks rather than words, which can be deeply meaningful. Our small television and broadcasting system has to compete against other systems with almost unlimited money.  In the circumstances we can say that they do well.  We must give this problem every consideration.  We must encourage the personnel of RTE to go ahead with what they are doing while at the same time we must sometimes protect ourselves from them.  In the main they are good people who are very skilled.  The public and the people controlling the authority must move forward in understanding and learning about this new and wonderful medium now existing in our midst.  The Minister has a worthwhile job to do.  I wish him well and hope that he continues to keep up the standards which have prevailed in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from south-west Cork, my first obligation is to refer to the Minister's statement on RTE.  Since RTE were established we have had continuous complaints from my part of the country regarding reception there.  It is believed that reception is particularly bad in the Rosscarbery, Union Hall, Clonakilty and Beara Peninsula areas.  The Minister recently received a deputation from the Rosscarbery area.  I thank the Minister for the courteous manner in which he received the deputation and for the assurances which he gave.  I know that the Minister has problems and I must praise him for the courteous way in which he received the deputation and the manner in which he discussed their problems with them.</P>
      <P>For over 20 years I have accompanied deputations.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs could well advise some of the people who receive such deputations on the manner in which to receive them.  The Minister dealt with the deputation with great civility. This is very important.  There have been a number of Ministers in the Fianna Fáil Party over the years who were not endowed with the Minister's characteristic of civility.  I remember one Minister who almost went out the door when we had a deputation from the west-Cork area because he was not prepared to deal with people who were not of his own political affiliations. I would like to thank Deputy G. Collins again on behalf of the deputation. As a result of our visit to him, we hope that our claims and representations will result in an improvement in reception soon in the Rosscarbery, Clonakilty, Glengarriff and adjoining areas where the reception has not been of a reasonable standard. In view of the fact that we had discussion with the Minister recently it is not necessary for me to labour this point here.  After almost 11 years of representations&mdash;or agitations&mdash;we seem to be getting somewhere at last in so far as improving the quality of reception is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the south of Ireland we have only one channel.  We rely totally on RTE. We are somewhat envious, and perhaps jealous, of more fortunate <Col N="1588" /> viewers in the northern half of the country and along the eastern seaboard who enjoy four different channels. Deputy Dockrell mentioned that in some areas viewers receive programmes on five different channels. RTE have been in operation for 11 years.  We have been told it is costly, and that a great deal of negotiation is necessary, to get agreement with bodies such as the British televisions authorities so that we can get their programmes in this country.  I am only conversant with the problems on a broad basis.  There is a demand in the south of Ireland for additional channels.  This is justifiable.  The question should be dealt with more actively than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that one of the reasons why we are going so slowly is that the income to RTE from advertising might diminish.  Television is a national service.  It is not controlled by private enterprise.  That being so, the people should be prepared to contribute towards developments such as those I have mentioned. We would like an additional channel, or even two additional channels if possible, for the viewers in the southern half of the country.  Perhaps the Minister would refer to this point when replying.</P>
    <P>I have heard some adverse criticism of RTE since its inception.  That is only to be expected, but I have never criticised RTE because I felt that they had a difficult job to do.  Television was a new medium in Ireland and they needed time for development, but after 11 years they have got that time.  There is a fair concensus of opinion around the country that RTE have been found wanting.  I appreciate their difficulties concerning the selection and preparation of programmes.  These difficulties were highlighted by the previous speaker, Deputy Dockrell.  Tastes differ very much in the country.  Deputy Dockrell, in the course of his statement, advocated programmes which would possibly have limited approval in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Deputies like Deputy Dockrell are quite entitled to advocate an extension of particular programmes which they like and which in their view do not get sufficient time.  That is one of the <Col N="1589" /> reasons why I refrain from being critical. The programme that would suit Deputy Dockrell might not suit others. I mention the Deputy and refer to his statement merely to illustrate a point. Programmes get different ratings.  It would be difficult for the broadcasting authority to put on a programme that would suit all of the people.  I suggest that would be almost impossible. Nevertheless it is not unreasonable to suggest that they should be able to broadcast programmes that would come closer to the Irish taste&mdash;if I may use that term&mdash;than is the position at the moment.  I say that knowing the Irish tradition and having a good idea, as I should have, of what would satisfy the Irish taste.</P>
    <P>I have no idea of the cost of television programmes.  I do not know what the authority pays for films such as cowboy films, which have some attraction for younger people and for older people too.  There are a number of films screened week after week which, it is generally accepted, have little appeal.  It is time that the authority took cognisance of that fact.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell was worried about the broadcasting authority having to work on such a limited budget and suggested that they were doing a very good job having regard to the limited funds available to them.  I have no expert knowledge as to what it costs to administer the broadcasting service, of what it costs to rent films, of what various programmes costs, of what other expenditure is involved.  I have merely the knowledge that the ordinary man would have.  The best I could do is to hazard a guess as to the cost of these things.</P>
    <P>According to the statement supplied by the Minister the total cost last year of running the radio and television service was £6,127,935.  By any standards, that is a formidable figure. Of that amount the radio service cost £1,375,394 and the television service cost more than £4¾ million.  Accepting that my knowledge is limited, as I have clearly indicated, it is my view that we are not getting value for that kind of expenditure.  Money is losing its value daily but I wonder if we are getting value for this sum of over £6 million, which was the figure for <Col N="1590" /> 1970-71.  I merely ask the question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Deputy's opinion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My answer is no.  On many occasions I have expressed the view that this House should have a different kind of relationship with public bodies, that the House should get more information about the activities of such bodies.  I have suggested time and again that there should be a select committee of the House to deal with State-sponsored bodies and that the Minister should have wider functions in regard to State bodies. The case against that, to give it first, is that if State-sponsored bodies are not autonomous it would be difficult for them to carry out their functions if there were too much probing by the House or by the Minister.  I do not accept that.  It is this House and, through this House, the people who have to repair deficiencies.  In all State-sponsored bodies now the deficiencies are running high.  If CIE do not make sufficient income to meet their commitments, the citizens have to pay.  If Telefís Éireann are on the rocks they reach out their hand to the citizens.  The same applies in the case of the ESB.</P>
      <P>This House should have more functions in regard to their activities than it has at present.  I do not agree with the system adopted in regard to State-sponsored bodies.  Most of them now have been in existence for years and their only relation with Parliament seems to be one of coming back for money to meet their deficiencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the body relevant to our discussion here, Radio Telefís Éireann, I would suggest that the time has come when a Select Committee of this House should be appointed to discuss, not alone with the Telefís Éireann Authority but with all State-sponsored bodies, their activities to date and report back then to the House.  I am altogether against the freedom of action these people enjoy.  It would be a different matter if they were self-supporting and carried out their work effectively and efficiently and without continuous demands for subventions <Col N="1591" /> from public funds.  Telefís Éireann has been in existence now for 11 years and the time has come when it should render an account of its stewardship.</P>
    <P>There are two sides to everything and the best way in which to get the two sides of the operations of bodies like Telefís Éireann is to have the kind of committee I suggest which would meet with the boards of these State-sponsored bodies and exchange views with them.  Possibly a great deal of good would accrue as a result of such activities.  Members of this House might have useful suggestions to make and the whole exercise could lead to a more efficient service from these bodies.  In saying this, I am not casting any reflection on the personnel of these bodies.  All I am saying is that they should not have the freedom of action they enjoy at the moment.  That goes for every State-sponsored body, Radio Telefís Éireann, the ESB, CIE and all the rest.</P>
    <P>With regard to programmes, I said it is difficult to please everyone because tastes differ.  I would like a breakdown of the cost of the different programmes.  A film called &ldquo;Daniel Boone&rdquo; runs for one hour weekly. There are other American cowboy films.  Could we have a breakdown of the cost of these programmes?  It is essential that we should have this information. When we are asked about the cost we simply have no idea as to what the cost is.  I am sure that were we to seek such information from the television authority we would not get it.  The Minister should address himself to this question.  Is he in favour of a committee of this House dealing with State-sponsored bodies?  Is he in favour of any amendment of the Broadcasting Act of 1960?  That Act gave very wide powers to Telefís Éireann.  It was a new venture at the time and possibly there was some justification for giving these wide-ranging powers.  Now, after 11 years operation, it is time the position was reviewed.</P>
    <P>With regard to radio, the best place in which to hear comments on radio programmes is in a pub.</P>

      <P>By and large, the public are very pleased with the radio service, judging by the comments one hears.  The public give radio a higher rating than they give television.

      <P>That is so.  The Minister referred to the telephone service. He obviously knew there would be a great deal of criticism and, in the course of his opening speech, he pleaded guilty because he was unable &mdash;I will not say unwilling&mdash;to meet in any reasonable way demands for telephone services.  One should not be too hard on someone who enters a plea of guilty but, at the same time, he should not be allowed to get away scotfree. By what yardstick are applications measured?  How is it that people in similar positions in the same area are not treated on the same basis when applications are made for a telephone service?  Apart from those who could claim a telephone service because of special business interests or some other reasons or because it would be of general benefit to a number of people or because of priorities in the case of clergy and doctors and so on, why is it that other people are not treated equally?  There are at present many who have applied more than two years ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

He says he went to Fine Gael and to Labour and they could not do anything for him.  Then he is told: &ldquo;Why do you not go to our man?&rdquo; I am sure this is a national rather than a local practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to hear that.  The Deputy may not be in the inner circle.  I should like the Minister to make a statement on the allegation that to some extent telephone applications are dealt with on the basis of the political affiliations of applicants and those who make representations on their behalf.</P>
      <P>As an example of the inflexibility of the Department in dealing with some applications I know a village in west Cork where there is already a dead telephone.  The line was laid but the business was taken over by a new management with a reasonably high output and they have now been trying for almost two years to get a phone without success even though I am told the cost of installing that particular phone would be negligible since there was a phone in some part of the building up to quite recently.  Why should that happen?  I have made representations in this case on a number of occasions and it seems it is a case where a Deputy should put down a specific question to ascertain why this is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About ten years ago I asked the Minister about the prospects of an automatic telephone exchange for the south-western part of south-west Cork, from Dunmanway westwards along the coast.  I was told that such an exchange would be provided for that area in about four years or within five in any case.  Ten years passed and nothing happened.  On what <Col N="1594" /> basis was this assurance given in the House by the then Minister?  Who advised him this work would be done or was likely to be done in four years time?  No war or other difficulty arose in this part of the country in the meantime that would change the circumstances. Why was that misleading assurance given?  Are we to assume that when questions are asked here on a matter of public interest, such as the provision of an automatic telephone exchange, someone in the Civil Service writes the answer with little or no checking?  If so, that should be changed and I want an explanation.  If the Minister gives it in his reply well and good, but if he does not we can get it by means of a question.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the Post Office Savings Bank on a number of occasions during Estimates debates.  I should like, and apparently the Department would like, to cultivate savings habits particularly among younger people.  One of the best ways to do that is through the Post Office Savings Bank but the Post Office pay low rates of interest, as low as any organisation in this country.  In fact, for a while they were lower than the bank rates.  In this inflationary period I do not regard a 4 per cent interest rate on savings as fair or reasonable. Inflation is running much higher than 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Why should a public Department ask a person who has saved a small amount of money to invest it at 4 per cent?  In Dublin and Cork trustee saving banks have an interest rate of 6½ per cent.  In today's newspapers there is an announcement that the Government are endeavouring to float a loan at 9¾ per cent but there is a vast difference between 9¾ per cent and 4 per cent.  Can the Minister tell us why the rate of 6½ per cent cannot apply all round?  Why is the rate given by the Post Office not the same as that given by the trustee banks?  Is it because of the danger the banks might lose some of their deposits to the State?</P>
    <P>It is wrong to ask people who have a small amount of money saved to invest it at 4 per cent when the prevailing rate is approximately 10 per cent. I realise the banks may have something <Col N="1595" /> to say about this but there is no justification for penalising the small saver. People in Dublin, Cork and other large centres are able to invest their money at 7, 8 or 9 per cent but the man in Schull, Castletownbere or in other areas has not this advantage.  If he wishes to save he is obliged to invest in the local bank.  Even if the rate was increased to 6½ per cent it would scarcely be sufficient when one considers the rate of depreciation of money.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I asked a question here regarding a five-day week for postmen and I understood that this would be extended to all postmen throughout the country.  So far this has not happened. Postmen are entitled to this advantage; in fact, all workers, with the exception of Members of this House, are on a five-day week.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the matters uppermost in my mind in connection with this Estimate: television reception; the provision of at least one additional channel for the south of Ireland&mdash;a matter of major importance; the difficult position in relation to the installation of telephones&mdash;in this connection the question whether applications are dealt with fairly or whether some people get preferential treatment even though their application may not warrant this treatment; and I also discussed savings banks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister make that statement in the Dáil because when Opposition Deputies are unable to get telephones for people we are told frequently by the people concerned that they were advised if they went to members of Fianna Fáil the phones would be installed without too much delay.  I am accepting the statement by the Minister that this is not the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well but I will confine my wishes to the current year because it might be dangerous if they were extended to next year.  I am a firm believe that the Government should be changed and, therefore, I cannot be expected to wish the Minister too long a period in office. Fianna Fáil have been in office continuously for 15 years and this is long enough.  Were it not for that I would wish the Minister a longer term in office.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has a good personality and this is a great advantage.  Deputations are able to meet him and discuss their problems in a full and frank manner and this is essential nowadays.  Public people no matter what their status, whether a Minister, a Deputy or a civil servant, must be prepared to meet and talk with people, to be courteous and civil, to listen to their complaints and discuss problems with them.  If they cannot do this they should not be in public life.  They should retire to a private job where meeting people and discussing their problems would not arise.  The Minister has the ability to listen to people and to talk to them and, as far as is possible within Fianna Fáil, he is a broadminded man.</P>
      <P>I do not think there are any other matters to which I need refer so far as the postal services are concerned.  The general body of postal workers are doing an excellent job.  It would be superfluous for me to add to the statements made by other Deputies who have indicated that all branches of the postal services are generally helpful, with a few exceptions.  The public have no complaints and for that reason I need not refer particularly to their activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJBurke" hpid="Mr. P.J. Burke Mr. P.J. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister and his Department for producing this very knowledgeable document to assist Deputies.  They have gone to a good deal of trouble to tell us what they have been doing and what they intend to do during the coming year.  The Minister and his Department employ 22,000 people in all grades representing, as he said, 2 per cent of the employable population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> Notwithstanding all the money that has been spent I have had many applications for telephones in County Dublin on the stocks for a long time. The Minister and his Department cannot work miracles.  Over the past years the population in County Dublin has increased to almost 60,000 people. With all the new developments in the county there are demands for telephones day after day.  Hardly a day passes that I do not get letters saying: &ldquo;I have been on the waiting list for a telephone for quite a long while.&rdquo;  I get in touch with the Department, or with the contract manager, or with the engineer and they explain things to me.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Minister being given more money, and employing more people.  The trouble is that we would have to rob some other Department for which money is also required.  We are living in an affluent society and, thanks to good Government, the standard of living of our people has been brought up so much that they are demanding more telephones. Everybody wants a telephone. I remember the time when you would have to go to a post office to use a telephone.  I remember the time when you would not see a car outside a house, a council house, a small farmer's house, a businessman's house, or the house of anybody else.  Today there are two or three cars outside houses and there are telephone lines going into those houses.  That is a great sign of the times.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to keep a special eye on County Dublin.  A number of people living there are businessmen and they require telephones.  I want to tell Deputy Murphy that there is no such thing as pull so far as the telephone service is concerned.  The job is done in chronological order and as courteously and as efficiently as possible.</P>
    <P>The damage to telephone kiosks in Dublin city and county is disgusting. It is impossible for the Garda to look after everything.  I wonder would it be possible for the Minister to have small flying squads to deal with this problem. If somebody is caught damaging a telephone kiosk he should get jail <Col N="1598" /> without any option.  My area is supposed to be reasonably civilised but two telephone kiosks not very far away from where I live were broken at night by some blackguard.  These telephone kiosks provide a great social service. It is very annoying when people find that the telephone has been dismantled by somebody who has no regard for anybody else, and not even for himself.  I do not think that ladies are doing this damage; I attribute it to men who seem to enjoy destroying anything provided for the benefit of the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister is sending a car around to deal with television spongers and it might be no harm if it were generally known that he had one or two cars or vans scouting for people who tear down telephone kiosks.  It costs a lot of public money to repair them.  Instead of having glass surrounding the telephone kiosks I see that they now have very thin steel. This is a good idea but nevertheless it is broken from time to time.  It is disgusting to see the damage done and the harm caused.  After an accident, if an ambulance could be on the scene immediately, life might be saved. Many people die from inattention after an accident.  Therefore, the telephone is essential.</P>
    <P>I do not want to ask for too much, but I should like to see telephones provided at road junctions.  I do not think the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should bear all the cost.  It could be shared with the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Health.  Each year there are a number of accidents on every road leading out of Dublin.  In an area of dense population accidents are more prone to occur than in rural Ireland. That is why I feel the Department of Health and the Department of Social Welfare should consider providing telephone kiosks at vantage points, thus possibly saving life.</P>
    <P>The Minister has succeeded in extending the automatic exchanges in various parts of the country.  I hope that work will continue.  I want to compliment the Minister and his Department on their advertising in relation to post office savings and <Col N="1599" /> their method of publicising saving certificates.  I should like to see this savings drive started in the schools through the Minister for Education. Even if the children saved for their holidays this would give them a wonderful example and it would stand by them in after life.  It should be part of their education.  It would make them thrify and give them a sense of value.  Saving is just a habit. I never succeeded in doing this since I entered public life because I have had early enough money to pay my way, never mind saving.  Perhaps I may do it sometime.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should enlist the aid of the Department of Education particularly, and other Departments, in this saving campaign.  Children especially should be encouraged to save. They do not know now its value in later life.  It is a terrifying experience sometimes when one goes to help someone in danger of being evicted. One sometimes finds that the wife backs horses and drinks, but more frequently it is the husband who does these things.  The children are neglected.  Therefore, in every walk of life saving should be encouraged and all Departments of State should participate.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I referred to temporary postmen and their problems when they come to retire.  All they had on retirement was the old age pension.  Now there is, I understand, a gratuity payable to those men.  The Minister has improved their lot considerably and I wish to thank him.  Of course there are postwomen as well as postmen in Dublin.  Some of them are old and a greater effort must be made to look after them on retirement. It is an old saying that you cannot take the breeks off the Highlander. Neither can we disburse money which is not there.  I am thankful to the Minister for all that he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot about Telefís Éireann and Radio Éireann.  I must compliment them on an excellent job. <Col N="1600" /> I know the Minister had to intervene some time ago&mdash;it was his duty as the Minister responsible to this House and to the country for the proper running of that service&mdash;but I must compliment all responsible for the excellent programmes put out.

      <P>Telefís Éireann have done an excellent job to improve our image abroad.  Of course, there will always be people who complain and criticise.  There are people who criticise us here in the House, people who would not have a Government at all if they could arrange it, dictators who would not allow anybody the right of free speech.  However, RTE give a fair service to the people and the people can be proud of the service.  In the 11 years since they were founded, Telefís Éireann have done a lot of good for the country.  They have shown up very clearly the wrongs perpetrated on our brethren in the North.  They have shown this to the world and have succeeded in improving our prestige abroad.  I hope they will continue along these lines.</P>
      <P>There is very little more I wish to say about the postal service.  As far as I am concerned it is excellent in my constituency.  People may complain about deliveries from time to time but they must appreciate that delays occur in every walk of life.  We must put up with them occasionally.  On the whole I compliment the personnel in the postal service.  We now have a five-day week in Dublin.  That leaves Saturday free from opening mail.  It may be a bit heavy on Monday but it gives Dublin Deputies a free hour on Saturday and that is very helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to continue as he is and not to forget my area of <Col N="1601" /> County Dublin.  There will be another election coming up and I might want to contact some friends.

If that is his policy he is not being fair to the other Members of the House.  Some of them might disagree with the type of punch he uses.</P>
      <P>I should like to express our thanks to our spokesman, Deputy R. Burke, for the magnificent contribution he made. He certainly put research and time into it.  It would be futile, I think, for anybody else, whether in Government or in Opposition, to try to keep to the standard or go into the technicalities that he brought into this Estimate.

      <P>B'fhéidir.  Ba cheart don Aire iriseoir lán-aimsire a cheapadh do na Gaeltachtaí.  Bhís ag éisteacht le seanchaí cúpla mí ó shin. Bhí sé ag innsint a scéil féin.  Bhí anshuim agam ann mar bhain sé leis an Ghaeltacht uilig timpeall 50 bliain ó shin.  Nuair a bhí sé ag caint ní raibh a fhios aige go raibh Caitlicigh agus Protastúnaigh ag éisteacht leis an scéal.  Bhí sé ag caint faoi dhaoine a tháinig isteach ar an dtrá tar éis timpiste. Cailleadh iad.  Dúirt sé go dtáinig an sagart agus gur léigh sé na paidreacha os cionn an choirp.  Ansin dúirt sé go dtáinig an ministir agus thosnaigh sé a ráiméis.  Bhí daoine in aice liomsa.  Conaíonn siad i gCiarraí thiar agus bhí fearg agus ionadh orthu gur dhein an fear seo focal a rá nach raibh ina cheann a rá in aon chor ach ní ceart go dtarlódh sin ar Radio na Gaeltachta.  Dá mbeadh &ldquo;News Editor&rdquo; ann, abair, a dhéanfadh an focal &ldquo;ráiméis&rdquo; úd a scriosadh amach bheadh an scéal ar fheabhas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1605" /> That is my contribution so far as Radio na Gaeltachta is concerned, but there is one point I would like to reiterate.  It should not be the position that part-time reporters are making a racket of news items.  In the first instance the reporters employed by the medium should recognise the State.  It is wrong to broadcast a news item over Radio na Gaeltachta that is an insult to the intelligence of the people in those areas. Who wishes to be told that a cat had kittens on Mount Brandon and that the reporter was there to see the event? The position is as bad as that.  It is necessary that responsible persons be in charge of news items.  The Minister spent his holidays in my locality and some time afterwards I heard on Radio na Gaeltachta that a prominent Provisional IRA man was on holidays in Dún Chaoin but there was no mention of the Minister having been there.  It was the same last week when Deputy Bruton spent the weekend in west Kerry.  He visited the Ballyferriter CoOperative Society and saw the great work this society are doing, such as the reclamation of land.  They give much employment.  The Deputy visited Castlegregory also.  News of his visit was sent to the radio station but it was not mentioned in their bulletins.  They continued to issue silly stories that are irrelevant and are an insult to the intelligence of the people of west Kerry.</P>
    <P>One incident which occurred was regrettable.  The relatives of a person who had died at Dingle Hospital heard of the death on a Radio na Gaeltachta news bulletin before they had been notified officially by the hospital authorities.  That should not happen. There must be a balance and if people are not prepared to execute their job in a responsible manner they should not hold these positions.  There is no-half-way measure so far as this matter is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has had a series of correspondence from me regarding a special situation in south Kerry.  This is an isolated incident.  Substantial proof has been submitted to the Minister that at least five letters were either delayed or opened in the post at a certain <Col N="1606" /> post office.  I wrote to the aggrieved party in this matter and my letter, too, was opened although because there had been complaints, I had taken much care to ensure that the envelope was sealed properly.  The Minister must give his attention again to this matter. Another letter I had for him was delayed four days.  The neighbours got that letter.  There is something wrong there, but surely the machinery in the post office is sufficient to find out what is wrong.  Perhaps my remarks here today will result in this situation being cleared up once and for all.  I can only hope it will have that effect.</P>
    <P>Regarding postmen in rural Ireland, it is my contention that they should be supplied with a greater number of postal delivery vans than are in use at present.  These men provide a wonderful service and any extra expense that would be involved in the supply of extra vans would be justified in the long term.</P>
    <P>I cannot agree with the imposition of a delivery charge on some telegrams sent to people in rural Ireland. If a man is living on the side of a mountain he should not be penalised in this way by the Department.  At present he may find that there is a charge of 20p or 30p to be paid on the delivery of the telegram.  All the children of the nation should be treated equally.  We tell these people that they should try to remain in their own localities and, consequently, it is very unfair to penalise them in any way.</P>
    <P>When telephone kiosks are being erected in any part of the country a central point should be decided on for the location.  There may be technical difficulties involved occasionally which might require the erection of an extra two or three poles but, at the same time, there is no point in having every telephone kiosk erected outside a post office.  When a telephone kiosk is being erected it should be put where the people of the parish usually congregate.  There is a central point in every parish.  Sometimes it is outside the local pub&mdash;there may be only one in the parish&mdash;or outside the community hall.  The Minister should be more flexible.  Just for the sake of <Col N="1607" /> two poles he could make everyone in the parish happy.  I do not think this point has been made by other speakers. Deputy Burke, fair play to him, is not living down in rural Ireland and would not be aware of this, but rural Deputies are inundated with correspondence on this point.  The Minister is a rural Deputy himself and I hope he sees what I am driving at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am just alluding to it in a general way.  I have not made up my mind whether the Minister was right or wrong.  However, I was there when incidents took place, and I might as well say that I disagreed with the incidents entirely.  In regard to telephone rental charges, if it is the policy of the Department not to encourage people to apply for a telephone they are successful because of the charges they make.  I had a particular case&mdash; perhaps it is an isolated one&mdash;of a dwelling house that was next to a sub-post office.  The man was told he would have to pay £165.  If five or six poles were needed there might be some justification for the charge but the house was right beside the post office.  A charge of £165 in those circumstances was ridiculous.  It would be just as well to tell that man: &ldquo;We know you cannot pay&rdquo;, being the best way to put him off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Once an area has a certain number of telephones a maintenance man should be employed.  It is ridiculous that if a telephone breaks down a man has to go 30 or 40 miles, maybe two days after the complaint has gone in, to repair it.  There would be plenty of work to keep a maintenance man occupied full time because he could be connecting new houses or doing other preliminary work.  The ESB have a maintenance staff, and various other companies have maintenance staffs.  There may be difficulties in this that I know nothing about but I would like the Minister to think over this suggestion.</P>
      <P>As regards the streamlining of the postal service, some towns are very annoyed that they are no longer mentioned in a postal address.  Let me quote two examples from my own constituency: Dunquin, Tralee, County Kerry, is the new postal address; before it was Dunquin, Dingle, County Kerry.  Then there is Ballinskelligs, Killarney, County Kerry; Cahirciveen is left out.  The Minister is not being fair to the communities in these towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to a matter which has given me great concern, that is, television fees and television reception; the two go together.  I hate to say it, but I disagree with my colleague when he says that fees will have to be increased to improve RTE's financial position.  It may be fine for fees to be increased in certain parts of Ireland where there is reception from five channels: BBC 1, BBC 2, UTV, Welsh TV and RTE.  However, £7.50 is far too much for the type of reception we are getting from one station in the south-west of Ireland. The people in that part of the country are also entitled to civil rights.  There should be a special television fee for people who can get reception only now and again from RTE and for those who are getting only very poor quality reception.  If the people on the east coast are fed up with one channel they can switch to another.  We have to wait for the newspapers the following day to see what is happening.  The Minister should try to make an arrangemen <Col N="1609" /> with the BBC and ITV for the erection of booster stations, particularly in the south and west of Ireland, so that we could see what is happening elsewhere.  I am sure the Minister would like to see &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; when it comes on.  Perhaps the Minister might give us his opinions about providing other stations for the people I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Minister started his campaign about &ldquo;television spongers&rdquo; I was discussing with a man the film which showed six vans parked together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Two officials were shown getting into each car&mdash;a driver and an inspector.  The man who was talking to me said &ldquo;No wonder we have to pay £7.50 when there are two people in every car.&rdquo;  We have reached the stage in the Post Office where every inspector has a driver with him.  The producer of the film should have been aware of the impression that would be created by the film.  The man I was talking to was struck by the point that it took two men to do the job.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will give us a ray of hope about being able to get other stations as well as Telefís Éireann.  The Minister should make a special effort to see that parts of Kerry, such as Headford and Glenflesk, get some television. The people cannot get a picture there at all now.  The Minister may be able to tell us about booster stations being erected here and there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as RTE are concerned some of their &ldquo;ads&rdquo; are unsuitable, particularly the one which describes certain brands of tyres.  I know of some young fellows who say they are as good as the driver shown performing certain acrobatics with his car.  It is being suggested that if certain tyres are fitted cars can travel at any pace without accidents happening.  I do not know what steps the Minister can take in this regard. The message has got across that if one fits certain tyres one will not be involved in an accident while using them. <Col N="1610" /> That is not so.  Emphasis should be placed on the need for care while driving and a warning issued that one's safety depends on being a good driver.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Agriculture met in Dublin yesterday.  They were concerned about the poor and cranky image which the farmers are getting on RTE.  They were so concerned that they passed a resolution to the effect that the pleasant things which can be said about farming are not being said, but only the cranky things.  The farming communities, organisations and cooperative societies are doing good work around the country.  It would be useful if some of that good work were highlighted on Telefís Éireann to show one part of the country what the other part is doing.</P>
    <P>There is a feeling about one programme on Telefís Éireann that all that has to be done is start a row in the Gaeltacht, then ring Telefís Éireann and they will be down with two or three cameras.  That should not be so. There is a particular Irish programme which I make a point of watching as often as I can.  It appears to me that one has to be extreme Right or extreme Left to get on that programme.  A fortnight ago I was listening to a number of people being interviewed.  I thought it was disgraceful that an interviewer should ask a panel &ldquo;Are we going to go to war or have peace?&rdquo; This House alone can decide on such questions. That interviewer should not take it on himself to ask any particular person or panel whether we were going to have war or peace.  I hope we will never have a repetition of a question of that type.  The Green Paper was under discussion on that occasion.  The Minister might care to listen to the tapes of that programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of complimenting the personnel of all the current affairs programmes, the news, &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo;, &ldquo;Enterprise&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tangents&rdquo; and &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo;.  They are all good programmes.  Friday night is not a suitable night for the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; Programme.  Friday night is pay-night and people usually go out to the dogs or the &ldquo;local&rdquo; on that night.  Thursday night would be a better night for that particular programme. <Col N="1611" /> I am sure that is why the TAM ratings for that programme are not as high as they should be.  People are occupied in other ways on Friday nights.  That is something we cannot change.  I like Frank Hall's programme. It shows the lighter side of life.  If a few public men or Members of this House are modelled in it, we can only blame ourselves.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to provide an all-night telephone service throughout the country. In some areas there is no all-night service.  In the year 1972 every parish and village should have this service. The service could be provided through the local exchange or some other system.</P>
    <P>On the Estimate two years ago I suggested that the system whereby the phone would ring once for Johnny Murphy, and twice for Nelly Flaherty and three times for Dick Burke is all wrong because the telephone conversation can be overheard. The Minister has taken steps but I wish he could do more in this regard.</P>
    <P>I hope that when the Minister is replying he will refer to some of the points I have made, which are not technical points.  I have not made the study of this matter that my colleague, Deputy Richard Burke, made.  Fair play to him, he made a contribution to the debate which every Deputy should read again and again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Je vais á trois heures cet aprés-midi á voir Leinster/ New Zealand á Lansdowne Road. It is not just to give the House a bit of colour that I air my knowledge of the language that we will all be studying and should have been studying long ago.  It is not those who speak most say most.  I shall confine myself to giving the Minister a little advice that should serve as a headline for the Minister in regard to the Estimate as it concerns myself and the people I represent.  I have no intention of going into the technical field of the Post Office engineering services because I know nothing about them and if I were to attempt to do so I would get bogged down as others do when <Col N="1612" /> they interfere with things they know nothing about.  I want to be as helpful as I can.  I want to advise the Minister and his officials in order that we can have an improvement in the entire services provided by the Department.</P>
      <P>At the present time a telephone is regarded as essential.  This has been the position for possibly 15 years.  I fail to understand why the planning section of the Department did not anticipate the demand for the service. Because of this lack of foresight we now have a priority list for telephones at the top of which are doctors, veterinary surgeons and others who are on constant call for emergency cases. Had there been proper forward thinking and planning in the Department, long before the present Minister went there, this position would not have arisen, a position which will continue well into the future, although I read with a certain amount of joy that the Swedish company is opening up in Athlone.  That is something that six years ago I advocated in this House, not alone to meet the demand in this country but so that we could export to Europe.  I am glad that this is now taking place and that the erection of the factory will proceed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Because of the expansion of the service and the demand for it there must be a new policy with regard to the recruitment of apprentices to the engineering section.  I must say for the engineering section that as far as Limerick is concerned I have not got the complaints which I have heard about a delay of hours and possibly two or three days for investigation of complaints.  That is not the position in the area that I come from and I speak not only for the city of Limerick but for the greater part of rural Limerick also.  Complaints are dealt with immediately.  In the city they are attended to within hours.  I do not know of any more devoted and competent men than there are in the Post Office engineering service.  I could not discuss the technicalities involved in laying, say, one line.  I would advise the Minister that a recruiting campaign should be initiated immediately with a view to meeting future demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1613" /> I would also suggest that more automatic phones should be provided. The automatic telephone eliminates delay in getting trunk calls in contrast to the former system where one had to wait one's turn and there might be a delay of an hour in getting a connection. The automatic telephone has eliminated that cause of complaint and should be more widely used.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about delays in the delivery of mail.  My postman always appears between five minutes to eight and five minutes past eight every morning.  I regard that as an excellent service.  I would be the first to complain if the service were bad.  I have had no complaints from anybody in Limerick about postal delays and there are few here or even outside this House who know as much about the people of Limerick as I do. In the past five or six years I have not had one complaint.  Some years ago there was some kind of reshuffle and deliveries were a bit late but, as a result of representations, everything went back to normal.  Now postal deliveries are dead on.</P>
    <P>With regard to telephonists, night telephonists work a three hour period from 6.30 p.m. to 9.30 p.m.  Income tax is deducted on an annual basis.  If any of them is absent something like £3.50 is deducted.  I met a case not so long ago where a night telephonist got a registered letter with 8p.  That was surely carrying things a bit far.  Of course, the postal authorities have to be strict in order to maintain public confidence.  If they are not strict public confidence will be shaken and there will be prosecutions every day of the week.  However, deducting £3.50 from £3.58 is carrying things a bit too far. I would ask the Minister to devote some of his attention to the position of temporary telephonists.  They have a grievance.  They are in the awkward position that they are nobody's child. They will not be accepted into the union and they have no one to speak for them.  They should get some consideration. Surely they are entitled to better remuneration.  This is night work and we all know what a chore night work is.</P>
    <P>Where Radio Telefís Éireann is concerned, <Col N="1614" /> hardly a week goes by without some sensational news about the conditions of the staff.  There must be something wrong when complaints occur so frequently.  There must be bad relations somewhere along the line.  As far as I can see, there is little or no security of tenure.  Every other day staff are changed, staff leave, staff go slow, staff black this, that and the other.  The image that should be projected is not being projected because of this failure in relationships somewhere along the line.  An experienced public relations officer or personnel manager should be appointed to organise the staff and to solve whatever problems have to be solved.  Only then will a proper image be projected.</P>
    <P>I do not know who plans the programmes, but it seems to be a very jerky kind of operation.  There seems to be no set plan.  We have no idea in advance what the programme will be unless we refer to our daily papers or to the <i>RTE Guide</i>.  Even then the advertised programmes are liable to change without notice.  Again, we are not getting the kind of programme we should.  We want to see our own way of life portrayed.  The fact that &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; tops the list every week is indicative of its popularity.  It is the Irish way of life that viewers want to see.  We should have more of Lennox Robinson, Seán O'Casey, Synge, Yeats and all the others.  We should get projected an historical background of our cultured past.  That is most important from the point of view of young viewers who should be made to realise the hardships that were suffered to bring us to the position in which we find ourselves today.  These are the things that will unite us and keep us together.  Shortly we will be entering Europe and it is most important that we should do everything to preserve and foster our cultural heritage. That is not being done at the moment on Telefís Éireann.  We get cowboys and Indians and gangsters and all the rest of them.  The Minister should proceed along those lines as far as possible.  I know that the research that must be done when pageantry has to be projected is a big job.  We had an example of this in the debate on the <Col N="1615" /> Treaty.  This was well done, an excellent production, even though it was done by a Limerick man.  This sort of thing with a bit of pageantry is what we should get from Telefís Éireann.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have sufficient cameras throughout the country.  Fortunately, we have a man in Limerick, but he is away every other day.  He was called on this week and it was found that he was on duty in the North of Ireland and would be absent for a week or ten days.  With more cameras we would get more local and sporting events, more local cultural developments and this would arouse local interest and pride.  People seeing things done on television would be inspired to do them in their own areas.  Competition would spread to the whole Thirty-two Counties and competition in this connection is a very good stimulant. It would uncover hidden talent which would otherwise be lost.  The Department should concentrate on this aspect of television.</P>
    <P>More time should be devoted to sporting events in addition to what we have at present.  On Saturdays we get perhaps two or three races from some meeting.  The bloodstock industry is up among the top five or six.  The greyhound industry is also very good but there are other sporting events which should get more coverage.  I do not know who makes the selection but you find some local function getting preference over something national.  That should not be.  The programmes manager should give more time to considering how to satisfy the needs of the greatest number of people.  He should not specialise on any one type of event.  On one Sunday it might be soccer and on another GAA games and so on.  The consideration should be to please the greatest number.</P>
    <P>Like many other parts of the country we in my area are deprived of something that the eastern part of the country has.  I see no reason why the whole of Ireland should not have the same television service.  I know there are technical difficulties involved. I see now that Cork and Waterford are having a piped television service. <Col N="1616" /> That is good but why can we not also have it along the west coast in Limerick and in Galway?  At present, because of the quality of what is being screened in Telefís Éireann some people turn off their sets and go where they can enjoy themselves better than in watching Telefís Éireann programmes.  Along with providing piped television in Cork and Waterford this service should be provided along the west coast so as to cover the whole country.</P>
    <P>I read with dismay that the RTE service is to be closed for some time on Sunday afternoons in the winter. This is the most stupid exercise ever carried out.  If they decided to close down for two or three hours in the summer, except on days when sporting events such as hurling or football matches would be scheduled, I would not have so great a complaint.  I could go some of the way with them, but when they suggest closing down in the winter for an hour or two they should realise that is the time when people are at home, in frosty and wet weather.  Where can they go?  Yet they are being deprived of the little comfort they can have at home.  This should be reconsidered.  The reports I have indicate that it would be much worse to close down the service than to keep it going.  If it is being kept going, for goodness sake let us have some entertaining programmes on Sunday afternoons when people want to get away from the troubles of the past week.</P>
    <P>These are the points I want to make about the postal and television services generally.  I have condensed my remarks as much as possible.  I do not believe in meandering on these Estimates; I want to be brief and to the point.  I hope what I have said will bear fruit and I look forward to the improvements I have suggested being implemented.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1617" /> In complimenting the Minister on this my first speech in the House and congratulating his Department on the Estimate&mdash;and it is the greatest Estimate ever put before the House&mdash;I should first like to deal very briefly with the postal service.  I am surprised that this service has been criticised because in our area particularly the postal service can stand up to any scrutiny.  It gives a good service.  For too long our postmen particularly in rural areas were one of the bodies of people who were neglected in our society.  This has not been the case in recent years.  There have been many improvements; vans have been provided in many areas but I would ask the Minister never to forget the problems these people must face.  They are obliged to start work at an early hour and they must cover a vast area whether they travel by van or on a bicycle.  The Minister should try to introduce a five-day week for rural postmen as soon as possible so that they may have the same working week as their colleagues in the city areas.</P>
    <P>Generally the Post Office staff deserve to be complimented.  They are constantly dealing with the public, they are courteous and helpful and, in the main, they are efficient.  One group of people who deserve special mention are the night telephonists.  I have known some of these people in Cork and in Dublin and frequently I have had to make phone calls from 10 p.m. onwards.  I have found them friendly, courteous and helpful at times when most of us are surely, sour and not too helpful to our colleagues and others.</P>
    <P>The same praise can be extended to most of the Post Office staff.  Generally they are helpful and courteous. The telephone operators who work during the day work under a severe strain.  Their job must be frustrating because most of us know how harassed we can become if we have to take a few phone calls in succession. The Minister and his staff must be complimented; the Department of Posts and Telegraphs present a courteous and civil appearance to the public. The engineering staff in Cork do a good job.  When they are required they are available as soon as possible, <Col N="1618" /> although I realise they have their priority listings.  This is quite right because the business firm must come first while the private phone has to wait.  I have not had any cause to complain, nor have I seen any reason why complaints should be levelled at the engineering section of the Post Office.</P>
    <P>At one stage the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was regarded as of lesser importance and responsibility than other Departments.  However, having regard to the greater need and desire for communication the Department has grown in importance.  One could say that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in some way are educating the people and all these factors have magnified the importance of the Department.  At one time there were not many telephones in rural areas; apart from the telephones installed in the homes of doctors, priests and local businessmen telephones were not installed in private homes.  However, nowadays the telephone is regarded as an essential and many people wish to have a phone in their home.</P>
    <P>If I sound rather parochial in my first speech in this House it is because I am more aware of the needs of my own area than of other parts of the country.  Satellite towns such as Ballincollig, Blarney, Carrigaline, Passage, Rochestown, Monkstown and areas around Cork have developed very quickly in a few years.  These areas are growing towns and have the needs of such towns.  Doctors have come into these areas, shops have been set up, lounge bars&mdash;a doubtful benefit of modern society but a part of it&mdash;have been built and telephones are required for all of them.  Many of the inhabitants of these areas work in the city and must be on call, and for them a telephone is essential.  The Minister must endeavour to provide facilities for these areas; the people cannot be expected to wait for perhaps two and a half years to get a telephone.  I appreciate that money is a scarce commodity but every means must be examined in order to get money to finance essential developments in these areas.</P>
    <P>When television was introduced by RTE people in the south were delighted <Col N="1619" /> that they could see some programmes but that novelty has long since worn off.  The Minister must be aware of the great need for better programmes. What was good enough last year is not good enough this year will not be good enough next year.  We must strive constantly for further improvement.</P>
    <P>RTE must be complimented on the vast improvement in several of the home-based programmes.  I am not a great &ldquo;pop&rdquo; record fan&mdash;I am sure my friends would regard me as a &ldquo;square&rdquo;&mdash;but recently I was very pleased with a &ldquo;pop&rdquo; record programme I happened to see.  The standard of production and presentation was very good. It was a credit to the people concerned and a compliment to them that this programme could have caught my fancy because I would never be regarded as a &ldquo;pop&rdquo; fan.</P>
    <P>The programmes on current affairs are quite good.  However, on some of the programmes&mdash;I am not confining this remark to current affairs programmes&mdash;frequently controversy boils over almost into a battle.  Quite recently I heard a person on television say that he would punch somebody; I think we can do with much less of this kind of remark.  I agree these may be isolated instances but they do not appeal to me.  I admit that we cannot always agree but we should agree to differ in a quiet sensible way and this approach should be adopted on RTE.</P>
    <P>The programmes on Sunday nights have improved.  Last year we had a succession of crime, war and horror films for six or eight weeks.  Perhaps certain people like these films but I think we got an overdose of them. Recently there has been an improvement in the kind of films that have been shown, but I would ask for more variety and a greater examination of some of the imported programmes.  We should not forget that television has a great influence on young people and we should try to ensure that programmes depicting the better way of living rather than programmes dealing with killing and shooting are shown on our screens.  I am not looking for all comedy programmes but, on Sunday <Col N="1620" /> nights, programmes should be devoted to light entertainment which would be acceptable and would be enjoyed generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan also mentioned something about which I feel strongly. With the advent of our entry into the EEC we should devote a bit more time on RTE to our own culture.  We should promote our own culture and our own pastimes.  We can project these things. We must preserve them.  For that reason I want to impress on the authority the necessity for devoting more time to our culture and our pastimes.</P>
    <P>We in mid-Cork have our black areas too.  Although we have two Cork members on the authority I am disappointed that many more of the black areas have not been eliminated by now.  Some of them are near the city and some of them are remote from the city.  Possibly the more remote areas are the more important.  Television in those areas fills a social need.  The Minister should ask RTE to have all the black areas eliminated as soon as possible.  The valley from Ballygarvan through Ballinhassig and on to Crossbarry is very convenient to the city yet it has very poor television reception, despite the fact that a booster station was erected nearby.  I understand that the authority have this in hand and I would ask the Minister to speed it up. There are other areas like the village of Minane Bridge and the town of Clonakilty and places like that where we should have a better reception.</P>
    <P>Because of our geographical situation we in the south have not had the advantage which the people living on the east coast have.  We have been confined to the one station.  Through no fault on the part of RTE we have not got the variety of programmes which the people living on the east coast have.  I want to impress on the Minister and his Department the necessity to eliminate all the black spots and to provide us with multi-channel television as soon as possible.  We are entitled to avail of the same facilities as are provided in the east.</P>
    <P>Níl morán eile le rá agam ach, mar focal scoir, ba mhaith liom a rá gur <Col N="1621" /> mhór an chéim ar aghaidh é Radio na Gaeltachta agus gur mhór an cabhair é chun an teanga do chothú.  Is binn linn go léir a cloisint go bhfuil beartaithe ag an Aire an Seirbhís seo a leathanú.</P>

      <P>The debate on this Estimate is usually devoid of political acrimony and most Deputies like to contribute to it.  The attitude and the thinking of the Fine Gael Party on the activities of this Department have been dealt with comprehensively and very adequately by our spokesman, Deputy R. Burke.  Other speakers have gone into more detail.  I do not propose to repeat what has already been said.  I will try to confine myself to some aspects of the activities of the Department in which I have a special interest.</P>
      <P>I have found the Minister most courteous, most approachable and very accessible at all times, and very willing to assist Deputies on constituency problems. I want to place that on record and I make no apology for doing so.</P>
      <P>I want to issue an appeal to the Minister in the strongest possible terms on behalf of a section of our people who have been forgotten down through the years, and who are still being forgotten. I refer to the very large exile population of Irish people resident outside this country.  I want to appeal to the Minister to do something&mdash;and he can do it; the cost will not be prohibitive&mdash;to improve RTE radio reception in Great Britain, and particularly in the London region.  I have many personal contacts with Irish organisations in Britain.  I have a deep personal interest in emigrant welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time and time again appeals have been made to me, by individual Irish people and by Irish organisations in Britain, to try to improve RTE radio reception, particularly in the London region where the greatest proportion of the Irish population in Britain reside.  I have had discussions with Mr. <Col N="1622" /> Hardiman, Director-General of RTE on this matter.  I found him very fair, very anxious to help and very interested in the problem.  The latest information I have had from the Director-General is that the bad reception in the London region is due to technical difficulties.  They are due to the fact, I understand, that the wave band there is overcrowded.  I was very pleased to learn from Mr. Hardiman that steps are now being taken to instal new equipment over a period of the next two years or so which should ensure better RTE radio reception in London.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with this.  It just is not good enough.  I want to appeal especially to the Minister.  No other Deputy has referred to this matter and I doubt if any other Deputy will.  I feel very strongly about it.  We have one million Irish-born people living across the channel.  It is estimated that there are a further three million of Irish parentage, which gives a total exile population of four million. Surely we have some obligation to them.  Surely it is not asking too much to ask the Government to provide this very basic facility which would help to make life in exile more pleasant and which would enable our exiles to retain their links with their homeland.  They should be able to tune into the home station to hear broadcasts of all-Ireland finals and other sporting events, to hear Irish music, Irish songs and the news from Ireland.</P>
    <P>Time and again people have pleaded with me and have pointed out how frustrating it is to tune into RTE on some special occasion and find that the reception is absolutely diabolical and could not be worse. I have looked into the cost of improving the service and I acknowledge the fact that some steps are being taken to improve radio reception over there but the installation of new equipment, <i>et cetera,</i> will take a period of three years.  I ask the Minister to now make a practical gesture towards our emigrant population in Britain by shortening this period and speeding up the installation of the new equipment.</P>
    <P>We have made a very bad mistake <Col N="1623" /> down the years in relation to the whole question of emigration and the problems of our emigrants.  It reflects no credit on this or any other Government. We have now reached the situation where nationally we are beginning to think of the question of our exiled population abroad.  We are very keen to go after them and plead with them to spend their money at home on holidays, to send back their money to be invested here <i>et cetera</i> but we have failed entirely to do anything to help them to make life in exile a bit more tolerable.  We could, without incurring any great cost, without bankrupting the country, have provided proper broadcasting services for these people.  I could never understand why, in a country like this, which has such a huge overseas population&mdash;I am not referring merely to Irish people in Britain but all over the world; we have a huge missionary population scattered to the four corners of the earth&mdash;steps were never taken to have a short wave radio station in this country.  Various people refer to this.  No explanation has ever been given to me as to why this is not feasible.  I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to give us some idea of what his thinking is in relation to this and whether he has any plans to provide this very desirable facility. Apart from the major question of a short wave radio station, I am asking him specially now to see to it that Radio Éireann reception in Britain is improved in the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have, since the foundation of the State, been looked upon as a kind of cinderella Department, a Department where junior Ministers suffer for a time before they move on to higher things.  In this age of international trade and commerce, of high speed travel, the development of tourism and so forth, communications and telecommunications have assumed a much more important role in the economic and social life of every nation.  It is not inappropriate on the eve of our entry to the EEC to bear in mind that we are an island nation situated on the tip of Europe, cut off from the European mainland, a country which is vitally dependent on trade and commerce with <Col N="1624" /> the European mainland, and will be more so on our entry to the EEC.  Communications will play a vital role in determining our viability, our survival and our progress in the EEC.  It is vitally important then that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister in particular should be conscious of the part he and his Department can play in the economic life of this nation and the social progress of our people.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see in the Minister's speech references to the fact that his Department are conscious of European developments in the field of telecommunications and to learn that Ireland is associated with various European organisations such as the European Postal Union and technical organisations in Europe.  There is no doubt that our exporters, whether in manufacturing industry or agriculture and particularly the tourist industry, are dependent on up-to-date, sophisticated and highly efficient communications services.  I am pleased to note that there has been a considerable increase in the number of companies and people who have installed telex services.  The demand for this service is growing at a rapid pace.  Telex, as well as the telephone, is a vital instrument in modern economic life.  Our business people, our exporters and our tourist people will be looking more and more to the mainland of Europe. Our whole outlook, our attitudes and the very well-being of this nation will be influenced to a large degree by what will happen within the EEC.  It is vitally important that the lines of communication between Ireland and Brussels should be the best that can possibly be devised.  At present the situation is reasonably good.  I investigated this a week ago.  While my principal involvement may be in the transport field I believe that communications are of equal importance.  It is essential that direct telephone dialling between Brussels at least and perhaps other European capitals and Dublin should be provided.  The direct dialling service now available between London and Ireland is a tremendous asset and a great advantage to people who have to do business.  The speed with which one can get a telephone call through <Col N="1625" /> the telephone exchange from any part of Britain to any part of Ireland has also improved considerably in recent years.</P>
    <P>The telex system is a fascinating one. It is one that will come more and more into use.  The Minister has given figures for the cost of telex rental.  I would venture to say that the figure is not prohibitive for any company which is doing a good deal of foreign trade.  I do not know what the situation is regarding the actual demand for telex service, whether the provision of a telex service is as slow as that of a telephone service.  The main thing is that efficient lines of communication between here and Britain and the mainland of Europe will play a major role in determining our survival and our progress.  Many business people and people involved in the tourist industry have expressed their concern to me regarding faults in the communications systems between Ireland and other countries.  It is of vital importance, now that we are members of the EEC, that a serious look be taken at the communications services&mdash;the telephone, telex and telegraph services&mdash; especially between Dublin and the European capitals.</P>
    <P>One particular aspect of the Minister's speech in which I was very interested concerns the exploration of the possibility of manufacturing telephonic and the various communications equipment in this country.  This is a logical and a desirable development particularly in view of the huge demand for telephones in respect of which there is a great backlog of applications.  I understand that apart from the financial problems involved difficulties have been experienced in securing equipment at the time it is required.  The Minister has referred to the manufacture being by way of contract but regardless of what method is used, any step towards the large-scale manufacture of various types of telecommunication equipment is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated by a reference in the Minister's speech to the question of transmitting computer data by telephone. This is a development that I <Col N="1626" /> had not heard of before but the idea seems a fantastic one and one which has exciting possibilities.  Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to let me have more detailed information on this matter.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of this debate Deputies have the annual crack at RTE and the whole question of political broadcasting.  It is doubtful whether any few people are in agreement nowadays regarding RTE.  We tend to concentrate more now on television than on radio but this is a pity because the quality of the sound broadcasting programmes is very good.  During the past 12 months I have had an opportunity to listen frequently to radio programmes.  This is because I had a radio installed in my car.  Because the radio is so relaxing it may lead to one being a more relaxed driver.  However, I have been greatly impressed with the variety, the quality and the presentation of the various programmes.  I have expressed these views to many other people and have found that in general there is agreement that the approach to devising radio programmes is much more imaginative and generally better than that used in respect of television programmes. Many of the radio programmes are extremely educational in their context.  This medium which one might say had been relegated to a position of secondary importance is doing a very fine job.</P>
    <P>While on the question of sound broadcasting there is one particular programme to which I should like to refer.  The relationship between politicians and broadcasters is a very sensitive one not only here but in many other places also.  If a politician hears a commentary on the media that is unfavourable to him he will not like it.  However, there is one programme in respect of which I have never heard any adverse criticism. From time to time a number of my colleagues, in particular Deputy Briscoe, have paid tribute to this programme. I refer to &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  This is a simple, straightforward factual report of the daily proceedings in Dáil Éireann.  No commentary is made on a Deputy's contribution. <Col N="1627" /> There is no attempt to analyse a Deputy's thinking and the programme succeeds in giving a fair crack of the whip to everybody.</P>
    <P>I have been here for 11 years and I have never heard any Deputy make any adverse comment, publicly or privately, about the programme, &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  I have suggested on a number of occasions, and other Deputies have also suggested, that that programme should be transmitted to television.  I remember Deputy Briscoe giving a newspaper interview some two years ago and asking why was it that that programme, which is taped for sound broadcasting, is not transmitted to television.  That could be done very simply.  The name of the Deputy being reported could be flashed on the screen. I have found, in my travels to political functions and meetings of various kinds around the country, a growing number of people tuning in at night especially to hear &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo;.  Is there some reason why that programme could not be transmitted to television? I like the programme and most people like it because it is a straightforward report of what we say.  What we say as politicians can be taken out of context and comments can be made. Sometimes we like what the reporters say.  I am in favour of all news media projecting Parliament as it is.  We all have our own peculiarities, human failings, personalities, attitudes and loyalties but, by and large, we represent a good cross-section of the nation. The news media should reflect Parliament as it is.</P>
    <P>The programme &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; is an outstanding example of good parliamentary reporting.  The reportage is factual, unbiased, fair to everybody.  I want publicly to compliment whoever is responsible for the preparation of the programme.  This programme is an outstanding example of good parliamentary reporting and I and many of my colleagues on all sides of the House would like to see it transmitted to television.</P>
    <P>Apart from that programme, the programmes in which a parliamentary political reporter gives an account of what happened in regard to various <Col N="1628" /> items of interest from the day's proceedings have given rise to general satisfaction.  As I have said before, whatever the faults of Radio Telefís Éireann may be, whatever the internal problems may be, whatever may be the problems in regard to staff morale and staff relations to which Deputies have referred, we are very fortunate in that RTE has in its parliamentary reporting staff a team of journalists who would be a credit to any country.</P>
    <P>In so far as current affairs programmes and programmes containing political commentary are concerned, the situation is not quite so good. Again, I have regard to the fact that one would naturally be influenced by the treatment one would have received in these programmes or by the fact that one had been ignored.  Political commentators and those who prepare current affairs programmes have a very serious responsibility.  I have detected a tendency on the part of some of these in the past to belittle Parliament, to belittle politicians, to belittle the role politicians play in the life of the nation.  That is a horrible thing to happen.  The late Deputy William Norton, a man who had lifelong association with the postal service, used to stress that there was a very serious obligation on the broadcasting media to ensure that the role of Parliament in the life of the nation, the functions of Parliament, the work of Deputies, should not be demeaned, should not be undermined, that there was a duty on the broadcasting media to reflect truthfully and honestly the working of Parliament and the efforts of the Members of Parliament to fulfil the obligations and duties placed upon them by the people who elected them.</P>
    <P>As far as the parliamentary reporting staff are concerned, they do this with integrity, honesty and a very great measure of success, which is appreciated not merely by those of us who have the honour to be Members of Parliament but by the public at large, particularly by those who are interested in politics.  I cannot say the same for the current affairs programmes. I shall not mention individuals or specify programmes.  If the <Col N="1629" /> cap fits.... I am not satisfied.  There are many others who are not satisfied.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss in detail a matter which has been the subject of much debate, not merely in this country but in other countries, the relationship between Governments and broadcasting authorities or Ministers and broadcasting authorities.  I was not here last week but I was rather surprised to read a report of a reference that had been made here to the manner in which the news staff in RTE have handled the situation in the North.  Whether this reference was made by a Deputy on this side of the House or not, I do not know.  It makes no difference to what I want to say. There was some reference to the fact that RTE did not handle this situation as well as the BBC or other broadcasting authorities handle it.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the outstanding presentation of the unfortunate situation in the North in recent times has been the daily bulletin transmitted by Mr. Liam Hourican.  I understand he has been honoured with a television award.  Whether the award was for this particular programme or for some other programme I do not know.  His reporting is a model.</P>

      <P>RTE have done a good job on the whole.  I would certainly be prepared to defend RTE and I do not subscribe to attempts to compare detrimentally RTE's handling of the tragic situation in the North with the way in which the BBC and other broadcasting corporations have handled it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of the studio in London was an excellent development. I should like further developments of this nature.  I am anxious that there should be as many regional broadcasting studios as possible.  Broadcasting should not be influenced entirely by the metropolitan outlook of a capital city. <Col N="1630" /> There is need for broadcasting facilities in major provincial centres and there is tremendous scope for the development of provincial programmes. The daily reports from the studios in Belfast and London have been very useful in keeping public opinion informed on developments.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the Minister made any reference to the question of membership of the EEC.  Is it intended to have broadcasting facilities or some kind of studio in the EEC headquarters in Brussels?  This would seem to be essential because more and more people will be interested in what is happening there.  I understand some of the newspapers are sending representatives to Brussels.  I should like to see a studio established in Brussels, a studio which would send out daily or weekly reports.  On matters of vital importance&mdash;the Minister for Transport and Power was at a meeting of transport ministers in Brussels recently engaged on a matter of vital importance to this country&mdash;our people would like to know exactly what is happening.  I would like now to remind the Minister of two local problems.  I might point out that I am an elector in the Minister's constituency.</P>

      <P>I sincerely hope my constituency will not be taken away entirely when the next revision is made.  There are two matters I want to bring to the attention of the Minister. The Minister will remember a deputation he saw from Limerick some months ago in relation to some confusion that arose in the broadcasting studio in Limerick.  The Minister might let me know what the position is.</P>
      <P>My local area is a famous area.  The President of Ireland comes from Bruree.  We have no automatic telephone exchange.  Hospital and parts of east Limerick have been automated, but Kilmallock has not yet been included. Croom is automated.  I would ask the Minister to examine the situation. Kilmallock is a very important centre and it will be even more important if it is restored to me in the next revision of constituencies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very kind in giving us such a lengthy introduction to his Estimate.  The notes have been very helpful indeed.  The functions of the Department are listed. Might I suggest to the Minister that he should some day get around to examining the functions of the Department. Some of them could be handled by other agencies, whether State or private. Are the Department the best agency for savings?  The commercial banks and other agencies may or may not be doing a better job, but this is one area in which the Minister might possibly divest himself of a particular function in the interests of the Department as a whole.  It is more than ever necessary that people should save, though it is not a very easy thing to do; if we are going to pursue to the utmost our plans for economic development it is vitally important that the savings of the people should be raised to the highest possible level.  If a separate agency looked after the savings' drive there might well be a higher dividend ultimately. I appreciate that there is a national savings body who have done and are doing an excellent job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" /> Perhaps the Minister would consider handing over this activity to this body and so enable the Department to examine other possibilities which I shall mention later and about which some people are not happy.  The technical services for civil aviation and the marine radio services might well be the responsibility of another State Department.  The Minister may have done this already but I am suggesting that he should carry out an intensive scrutiny of the whole organisation of his Department and their duties.  I do not say this in any criticism of the Department which must be one of the most varied in the State.  I am saying that these should be examined in fairness to the citizens in general and to the Minister's officials and the many thousands employed in the Department.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested for many years that the Post Office might be handed over to outside interests, even to a private firm.  I do not mean a mere profit-making company but the public interest might be better served if the Post Office services&mdash;and by this I mean the sub-post offices, the General Post Office and the regional or area post offices which give a great service to the people, that narrow sector of it where one deals with people requiring stamps and the payment of social welfare benefits&mdash;were examined with a view to allocating them to other Departments.  This would be comparatively easy in urban areas where there would be social welfare offices but I realise that in rural areas this would not be quite so easy and that therefore the local post office which has become an institution in these areas in many ways must carry out some of these duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider narrowing the role of the Post Office and establishing either a separate unit such as some of the semi-State companies whose job it would be to run that part of the service.  The actual postal services must be carried on by the State. It is specially desirable that these should be provided by the State.  It might well be that private enterprise would not undertake this great task because there would be no profit in it <Col N="1633" /> but the question is whether the post office sector would be better run by a semi-State concern.  If our airlines are run, not by the Department of Transport and Power but by Aer Lingus, a semi-State body, why should not the postal services or the savings campaign also be run by such a body? Semi-State concerns are doing a fine job.  I do not know what the impact of our EEC membership will be but if we are considering changes we might make we could begin with this Department and see where we could improve these matters and perhaps introduce some radical change in the whole structure.</P>
    <P>The local post offices which I mentioned may be small but this is quite a big matter for the people concerned. In my own area we are pressing for a new sorting office and a new public office.  I pay tribute here to the Minister for the way in which he has tried to clear away legal technicalities. I speak only of one centre but I am sure this could be multiplied by many instances throughout the country.  If we do not have the best possible conditions for staff who must work 24 hours a day in shifts we should not expect the best postal services from them.</P>
    <P>When one stamps a letter and posts it one can be sure that the letter will be delivered to the address for which it is intended.  Behind that there is a tremendous organisation into which the letter is received, passed to the sorting office, sorted and sent on its way.  Perhaps we take it for granted that this service will continue to operate but we have no right to take this for granted if, in some parts of the city or country the staff are required to work in old and unsuitable buildings.  The one to which I refer in Dublin south-east was built at the turn of the century and is still serving the same purpose.  Having visited it and seen conditions there, I urge that it be replaced immediately.  I know the Minister is pressing on with this but if he would further expedite the move it would be appreciated not only by the public but also by the men and women who work there.</P>
    <P>On this estimate one naturally <Col N="1634" /> thinks of the broadcasting service, a service which takes so much abuse during the year in the letter columns of the newspapers and, if one attends meetings frequently one finds that RTE is often under heavy criticism. We can all find some aspect of RTE to criticise but we should try to temper the criticism with the realisation that the authority are providing entertainment on a rather small budget.  It is small when compared with broadcasting budgets in the neighbouring islands but very few people take this into consideration and realise that across the water they can spend £10 million to our £1 million and therefore can put on more expensive or expansive programmes, though not necessarily better programmes than those we are producing.  The neighbouring broadcasting authority this week celebrate the 50th anniversary of their foundation; they have 50 years experience behind them while we have a mere ten or 11 years.  We cannot, therefore, expect the same expertise or professionalism from RTE.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to reiterate a point I make each year about advertising on RTE.  Advertisements for tobacco have been phased out but this has not been done with regard to advertisements for intoxicating liquor. I suppose RTE cannot carry on without revenue from advertisements but I hope that sometime in the future the station will not have to depend on advertisements.</P>
    <P>RTE screen many excellent documentary films, some of them in connection with youth welfare.  These programmes are watched by families but in the commercial breaks there are many advertisements for drink with the emphasis on young people. One advertisement depicts young people arriving at a party; they are welcomed to it because they have a carton of stout or beer.  In the film they are greeted with the words, &ldquo;I knew you would remember to bring the drink&rdquo;.  Many of the advertisements are filmed abroad and often famous footballers are depicted with a drink in their hands.  I do not want to suggest people should not drink, but it is wrong to give the impression <Col N="1635" /> that the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing is to drink and that the young person who does not drink is not &ldquo;with it&rdquo;.  We cannot blame RTE for accepting these advertisements because the advertisers pay large amounts of money and supply their own slides or films but the authority will have to pay more attention to this kind of advertising.  It is doing no good from the national point of view and, so far as most of us are concerned, it is not doing any good for the concerns or firms who use this kind of advertising.</P>
    <P>There is a deep responsibility on people who advertise spirits or alcohol. They must be well aware of the effect their advertisements have on the young or immature.  The time must come when consideration will be given to phasing out these advertisements.  The fact that so much space is bought on the television screen is a tribute to the drawing power of RTE.  Because many of their presentations are excellent they attract a wide audience who are obliged to watch the advertisements during the commercial breaks.  For people in my age group it does not matter too much but it matters very much for young people. It is a source of worry for parents who are aware of the influence of such advertisements on the young.</P>
    <P>Even smokers agree that it is right that advertisements for cigarettes and tobacco have been phased out and RTE deserve credit for taking this step.  Cigarettes harm the lungs but there are greater social implications with regard to advertisements for drink.  There is a continual overemphasis on youth; young people are encouraged to believe that if they want to be <i>blasé</i> and &ldquo;with it&rdquo; they must drink.</P>
    <P>RTE produce some excellent programmes. If they could aim at keeping up the highest standards they would attract advertisements from other firms and would not have to depend on the type of advertising I have mentioned. RTE have not been in existence for long and until the people are prepared to pay sufficient taxation it will be necessary for the authority to continue showing advertisements.  Perhaps some <Col N="1636" /> day we will reach the stage when RTE will not have any kind of advertising. As our society becomes more affluent more television sets will be purchased and the number of viewers will be increased. At the moment much of the good work that is carried out in the schools is undone when the young people are influenced by all the poor type of advertising that is screened on our television.  So long as nobody objects this will continue but parents are worried.  They are our first concern rather than whether RTE are able to pay their way.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the result of the referendum held in connection with the retention and upgrading of Mallow County Hospital, Cork as a surgical unit; and, if so, if he is prepared to meet the expressed wishes of the overwhelming majority of the people of the area in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen press reports of the results of an unofficial opinion poll in north Cork in relation to Mallow Hospital.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been no suggestion of the discontinuance of the use of the Mallow Hospital. If there were any unfounded doubts about this they should have been removed by the decision to carry out significant building works there-works which are now in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue which arises is the nature of the patient care services which would be appropriate in the future. This is a problem of the organisation of health care services on an effective and rational basis across the board. It is one that exercises health administration in every country.  The Oireachtas, through the enactment of the Health Act, 1970, and the approval of regulations made under that Act, has agreed to the setting-up of a new structure of health services administration <Col N="1639" /> which has the reorganisation and improvement of our services as a priority task.  One of the main implications in this is that the services should be looked at as a whole and that development should be on a fully co-ordinated basis.</P>
    <P>Changes in needs coupled with advances in medicine emphasise the necessity to make adjustments in structures and functions to do a better job.  The use of simplistic and emotive terms like &ldquo;up-grading&rdquo; and &ldquo;downgrading&rdquo; contributes nothing to the attainment of this objective&mdash;it serves simply to frustrate efforts to provide the kind of safe effective services which the people need.  For example, if surgery ceases in a hospital and the maternity service is expanded while, at the same time, general practitioners in the area can look after patients needing medical treatment, and patients return from a surgical hospital for convalescence this is not in my view &ldquo;down-grading&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the case of Mallow Hospital, I have made it clear that no immediate change is proposed in the services provided there.  I understand that a permanent surgeon is appointed and is due to take up duty in February.  The new bodies concerned, the Cork Regional Hospital Board and Comhairle na nOspidéal will have an opportunity to go fully into the question of the future role of the hospital before any question of a change in any aspect of that role is decided on.  I do not propose to take any action affecting the role of the hospital pending consideration of the matter by these bodies.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should know that there is a vacancy for a <Col N="1640" /> temporary county surgeon which has been advertised by the Southern Health Board.  Quite frequently when a new surgeon is appointed he does not take up duty in the hospital before a certain date, and temporary surgeons have to be appointed.  In this case the Southern Health Board made approaches to six surgeons in Cork city to do temporary service in Mallow pending the coming into office of a permanent surgeon on the 15th February.  They failed to secure agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy presumably has in mind is the extension of out-patient facilities and the improvement of the physical lay-out where this is required.  I have constantly stressed the importance of developing our consultant out-patient services both in regard to the range of such services and their ready and convenient accessibility to the community. This I regard as a key development in achieving a real improvement in the services for patients who need to be referred for consultant opinion.  It is also one of great economic significance in that it will help to reduce the demands on acute in-patient care in two ways; first, by ensuring that those patients whose treatment can be undertaken outside hospital are so treated and, secondly, by reducing patient time in hospital through carrying out appropriate investigations before the patient is admitted.  Every consultant-staffed hospital has out-patient facilities but in many cases these need to be developed.  I am satisfied that the health boards in their consideration of the services in their areas will be fully conscious of the need to take special account of out-patient needs.  A number of specific proposals for the improvement of these facilities are being developed in association with my Department in hospitals distributed over six of the eight health board areas.</P>

      <P>Statistics showing the exact number of mentally handicapped persons are not available in this country, or, indeed any other country.  The Commission of Inquiry on Mental Handicap which reported in 1965 examined the question of statistics and recommended practical targets for the development of services by estimating the numbers likely to be in need of, and presenting for services.  The commission recommended that services, either on in-patient or out-patient basis, should be provided for 7,850 children and 9,300 adults.  Accurate information regarding the numbers of physically handicapped persons in this country is not available.  The number of persons in receipt of disabled persons maintenance allowances on 31st March, 1972, was 23,658.  It is estimated that 16,000 of these are physically disabled.  The disabled persons maintenance allowances are payable in respect of disabilities, which include injury, disease, congenital physical or mental illness or defect, which have continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for at least one year.  They are not payable to persons with adequate means, children under 16 years or those in institutions.</P>

I have not been able to secure the finances for it and I regarded other improvements in the health services as being of greater priority.  It would cost £1,200,000 to do what the Deputy suggests.  It is something I would like to do and will do at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to state the percentage increase in the numbers treated for alcoholism during the period mentioned in the question. I have, however, information regarding the percentage increase in admissions to mental hospitals for alcoholism and alcoholic psychosis during the period 1966-1970, when the percentage rise was 75.5 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very concerned with the increasing incidence of alcoholism and heavy drinking.  Treatment for alcoholics is already provided in all mental hospitals.  In addition, I have had the leaflet &ldquo;What sort of a drinker are you?&rdquo; distributed as widely as possible. I have arranged for a series of seminars covering the abuse of alcohol and drugs for post-primary teachers.  I have encouraged health boards to appoint psychiatric social workers who will specialise in the problem of alcoholism <Col N="1646" /> and a number of such workers have already been employed.</P>
    <P>A while ago, I requested the Irish National Council on Alcoholism to undertake a survey among interested organisations and individuals with a view to formulating recommendations on the further steps which might be taken to deal with this problem.  The council has completed its survey and is now in the process of finalising its recommendations which I hope to receive shortly.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis referred to is, in the main, section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, and the Unemployment Assistance (Calculation of Means) Regulations, 1934, made thereunder.  That section was amended on several occasions by subsequent enactments to exclude further particular items of income from the assessment of means.  Section 15 (1) of the Children's Allowances Act, 1944, so excluded children's allowances. Section 8 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1965, modified section 13 of the 1933 Act by introducing the valuation system of means assessment in relation to income from land in the congested areas.</P>
      <P>The things which constitute the means of a person by virtue of these various legislative provisions are set out in my Department's explanatory leaflet U.A. 19 which is available free from the Department or at any employment exchange or office and a copy of which I am sending to the Deputy.</P>

Surely that position should be altered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together. Section 13 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, as amended, sets out the things which shall be deemed to constitute the means of a person in the calculation of means for unemployment assistance purposes. Among these things is all cash income, subject to certain specified exceptions, which the person may reasonably expect to receive in the succeeding 12 months, including any such income he may expect to receive as head of the household whether as contributions to the expenses of the household or otherwise.  One item of cash income which is specifically excluded from the calculation is &ldquo;any moneys received by way of home assistance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Disabled person's maintenance allowance, which is essentially a non-contributory <Col N="1654" /> pension, is not an excluded item of cash income.  Where this allowance is paid to an applicant's wife, as in the Roscommon case referred to, it must therefore be reckoned as part of the income of the head of the household.</P>
    <P>I should point out that an allowance in respect of his wife is already included in the weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable to a married man.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he has received representations from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions concerning the position of widows who are entitled to contributory widow's pensions and who take up employment and subsequently become unemployed; and if he will elaborate on the modification of the principle adopted by his Department that only one type of benefit should be paid to a claimant in respect of those cases and the provision whereby in such cases 50 per cent of unemployment benefit is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. J. Brennan Mr. J. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that correspondence is continuing between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and my Department concerning the position of contributory widow pensioners in the scheme of unemployment insurance.  It is a basic principle of schemes of social insurance that only one type of benefit should be paid to a claimant in respect of any period even though more than one of the contingencies for which benefit is provided has arisen in that period in the particular case.  This principle was, for instance, part of the framework of the Beveridge Plan in Britain and is in operation under the National Insurance Scheme there and in Northern Ireland. In this country, however, the principle has been substantially modified in its application to widows by the Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefits) Regulations, 1953 to 1972, under which unemployment benefit, or disability benefit, at half the appropriate personal rate can be paid in addition to widow's contributory pension.  As a result, the total income from social insurance <Col N="1655" /> sources of a widow pensioner without dependants who becomes eligible for unemployment benefit is considerably more than that of a single man, widower or single woman.  In view of this, it is rather surprising that the concession granted in favour of widows should be regarded as, in any sense, a source of grievance.</P>
      <P>The situation of widows under the existing provisions would, it is presumed, be comprehended by the terms of reference of the Commission on the Status of Women, but pending the issue of the commission's final report it would not be proper to speculate on what recommendations, if any, may emerge.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Value-added tax at the rate 5.26 per cent applies to imports of live animals in the same way as a Customs duty. In the case of imports of horses&mdash; and also cattle, sheep and pigs&mdash;the tax is chargeable on 19.20 per cent of the value, making the effective rate of tax 1 per cent.</P>
      <P>There are provisions under Customs law for the temporary importation of goods free of duty in certain circumstances. These apply to VAT also and, in addition, special arrangements have been made to exempt from tax live animals temporarily imported for breeding or racing.  The Revenue Commissioners have arranged discussions with representatives of the bloodstock industry to investigate any problems which may still exist and to consider whether any further special arrangements may be called for.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1668" /> As I explained to the Dáil on a number of occasions, the question has been raised as to whether the economic and social returns from arterial drainage are sufficient to justify the heavy capital investment necessary for the service.  With a view to reaching a conclusion, a full cost/benefit study of arterial drainage as administered at present has been put in hand.  This study is making good progress and it is hoped the result will be available next year.  In the meantime consideration of a number of drainage proposals, including the Lee (Tralee), the Luing (Boyle catchment) River, and the Fergus is being suspended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that expenditure was declining before the cost/benefit survey was put in hands. The point is we have now to find out exactly what return we are getting for the investment.  We will know that next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what the Deputy says about the large size and great conversion rate of the Chianina breed but I am sure the Deputy will also be aware that in recent times we have put a large number of foreign breeds of cattle through our limited quarantine accommodation. An assessment of the Chianina breed has, in fact, been carried out by officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries fairly recently and at this stage it is not possible to say when, or if ever, importation of Chianina cattle would be contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The assessment that has been done was purely for internal departmental purposes, I think, and before any decision to import Chianina cattle would be made a great deal more consideration would have to be given to the qualities of the animal and the advantages that might be available from its importation.  For instance, the question of its uses for cross-breeding would have to be examined and its suitability for the type of cattle husbandry we have here. <Col N="1673" /> As the Deputy knows, it is a pretty voracious eater and in our cattle husbandry conditions Chianina cattle would possibly not be the best type.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the best way to confirm this or otherwise is, as the question suggests, to import for experimental purposes and that these internal reports, to which he refers are not based on performance in Irish conditions?  The question merely asks for importation for experimental purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must realise that in order to get a real assessment of the qualities of this particular breed, as in the case of any other breed, you really need a fairly extensive field trial and in order to get that you must be a couple of generations away from the original importation.  For the moment the practical difficulties are almost insurmountable. The importation of Austrian and various French breeds and some English breeds also has taxed the capacity of the quarantine facilities and I think that will continue to be the case for some time.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 14, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;subject to subsection (2) of this section&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage we indicated our serious dissatisfaction with the draftsmanship of section 2 which confused the regulations of the Communities and the directives and other decisions or acts of the Communities.  As has been pointed out, regulations of the Communities are binding <i>ab initio</i> without further enactment on the part of member States but directives and other acts are not necessarily part of the domestic law of member States unless and until member States adopt them by means of their own enactments. There is immense discretion left to the individual States to determine <Col N="1686" /> the manner in which decisions and directives are to be implemented.</P>
    <P>It is our view that this Bill, as drafted, is unconstitutional and we give a warning to the Government that if they proceed to ignore the justified complaints of people in this House and elsewhere about their conduct they will find themselves facing a constitutional action that could jeopardise this country's involvement in its obligations in the European Community as from 1st January, 1973.</P>
    <P>The Referendum Bill was amended in this House on the proposition of Fine Gael.  It is clear to us now that this Bill has been drafted by the Government without regard to the amendment that was made in this House, an amendment that was subsequently adopted by the people in the referendum.  This Bill would be constitutional if it were introduced under the Referendum Bill as introduced, because this Bill would be an act consequent on membership.  The Fine Gael amendment was that laws and other acts of the Community which were necessitated by membership of the Community would not be invalid by reason of certain provisions in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Government have a choice of ways in which to implement the directives and decisions of the Community. Article 15 of the Constitution provides:</P>
    <P>The sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas: no other legislative authority has power to make the laws for the State.</P>
    <P>There is a qualification:</P>
    <P>Provision may, however, be made by law for the creation or recognition of subordinate legislatures and for the powers and functions of these legislatures.</P>
    <P>It is clearly legislatures which have this delegated power, not individual Ministers.  We will assume for the purposes of this argument that it is valid under our law for Ministers to make regulations so long as they are given that delegated power by this Parliament; if there is that delegated power and there is also a choice of making <Col N="1687" /> laws by legislation or regulation, we believe that the Constitution imposes a clear obligation to make those laws by legislation and not by ministerial decree.</P>
    <P>What the Minister is seeking here is not necessitated by membership of the Community.  The Government have made a choice to legislate in future by ministerial decree without consultation with this House, without involving either House of the Oireachtas, and without fulfilling the clear obligation in the Constitution to legislate in public.  The Constitution emphatically requires that proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad be in public unless they should otherwise decide for some special reason, and then it requiries a vote of two-thirds of the Members in order to meet in private.</P>
    <P>We must legislate in public.  We must legislate according to our Constitution. That could be qualified if we were under an obligation within the European Community to proceed in another way.  We are not obliged by membership of the European Community to translate directives and regulations into law by means of ministerial regulation. When it is open to us to legislate by means of a Bill in the Dáil and Seanad we have a clear, emphatic and inescapable duty to legislate in that way, and in no other way.</P>
    <P>This Bill, clumsily thrown together, purporting to take away the legislative power of this House, purporting to negative the people's right to legislate, the people's right to criticise Government proposals, is an unconstitutional Bill.  Apart from the fact that it is unconstitutional, it offends against every concept of democracy.  It is not necessitated by obligations to the Community. The Minister acknowledged that on Second and Third Stages.  He said the mere fact that Ministers are being given power to legislate by means of decree does not mean that Ministers will necessarily do that, and that they may from time to time consider it desirable to introduce legislation in the House rather than to translate enactments of the Community into our law by means of ministerial regulation.</P>
    <P>That is an exercise of choice.  The fact that the Minister acknowledges <Col N="1688" /> that it is not necessary to proceed by means of regulation clearly proves that the Bill as introduced, and now on Report Stage, is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.  The Minister is walking a very dangerous tight rope which could get the country and the various steps necessary to fulfil our obligations in Europe into very serious trouble indeed.</P>
    <P>We are bound by the decisions of Committee Stage.  We do not believe that the Bill should be left as it is, but we are bound by the votes taken on the previous stage.  Therefore, we had to table our amendment in a way which takes account of the decisions already taken.  Accepting that discipline, we have redrafted section 2 so as to separate directives of the Community from regulations of the Community.  We have done that in amendment No. 2 by providing that the regulations shall be binding on the State and shall be part of the domestic law, and that directives shall not be part of the domestic law or enforcible within the State until regulations in relation to them are made under section 3 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>That is the true position.  It is suggested in the original section that a directive or a decision is to have the same force and the same effect as a regulation of the Community.  That is not so.  A directive or a decision is not enforcible, and will not be enforcible until we either legislate to make it enforcible, or the Minister makes an Irish regulation making it enforcible.  It is quite wrong to recite in section 2 that these things are part of the domestic law.  They are not part of the domestic law until they have been translated into our domestic law by means of ministerial regulations, or a Bill in this House.</P>
    <P>What we are doing does not in any way take from the force, we believe the evil force, and intention of the section.  At least it is tidier legislation and I say, with all due respect to the draftsmen who advise the Government, that it is better draftsmanship to identify the difference between regulations of the Community and directives, decisions and any other acts or enactments.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Leary has burned them in a good cause because obviously he has a clear grasp of what is in sections 2 and 3.  The Fine Gael suggestion that the Bill is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution is for the courts to decide.  The amendment put down by Fine Gael proposes to us the question of ministerial regulations and, if Deputy Ryan is correct, that, too, would be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.</P>

      <P>For the Deputy to stand up and say that Fianna Fáil are quite wrong and that they are bringing in something contrary to the Constitution, and then to propose an amendment which does exactly the same thing, is an exercise in which we should not indulge.  If it is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution when we put it down, it will be <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution when Fine Gael put it down. If Deputy Ryan is right it has been <Col N="1690" /><i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution since it was enacted because every year, under legislation, Ministers bring in up to 350 regulations and under this we will have about 20 a year.  Therefore, all legislation which gave rise to Ministers making regulations, delegated legislation, was wrong.  If Fine Gael make that point, there is an onus on them, not only to interfere with the attempts we are making to keep up with our commitments, and the advantages of membership but also to follow up all the other legislation which, by their definition, is <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Let me get back to what Deputy O'Leary and I see clearly.  I think the amendment is based on an unfounded assumption that regulations, and only regulations, are directly applicable.  I spoke about this on Committee Stage. The second part of the assumption is that provisions of the treaties and acts cannot be part of our domestic law without being directly applicable.  There is a broad classification.  Regulations are directly applicable but although they are directly applicable many aspects of regulations may at times require ancillary legislation in one of the countries of the Community to make them effective.  On the other hand, directives in principle are applied only when the country involved makes its own legislation.  Some parts of some directives have direct application and it is with this extra knowledge that the draftsman drafted section 2 and consequently section 3.  I do not think it would be possible, taking those facts and I thought the House understood this from me the last night, to legislate otherwise than as the draftsman has done.  I am quite satisfied that this does what we want done, which is just to be able to undertake the onus on us to apply the Act of Accession here.</P>
      <P>We dealt with this on Committee Stage.  This difference exists in our thinking.  For simplicity we all spoke of regulations being directly applicable and the others needing legislation, but there is a blurring, there are areas of grey.  This proposed draft in the Bill does cover any onus on us to implement the Treaties of Accession and the Act of Accession.  I think it should stand in that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate, particularly on Committee Stage, developed into an attempt to define directives in a legal sense as something distinct from regulations of the Community and to build a theory on the idea that the directives were, so to speak, legally unborn children.  I think there is a lack of appreciation of what we really have here.  In so far as we are adopting the legislation of the European Community, through its organs the Council of Ministers and the Commission, we are accepting their acts as binding legislation here.  Deputy FitzGerald, on Committee Stage, I think agreed with me that a directive is as much an act as a regulation, that the distinction is that in the case of one you have the thing neatly defined and directly applicable, in the case of the other it is incomplete in the sense that to secure local enforcibility something has to be done locally.  This is all common case but that does not make a directive any less an act or any less a proper subject matter for the legislation as is in that section.</P>
      <P>We have many times in this House enacted legislation that needed perfection by ministerial order and regulations. Many of us have, indeed, complained that it was a technique too easily availed of.  Without going into detail I can recollect cases where the actual implementation of the Act of Parliament we passed here depended on the making of an order by the Minister in a particular area or even the bringing into action of a part of an Act.  It would not be difficult to find on the record of the House an Act with a section which reads something like this:</P>
      <P>This part of the Act will come into effect on the day prescribed by regulation.</P>
      <P>Will anybody argue that that Act of Parliament is any less an Act of Parliament than an Act that says definitely:</P>
      <P>On blank day of blank such-and-such will happen</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>and does it completely in the one Act? No.  What has happened here is that with the exigencies of the modern world, parliaments have and this Parliament has evolved a method of getting <Col N="1692" /> over the difficulty of not being able to make a thing precisely effective in detail at a particular point by delegating the power of legislation to another agent.  The point I want to make is that an Act of Parliament requiring implementation by regulation is no less an Act of Parliament than any other Act because of that reason.</P>
    <P>Let us apply this reasoning to the Common Market.  This is not a question for scoring points and I can appreciate the argument that is being adduced from the other side although I cannot subscribe to it.  I would ask Deputy Ryan to look at this approach. Is a directive legislation or not?  If a directive from the Common Market were merely the expression of a wish or was to be construed on a take-it or leave-it basis, if it were merely an exhortation, then I would subscribe to the views propounded from the other side but if a directive is an Act and is, in effect, a piece of legislation, then I find myself completely on the Minister's side.  I believe that that is precisely what we are dealing with. We are dealing with an Act which is none the less an Act by reason of the fact that to give it effect something further must be done.  Say a directive was issued which would have conveyed some rights on somebody after implementation and say a Minister failed to implement it with regulation, is that to be construed as meaning that the Act has failed?  How would a court look at this?  In my submission a court would look at it this way, that the person had the rights by the very fact of the directive but that his claim failed because of the failure of somebody else down the line.</P>
    <P>This has happened in the courts in regard to domestic regulations where, for want of doing something perfectly, a person would have a claim under an Act but for want of a regulation or the proper doing of a regulation his claim failed.  In the failure of that claim he would be told by the court that he had better go and look to the person who failed, that there was no doubt about the basic law in his case.  The same kind of thing applies here.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are unduly confusing <Col N="1693" /> ourselves with the difference between directives and regulations.  We are trying to distinguish something that is one in its essence through the fact that in the practical application there is a vast difference.  I am sure Deputy Ryan will agree that the problems of drafting legislation of this nature are very great.  I share the view that he has and that everyone in Opposition has, perhaps more acutely than those behind the Government, of the desirability wherever possible to make legislation explicit in this House and to avoid administrative legislation through regulation as far as possible.  In the case of this Bill and what is involved, having regard to the fact that regulations will have to be made under certain situations in the future, and that a great deal of legislation has to be adopted and that you have to provide for legislation that will be made which you will adopt as it is, namely, commission regulations, I still find myself with the same view which I expressed on Committee Stage.  This Bill reflects great care and thought in its drafting. I think I made that remark even before the controversy about the form of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the House that it is not practical to have a completely analytical Bill in this case and if you are not going to have a completely analytical Bill this type of Bill is the better.  One could run the risk of falling between two stools in attempting to half do the job by overdoing the detail in one area and leaving the rest open.  This is too serious a matter to think of scoring points in debate. I fully appreciate the points that have been made on the opposite side. Therefore, I believe I should give my reasons why I believe the Minister should keep this Bill in the form it is in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has admitted that the bulk of directives are not framed to be directly applicable in the State.  They are not framed in a way that they can be immediately enforced in the State after they have been enacted by the Council of Ministers of the EEC.  In other words, they are framed in such a way that it is <Col N="1694" /> required of the national State to which they apply to introduce legislation or regulations to give them full effect.</P>
      <P>There are many directives which give the national State a very wide range of choice as to the way in which it may implement them.  On Committee Stage I drew attention to a directive in relation to assistance for people keeping farm accounts.  The Government are free under the terms of this directive to apply it or not apply it in particular parts of the country.  It goes as far as that.  Therefore, section 2 says that, existing and future acts adopted by the institutions of the Communities&mdash;that includes directives&mdash;shall be part of the domestic law of the State under the conditions laid down in those treaties.</P>
      <P>You cannot simply make these directives immediately part of the domestic law of the State because they are not framed immediately to become part of the domestic law of the State.  It would be impossible to enforce them.  If you had a man who was seeking a premium for keeping farm accounts and he sought to enforce this directive, which had not had the necessary regulations made by the State&mdash;it is quite possible it might not make the necessary regulations&mdash; he could not enforce it because he would not know whether or not they would have been, if the State had made regulations, applicable in his particular area.  In this case you would have a confusing legal situation.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to make these directives part of the domestic law regardless of whether any implementing regulations are made.  As such it goes further than the Minister is permitted to go by the constitutional amendment which was made on 10th May last.  That constitutional amendment enables the Government to enact measures which are necessitated by the obligations of the Community.  The Government are not necessitated by the obligations of the Community to make those directives, which are not intended to be directly applicable in the State, regardless of whether or not they make them directly applicable in the State without consequent national legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has contended that <Col N="1695" /> this is qualified by the phrase &ldquo;under the conditions laid down in those treaties&rdquo;, that that somehow lets us &ldquo;off the hook&rdquo; and that the directives do not become part of the domestic law because those treaties do not require them to become part of the domestic law.  I doubt this because those treaties are framed as documents in international law and are not framed, as far as I can see, as documents for implementation domestically within the Irish courts.  It is fair to say that there is considerable doubt whether the amendment which Fine Gael have proposed will clear up the doubt and that in the interests of clarity, if nothing else, the Minister should accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested that an answer to the Fine Gael argument was that if Fine Gael were right then this State has often done wrong in the past.  That is possible.  Again and again it is found after years of malpractice that a particular way of doing things is unconstitutional.  I anticipated the Minister's argument where he said that Fine Gael were suggesting something&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the precision of the Minister's language.  Perhaps I was giving too free a translation but it is possible that the State has been wrong in the past in giving this delegated power of legislation to Ministers. The Constitution does not entertain the idea.  It says that delegated power of legislation may be given to subordinate legislatures.  The other point that the Minister made, and which I anticipated, was that if the Fine Gael argument is right the amendment is as illegal as is the Government Bill but we are caught by the decisions of this House on Committee Stage.  We endeavoured to prevent the House from making a wrong decision on that Stage but we were overruled by a Fianna Fáil majority.  The rules of the House do not permit us to re-table the amendment which would avoid this wrongdoing.  While we <Col N="1696" /> believe that it can be argued and proved that the Government are doing wrong we ask them at least to do it with some clarity and precision so that the very distinct difference between a Community regulation and a Community directive will be recognised in our legislation. I will produce further evidence of the unconstitutionality of this Bill and remind the Minister that on the Second Stage also we endeavoured to have amendments passed which would have prevented this illegality.</P>
      <P>Article 17.2 of the Constitution states that:</P>
      <P>...no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to Dáil Éireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Minister has sought power to impose taxation by regulation.  On Committee Stage he refused our amendment to withhold that power and keep it in Dáil Éireann.  Therefore, although the Government are seeking power today to impose taxation by regulation they cannot do it.  The obligations of the EEC do not require that that be done by ministerial regulation.  It is not necessitated by membership of the Community and neither is it something that is covered by the authority conferred by the people in the plebiscite. It is beyond what is necessitated and that is the emphasis that we are putting before the House.  If the Government had not been so indifferent to the democratic process, if they had not been so hungry for power, irrespective of the blessing and approval of the Oireachtas, they would not be walking themselves and the State into this constitutional mess.</P>
      <P>Again, in Article 15.5 the Constitution provides that:</P>
      <P>The Oireachtas shall not declare acts to be infringements of the law which were not so at the date of their commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment on Committee Stage, which was defeated by Government vote also, would have ensured that no ministerial regulation would be made which would declare an act to be an <Col N="1697" /> infringement of the law which was not so on the date of its commission but we were informed that the obligations of the Community require that that amendment would not be acceptable. Here again there is a clear conflict between the obligations of the Community and our own Constitution.  We accept that some of them are inevitable and that some of them are covered by the decision of the people in the referendum.  But the Government have gone far beyond the authority given and they are in the process of cutting a stick with which to beat themselves and the institutions of this State.</P>
    <P>I accept the very reasoned arguments put forward by Deputy de Valera and I would like to reply in the same vein as that in which he submitted his views.  He wished to know whether a directive was binding on this State. I say it is.  We have provided for that in our amendment because section 2 would provide that the Treaties governing the European Communities and the existing and future acts adopted by the institutions of the Community shall be binding on the State.  That covers the directives and it is accepting as an obligation on the State the implementation of the directives, but it is wrong to go on to say after that, as the section says, that on that account they are there and then part of the domestic law.  We say they become part of the domestic law only when they are enforcible in law.  Our amendment is not in conflict with the intention of <Col N="1698" /> the section but it certainly is much better draftsmanship.</P>
    <P>The directives could be regarded as being in the nature of discretionary trusts.  They create a trust.  They impose an obligation on the trustees&mdash; the trustees are the Government and the Parliament of Ireland&mdash;but it is left to the trustees to exercise their discretion within the obligations created.  Our amendment identifies more neatly the area of discretionary trust from the area of unavoidable and immediate obligation. Apart from the fact that directives create obligations they are also in the nature of enabling legislation. The directives of the Community create obligations they are also in the nature of enabling legislation. make orders but all these arguments, even the excellent arguments of Deputy de Valera, tend to support us on this and point to the need to distinguish between the regulations of the Community on the one hand and the directives, decisions and other acts on the other.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the Minister's anxiety to have this Bill put through the House as quickly as possible but I would hope that even at this late stage he might give an indication that he is prepared to consider getting the advice of the draftsman and, perhaps, introducing an amendment in the Seanad that would cover these points. If we are not given that assurance we shall have to press the amendment.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 3 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 15, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) All draft EEC regulations and directives laid by the Commission of the Communities before the Council of Ministers of the Communities shall, as soon as may be after they are issued, be laid on the table of both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Government accompanied by such explanations as are deemed necessary by the Minister.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment goes a short way along the road we were seeking to go on Committee Stage of this Bill in regard to ensuring that Deputies, Senators and public representatives generally should have an opportunity of scrutinising draft EEC legislation prior to that legislation becoming the settled policy of the Community, because we believe that the best influence can be exerted by this House if that opportunity is afforded to it prior to a decision being taken by the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very little point in having debates in this House on matters which are already agreed at Community level.  What we believe should be <Col N="1701" /> done is to give this House an opportunity to influence the stand taken by the Irish members of the European Parliament and, most important of all, by the Irish members of the Council of Ministers, when these matters come for decision before them.  We believe that is an important element in the democratisation of the Community decision-making procedures. This amendment goes a short way in this direction.  It does not go as far as I would like it to because the other steps along the road have already been ruled out by the vote of the Fianna Fáil Party in this House.  That party did not want to see proper procedures available to Deputies for advising their Minister on whatever line he should take in regard to EEC legislation coming for decision before him at the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>This amendment is one which the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting despite the difficulties he mentioned in relation to the other amendments we had along the same general lines.  Unfortunately, the amendments does no more than put Members of the House on notice of the existence of the proposals which are coming up for decision.  It also gives the Minister an opportunity of accompanying this notice with a translation of the decisions which will be deposited in the Library in both official languages.  It is important to point out that, in the terms of this amendment, these should be made available in the Irish language also.  This also gives the Minister an opportunity of placing, with the actual deposit of the draft regulations, an explanation of the implications for Ireland, thereby giving Members information as to how regulations will affect our country, and assistance as to how to analyse them. This should help them to make submissions to the Minister and to communicate with their constituents who may be concerned about the implications of a particular directive.</P>
    <P>All this information should be laid before the House and should be in the Library.  It is important that this should be done.  I am not sure to what extent the fact that a regulation is laid before the House entitles Members to <Col N="1702" /> seek a discussion on it.  I do not know whether there is such a right.  If there is such right, that is something which would be very desirable.  It would be desirable if Members could, when a draft directive is laid down, as they can when regulations are laid before the House, discuss it.  Prior to a decision being taken is there an opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If directives are laid before the House that gives an opportunity to Deputies to be aware of what is happening and to communicate to their constituents the contents of these regulations, accompanied by whatever explanation the Government wish to give and thereby to get opinions back from their constituents which they can then submit privately to the Minister. No other procedure is provided for, unfortunately.  This is something which the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting.  If the Minister refuses to accept it, I just cannot understand why he should do so.  If the Minister refuses to inform the House officially of proposals coming before the Council of Ministers, he is intending to keep the House completely in the dark as to what is going on in the EEC and to arrogate to himself as a member of the Council of Ministers and to the small number who are members of the European Parliament, the opportunity to participate in the knowledge of the proposals coming from the Commission for decision.  I hope that the Minister will accept this small amendment to the Bill as a very small measure of recognition of the role of this House in assisting him and Members of the European Parliament in analysing, for constituents all over the country, the effect of proposals coming from the Commission and as yet undecided by the Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment moved by Deputy Bruton appears to be most reasonable.  I fail to see any reason why the Minister for Foreign Affairs should not accept it.  The Minister has not indicated yet whether he will accept it or not.  Are we foolish to presume that he will not accept it? If I thought that the Minister was not prepared to accept this amendment, I would make the allegation that in this Bill an effort is being made, most successfully, to blindfold and gag this House by withholding information from Deputies about regulations and directives and thereby keeping them in the dark.  When the Members of this House are kept in the dark it means that they are not in a position to enlighten their constituents.</P>
      <P>Yesterday it was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> that there has been a drastic reduction in the number of farmers in France since 1955 and if there are regulations or directives which will lead to a reduction of landowners in my constituency.  I should like to know about them because I am the link between the agricultural community in my constituency and this House.  If there is a breakdown between this House and Brussels, by what means can the Irish people extract the information they require?  This Bill is a most dangerous Bill if the safeguards embodies in the amendment are not inserted.</P>
      <P>The amendment is most reasonable. It asks that:</P>
      <P>All draft EEC regulations and directives laid by the Commission of the Communities before the Council of Ministers of the Communities shall, as soon as may be after they are issued, be laid on the table of both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Government accompanied by such explanations as are deemed necessary by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I presume that what is meant by the words &ldquo;accompanied by such explanations as are deemed necessary by the Minister&rdquo; is that there would be a memo attached to every regulation and directive similar to the explanatory memorandum that accompanies a Bill when it is circulated to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1704" /> I would be prepared to go further than Deputy Bruton has proposed in his amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will not exceed what is permitted on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not.  In addition to what is suggested in the amendment, that regulations and directives be laid on the table of both Houses, I would suggest that they should be circulated to Members of this House so that they might be in a position to study such directives and regulations as would have an important effect on the economic, political and social life of the people.</P>
      <P>Unless the amendment is accepted, this House will have lost its teeth. The only thing I regret is that those who realise what is involved now did not realise it before 10th May last. This Parliament will become a pawn and a tool for Brussels.  It is only by acceptance of the amendment that Members of this House would be able to know what is going on.  The need for such an amendment is urgent.  On 10th May last the Irish voters gave the Government a blank cheque so far as the powers of their Parliament was concerned.  Now we have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government assisting Brussels in the concealment of their business.  This is an effort to hide what is going on, to keep directives and regulations from public representatives so that they cannot be held responsible, in the case of agriculture, for instance, for the diminution in the number of farmers in rural Ireland, and will not be in a position to point to any regulation or directive that may have a serious effect on the industrial life of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If regulations and directives are made in Brussels and if only the select few who will represent us there are aware of these regulations and directives which may wreck Irish industries and render Irish workers unemployed, this House will be completely powerless to do anything about them or even to express an opinion.  If the regulations and directives are not laid <Col N="1705" /> before the House Deputies will not have an opportunity to express an opinion.  Unless Deputies can study the regulations and directives before they are made they will be unable to judge their effect on our own community.</P>
    <P>What greater disrespect can there be for Parliament than the suggestion that Parliament does not warrant the confidence of Brussels and that Parliament will not be given the facilities reasonably asked for in the amendment? Are there underhand activities that have not been disclosed?  The Irish people and the Danish people have voted democratically to enter the EEC.  In Britain, the people did not get the chance to do so.  Before the referendum the people were warned that Parliament would become a shadowy version of an urban district council so far as its functions <i>vis-à-vis</i> the EEC would be concerned. Thousands of people did not heed that warning.  The necessity for this amendment enlightens the people in this regard.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept the amendment, Members of Parliament will have no prior knowledge of regulations and directives made in Brussels and will not be able to judge their effect on our economy and on the social conditions of their constituents.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister for Foreign Affairs will satisfy the House as to his reasons for refusing to accept a reasonable amendment such as this.  Is one of the reasons that because of the difficult years ahead the Government do not want Parliament to be as well informed as they are, that there is a desire to make laws, directives and regulations and to leave Parliament, which was once sovereign, in total darkness and ignorance?  Is it that those associated with the Council of Ministers and the Commission are afraid of the criticism of Parliament?  Is it that they are afraid of expressions of Parliamentary opinion on certain of their works.  Certainly, as time goes on, they may well be ashamed of the economic consequences that flow from their directives and decisions.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out, this is a most dangerous Bill without a subsection of this kind and, even if the Minister <Col N="1706" /> accepts this amendment, it will not improve the Bill to any great extent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the Bill now.  We can deal only with the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted, both Houses of the Oireachtas will at least have to be provided with all essential information. What objection has the Minister to facilitating Parliament with this kind of information?  Is it that 90 per cent of the work in Brussels will be done behind closed doors?  If this amendment is not accepted, there will be people elsewhere legislating in the dark for this country.  We want legislation in the full light of day, legislation carefully studied and examined.  Parliament is being flouted.  If this amendment is not accepted, it will mean that laws will be enacted elsewhere which will affect us, laws relating to the economic and social life of the Irish people.  Our voice in Brussels will not be sufficiently loud to change those laws.  We were told in the referendum campaign that it would be better for us to be there so that Ireland's position, economically and socially, could be improved.  It was suggested we might be able to adapt European legislation to suit our needs. The people fell for that.  We are almost there now and we find that the voice of our representatives will be a feeble voice.  We find that this Parliament will not get the regulations and the directives so that Parliament can scrutinise and examine them.</P>
      <P>Is it the intention to sell out completely to the foreigners?  The bargain has been sealed.  I regard myself as good a European as the next, but I am an Irishman first, and my main interest is to ensure that this Parliament will function smoothly within the EEC.  I do not want to see in the EEC the rich growing richer and the poor growing poorer.  The EEC is a rich man's society and this society intends to keep the people in the dark. The Fianna Fáil Party and the Fianna Fáil Government are giving to the rich European's club the right to do things behind closed doors and the right to deny public representatives information as to what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I charge the Minister with being <Col N="1707" /> responsible for depriving this House of a right vested in Parliamentary institutions in every democracy.  He will have to be compelled to place regulations and directives in the Library of this House so that Members of this Parliament will know what is going on and, not alone Members of this Parliament, but vocational organisations, farming organisations, trade unions and all the other bodies which will be vitally interested in these directives and regulations.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that regulations and directives could be made in Brussels which would seriously affect the trade union movement here?  Those associated with the trade union movement in Germany and on the Continent generally do not see eye to eye with those associated with the trade union movement in Britain and in this country. Even the very existence of the trade union movement here may be affected.  God help the working classes here since 1913 had there not been a strong trade union movement.  Now there is the possibility that steps will be taken behind closed doors in Brussels to render ineffective the functions of trade unions both here and in Britain.  Is it not correct that there was a long and serious discussion behind closed doors in Brussels as to what drastic steps could be taken against the trade union movement in both France and Italy.  Assuming the Brussels bureaucrats decide, in their wisdom, to take the teeth out of the trade union movement in all member countries, surely we are entitled to see in advance the directives and regulations being considered in Brussels in relation to the rights and functions of trade unions.  No decision was taken on the occasion to which I have referred.  No regulation was made.  No directive was given about silencing the trade unions in Italy and France.  Now that they are strengthened by the accession of Ireland and the conservative element and the Heath atmosphere and all resources pooled, another attempt may be made on the trade union movement in Europe.  If such an attempt, which might affect the livelihood of every trade unionist in Ireland, <Col N="1708" /> is made the House will be kept in complete ignorance of it unless there is a new subsection in this Bill to ensure that we shall have an opportunity to consider any regulation or directive in regard to the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Apart entirely from that, this House is entitled to examine every regulation and directive concerning agriculture. It will be bad enough if there is a continuation of the discussions to muzzle trade unions in Britain and in this country just as discussions took place to muzzle the movement in Italy and France, but in a country where agriculture is so important and where farmers expect a Utopia after the dawn of New Year's Day, we are entitled to know every order, regulation and directive and to be able to forecast for our constituents the results of such decisions by the Brussels bureaucrats.  That cannot be done unless Deputy Bruton's amendment is accepted.  An undertaking by any Minister is only worth the amount of time it takes for him to deliver it.  We want it written into the Bill and even if that is done it will not improve this sad Bill which is selling out this House and everything connected with it but it will at least ensure that decisions affecting every branch of life, political and economic, may at least be seen and read by Members of the House.</P>
    <P>I have given an explanation to the House, and it is now on record, of the attitude of the Brussels bureaucrats in regard to certain Continental trade unions.  I now want to warn farmers' organisations that unless this new section is put into the Bill and unless we can see all the regulations and directives and know their contents fully and secure an explanation from the Minister giving his views on their consequences for this country, there will be decisions that will shake the foundations of farming here. What we want is not unreasonable; it is something to which a democratic Parliament is entitled.  If we are to pretend that we are a sovereign Parliament, which we shall not be after New Year's Day, let us show that all vestiges of democracy have not gone from us by accepting this amendment. <Col N="1709" /> If this Bill is passed without the new subsection, I am convinced every farming organisation will regret the day that it was passed.  Every organisation of vocational interests will be kept in ignorance by the concealment of what is going on concerning their existance and their affairs.</P>
    <P>Nothing concerns the House more than safeguarding the rights of farmers to live on their holdings, safeguarding sound, economic prices with profits for farmers.  We shall not know what is being done unless the decisions are put before this House for our perusal.  The future of the beetgrowing and tillage farmers, milk producers, bacon and pig producers and the existence of our dead meat trade and our bacon factories may be involved.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation is a dirty word nowadays and is causing uneasiness not only now economically in this country but it has caused disturbance throughout Europe for some years past.  There can be many types of rationalisation.  Even the theologians are examining the words nowadays: people are wondering how excuses can be made for their offences against the full terms of Christian teaching. The word &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo; is being examined in many quarters.  It may be easy to find and make excuses but that does not alter the original stand. That is why I say, as regards the trade union movement and the rights of farmers to know what is in store for them either in benefits or in worsening of living standards, that unless Parliament is facilitated in seeing and considering these regulations, one cannot know what will be the outcome.</P>
    <P>If the new subsection is included in the Bill at least the House will not be kept completely in the dark; there will be some glimmer of light as regards regulations and directives.  I want to ask the Foreign Minister what will be the position, without this new subsection, of industrial concerns which do not meet the requirements and directives of the EEC as regards steps already taken and as a result of which the EEC Commission are threatening to fine 62 companies. I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 11th November, 1972, which said:</P>
    <P>The European Commission has <Col N="1710" /> threatened to fine or otherwise penalise 62 companies in the Six which have not supplied requested information about their trading operations.</P>
    <P>I hope that all the companies and industrialists who had an enlightened view of the EEC last April and May will examine the reasons why 62 companies are being picked out for heavy fines and why this threat hangs over them because of failing to disclose full information to the Brussels bureaucrats about their trading operations. I would like to know this since every company in this country will be caught out on New Year's Day under the same regulation by which 62 companies are already threatened with fines.  My argument in relation to this subsection is that if there are to be directives or regulations in relation to the giving of information, tax-wise or otherwise, which is requested by the Brussels bureaucrats and if any Irish company fail to respond, they are going to be fined and may be put out of business by a stroke of the Brussels' pen for not complying with the regulation.</P>
    <P>I continue the quotation:</P>
    <P>The companies concerned had notified the Commission about one or more exclusive agreements which they operate with other companies thereby conforming with the Community competition rules.  However, they have subsequently failed to supply additional information requested by the Commission with a view to confirming whether or not the agreements themselves infringed the laws.</P>
    <P>I want to warn, through the medium of this House, every industrial concern and every company in this country that they do not know what is in store for them after New Year's Day.  It will not take them long to find out, once the Brussels boys get after them, and this House can do nothing about it because the very regulation which affects the 62 companies which are already under threat by Brussels is here in this document, if we could get a magician to find it and will become part and parcel of our domestic law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1711" /> We must safeguard industrial concerns and companies.  This House must safeguard the trade union movement, must safeguard the farming organisations and farmers in general and must safeguard educational interests in all aspects, but this House is safeguarding nobody by failing to see to it that all future laws, regulations and directives are to be furnished to us with detailed information from the Minister as to their consequences.  I want to tell the Foreign Minister here and now as one who readily accepts the wishes of the people and who has readily accepted election results for the past 30 years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If there are regulations to be made to penalise industrialists in my area, to penalise private and public companies, economic institutions, the trade union movement, the farming organisations and educational interests, I want to know in advance what they are all about and that is why I am so strongly advising the House to insist on the inclusion of this amendment, because we doubt this new subsection.  The Foreign Minister is failing to meet a reasonable democratic demand.  It is not really a demand; it is a reasonable request.  Admittedly, he has this blank cheque but why continue to exceed the value of the blank cheque against the best interests of dmocracy in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If in relation to the entire social and economic life of the Irish nation, the Council of Ministers are to make directives and regulations which may have a bearing on a united Ireland, is this Parliament not the place to discuss such directives and regulations? If there are regulations and directives which bring up our social welfare benefits to a standard even higher than those in Northern Ireland as a means of encouraging those who are outside to come in for better living standards, surely this House is entitled to know of such regulations and directives.  If in Brussels at a later stage the Council of Ministers feel that our Minister and the British Minister must put their heads together in relation to suggestions for a peaceful solution to the Northern problem will this be done with the British in Brussels behind closed doors?  Will this House be made aware of any regulations or directives that may have a bearing on the unity of this country? On more than one occasion President Pompidou is on record as stating that both Britain and the Republic should <Col N="1713" /> iron out their problems before we enter the EEC.  If, as a result of any pressure from France in relation to such problems, directives or regulations are made that would have an effect on the unity of this country and which could be explored and discussed in this Parliament, will this be done behind closed doors?</P>
    <P>Democracy is a very fine word to use but it is difficult to put it into practice.  I am a believer in the freedom of speech, of thought and the complete freedom of Parliament to rule, advise and guide.  In the interests of democracy I ask that Parliament be allowed to function by giving it all the information that is necessary. Therefore, I support this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan's well-delivered and sincerely spoken speech does not need any endorsement from me.  When Parliament ceases to be the guardian of the national interest democracy dies.  The accountability of Government to the Oireachtas is an essential of our Constitution and of our whole democratic process.  We are asking the Government to respect that principle of accountability and to allow the Oireachtas to continue to be the guardian of the national interest. Therefore, we suggest that drafts of regulations and directives should be brought before this House for consideration so that Members may give their opinions on them before the Government make the final decision.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the amendment which purports to interfere with the rights and obligations of the members of the Government to discharge their ministerial duties.  There is nothing in the amendment which conflicts with the obligations of this State to the European Communities, but there is everything in the amendment which makes it possible for democracy not merely to be seen to work but actually to work.  There is nothing in the amendment which is not respected in a number of member states of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to the book entitled &ldquo;The EEC: National Parliaments in Community Decision-making&rdquo; by Michael Niblock.  In this publication <Col N="1714" /> it is stated that whenever a proposal of any political importance is forewarded to the Council, the competent committees of the Dutch Second Chamber have a right to discuss its contents in the presence of the Government's Council representative.  It is stated that the Minister will usually be expected to inform the committee on how the Government reacts to the proposals, what reservations, if any, it feels towards them and what position it expects to take up in the Council. The publication states that the Minister's statement will be the subject of comment and perhaps criticism from the committee.  He may be urged to adopt a different attitude from the one he had previously intended to take although the Government's ultimate responsibility for determining the negotiating position must not be called in question.  Once important decisions have been reached in the Council, it is the normal practice for the Minister to be invited to appear again before the competent committee in order to clarify the course taken by discussions in the Council.</P>
    <P>In the Belgian Senate and Chamber, the procedures involve somewhat less discussion than in the Dutch Parliament. Their activity is less regular as well as less intensive.  Nevertheless, they exercise this right of supervision which intervenes sometimes before, and at other times after, the event.</P>
    <P>In the Bundestag into the law authorising the ratification of the Rome Treaties passed by the Bundestag in 1957&mdash;a piece of legislation not dissimilar to this&mdash;a clause was inserted which requires the Federal Government to inform the two Houses of Parliament of projected Community decisions which, if passed, would necessitate changes being made to German law or which would become directly applicable in Germany.</P>
    <P>We are asking no more than an opportunity to discuss the draft regulations and directives so that the elected representatives of the people of Ireland will be able to offer their opinions on these directives.  During opinions on draft regulations and directives.  During the negotiations for our entry into the EEC the Government acknowledged&mdash;perhaps not <Col N="1715" /> always in public but certainly in private&mdash;that the intensity of criticism, the expression of fears from the Opposition, helped to strengthen the Government's negotiating position.  It helped to obtain for us concessions and arrangements that were to our benefit.  Why should we divest ourselves of this opportunity to strengthen the hands of our Minister in the Council of Ministers, of our representatives in the European Parliament or of the Commissioner who will represent Ireland?</P>
    <P>The procedure we are suggesting would substantially strengthen and improve our position and, although we do not like all the powers the Minister is seeking in this Bill, there is nothing in this amendment that detracts from what the Minister wants to do.  All we want is an opportunity to express our views before the State is committed to the adoption of directives and regulations that were not put before Parliament.  If the Parliaments of Belgium, Holland and Germany use this right, why should we not seek to build it into this Bill and preserve this advantage for our country?  This is the only way we can ensure that the Parliament in Ireland remains the guardian of the people's interests.</P>
    <P>It would not be so bad if all the powers of which we are divesting ourselves here were transferred to the European Parliament but that is not the case.  The European Parliamentary institution is imperfect and has not been given the power of control, the power in the making of legislation which a parliament should have.  Until a proper European Parliament is established it is imperative that at least we reserve the right to comment or influence decisions before they are made by somebody else.  It is necessary for us to do this and this is what this reasonable amendment seeks to achieve.</P>

      <P>I know Deputy Ryan was in a hurry.  He was reading about the German Bundestag and the law authorising the ratification of the Rome Treaties passed by the Bundestag in which a clause was inserted requiring <Col N="1716" /> the Federal Government to inform the two Houses.  If he had read on a little further he would have seen that, in a later resolution, the Bundestag laid down their own procedure for the application of that article, article 2 of their legislation, by which the President is required to forward a Commission text falling within the categories mentioned to any parliamentary committee which might be interested in looking at it. I do not know whether the Deputy was aware of the second part of the paragraph.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Flanagan objected to the idea of a committee on certain very firm grounds: it would give a special place, special knowledge <Col N="1717" /> and a special privilege to some Deputies. If the committee were set up for the purpose of informing the Dáil and making sure the Dáil was informed on draft legislation, it could be very useful.  Deputy Bruton may be under a misapprehension if he thinks we have rejected the idea of a committee.</P>
      <P>I have questioned the Dáil Office and I am told that, to get a joint committee such as is desired in the motion, would require an expediency motion of this House and an expediency motion of the other House.  If both were passed we could then set up a committee.  I had intended to do this except for one or two points.  One is the motion in the names of Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Ryan suggesting 14 Members of this House and six from the Seanad.  I should like to discuss the possibility of basing on it the ten members of the European Parliament from the Oireachtas, plus ten others.  We should also ensure that they will have an adequate secretariat to make it possible for Members to keep up with the amount of draft legislation coming out of the Community. We can arrange for that.</P>
      <P>Their function in the motion proposed by the Deputies is to report to the House.  To meet Deputy Flanagan's point I think their function should be to inform the Oireachtas.  I would add to that what I think will be their main function later on, that is, the briefing of members of the European Parliament about Ireland's position in relation to various pieces of legislation.  The purpose of this committee would be to bring information to Deputies.  I should like to tell the Dáil that the Government have already taken the decision to put in the Library the drafts mentioned by Deputy Bruton in his amendment. Laying them on the Table of the House does not and anything to the situation.  They will be placed in the Library and available to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one limitation which Deputy Flanagan mentioned on Committee Stage.  All draft regulations and directives cannot be made available because some are confidential.  He must not be afraid of this confidentiality. <Col N="1718" /> It is not arbitrary.  There are certain matters with which the Community deal, such as the taking up of a negotiating posture with some country outside the Community, and certain monetary decisions, which would be confidential, and some aspects of the external commercial relations of the Community.  These could not be made available and for that reason I could not say that all draft regulations, and so on, would be available to Deputies.  All that can be made available, all that will be available to the European Parliament, will be in the Library of the House.</P>
    <P>I believe that, without limiting the House in any way, we should have a committee of the House serviced by a special secretariat to have a look at legislation passing through.  We should set up that committee by motion and, if possible, have a similar motion passed in the Seanad.  I do not want it in this Bill.  I think we should do it by motion.  That is the way the German Bundestag did it.  This is a Bill of principle allowing us to fulfil the obligations which will arise from membership of the Communities and the Act of Accession.</P>
    <P>I am quite anxious about the question of Deputies being informed and I think the way to do it is to have every document in the Library that can be put there, to set up a committee specially interested in seeking information, and to have this committee open to other Members of the House to observe their functioning, with a secretariat who will have nothing else to do but find out for Deputies the matters which will influence their decisions in terms of policies.  We are probably all aware that there are some aspects over which we have no control.  This was the big decision on 10th May.  It would only diminish this Parliament if we were to seek to control institutions having had a decision from the public within the narrow scope mentioned in the referendum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not at all satisfied with the Minister's attitude on this matter.  I do not doubt his goodwill for one moment.  I realise that he sincerely wants us to have a committee.  I believe that he sincerely wants to consult <Col N="1719" /> Deputies but we have no guarantee whatever that there will always be a Minister in his place who will adopt that attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I say we must enshrine in this Bill the principle that the Dáil will be consulted.  That principle is worthy of being enshrined in this Bill. The Minister said this was a Bill of principle and then he somehow seemed to dismiss this matter as not being a principle worthy of inclusion in the Bill.  To my mind the inclusion of procedures to ensure that the Dáil is consulted is a matter of the highest possible principle.  I find it very disturbing indeed that the Minister should seek to dismiss it with: &ldquo;Well, we will fix it up afterwards.  You can trust me.  I will make sure you will have your committee.&rdquo; This is not a matter for the Minister's personal word.  He will not be a Minister for very long.  We do not know who will follow him or what sort of Government will succeed this Government, or what sort of Government will succeed the Government which succeeds this one.</P>
      <P>We could have a Government which would not wish to consult the House. We could have a state of virtual &ldquo;civil war&rdquo; in the House with the majority bloc not wanting to afford any opportunity for consultation on what they were doing in Europe to their political opponents.  In that situation it would be quite possible under this Bill for them not to give any notice of the regulations which were going through, not to give an explanation of them, not to set up a committee, because all they would have to do as a majority would be to annual the motion setting up that committee.  We have had some experience of committees.  There was one on health which fell into disuse&mdash; I do not know the history of that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that committee had been enshrined in an Act it would have been much more difficult for the Government to get rid of them.  We are proposing in this amendment that we write into this Act a provision that the <Col N="1720" /> House will be consulted.  If that is not enshrined in the Act it is possible for us to have a Government which would not inform the House of draft regulations, which would not inform Deputies of them, and Deputies might find themselves forced to go to Brussels or to subscribe to <i>Le Journal Officiel</i> at a cost of, perhaps, £100 in order to get knowledge of what was being proposed.</P>
    <P>It is possible that by simple motion or by not removing a motion that there would not be a committee in existence to inquire into this matter.  Therefore, it is not good enough just to have the Minister giving his personal promise about what the Government will decide to do.  It must be enshrined in the Act and I cannot understand why the Government cannot do this.  It has been written into the German Act. There they do not rely simply on the goodwill of the German Foreign Minister who, whether he likes it or not, has to go before the Bundestag.</P>
    <P>For reasons best known to themselves, the Government are not prepared to give this commitment and I have the gravest suspicions of why not.  The Minister may be trying to mislead the House.  For instance, if the Government are returned at the next election they can say: &ldquo;To hell with the committee.  We said we would lay all the orders in the Library.&rdquo; If they came back with a big majority they could say: &ldquo;The people have reposed so much confidence in us that we do not need to discuss this matter with the other side who are only trying to disrupt us in doing the national work.  Why should we bother to discuss this with a minority&rdquo;? They could use all the terms they like such as &ldquo;hairies&rdquo; and &ldquo;pinkos&rdquo; and so on.  They could get rid of the institutions that are there to enable the House to be consulted.  They would only have to go back to the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs who would then be safely in Brussels, who will not figure any more in the Irish political situation. There will be a new Minister in his place who could easily go back on what the present Minister said in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1721" /> I am not satisfied with the word of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this matter.  I want it written into the Act.  I want it written down in chapter and verse that we will have a committee, that the draft regulations will be laid before the House, and I will not be satisfied with the Act until those assurances are given.  I cannot understand why the Minister will not give them except for the sinister reasons I have adverted to.  This is <Col N="1722" /> one of the most important pieces of legislation this House has dealt with in a long time and yet we see the Government adopting this shabby, anti-democratic attitude.  I, for one, am disgusted with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 25, to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Regulations under this section shall be called ministerial decrees.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is probably obvious.  There is a great deal of confusion in terminology with Community regulations and ministerial regulations.  We believe it is desirable that we should distinguish very clearly and in ordinary terminology the difference between regulations of the Community and orders which might be made by an Irish Minister.  We think it is desirable that we should not seek in regulations made under this Bill to give the force of law to acts of the European Community, or to give to them the same title or general description that is applied to our ordinary domestic law, where Ministers make regulations to bring into force various parts of our own legislation.</P>
      <P>We are not pressing for the use of the word &ldquo;decree&rdquo;.  We seek a description of orders made by Irish Ministers under this Bill other than &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;, which will inevitably be confused with the regulations of the Community which are absolutely binding and with the directives and decisions which are not binding.  It is clearly undesirable that we should use in our own law descriptions which will confuse these two types of legislation and enactments of the Community.  I would ask the Minister, therefore, to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is offered or, if he will not do that, at least to come up with some better suggestion.</P>

      <P>The word &ldquo;decree&rdquo; does not attract the same meaning.  It is not used in our law for delegated legislation and is not mentioned in the terms of the definition of the statutory instrument in the Interpretation Act. I am aware of the confusion because it is a confusion in this debate.  The Bill gave rise to the confusion because we spoke of regulations of the Community and ministerial regulations.  In actual practice, while the regulations of the Community will continue to be so described, individual Minister's statutory instruments will be ordered and so described, for example, as European Communities so and so order 1970, so the confusion is confined to the debate here and will not occur in the future.  As I say the title &ldquo;decree&rdquo; is not used in our law as a term for delegated legislation and is not mentioned in the Interpretation Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister has very clearly advanced a good reason for adopting the amendment.  We want to distinguish these new regulations from anything that has gone before or anything else that might exist in our delegated laws, rules, orders and regulations.  It is in order to have these clearly identified as ministerial regulations, made in consequence of Community obligations, that we believe they should be given a very specific title of ministerial decree.  The fact they are not in the Interpretation Act or anywhere else makes, I believe, the acceptance of our amendment all the more urgent so that this new batch of laws will be clearly identifiable.  The Minister has underlined the need to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I said before that, if we so described them without their having a standing in the Interpretation Act and use in our law, they would not attract the provisions of <Col N="1725" /> the Act in regard to printing, notice of making, numbering, citation and so on.  It would diminish them, even though we felt during the debate the need to distinguish them.  In actual practice what we now call ministerial regulations will be individual orders. If we change the name to &ldquo;decree&rdquo;, even to &ldquo;order&rdquo;, under this legislation, it would mean they would not attract the provisions of the Interpretation Act in regard to printing and so on.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with the worries that Deputy Oliver Flanagan, Deputy Bruton and Deputy Ryan had about informing the House.  Our intention on the Committee Stage was to have a debate here twice a year at six monthly intervals.  When it came to drafting the amendment, to have a debate twice a year would have meant an amendment inserting &ldquo;within the following eight months&rdquo; not six months.  By inserting &ldquo;six months&rdquo; here to accept the Fine Gael time we are bringing about a situation where legislation will have to be brought to the House three times a year mechanically because of the intervention of the long recess and so on.  I had intended to make it eight months to implement what I promised, but I am accepting the six months which brings about a totally new situation <Col N="1726" /> in regard to the consultation procedure with the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to repeat what was said on amendment No. 4.  Amendment No. 8 is not dissimilar, but I would like to distinguish it from the previous amendment.  Debates by the Dáil on regulations already made are not an adequate safeguard.  That will not suffice because it will not allow the Dáil to express a view on any draft proposals.

A motion standing in the names of Deputy Cosgrave and myself&mdash;and the Government have already indicated their willingness to accept in principle what we are recommending&mdash;requires that the committee would from time to time report to the Dáil.  That committee may still do that, we may have debates on their reports when they are before the House and those reports may contain opinions on drafts of regulations and directives, but, as Deputy Bruton said, we do not think it is quite sufficient safeguard to put these matters into motions of the House.  It is much better to spell them out in the Acts because thereby we give recognition to the fact that we are a legislative assembly and that if we are divesting ourselves of certain powers, at the same time we are taking precautions to ensure that those powers are not abused by others and that they will not be used excessively <Col N="1727" /> or unnecessarily and that while they are being used by others we will watch the way in which they are being used.</P>
    <P>In this House we may create a new child of ours by setting up a European affairs committee but if we are bringing in a new legislative or political child it is very important that we supervise that child's growth and keep a watch on its activities.  That is why we want to put that into the Bill and why we want to spell out in the Bill the provision that irrespective of any committee which may be established, there should be an opportunity in the Dáil and Seanad for debate at least twice a year on the proposals of the Community. The Minister has told us that perhaps Ministers will need to make no more than 20 regulations per year to implement Community obligations. That is a fair quantity of law.  It will probably exceed what this House has passed into law in many a year.  There is no limit on the kind of regulations that can be made.  Under this Bill it is likely that regulations will be made that will be as extensive and far-reaching as many Bills passed by Dáil and Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope that even at this last stage of the Bill the Government will see their way to offering to all our elected representatives the opportunity to debate in public what the Community are doing and debate what proposals the Community may put forward for the future.  That is the very least we can have in order to preserve democracy here and to give the people the sense of being involved.  There are very serious dangers for this country if we do not afford our people the opportunity to consider themselves involved in the Community's future development.  This is the last door that remains open and I hope the Minister will not close it against this possibility to participate in the Community's future development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to view this proposal as being something reasonable.  I would not consider it unreasonable to have a debate twice yearly, regardless of whether that is embodied in the Bill.  What we have <Col N="1728" /> agreed on is that three times yearly the Ministers will bring forward legislation to confirm regulations and if they are not confirmed by the Dáil they lapse.  At this stage we should agree that apart from any seeming advantage other countries may have in regard to having their say, none of them has quite as strong a say as we are allowing for in this Bill in terms of ministerial regulations or directives which have to be applied by ministerial regulations.</P>
      <P>By accepting the proposal of a period of six months we have made it necessary for Ministers to bring forward legislation three times yearly.  I would hope that the scope of the Bill would allow Deputies to discuss wider matters but I cannot speak for the Chair on that.  In any case, we are providing for discussion three times yearly on matters covered by this Bill, the regulations made by a Minister and which one wishes to influence or confirm or not confirm as the case may be.</P>
      <P>In relation to the draft legislation of the Community which would not be subject to influence by this House, again I think that it would be desirable to have debate so long as the House is not diminishing itself by trying to take on functions it does not have and cannot give itself.  The motion was that the committee should report to the Dáil.  This is the question that I would like to have discussed with the movers of the motion.  If that question could be sorted out, perhaps we could report to the Dáil twice yearly and have debate twice yearly on the reports.  I see nothing unreasonable in this but I would like to consult regarding it so as to ascertain whether it is appropriate to this Bill or whether it will be happening under the motion. If the Deputy is agreeable to leaving the matter stand at that we can put an amendment in, if necessary, when the Bill is going through the Seanad, that is if it does not come up satisfactorily under the motion.</P>

      <P>We cannot agree that this Bill do now pass and the reason we cannot agree is because the Bill is unnecessary.  We agree that some legislative measure is required to implement the obligations of the Community but there was no need to divest this Dáil of the power of review of draft legislation from the Community which power has been given to several other member states of the Community.  We have done more damage to the whole democratic process than any other member state has found it necessary to do in its own Parliament.  We had a greater need than any other country for continued involvement of our national Parliament in Community affairs because we have been outside the mainstream of international activity.  We have not been integrated as closely as other countries, economically, politically, socially or militarily.  We need to ensure that our people have a continuing interest in the progress and development of the Community.  We have received from our people a vote which indicates their readiness to participate but, having accepted that vote, we should not have interpreted it as meaning that there is no longer any need to consult the people.  They gave that vote because they were consulted, because the problems that were involved were spelled out to them but we could just as easily lose the confidence, the interest and sympathy of the Irish people in Community affairs by neglecting them in future and I believe that to be the awful path on which we are now embarking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the Treaties or any subsequent enactments which absolves the Government of this country from the obligation to respect the constitutional duties, to allow the Houses of the Oireachtas to function as a Parliament; neither is there anything <Col N="1730" /> in the Treaties or subsequent enactments which absolves the Government from the obligation to be accountable to the Legislature for their policies and legislative proposals.  The Dáil should have the right of continuing surveillance, including surveillance of policy.  The whole broad spectrum of policy-making in the Community ought to be available for consideration here but this Bill would deprive us entirely of that right.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to know that even in the inadequate structures of the European Community which, by implication, were criticised in the communiqué issued after their recent Summit Conference, the Commission, which is the policy-making body, is under an obligation to report from time to time to the Parliament.  It must present to the Parliament memoranda and programmes of future action so that the Parliament can consider the proposals.  We will be sending to the European Parliament ten Members from these Houses and before they go they will not have had any opportunity of hearing the views of their colleagues in Oireachtas Éireann on the proposals of the Commission.  This is a very bad atmosphere.  Our people, as a whole, will rule the day that a Fianna Fáil majority passed this unnecessary piece of crushing legislation.  I say &ldquo;crushing&rdquo; because it crushes the whole democratic process in this country.</P>
    <P>Thanks be to God we have here yet an Opposition who will not accept this lightly, who will continue to protest and who pledge that on attaining Government they will do something to improve the democratic process and ensure that there is full and continual consultation, because that is the only way in which we can preserve our democracy.  We are surprised that the Government have not heeded the pressures against democracy in our own society, pressures which have erupted in violence in the street, in protests against the whole democratic system, in expressions of cynicism at the powerlessness or indifference of politicians and in contempt for the political system and the Government in particular.</P>
    <P>I think the explanation for this is <Col N="1731" /> that Ireland is suffering because there is in power a Government continuously for 15 years, a Government which has been, with the exception of six years, in power since 1932.  In that Government there are many Members who have never sat in this House as ordinary Members of the House and if they have sat in the House they have sat as ordinary Members only on the Government benches where they were trained to be mute and to accept everything without criticism, without complaint, without protest, without examination. There are in the Government benches men who have never sat as ordinary Members on either side of the House because they have been appointed as Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers from the day on which they arrived in the House.  Therefore, these people are now totally lacking in an appreciation of the need to involve all our people in the whole parliamentary and democratic process.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are many Members in the Government party who are worried about this development. Even though they may not have sat in this House as opposition Members they see where we are drifting, where our whole society is drafting. It is drifting into a situation in which the head is becoming bigger than the body which is supporting it.  Any structure of that kind, particularly when it is a human one, is one which is bound to collapse when the winds of inflation, of unemployment, of economic depression come blowing and those are the winds which are blowing in the whole political and economic sphere in Ireland at the present time. We, therefore, must protest about this Bill.  We must deplore the apparent indifference of the Government to the cries and protests, perhaps, only whispers now but which we believe are bound to grow, and the tragedy is that it will probably be too late before we get a chance again to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>This is a disgraceful Bill.  It is one which reflects no credit on the Government or upon our whole history here as a democratic State.  We are running against the political tide.  We are running against our own traditions. <Col N="1732" /> We are doing violence to this tradition of ours that we profess to cherish, and I believe that untold harm will be done as a consequence. Even though the Government may be well-meaning, when they have unnecessarily denied the elected representatives of the Irish people an opportunity to offer their opinion on the Government's policy, the Government's proposals, the Commission's policy and the Commission's proposals, they have taken away from Parliament the most effective power which is available in a democracy, that is, the right to complain and the right to speak, the right to advise, the right to try to exert influence on Government, and &ldquo;Government&rdquo; in this case means not only the Government of the Republic of Ireland but also the Commission and the Council of Ministers in Brussels.</P>
    <P>We are rendering ourselves impotent and irrelevant, and it was unnecessary. Let no one suggest that those of us in Fine Gael or anywhere else who favoured entry to the European Economic Community sold the pass.  We did not.  What is being done now is unnecessary and, as I said earlier today, because it is unnecessary it is outside the scope of the authority conferred by the people on the 10th of May last in the referendum. I believe that will yet be challenged successfully in our courts as being unconstitutional and an expression of unnecessary contempt by Fianna Fáil for the whole democratic process.</P>

      <P>I want to express very strong views on this question and I do so in the full knowledge that I am about to enter my thirtieth year as a Member of this House.  Out of that thirty years' membership I have spent 25 years in Opposition and approximately five years in Government.  I support Deputy Ryan when he says that men so long associated with power and authority have not the faintest idea what it is like to be a quarter of a century in opposition.  From that long period of opposition we have learned to cherish one thing, that is, the freedom of speech, the freedom to ask <Col N="1733" /> questions and to demand answers to those questions.  In spite of the arrogance of Ministers and the silence which often hung over them, we were determined to drag information from them.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs might have put a more suitable title on the Bill.  It could have been titled &ldquo;The People's Farewell Bill&rdquo;.  It could have been titled &ldquo;The Gobstopper Dáil Éireann Bill&rdquo;.  It could have been titled &ldquo;The tongue-tied Dáil Éireann Bill&rdquo;.

      <P>It is not passed yet.  One of the principal effects of this Bill is that it has diminished democracy in this Parliament.  In addition to that, it has stripped Members of Dáil Éireann of authority and power.  It declares the fact that we are no longer a sovereign, independent Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be many of us in this House who are very poor men, but there is one way in which we are rich: We have not yet sold our principles. No money, no power, no influence can purchase a man's principles.  This Bill has sold out the Irish Parliament.  It has offered offence to the Irish language, as has already been commented on by Conradh na Gaeilge and by other Irish-Ireland organisations who have not sold out.  I have pointed out earlier that there are 200,000 Irish people in this country whose mother tongue is the Irish language, who believe in the Irish language.  As a result of membership of the EEC French will be adopted as a standard European language.  German will also be used.  There will be a challenge to those who believe in the Irish language. Those who, as a result of the passage of this Bill, have offered serious offence because of their failure to supply copies of information, regulations and orders in our own national language, those who have been silent in Brussels, <Col N="1734" /> who have raised the white flag of surrender in so far as the Irish language is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In section 2, which has been fully debated, regulations of the EEC have been listed with a variety of dates which mean nothing to us.  This Bill will bring into our domestic law a conglomeration of words, numbers, letters and figures which mean nothing to anyone, but which may result in penalties.  Restriction of liberty, power and authority and the surrender of power from Parliament may result in our falling into the hands of financial monopolists and capitalists in Britain, France and Germany who will control the business of the Irish and usurp the powers which the Irish people have given to us in this House.  By their votes on 10th May last the Irish people handed away their freedom.</P>
      <P>This Bill will result in the giving away of everything valued by those who believe in an Ireland free from the North to the South.  Every expression of confidence in the sovereignty of the Irish Parliament has gone. Everyone who believes in sending a representative to speak on his behalf in Parliament may no longer do so in the spirit of democracy and freedom. This Bill is the expression of a farewell to free thought and the right to the free expression of opinions and the extraction of information.</P>
      <P>German laws, French laws and Italian laws will be imposed on us. Regulations which mean nothing to us may eventually cause discomfort and distress to many of our people. As I said before, if the Irish people sow nettles they cannot expect roses to grow.  Our people were bluffed into voting for entry to the EEC and this Bill proves that the forecasters and prophets prior to the 10th of May are now a little bit more cautious in their undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one way in which a depressed people can improve their lot is <Col N="1735" /> through a parliament which can function for them.  In every country with a depressed parliament there has been the sad spectacle of parliament from the streets with people taking the laws and law-making into their own hands.  Lawmakers have become lawbreakers.  There has been loss of confidence in the democratic means of ruling.</P>
    <P>Following this Bill there will be bureaucratic control from Brussels. There will be a failure of parliamentary debate and discussion.  In my opinion, by the year 2,000 there will be an uprising, because one cannot bully the Irish too much.  The Irish can be led by the nose, as has been done before, but they cannot be bullied. One can dangle an attractive carrot in front of them, but no power or authority from outside, whether it comes from Germany, Italy, France or Britain, will be tolerated for too long. The moment the Irish feel that their Parliament is powerless to safeguard them they will show their Irish spirit. I may not live to see that day.  When respect for Parliament has been lost there will be trouble.  This is the kind of Bill which will be responsible for bringing us into a chaotic situation which may be the means of bringing distress and discomfort to our people.</P>
    <P>This Bill has interfered considerably with the rights of our people.  In future we will not be able to discuss matters as freely and with the same authority as heretofore.  We will not be able to take, as freely as before, decisions concerning the economic and social life of our people.  The same consideration for our people will not be shown by the foreigners as was shown by an Irish Parliament doing its job for our people.  This Parliament knows the feelings, customs, likes and dislikes of our people.  Our methods of business and our agricultural policies are clearly understood.  Only Irishmen know how to handle Irishmen.  Laws which come from Brussels may be responsible for an upheaval of Irish life and may result in interference with our Irish culture. This could be avoided by protecting our Parliament in this Bill.  This Bill lessens the power of Parliament.  I take <Col N="1736" /> a serious objection to that.  No Bill has ever brought me to my feet with the same amount of agitation and anger.  I have feelings of sadness and regret for the departure of democracy and the surrender by Parliament of its supreme authority.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dr. Hillery, will be saying farewell to Dáil Éireann within the next few weeks.  He will be hearing and reading about us in his luxury, well-appointed apartments in Brussels, unless pressure of time prevents him from reading the Irish papers in the English language and various Irish texts.  I hope he will carry with him the knowledge that there are in this Parliament men who will endeavour to find every possible means of getting information concerning activities in Brussels and of studying their effect on this country.  If we cannot get the information in this Parliament we will seek other means of getting it.  If there are injustices imposed on our people from Brussels we will arouse the Irish spirit again, and we are capable of doing it.  We will participate at churchgate meetings in order to warn the people of the consequences of this Bill, the loss of democracy and our powerlessness to help them in the event of the imposition from Brussels of injustice against them.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Bill is leaving Dáil Éireann in the form in which it is.  I express fears identical to those expressed by Deputy Richie Ryan.  I am sorry that a Government that has been steeped in the tradition of power and authority could not at least have appreciated the difficulties facing an Opposition that has a duty to the people.  The people are entitled to respect.  They are the taxpayers.  The Minister may tell us that the people will be getting more out of the EEC than they will be putting into it.  The position is that the right of Parliament to speak for the people has been challenged in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill, which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is about to declare as having been passed by the Dáil, sounds the death knell of democracy as we have known it.  It may be the start of <Col N="1737" /> a movement for the reverse of freedom, independence and democracy which might not end as cheerfully as the Bill is being passed.</P>
    <P>All public representatives have the responsibility to maintain confidence and trust and belief in an elected Parliament.  Never before has a Parliament been stripped of its power and authority as this Parliament has been and as the Parliaments of the EEC member states have been.  I wonder if 50 years from now will see that rich man's set-up in existence?  I doubt it. Will 25 years see it in existence?  I doubt it.  The year 2000 will see an extraordinary change in this country. Dictation from a foreign power was never readily accepted here.  Irrespective of the type of committees that may be appointed, irrespective of the representatives that are sent to Brussels, the authority of this Parliament to administer the affairs of this country will be only fractionally <i>vis-à-vis</i> the European Acts.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that all the people of this country, particularly those of us who will remain in this House, will cherish the right that we have.  I trust that we will endeavour to keep the respect of the people and their confidence in Parliament.  In order to win and to retain respect Parliament must be able to function.  In my opinion, this Bill prevents the free, full and honest functioning of Parliament.  It says farewell to democracy as we have known it in the Republic.</P>

      <P>We in the Labour Party are consistent in opposing the Bill as we opposed the whole concept of Ireland's entry into the EEC during and before the Referendum campaign. One of the main reasons for our opposition on that occasion was our belief that there would be a diminution of the status, power and influence of Oireachtas Éireann in the event of our joining the EEC.  Now that this Bill is on the verge of being passed by the House, the words, the speeches and the sentiments which we in this party expressed are seen in their true light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill which is being put through the House now will amend or render <Col N="1738" /> redundant many of the Acts which took long weeks of debate in this House, debate that was heated in many cases.  Laws were amended because of the interplay of Government and Opposition speakers.  As a result of today's work and the work of the last few weeks, the position will be changed in such a way that nobody in this House knows what will happen in regard to our legislation.  It became quite clear during the debate that the Government themselves did not know what was being changed and what was being introduced in the long list of amendments which were put before us. The rejection of amendments designed to ensure that the Irish people would be informed as to what the Bill is intended to do demonstrated that the Government were either unwilling or unable to tell the people what entry into the EEC and the changes in legislation as a result of that entry will mean to the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The power vested in Oireachtas Éireann is in very large measure being handed over to a Community which in itself is less than democratic.  Those of us who have been in Europe and visited the European Parliament would agree that the democratic process could not possibly flourish in that body since most of the decisions and the power and the influence rests with the Commissioners and the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>Many derogratory titles have been used to describe the EEC, some of them in error, some that have some truth attaching to them.  It would seem now that the promises made by the Government during the Referendum campaign will be shown not to have been carried out.  The changes that had to be made in order to make entry into the EEC possible&mdash;the change in our currency, the introduction of VAT, the changes envisaged in this Bill&mdash;do nothing to fulfil the promises made to the Irish people, promises of wealth and a better life for everybody on entry.  Although we are not yet in the Community it is only a matter of time until we will be and the signs are that it will not be any bonanza.</P>

It is a sad thing to realise that this Bill will pass tonight and that, as a result of its passage, there will be the diminution in the status, power and influence of Oireachtas Éireann.  We, in this party, have at all times pointed out the dangers that would come as a result of entry into the EEC.  We are opposed to entry.  We will oppose entry to the very end and, if the very end is this last vote, we will oppose by voting against the passage of this measure.</P>

      <P>This debate was used by some speakers to retry the referendum.  Deputy Tully said this was a fact and that this was now being accepted.  The last speaker seemed to have a different idea.  One can understand and appreciate the task of the Opposition, but I cannot see any consistency in the approach of Deputy Oliver Flanagan and that of his leaders and so I shall confine myself to dealing with Deputy Flanagan's leaders in the Opposition. I can understand the approach.  It was a good thing that this Bill should have been debated.  Perhaps Deputy Ryan went a little far in his concluding statement, in his method of expressing himself, but that is politics and it is expected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us get to the core of this now.  What we are doing in this Bill is implementing the referendum decision. We are doing what everybody realised we would be doing, namely, accepting power or, from our point of view, delegating our sovereignty to another body in the European structure.  To those who talk about democracy I want to point out that, after the passing of this Bill, if a majority of this <Col N="1740" /> House so desires and, <i>a fortiori,</i> the people decide, we are as free and as sovereign as ever we were to take the opposite decision.  If that is not a definition of sovereignty I do not know what it is.  I agree that when one enters an association it is hard to get out again.  I do not minimise the force of that argument.  But we cannot get rid of our sovereignty.  There has been talk about the functions of democracy and the fact that we, as representatives of the people, legislate for the people and carry this responsibility and this function. At least one Deputy indulged characteristically in irresponsible propaganda, maverick propaganda.  It was certainly not in line with his leader's views on this issue and that kind of propaganda is more damaging to the status of Parliament and democracy and its functions than everything that is contained in this Bill.  I invite those who are so concerned to come in here when the Estimates are on and examine their consciences about the way we function in relation to our sovereign powers and the way we discharge them.</P>
    <P>There was a good deal of talk as to what is to be laid before the House and what is not.  The tragedy is that not enough attention has ever been paid to what is laid before the House. We all of us admitted that there are dangers and there are drawbacks.  We said this before the referendum. Nothing is done in politics in which there is not some drawback.  In all human relations there is for and against.  If that were not so we would not be a human society at all.  Of course there are arguments against.  Of course there are problems.  Of course there are dangers.  By all means let us look at them.  For my own part, exercising my own judgment, I cannot see any better way of handling this particular matter.  If Parliament is not informed, even as things are, that is not the fault of our not having something translated from one language into another language; it is not because documents are not available.  The fault lies with Deputies who have been concerned with activities that may seem to them more rewarding from the point of view of votes.  We have a serious job <Col N="1741" /> to do, a more important job than looking for votes.  We were not sent in here to look for votes.  We were sent in here to do a job of work.  The effect of this Bill, its efficacy and its dangers, will in the last analysis depend on whether we, as Deputies, the representatives of the people, do our work.  It will not depend on all the talking of which some people are capable.</P>
    <P>Even though I deprecate Deputy Ryan's concluding remarks, I think the Opposition would have been failing in their duty if they had not put in amendments and debated this whole matter.  It was a pity to spoil a pretty good effort.  As I say, the efficacy of the Bill will depend on our approach. I should like to emphasise again what I said on the Committee Stage.  We are a small country.  We are a unit.  We are still a sovereign unit.  In our approach to the EEC the danger is that we will try to be more European than the Europeans themselves and forget that we are Irish.  Charity begins at home. Let us go in fully as Europeans but let us also realise that we are in a transitional stage, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, and that the much-abused Gaullist approach, as it is called, the approach that looks to the Council of Ministers for a foreseeable time and that considers the national entity, is, I think, a sounder approach for us.  There is nothing in the Bill which prevents that approach or which indeed dictates any approach.  I should like to press the point of view again which I pressed on Committee Stage. Perhaps I have not got all the support I would like in this House on that point but nevertheless I should like to press it in a rational way.</P>
    <P>Finally, there is something which, with the permission of the Chair, I would like to say and think I should say.  This Bill is the culmination of a tremendous amount of hard thinking, hard work and devoted service.  First, I should like to pay tribute to the Minister who bore this burden through all the critical years when the entry negotiations were such a vital matter for us, when there were so many obstacles and difficulties in the way, particularly when our neighbour was entering at the same time.  The Minister <Col N="1742" /> and his Department manfully and in the best traditions of the State maintained the sovereign approach and the dignity of our people.  Now that he is going from his office he should feel that he has done a good job which is appreciated.  I think it is appreciated by the people.  In the future no matter how things go, the Minister's achievements in this field will rank as material for history.  In saying this, I do not want to be fulsome; I merely want to be practical. My own personal felicitations do not matter but the worth of this achievement should be recognised now in this House.  It is only right, particularly as it was mentioned in the Dáil, that the Department which so ably handled this business should also be mentioned. All I would say about the Department of Foreign Affairs in this regard is that it was no surprise; it was in their great tradition.</P>
    <P>Fifty years ago, when this State was founded, that Department served Ministers of another Government than ours and that combination acquitted themselves very creditably in the negotiations of the common wealth at Ottawa and all that led up to the Statute of Westminster.  Already, at that early stage, the Department had acquired for themselves a reputation and prestige internationally that was remarkable for a young State.  In the succeeding years, during the thirties, during our constitutional development and the development of our relations abroad, during the war years and the critical period of the United Nations after the war, this Department maintained uniformly their high standard of efficiency, effectiveness and loyal service.  Tonight we are passing a Bill which must also be taken as a reflection of the same efficiency, loyalty and service.  It is only right we should say this and recognise that in our Civil Service we have such all-over excellence and in the Department of Foreign Affairs in particular we have not only this great tradition through years of service but, thank God, we still have men in that Department who completely satisfy that tradition.  I say a little more than perhaps I would say in the ordinary way because of some <Col N="1743" /> remarks made earlier in this debate but in any case that recognition of the Department at this time is due from this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does nothing more&mdash;and I hope nothing less&mdash;than make it possible for us to undertake the obligations which we accepted in signing the accession Treaty and on which the public decided because our referendum was not only on changes in the Constitution made necessary by membership, but was clearly made a consultative referendum by the Taoiseach in answering questions in the Dáil quite early in the campaign. Our people have decided that we should be a member of the Community. There was a full information programme for about 18 months beforehand and it was very intensive immediately before the referendum. In that full knowledge it was known that in certain areas of economic and related social matters decisions would be made in Europe in which our country would participate through the representative of the Government in the Council of Ministers.  The public were made well aware that in the making of these decisions our Minister in the Council of Ministers would have the assurance that no decision would be taken against the vital interests of any one country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly, the public knew that it was the Minister who would be there representing the country until such time as the European Parliament had more power over the institutions of the Community.  In the meantime we will have members in the European Parliament and people will go from this Oireachtas to it.  They will be made aware of proposed legislation by the Commission going to the Council of Ministers for decision.  The Economic and Social Committee will similarly be made aware of these decisions. These added democratic processes in the decision-making procedure are available to us but we are at an interim situation where our main power in decision-making in the Community will be through the Government. The people knew that, in voting and deciding that we should be a <Col N="1744" /> member and should undertake the obligations of membership.  Nobody will deny that we made quite clear what the implications of membership will be.</P>
    <P>This Bill sought to do that.  Much of the decision-making in the Community concerns day-to-day administrative matters.  Many of the directives and regulations can be implemented on an administrative basis.  About 90 per cent of the legislation coming from the Community last year was related to the common agricultural policy and the vast majority of these decisions are to our advantage.  None of them are against our vital interests or would be against the vital interests of any member. No such decision will be taken.  It may be accepted that it is to our advantage that regulations and directives be implemented quickly so that the advantages to the people of this country will be quickly available.  So, we had to seek some way in which we could implement Community decisions here.  To put every directive through the process of legislation in this House would mean that this House would have to consider nothing else but Community legislation and neglect all other matters which are concerned with a much wider range of functions than those related to the Community.</P>
    <P>It would mean that it would have either to neglect everything else and sit all the time or not fulfil our obligations, or not be able to say that Ireland as part of the Community is implementing the Community laws.  So we had to devise a method whereby we could quickly respond and, at the same time, give Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann a say and this was the method of the Bill, allowing Ministers to make regulations, delegated legislation.  We have delegated legislation already.  Last year 350 such instruments went through so we allow Ministers to make delegated legislation.  We do not impose on Ministers in the Bill the need to do everything by delegated legislation.  A Minister can come in here with legislation, if he thinks it desirable, and his thinking will be influenced by the fact that he has to come to the Dáil at some stage, with legislation, if he has time for it.  There is no imposition on <Col N="1745" /> the Ministers to use the power but it is there to make it possible for us to function.  We have in section 4 something which the other Parliaments do not have.  We have heard here of other Parliaments having access to decision-making. They have not.  They have access to knowledge and we have in this Bill the right of our Parliament to make all ministerial regulations lapse unless the Minister afterwards puts legislation through its various stages and confirms each regulation.  This is a power which I have strengthened at the request of the Dáil in so far as we intended originally to have the Minister come with legislation a year after.  We have now brought in the idea of doing it within six months and mechanically, because of the spacing out of the sessions of the Dáil this six monthly provision will mean that three times a year the Dáil will have a debate on legislation.  It will have to be brought three times a year to fulfil that obligation so that three times a year Ministers will come in here and if what they bring in is not confirmed it will lapse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>Because if you said every six months in the Bill, the long recess would make it awkward to make sure that you got all regulations within six months of their being made by the Minister.  That can be explained&mdash;it is a fact&mdash;and it is an advantage, a bonus, if you like, on what the House asked for.  As well there are the normal procedures which are not stopped&mdash; Question Time, Private Members' Motion, Motions and private legislation.</P>

      <P>The Dáil is not diminished in any way by this.  The fact that we are introducing in this Bill delegated legislation is not new and to say that it is unconstitutional in this instance is to do a disservice to the decision of our people to join Europe because if it is unconstitutional to provide for delegated legislation in this, it has been so with any other legislation.  If Fine Gael challenge the <Col N="1746" /> constitutionality of delegated legislation on this Bill, they are making an attack on European legislation because it is European legislation and not because there is anything new in it.  Fine Gael also put down an amendment, having said the Bill was unconstitutional because it gave this right to Ministers to make regulations, which itself would give a right to Ministers to make regulations.</P>

I can understand the Labour Party who have been consistent, and also Deputy Flanagan, who I know was against membership of Europe and I presume his party knows it.  I can understand the percentage of our people who voted against membership. There are people in the country who have grave fears about it.  I have no fear whatsoever.  I think Ireland is taking the most important forward step this country ever took.</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat. When I was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Taoiseach asked me to go to Europe to find out what was in the air about a Community of Seven&mdash;Deputy de Valera was good enough to speak of the good work of the Department of Foreigh Affairs and he had good reason to speak well of them, because of some other remarks &mdash;and at that time the prospect of a Community of Seven which excluded Ireland was a real prospect indeed and we examined what would be the outlook, the prospect, for our people if that happened.  It would have been a disastrous situation economically, socially and resultantly politically, if we had been excluded from the European Communities and it is a disservice to our country for Fine Gael now to give some feeling that it is wrong to join Europe, that this Bill is unconstitutional because it is a European Bill. The people should be made firmly <Col N="1747" /> satisfied that this is the most important, the most positive and the wisest decision ever taken in the history of this country.</P>
      <P>To come to the other aspect which must arise on a Bill such as this, that is, how does Dáil Éireann become involved? Having made the decision in May that in a certain area of economic and related social matters we hand over to a Council of Ministers, on which we will have one representative, certain decision-making, our people decided at the same time that that function would be taken away from Dáil Éireann and I do not think it is going to do Dáil Éireann any good, having got that decision of the public, and within the Dáil at least 80 per cent supported it before the referendum, to seek a position for itself in relation to the institutions of Europe which Parliaments of other member countries do not have.  It is only making a fool of Dáil Éireann in the eyes of the world if you try to have a role which does not belong to you and which no Parliament of any of the other member states has sought or seems to seek.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had this problem all through the negotiations of trying to inform Deputies.  For that reason, I have already got a decision of the Government that all legislation, all draft legislation, which is not confidential&mdash;and the confidentiality is limited in amount&mdash;will be in the Library of the Dáil.  How Deputies are to be made aware of all this legislation passing through, and I think they will know that there were 2,900 regulations last year and 410 directives, is the problem and I believe that we should have a committee of this House and of the Seanad, if they so agree which will seek out in all that draft legislation matters of political content, matters which are matters of policy.  The vast majority of these things will be something that is being done now administratively and nobody questions that in our own institutions; but there will be some matters which <Col N="1748" /> will have a policy content.  Deputies should be made aware of them, and if I can get together with the leaders of the other parties or their representatives in this matter, we can set up a committee which will be supplied with an adequate secretariat to distribute to the Dáil, so that the Dáil will be fully aware, all the information which they must necessarily have to follow the development of Europe.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt about the influence of a Dáil on decision-making as long as the Dáil remembers that the present method in Europe of making decisions, approved by our public and recommended by us, is that the Council of Ministers make their decisions, that the representative of Ireland there will be a Minister from Ireland and that at the present time we join not on the basis of the weighed voting set out in the Treaty but on the Luxembourg compromise, as it is called, where no decision is taken against the vital interests of any single member.  We will have to accept that that is the way it is done.  The Government will have to be free to make their decisions.  We cannot set up any way that would stop us functioning but after that, I do accept the powerful influence the Dáil can have in the decision-making process, so long as we set up nothing that will make it impossible for us to fulfil the obligations of membership of the European Communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress I was speaking about the structure of the local post offices and what could be done to brighten their image. In many rural and urban areas, the post office is the focal centre for the disbursement of many of our social services.  Therefore, many of our old people use the post office to draw their pensions or to get information.  Too many small post offices have few amenities for old people.  While the Minister may not have direct control of them, since some of them are shops as well as post offices, I would suggest that he should use his influence with the holders of these post offices to get them to make them more attractive for the old people who go in there to draw their pensions.  They could be brightened by the use of some paint <Col N="1753" /> and paper, and a few seats should be provided for the older people so that they would not have to stand in a queue for any length of time while awaiting their turn.</P>
      <P>I also mentioned earlier that a sorting office in my own area, in Ballsbridge, badly needs replacement.  I know the plans are almost finalised but I would ask the Minister to give the necessary push to have this 19th century building replaced by a modern one.  After all, employees must work there for many hours each day.</P>
      <P>I have listened to most of the discussion on the EEC Bill and I am wondering, in this context, if RTE should not have a more international approach.  It is true that by comparison with some of the European broadcasting giants RTE are very small. However, they now have a great opportunity to project Irish culture and Irish social life into the new European scene.  I am thinking on the lines of expanding the Eurovision contest.</P>
      <P>Speaking of RTE I should like particularly to pay a tribute to their political commentators, two of whom we know especially in this House.  They behave in a most responsible way in bringing to the Irish public the events that occur here.  We must give them the highest credit for their standards of professionalism and responsibility in their contributions to RTE's news bulletins, particularly in these days when biased reporting might inflame an already dangerous situation.  Of course RTE reporters must travel to the North&mdash;they have been doing so during the past four years&mdash;and consequently their jobs are much more onerous.  Therefore, as I have said, great credit is due to them.</P>
      <P>RTE also have a role in the education sphere.  I wonder if in this context they should not devote more time to the university level.  I am thinking on the lines of a university of the air.  I wonder if RTE have examined this question <i>vis-à-vis</i> other stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that more time and money should be devoted to a project of this kind, particularly in this country where we must accept that thousands of our people, because they live in <Col N="1754" /> remote areas as distinct from any means disability, cannot go to universities. Then, of course, people who are physically disabled would benefit as well.  That is why I suggest that in this country particularly the national broadcasting service should cater more for university programmes.</P>
    <P>All of us can commend the authority for Telefís Scoile, but Telefís Scoile caters entirely for secondary schools.  I have suggested that the authority might consider programmes at university level but I should like also to see serious thought given to providing programmes for primary schools, even if it were only for one or two hours per week.  There are numerous film services available and we hear now and again that canned programmes are cheaper than live ones.  At the moment the curriculum for primary schools is very heavy, so a television programme for primary schools might, incidentally, take a lot of weight from overworked teachers in those schools.</P>
    <P>I know the cost of implementing my suggestion would be great but there is a duty on RTE, as a national service, not alone to provide entertainment but to cater for the educational needs of the community.</P>
    <P>I agree with what other speakers have said in regard to the authority's attitude to Irish language programmes. Mainly on such programmes there are panels of people who are fluent in the language&mdash;fluency seems to be the test for inclusion in such panels.  I think that it would provide more encouragement to the people who are anxious and willing to learn the language if people other than those whom I would call the élite from the point of view of Irish, were given a chance.  I think it is wrong to reserve a place in our national broadcasting system to this small section of the Irish speaking community.  At the moment, because of the academic content of Irish programmes, viewers who are not so well versed in the language but who are trying to improve switch off.  RTE should do more to try to encourage people who are seriously interested in the language.  For an English language programme they do not always bring on people who have perfect English so <Col N="1755" /> why should they debar people from taking part in Irish speaking programmes because they are not fluent? RTE can play a much bigger part in the educational field, particularly in the matter of programmes in Irish, if they bring on men and women from non-Gaeltacht areas or those who have had to learn Irish in their spare time.  There will be no extra cost involved.  It is well worth trying and RTE should be urged to adopt the policy of bringing on people who, if it gets too difficult, will break into English but who will be trying all the time not to do that.  This will encourage the home viewer to speak Irish.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed by the religious programmes on RTE.  The big mistake is often made that there is a half-hour programme on some very serious theological aspect.  People are brought on who know their subject but it should be remembered that many of the viewers are not theologians but people of simple faith.  This does not mean that they are of weak faith.  Looking at those programmes I can say for myself that at times I am confused.  The fault may not lie with the people who appear on these programmes; it may lie in the fact that they are given such a short time to expand on their viewpoint.  The interviewer uses some of the time so the actual time available to the man or woman who is the main speaker is very short indeed.  Nine times out of ten the interviewer has to say: &ldquo;I am sorry, we have no more time for that.&rdquo; We are very often left with very important questions hanging in mid-air.  We do not know what the speaker would have said had he been given an hour. While we try to attune ourselves to changes in these days of change I think it is asking far too much to expect that in a half-hour programme questions of faith and morals or perhaps some dogma, should be discussed.  The person at home has not, perhaps, been able to give his full attention to the programme because of distractions but even if he has, after some programmes he is confused by the utterances of the speaker.  That may not be the fault of the speaker.  He or she, knowing the subject so well, may assume that we all know it equally well, but whoever <Col N="1756" /> organises the programme might try not to talk down to the people but to speak in language that we understand.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; programme is short and the speaker generally has a nice little pithy talk to which one likes to listen.  The vast majority of speakers on &ldquo;Outlook&rdquo; are good.  One can see the results of the training these men have got.  It has made them much better speakers on television.  I am sure that programme has a large audience.  It is a very simple little programme but some of the other religious programmes are above some of our heads at least.  The language should either be simplified or the people taking part in them should be given more time to explain their views.  It is very necessary today, when attacks come from many sides on things which people hold dear, that these programmes should attune themselves to the thinking not of the intellectual members of our society but to the thinking of members of our society who want to learn and may not have the intellectual capacity to follow the sometimes pedantic utterances on these programmes. The RTE Authority do their best.  Some brilliant people have appeared on these programmes but it may well be that they are not speaking to the people who want to hear and to follow each argument on religious matters.  I have at times been confused.</P>
    <P>One could fault the RTE Authority for many of their productions.  Each year I mention some of the programmes which give offence.  As RTE mature I hope this will not continue and that we will see a greater degree of maturity on all programmes.  I should like to say, by way of criticism, that on some programmes they are inclined to bring on people not because they have got a message or are particularly good at their subject but because of the very fact that they are &ldquo;way out,&rdquo; different to the majority. They are brought on to say things which may shock people.  The great majority of our people are sometimes shocked and hurt.  Parents complain that if their children are looking at a programme which may be harmless and, indeed, may be a good programme for adults, something may <Col N="1757" /> happen in it which will hurt the parents who are thinking of their children.  It may not be meant to be in bad taste but it can be in bad taste. The RTE Authority and the producers should keep in mind the fact that all the people are not intellectuals.  We are not all experts on drama or culture of any kind.  Programmes must be geared to educate the people but the mass of the people do not want the kind of <i>avant garde</i> philosophy of some of the programmes.</P>
    <P>The film about TV spongers shown on RTE is a bit offensive.  You see an inspector going to a person's door and when the woman opens it she is asked if she has got a licence.  I usually feel sympathy for that person when she says she has not got a licence.  She may not have the money to pay the licence fee.  I know those people may be actors but I always feel pity for them.  Some other way should be found to ensure that licences are paid. Somebody should examine this matter and, perhaps, find a better solution than showing a film about TV spongers.</P>
    <P>When one buys a motor car one has to tax and insure it.  Perhaps we could adopt the same procedure in relation to TV licences.  When a person owns a motor car a garda can see the tax disc on the windscreen.  When a person buys a television set it could be registered and every year a reminder could be sent out that a new licence was necessary.  Commercial concerns have to deal with bad debt problems but they cannot spend large sums of money trying to recover them.  They may appoint special people to do this work or send out solicitor's letters.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the great majority of people pay their television licences every year and, perhaps, those who do not pay have not got the money for the licences.  If we must have some scheme to encourage people to pay their licences we should try to do it in better taste than the TV spongers film.  I do not know how much money RTE loses on account of the people who do not pay their licences.  The Department should be able to think up some satisfactory <Col N="1758" /> scheme to ensure that licences are paid.  The people who pay their licences should not have to watch a film in relation to TV spongers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs give a good return to the public.  The Post Office affects the lives of everybody in the country in some way.  I hope the Minister will look at the whole structure of his Department and try to shed some of the responsibilities he is carrying at the moment. I suggest that the Post Office could be run as a semi-State concern like Aer Lingus or some of the other State-sponsored bodies.  The Minister might take the savings section away from the Department and let that be run by another State-sponsored body.</P>
    <P>Most speakers conclude their remarks on this Estimate by referring to the waiting list for telephones.  When people want telephones they often approach Deputies and I must say on any occasion when I approached the Minister in this regard if it was possible something was done.  It is one of the penalties of our growing affluence that there is such a demand for telephones. Ten years ago we had not half the number of telephones we have today and the number of applications is increasing.  We will probably see the day when every house will have a telephone. That cannot be done overnight and there is bound to be a queue.  The Department are doing their best to try to overcome the problem in this regard. I believe the priority in the Department in regard to the allocation of telephones is a fair one.  If the Minister can increase the installation rate by, say, 10 per cent a year it would go a long way towards shortening the waiting list for telephones.</P>
    <P>The Post Office is going through a difficult time but I believe it is doing a good job.  I hope that next year the waiting list for telephones will have been reduced considerably.  I also hope that some of the other matters I mentioned this evening will have been dealt with.  I understand that Deputy Thornley, who is the Labour Party spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs is ill and I take this opportunity of wishing him well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not often I find myself sympathising with Ministers in this House but whenever I speak on this Estimate I sympathise with the Minister because I think the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is far too unwieldly and has got completely out of hand.  Like Deputy Moore, I feel that some sections should be taken away from the Department and put on their own.</P>
      <P>When one thinks of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs one immediately thinks of the telephone system. Those of us who live in rural Ireland experience some difficulties with regard to the telephone system.  The Minister must know that our telephone system in the west of Ireland is not very good. It is no good saying that there are long waiting lists for telephones in every country in Europe because that does not make it any easier for people who are waiting for telephones.</P>
      <P>Connections to the west of Ireland are particularly bad.  Earlier this year an American factory coming into my constituency was unable, through the normal channels, to get a connection. I had a frantic call from IDA sources in the west and from the people in the town.  The Minister was very cooperative and the telephone was installed.  I discussed this with the officials of the IDA and with business people coming into the west of Ireland. They say that undoubtedly our telephone service deters people from coming to the west to set up business. We should get some special concessions in the west.  It is easy enough to get an industrialist to set up in Dublin or Cork but it is not so easy to get him to go west of the Shannon. If we had a better telephone and telex system they would be more inclined to come to the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are relatively small aspects of the telephone service that puzzle me.  For instance, in the towns of Loughrea, Athenry and Gort in my constituency there are automatic exchanges which appear to be complete but which have not yet been put into use.  In reply to a parliamentary question earlier in the year the Minister told me that it would be about three years before they could go into <Col N="1760" /> operation.  Judging from the extent to which the town of Loughrea is growing, by the time the automatic exchange is put into operation it will not be adequate to handle the volume of work that will be required of it.  The buildings are there and cables have been laid but, perhaps, there is some reason for the hold up.  Each of these towns has a growing population and those of us who use the telephone service frequently find it progressively frustrating when there are delays in answering at the exchange.  If one seeks an explanation from a supervisor the excuse is usually that the line had been very busy.  Recently while in the house of a friend in my constituency I tried to make a phone call and when I did not succeed in getting a reply from the exchange my friend suggested that I use the method of ringing that is used by a certain priest.  That worked so it would seem that there is some secret method of getting instant service.</P>
    <P>Of course, we are aware that the exchanges are overworked in a number of country areas.  Loughrea is one of those.  On one occasion I found a night operator and myself to be using language which, to say the least, was not parliamentary but which in the circumstances was understandable.  I regret to say that it was I who used such language in the first place but, were a foreigner to overhear us, it would not have given a very good impression.  It is easy to criticise or for subscribers to be hurt when a sub-postmaster or postmistress is abrupt on a line but I am sure that if I were in their place I would be very cross too.  Officials at local exchanges are expected to work long hours for which they are not well paid.  I notice also that in some exchanges there is not yet an automatic buzzer so that it is still necessary to wind a handle in order to put through a call.  Surely when an exchange is carrying any more than half a dozen telephones they should have the automatic facility.</P>
    <P>On the whole, the telephone service provided in rural Ireland by postmasters and postmistresses is second to none.  I have had occasion time and again to dash into post offices in <Col N="1761" /> various parts of my constituency and to ask a postmistress to make a call for me.  They have always been willing to oblige although they need not do so.  They are always ready also to oblige anyone who might wish to call a priest, a doctor or a veterinary surgeon by making the call.</P>
    <P>The provision of public telephones seems to be a matter of growing concern in rural constituencies.  People are asking that kiosks be provided in numerous parts of an area.  I can understand the need for a kiosk after a post office has closed in the evening. In my area of Kilrickle we agitated for a kiosk and succeeded in being provided with one but because it is on the main Dublin-Galway road the connection is lost each time a truck passes so that we were better off when we used go to the post office to make our calls.  Perhaps, therefore, it is not always best to provide a kiosk.</P>
    <P>Each year the question of commemorative stamps is raised on this Estimate.  We have reached the stage when we claim to be mature politically and we think we are sophisticated.  We pat ourselves on the backs and say that the civil war is no longer a political issue, but yet when it comes to the question of honouring the founders of this State we do not do so in so far as commemorative stamps are concerned. This year marked the 50th anniversary of the death of Michael Collins but no stamp was issued in commemoration of the patriot.  I cannot understand why this was not done.</P>
    <P>Each year I have some complaint to make in respect of the telephone directory. Because of the growing number of subscribers it would be a good idea to produce the directory in two separate parts, one for the Dublin area and the other for the country area. This would result in the directory being easier to handle and less likely to fall apart.  Also the print could then be somewhat larger so that those of us who are getting on in years would not have difficulty in distinguishing the nines from the noughts and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Many of the post office buildings could be improved greatly in appearance by a little brightening up.  In so <Col N="1762" /> far as the Post Office vans are concerned, I did not like the new marigold colour originally but I find it quite acceptable now.  At any rate, post offices need not be as dingy as they are.  The uniforms worn by postmen leave much to be desired but I suppose if they are comfortable and warm they are not too bad, although they could be much smarter.</P>
    <P>On Sunday last I received a deputation in my constituency and I was amused when one person told me that his problem could be solved very easily, that all he wanted was a telephone. I had to tell him, however, that that was the only problem I could not deal with because there are about 22,000 other people awaiting telephone installations.</P>
    <P>One person on that deputation had a complaint in regard to the Post Office and this concerned the increasing number of letters and postcards that seemed to go astray.  This matter is coming to light in various ways.  One of these is in respect of people who apply for the beef incentive bonus scheme.  If a cow has not calved at the time an official calls on the farmer, a tiny card is left with him which he is to post when the cow has calved. Naturally farmers are meticulous in sending in these cards and small farmers in particular depend to a large extent on the income from the scheme.  However a number of these cards never reach their destination.  I do not know what is the explanation for this.  I have made representations to the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in respect of having some applications re-considered but they tell me invariably that the card did not reach them, but when I tell this to the applicant he is usually adamant that the card was posted.  I never take a chance in so far as my own applications are concerned.  I hand the cards in personally.</P>
    <P>The Post Office have some very good small savings schemes in operation but these should be advertised more widely.  They did have an advertisement on television but I do not know whether it is on now.  This advertisement advised youngsters to save and this was very good because, <Col N="1763" /> while a young boy or girl may be a little reluctant to open a bank account, he or she will be in the habit of going to a post office for stamps, <i>et cetera</i>, and consequently, will not hesitate to open a savings account there if they so wish.  This is an ideal way of encouraging saving and, of course, the return is excellent if the money is left in for a sufficient length of time.</P>
    <P>In connection with this Estimate, one thinks automatically of RTE which body, in my opinion, should have a Ministry or at least a subDepartment of its own.  In this respect I sympathise with the Minister in having to deal with that establishment.</P>

      <P>But that is not good enough.  If we wish RTE to be really efficient we must give them more money than the licence fees. Some people would argue that RTE are extravagant while others would say they do not receive sufficient moneys.  It is a question of whether it has too much money for the return we are getting or whether it has not enough money to give us a proper service. Personally I think it should have more money to give us a better service.</P>

      <P>I do, and after that there is the revenue from advertisements and so on.  I think the whole system of financing RTE is wrong.  Television is a completely new medium to this country.  It is the most powerful of all the media and one which will be increasingly influential. Therefore the maximum amount of money should be allocated, not to be thrown away but to be spent with the appropriate supervision in order to give us the best service possible.</P>
      <P>Our newscasters are good.  I remember arguing here a couple of years ago that there were too many news announcers and I was told they could not be done without.  Now I notice they are done without and very efficiently done without.  Although the newscasts are good I am not so impressed by &ldquo;news at 10 o'clock&rdquo;.  I preferred the other method of presentation. Again our newscasts are not as good as the BBC, particularly on our own problems.  I switch from one to the other to get a particular story on the North and I find the BBC more impartial on the Northern Ireland situation.  While I am in favour of freedom of speech, far too much platform is given to undersirable members of the public, sometimes on news programmes but certainly on current affairs programmes.</P>
      <P>I have always felt that our canned programmes, as Deputy Moore says, are of a very low standard.  I do not believe the Minister was born when some of them were made.  They are so old and so antiquated that it is painful to look at them, and the unfortunate continuity announcer has to say: &ldquo;We regret the poor quality of the sound in this film&rdquo;.  We should not be insulted with this kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Telefís Éireann should provide more music.  I do not mean only traditional music; I think that makes bad television, strangely enough.  We have two excellent orchestras that we very rarely hear.  Young people are gone mad on this pop culture, which to me is only noise.  Youngsters can be educated musically, and if there was much more light music there would be an increasing audience.  I know it is expensive, but it is good entertainment <Col N="1765" /> and it is worth it.  The only time we ever hear our orchestra is on sound radio, and only housewives or those who are ill or driving long distances listen to sound radio to any great extent.</P>
    <P>School programmes are very good, but RTE fall down on the provision of programmes for the very young.  We have nothing to compare with the programmes on the other stations which should not be mentioned here.  I have seen piped television in the afternoon and the pre-school age programmes are very good.  I do not see why we could not import some of them here if we cannot make them ourselves. Some people argue that television is not good for very young children.  I am of two minds about this.  I think it broadens the mind.  Even for babies, the visual thing, stories about animals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Some Deputy was advocating here this evening that &ldquo;Today in the Dáil&rdquo; should be televised.  That programme is all right in sound, but if we had to look at it in pictures it would be ghastly.

My constituency receives Radio na Gaeltachta very clearly.  I have asked innumerable people, people who are well versed in the Irish language, if they listen to it. A number of them say they cannot find it on their transistors; neither can I, incidentally, but possibly I have not got the knack of finding it.  We spent a lot of money on Radio na Gaeltachta.

      <P>I always felt it was a mistake.  I do not know whether it is fair to mention anyone, but Pádraig Ó Raghallaigh was in charge down there and he did a superb job in getting the radio off the ground. It nearly killed him.  I do not think we should ask this of any of our civil servants.  Having got it off the ground he disappeared from there.  However, I am very unhappy about the way in which Radio na Gaeltachta has worked out.  This may not be a popular thing to say, but I think it is a nest of Sinn Féin.  My Irish is not all that fluent but I have heard the programmes in other people's houses and I think it is very slanted.  It is questionable whether the money was well spent.  If the Minister looks over his shoulder he will get advice from his own party.  A Fianna Fáil Member who lives in the west of Ireland said to me: &ldquo;Would that we had got that money for drainage or for a water scheme somewhere.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It alarms me when the Minister states in his speech: &ldquo;We are hoping to extend the hours of broadcasting still further.&rdquo;  Should we not have a hard look at the whole set-up in Radio na Gaeltachta?  There seems to be no <Col N="1767" /> editorial supervision.  Everybody seems to be able to say and do what he likes, and this is wrong.  I do not know what the TAM rating would be for this.  I asked a teacher in one of the big schools in the Gaeltacht to find out from the children if they listened.  He did not do a very comprehensive survey but, doing the best he could he found that a very small percentage of the children listened.  A number of them did say their mothers or fathers turned it on and made them turn off other programmes.  One wonders whether it is money well spent or whether it is another empty gesture like these gadgets around the seats here which are used very little, although Deputy Begley spoke in Irish today for a couple of minutes.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants seriously to go ahead with Radio na Gaeltachta, more time should be spent in trying to educate us in Irish.  Radio na Gaeltachta could serve a useful purpose in schools in the west of Ireland.  At the moment it is not serving any useful purpose.  It is doing a disservice to the State.  I will probably be criticised for saying this. People on television are sensitive to criticism.  Politicians can be criticised from morning to night, but nothing critical must be said about the people in the ivory towers of radio and television. There is usually a grain of truth in criticism.  I always listen to criticism because one can always learn.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke at length about advertising, particularly in relation to drink.  I understand that Deputy Moore, like myself, does not take a drink.  Perhaps we are rather sensitive about people who drink. Drinking is practically a way of life in this country.  Cigarette smoking is also very prevalent.  We must point out the dangers of drinking.  There is no use in withdrawing drink advertisements. People will not stop drinking. A good job was done on television in regard to cigarette smoking.  The programmes about cigarette smoking were informative.  Similar programmes could be shown in regard to the dangers of drinking to excess.  The problem of alcoholism in this country <Col N="1768" /> is not new.  I have come to the conclusion that in some cases it is hereditary.  Advertisements issued by the Department of Health showing the dangers of excessive drinking might be useful.  Withdrawing advertisements about alcohol will not serve any useful purpose.  The breweries would save money, but the position in regard to drink would not be changed. Young people, in increasing numbers, drink.  We have to educate them so that they can drink with minimum danger to themselves.  I do not wish to be taken as saying that we must teach them to drink.  We must educate them in regard to drink.</P>
    <P>Television can provide a useful service with regard to drugs.  Most youngsters look at television.  A very useful purpose could be served by the Department of Health sponsoring programmes warning youngsters about the dangers of drug-taking and of experimenting with drugs.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Moore, I think that the TV spongers advertisement is good.  It is in no way offensive and the actors have not got ghastly accents. It must remind some subscribers to pay their licence fees.  In Connemara I have come across people who do not get satisfactory television reception. This also occurs in the hilly parts of County Clare.  Sometimes they get a picture but no sound; on other occasions they get sound but no picture.  Sometimes they receive Spanish television stations showing bull-fights.  These people feel that they should not be asked to pay television licence fees.  One must sympathise with them.  If they cannot get proper television reception they should not have to pay for television licences.  At a social gathering during the summer a well-known person entertained his guests by describing how a RTE team came to interview him and asked him whether he had a television licence. His wife said they had not, and one of them said that if he could get only RTE he would not have one either. This reflects badly on ourselves and RTE.  I presume the authorities are lenient with people who are not getting proper reception and that the Minister would not prosecute people in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1769" /> I would like to thank the Minister and the members of his staff who were so helpful to me during the year.  I seem to have a growing number of telephone problems.  The officials in the Department are always courteous and seem to have an explanation for everything.  I pass on the information they give me, hoping that it will be accepted as adequate.  The telephone problem is gigantic.  We do not seem to have come to grips with it.  Presumably the lists waiting for telephones will be as long next year as they are this year.  Perhaps the Minister will be on this side of the House sometime and will be able to say to us &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; when we speak about the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>Posting from this House is not reliable.  I wrote to my small daughter who is at boarding school and posted a stamped letter to her from the House.  She never got it.  I sent a letter in a franked envelope and she did not get that either.  I wrote from Rathfarnham and she got that letter.  I presume my letters got lost between here and the GPO.  Letters posted in the House on a Friday morning do not arrive in Rathfarnham until Monday morning or afternoon.  On one occasion I left post on a table upstairs.  It was sent out on Thursday but it had not arrived at its destination in Rathfarnham when I returned from Galway on Monday.  Postage outside the Dáil is more satisfactory.  One would imagine that the seat of Parliament should get efficient service, if not privileges.  If we do not run our own affairs well, how can we run the affairs of State in a satisfactory manner?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister and his staff for the courtesy and efficiency which I have received from them over the past year. Some of my problems have been solved, but a few still remain.  The telex communication system is being used by an increasing number of firms in Ireland.  This system has been the subject of much complaint.  There are not sufficient lines in use.  I do not fully understand its working, but I have complaints from industrialists that they are not getting satisfactory service from telex.  The Department <Col N="1770" /> realise this and have been giving rebates to some of the telex subscribers. This is an admission that there is something wrong with the telex system and that it could be improved.  If industry is to have a chance to compete in Europe, delays of this kind should be reduced to the minimum.</P>
      <P>The main point I want to make is in regard to the Clonmel telephone exchange.  Clonmel is the biggest inland town in Ireland and is one of the fastest developing towns.  It has the most antiquated telephone exchange in the country.  It is not only crank-handle; some of it is pigeon carrier stuff.  The telephonists are more than helpful and very obliging.  The conditions there cause annoyance and shortness of temper on the part of operators and subscribers.  A number of big industries are going into the area.  There is no automatic exchange there.  I have heard complaints of delays of 1½ hours to get a call to Dublin.  One could drive to Dublin in that time.  It is not the fault of the supervisors; it is a matter of overloading. It can take 45 minutes to get a call from Cahir to Clonmel.  I do not blame the telephone operators who are most helpful.  If the Minister wants to help this town to expand and wants business to be efficient and if he wants to facilitate the hospitals and the county council he must give priority to Clonmel in regard to the telephone service.  I trust the Minister will do that.</P>
      <P>In regard to applications for telephones, rural areas should get a higher priority than city areas.  A farmer may have to call a vet or a doctor in case of emergency and may have to travel two or three miles to the nearest telephone whereas in Dublin there is a telephone kiosk every 200 or 300 yards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Doctors are not attracted to rural mountain areas. There should be telephone kiosks in all rural areas.  Applications for kiosks have been rejected on the grounds that the number of subscribers would not <Col N="1771" /> justify the erection of a kiosk.  I suggest that there should be an agreement with the local authority that they would subvent the kiosk.  That has been adopted in one or two areas in Tipperary and in Carlow.  It is a scheme whereby telephone kiosks could be provided in mountainous rural areas where they are needed. There may not be a doctor within eight or nine miles.  A farmer may have to travel eight or nine miles for the vet.  Priority should be given to rural areas in the provision of telephone kiosks.</P>
      <P>There has been a complaint from people who supplied petrol to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to the effect that only one company are now supplying.  I am not sure of the nature of the complaint.  Persons who had been supplying for years, who were getting only one penny profit per gallon, are now deprived of that business and the Department are dealing with one company.  I have written about it and have transmitted complaints I have received.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hogan O'Higgins about Telefís Éireann and the newspapers being sensitive to criticism. They think that we have necks like bulls but we are not supposed to criticise them.  This was particularly noticeable in regard to the debate on the Forcible Entry Bill where the question of journalists arose.</P>

      <P>We will accept that. It is a very popular programme in rural areas.  Some of the programmes seem designed to keep somebody in a job.  Some of the home made music programmes are really terrible, utterly boring.  Some of the canned programmes are obviously the cheapest available.  It would appear that someone is trying to get rid of these films that are presented on Sunday nights. If Telefís Éireann retain them for a couple of years they will be a century old and will be recognised as antiques. The news service has improved.  The current affairs programme has improved tremendously.  I do not know whether there is a shortage of money or a shortage of talent but in my view it would be better not to present some of the programmes being presented. I should like once more to thank the Minister for his efforts and kindness and consideration during the year, which went beyond the call of duty.

      <P>The Minister is, no doubt, a fine man, in charge of this Department.  I am not entirely satisfied with the way in which certain appointments are made in the Minister's Department.  Employees of Government Departments are supposed to be divorced from politics.  There is more political pull in getting people appointed to jobs in the Post Office than there is in any other part of the public service.  Even the appointment of postmen is not entirely free of a political aura.  Generally the appointment is made on representations from a Deputy.  The Minister should really break away from this tradition.  All it is is jobbery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, when a vacancy occurs in a post office, a regular battle is fought for the post office. Someone gets the post office on political pull and regardless of the qualifications of other applicants.  This reflects no credit on the Minister or his Department and, if he changes the system, it will be a big improvement. Employees in these jobs cannot stand for any public office.  I do not think that is altogether fair.  Perhaps the Minister would look into it and allow them the same opportunities as other people have.</P>
      <P>With regard to telephones, if one complains to the Minister about bad service he certainly examines the complaint and ensures that Members of this House get the best service possible. The general public are not, perhaps, quite so lucky.  I spent an hour on a public telephone dialling 10.  I admit this only happened on one occasion. The Minister will probably say that he has not got the money to give a really satisfactory general service. Now, if the Minister is really fit for his job, he should be able to get the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1774" /> The automatic system came in some years ago.  It is disimproving.  Is the system out of date?  I have used telephones in other countries and the dialling system has been very satisfactory. I would urge the Minister to instal a modern system.  The telephone system around Tuam is very bad.  A great many people in that area have been on the waiting list for quite a considerable time.  The Minister should take steps to speed up the installation of these telephones.  Every year on this Estimate we have the same complaints to make and one begins to wonder if one is wasting one's breath.  The Minister does not seem to do much about our complaints.</P>
    <P>Some programmes on Telefís Éireann seem to be biased in favour of the Government.  When the Taoiseach went to meet Mr. Heath in Chequers that meeting was covered by every programme on which it could be covered&mdash;in the news bulletin, on the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme, on &ldquo;Féach&rdquo; and on anything and everything else.  There are, of course, people who like to see the Taoiseach getting all the publicity possible, but I think it was overdone on that occasion.  Of course the meeting should be publicised but there was no need to have three or four sets of television personnel covering it.  It is a waste of money.</P>
    <P>There are bad programmes on Telefís Éireann and I doubt if the authority are prepared to do anything about them.  The films shown over the week-end are at least 20 years old. They may appeal to the older generations but they have certainly no appeal for the young people.  Surely more modern films could be shown.</P>
    <P>The people in the area from which I come&mdash;the west coast of Galway&mdash; have to rely on Telefís Éireann.  The people living here on the east coast can get UTV, BBC 1 and 2, Harlech and some other stations.  There are parts of Roscommon in which they can get BBC but reception is not very good.  With piped television in many parts of the city we in the west of Ireland are not getting the same television service as those in Dublin and probably along the east coast and also in the north-east where they can get <Col N="1775" /> good reception from UTV.  It is unreasonable to expect those living in an area where you can receive only Telefís Éireann to pay the same amount as those who can tune in to many other stations.  I think the other stations are far superior in many ways to Telefís Éireann.  I refer particularly to the BBC and their sporting programmes transmitted all day on Saturday. UTV transmit the &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo; on Sunday, and on Saturday night you also have the BBC &ldquo;Match of the Day&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not to wrestling particularly I am referring but to association football, otherwise known as soccer.  Where people have a choice Telefís Éireann are gradually losing their audience, but in the west of Ireland we never get an opportunity to look at BBC sports programmes. The Minister should impress on the authority that people in the west of Ireland should have the same opportunity of seeing sports programmes on BBC and UTV as those living in other parts of the country.  We have to pay the same television licence fee as those who are able to see these other programmes. Telefís Éireann should make some arrangements so that we in the west can see the same programmes as those in the east, seeing that we have to pay the same fee.  We should get fair play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, as regards the sports department of Telefís Éireann, it could be said that if there was horse-racing or jumping anywhere in the country it would be covered.  Taking into consideration the number of people who are interested in these sports, they got more than their due time from Telefís Éireann.  I do not know who was responsible but as one who spent most of his active life in sport&mdash;I am not too inactive yet but too inactive to take part in any useful capacity&mdash;I regularly meet people interested in sport who ask why Telefís Éireann are so slack in their sports programmes. If you live in Dublin you <Col N="1776" /> can see first division soccer matches and usually on Wednesday night there is an international match.  Irish soccer, as portrayed by Telefís Éireann&mdash;they usually take it off the field&mdash;is of rather poor quality in comparison to what we could see but which we in the west of Ireland never have an opportunity to see although we pay just as much for our licences.</P>
    <P>At one time I approached the Minister to provide a booster station so that we could get BBC reception.  The BBC signal was coming into this country and it was a case of good luck to those who could get it and hard luck for those who were not able to get it. Of course Telefís Éireann could take these programmes from the BBC by some arrangement and I think they should do so.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the coverage of the Olympic Games by RTE I would say that was an occasion where we had quite a number of athletes.  They did not do well but in my opinion we had twice too many Telefís Éireann personnel in Munich covering these games.  They gave us a rotten service. &ldquo;Munich 72&rdquo; by Telefís Éireann was poor and one commentator in particular seemed to favour the eastern rather than the western block.  When a Russian beat a Yank he seemed to be delighted and I thought he was biased in many things he said, particularly when the Russian sprinter happened to win the 100 metres or 200 metres.  He was rather happy that the American domination in the event had been broken.  This did not look good for a Telefís Éireann commentator on that programme.  We had a whole day watching horse jumping and again, for the number of people in this country who were followers of that sport, it seemed excessive.  There were many other events taking place in which there was much more action and I think this is what the Irish people want.  But they did not get it.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in getting the Minister to improve the telephone service.  I am also interested in all programmes on Telefís Éireann and particularly in the sports programmes. I think the sports service we get on Telefís Éireann, particularly in the west of Ireland, is disgraceful.  I am <Col N="1777" /> sure the Minister is not getting these programmes I have mentioned in Limerick either.  I would ask him to look into the problem with a view to giving us the same service as the people in the east are getting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intervening in this Debate especially to inform the Minister and the House about the activities of Radio na Gaeltachta as the people of Kerry view these activities.  It is a matter of national importance that special vigilance should be exercised in the case of Radio na Gaeltachta. Despite the assurances and excuses we get from the broadcasting establishment there are very few people in Kerry who do not have grave misgivings about the way Radio na Gaeltachta is being operated.</P>
      <P>The service appears to be the happy hunting ground for individuals whose objective is to create as much mischief and disruption as they can.  Some of these people who seem to have a monopoly of broadcasting time are in a position to see to it that people who disagree with their outlook very rarely get on the air.  This is a fact.  The influence they enjoy makes it clear that these people are either in cahoots or conspiracy with the management of Radio na Gaeltachta or else the management is grossly negligent.</P>
      <P>The management problem is the big problem as far as I can see.  I was back in the west Kerry Gaeltacht a month ago and I can tell the House that the people there were absolutely mad with the manner in which the service was being operated in that district.  The manner in which one gentleman, already referred to today by Deputy Begley, was allowed under the guise of news or feature broadcasts to publicise his own activities is a shocking indictment of the station and as scandalous as it is comic, to my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had Radio na Gaeltachta in Kerry purporting to report a strike where in fact there was no strike. The report was concocted by the individuals who were doing their best to hunt an industry out of the Gaeltacht. A newspaper in such a situation would without a shadow of doubt face a libel action.  We also had the attempt made by the said Radio na Gaeltachta <Col N="1778" /> to drum up on the smallest pretext a so-called pollution problem involving the very same industry.  This is a matter of grave concern and if the same thing is happening in other Gaeltacht areas, I believe there should be a sworn inquiry into the operations being conducted by the management of Radio na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleague, the Minister for the Gaeltacht, should keep themselves fully informed about what is really going on.  They need not be impressed by any further excuses put forward by that management. I feel very sorry for the many decent broadcasters who are trying to provide a good local cultural service but it is well known that these people are subject to insidious pressures from irresponsible and disruptive elements within Radio na Gaeltachta.  This is the position in Kerry anyway.  There appears to be some kind of social blackmail apparently if you do not go along with these boys.  There also appears to be a witch-hunt against people who will not toe the fashionable anti-establishment line in the same station.  These matters deserve the closest attention of the Minister and his colleague.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should inform themselves about the publicity being given through Radio na Gaeltachta in Kerry to the activities of an organisation called Cearta Náisiúnta Chorca Dhuibhne.  This is a body organised and owned, so to speak, by three people, one of whom is the key man operating the service in the Dingle Gaeltacht.  The real point about this is that the reports of activities of this so-called organisation are supplied by the leader himself and I presume he is paid for this as a journalist.  I believe that this whole business requires a full-scale inquiry and that instead of telling the people in Kerry that they are being black-guarded, Radio na Gaeltachta could do useful work and instead of trying to hunt industrialists out of the area, they should be trying to promote industry. They should be telling the people the social service moneys they are entitled to get, telling them about the grants they are entitled to get and, in particular, the large sums of money <Col N="1779" /> which they received this year from Roinn na Gaeltachta for road improvement works in the area.  This would be more in their line than the blackguardism which they are conducting.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department are doing an excellent job, having regard to the resources available.  There is no doubt that the telephone service continues to grow rapidly and the demand for telephones must surely be increasing now more rapidly than ever before, due to the improvement generally in the economy.  I believe the fantastic demand for telephones at the moment is the result of good Government during the past ten years and more, the fact that the country is booming and the economy moving nicely and that there is affluence in the community.  The fact that the waiting list grew during the past year from 7,000 to 22,500 is remarkable and it is a fair barometer of the growing economy.</P>

      <P>It is worth noting that there is a staff of about 22,000 men and women employed by the Department and it is a tribute to the management and staff within that vast Department that we hear so little about the management-labour problems which must surely exist within a Department employing that number. I would like to compliment management and employees and the unions for the manner in which they are conducting their business.  I was gratified to learn that a substantial improvement <Col N="1780" /> has recently been made in retirement gratuities for part-time staff and that a pension scheme for full-time unestablished staff was introduced.  We had been seeking this for some time and it is indeed gratifying to know that the position has been vastly improved.</P>
      <P>There are certain areas in rural Ireland that have not got a telephone service.  I think that the case I made previously on behalf of people in the Black Valley area near Beaufort in County Kerry, was the most impressive case that could have been made for a telephone service.  There are between 20 and 30 householders who are living in a valley in a remote part of Kerry. I met them recently and asked them whether they would prefer to have electricity provided or to have a telephone service and I was amazed to find that they would prefer to have a telephone. These people fear that they may be cut off from the rest of the country during bad weather and that it would not be possible to fetch a doctor or priest if an emergency arose.  I know the problems so far as the Department are concerned but I can assure the Minister that the people concerned are prepared to provide voluntary labour and they may make a contribution towards the cost of providing a telephone service.  The fact that they will give voluntary labour, perhaps provide machinery and probably make a capital contribution towards the cost should ensure that their application gets priority.  I hope that when we are discussing the Estimate for this Department next year the area concerned will have a telephone service.</P>
      <P>Some effort should be made to try to encourage people to keep telephone calls as brief as possible.  If this were done it would help to eliminate the overloading on certain lines.  A telephone should be used to convey a message or for a short conversation; it was never intended for lengthy conversations.</P>

      <P>The canned programmes on RTE should be phased out and replaced by our own shows and plays.  We have many good writers, artists and actors and the people should hear and see these performers. I agree with the previous speaker that there should be more programmes on television devoted to sport because this would be good for the youth of the country.  I should like to see such programmes screened on Saturday and Sunday nights instead of films and shows.  I should like to compliment the Minister and his staff on the work they are doing and the manner in which this Estimate was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many people can get only very poor television reception &mdash;in fact some of them cannot get a picture&mdash;but in spite of this they are obliged to pay for a television licence. In cases such as this they should not be obliged to pay the full amount of the licence or, at least, they should not be pressed for payment until reception is improved.</P>
      <P>I understand that there is a method nowadays whereby an area can be tested for reception.  I understand that the equipment is very expensive but it would help if it could be made available in areas where the reception is very poor.  It is useless for people to have television sets in their homes and be unable to receive any programmes.  I should be obliged if the Minister would look into this matter because improved reception would be of benefit to the people especially during the winter months.  They can only sit down and enjoy a good picture on television from October until March, when their work increases considerably.  Very often American films which are 20 or 30 years old are shown on RTE.  Irish people would prefer to see a film of local interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people are still on the waiting list for a telephone.  I must admit that the telephone service has been improved considerably.  We must thank the Minister for this.  People have become very conscious of the telephone and the demand is increasing steadily. I should like the Minister to tackle this problem.  I know that the Minister's <Col N="1782" /> hands are tied because of lack of money.  He has a big staff, many of them highly paid.  They are doing a great job.  In rural areas we have a dwindling population with the result that there is a great need for the telephone service to get in touch with the doctor or the priest or the veterinary surgeon.  Many old people are living on their own and they feel isolated and lonely if they have no means of communication with their families.</P>
    <P>Coming back to RTE, we should have more programmes on agriculture. We have many agricultural shows throughout the country but, generally speaking, the only one we see on television is the Dublin Horse Show.  The finest livestock are exhibited at Ballsbridge but on television we only see the horse jumping.  Many people would be very interested in seeing the cattle and sheep.  The horse industry is one of our finest industries but we must not forget that a great number of our people are depending on cattle and sheep.  They would like them to get more coverage on television. We read about an agricultural show in Cork or Roscommon at which first-class livestock are exhibited and people would like to see them on television.  This matter has been raised on a few occasions at agricultural committee meetings.  More coverage should be given to agriculture.</P>
    <P>There is a programme called &ldquo;On the Land&rdquo;.  There are many inventions today which are not familiar to our progressive farmers.  It is very important that they should be made aware of them.  They should be demonstrated on that programme because the farming community take a particular interest in it.</P>
    <P>In these days of modernisation and mechanisation I suggest that RTE's farming programmes should be of greater length and variety.  Our aim now should be to keep as many people as possible on the land and to try to encourage those who have left to come back.  Young farmers now need more information than ever before in order to compete with our partners in the EEC and therefore I urge the Minister to suggest to RTE that their farming programmes on both sound <Col N="1783" /> and vision should be of longer duration and should include more practical subjects.</P>
    <P>I am dissatisfied with the telegraphic service of the Department.  Very few people will go to the trouble of sending a telegram unless the case is urgent.  I have experience of cases where there was a delay of up to three hours before a telegraphic message was even touched in the post office. This is a serious defect and it should be remedied as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Many small villages in Sligo/ Leitrim and, I suppose throughout the country, need a better telephone service. I would instance a village like Ballintubber.  I have brought their case to the Department on two occasions but nothing has been done.  Business people, particularly, in such areas depend very much on a reliable telephone service.  I therefore appeal to the Minister to see to it that the needs of such people are catered for.</P>
    <P>In this connection, as I mentioned earlier, the farming community nowadays have more and more contact with veterinary officers of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Only on six occasions during the year do these officers call on individual farmers to look after such things as the brucellosis test, bovine TB and the warble fly test.  Farmers desire to have much more frequent visits, much closer contacts with these officers.  I appreciate that more frequent visits would involve a substantial extra amount of money, but because of the present inadequate telephone service, farmers cannot communicate quickly with these officers.</P>
    <P>On the question of deposits for new telephones, I suggest that a three-year rental in advance is too heavy.  I am not quite sure if my figure is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to help in this matter but I would point <Col N="1784" /> out to the Deputy that the capital cost of installing an individual telephone could be as much as £1,000. In my experience the cost has been between £600 and £800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLaughlin Mr. McLaughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister. I know he will do everything possible.  A number of vans have been put on the road and no doubt they are giving good service but they are also depriving people of jobs.  We are living in an age when everybody wants a job.  Even people with farms, and comfortable farms, want a pay packet at the end of the week.  Every time the Department put a van on the road they are depriving somebody of a job.  I would ask the Minister to be very slow about putting vans on the road and depriving young family men of employment.  The postmen of the past gave good service and boys of today will be just as good if they are given the opportunity.</P>
      <P>There is the problem of post offices being closed.  Where at all possible I would ask the Minister not to close post offices.  Down the years the post office has been part and parcel of an area.  We have had enough closures. Garda barracks have been closed and homes have been closed.  On a previous occasion I asked the Minister not to delay the delivery of letters by having one man appointed to do two post offices.  I got an assurance from the Minister that he would put that right and I think the position has returned to normal.  To have a postman delivering letters from 8 o'clock until 12 noon and then going to another area from 12 noon until 2 p.m. or 3 p.m. is not giving a good service.  The people did not like that at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are boys and girls working in post offices many miles from home when, with a bit of co-operation, many of them could be placed in their own localities.  I know of one girl who is about to be made permanent and transferred from Sligo.  It means she will have to leave home and her widowed mother and wait until a vacancy arises before she can hope to get back to her native town.  It is a pity that a girl like her cannot be made permanent in her own locality instead of having to go to Dublin.  It <Col N="1785" /> would save the home and the person concerned considerable expense.</P>
    <P>People receive parcels from England or America and with the duty charged on them it would be almost as cheap to send them back.  A substantial sum has already been paid on the parcel when it was posted and when it arrives at Sligo or Manorhamilton there may be £4 or £5 to be paid on it.  This is unfair.  Public representatives have to go to the Revenue Commissioners and in the end the parcel either has to go <Col N="1786" /> back or the duty has to be paid.</P>
