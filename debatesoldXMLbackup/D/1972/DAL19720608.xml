    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred to the matter of decentralisation. I stated that the correct thing to do would be to decentralise and to provide the additional accommodation required by Government Departments in provincial towns in the west and south west areas of the country. Instead of paying fantastically high rents for premises in Dublin it would be much more worthwhile to provide the necessary premises and facilities in provincial towns.</P>
      <P>I stated that I agreed entirely with the proposal to provide facilities for the simultaneous translation of debates into Irish.  If this were done much more Irish would be spoken in this House because Deputies would be encouraged to use the language.  It is up to Members of this House to give the lead in this matter.  A considerable number of people throughout the country can speak the Irish language; all they need is encouragement and it is up to us to provide the lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1120" /> I stated also that the Office of Public Works should have a priority list which should be reviewed every three years with regard to improvements to piers and harbours and landing facilities for fishermen along the coastline. In places where proper landing facilities are not available now, it is of vital importance that they be made available as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note the provision that has been made in this Estimate in respect of schools.  Last year expenditure on the building and improvement of primary schools amounted to approximately £3,655,000.  There were 53 new buildings erected and major improvements to 48 schools were carried out.  It is gratifying to note also that 21,500 new pupil places were provided for and that a further 7,000 places were provided in prefabricated units.  This year there is being provided a sum of £4 million more than was provided last year.  I wonder, however, whether any provision has been made for new primary schools at Killarney.  Improvements are required urgently there and at least one new school is required.  Killarney is a town with a fast growing population and some children have to sit in primary schools throughout the day where conditions are very bad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if that would not be a matter for the Department of Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision should be made in this Estimate for the improvement of schools in Killarney and for at least one new school.  I am glad to note, too, that a contract has been placed for a bridge to connect Dinish Island with Castletownbere.  This is a very important fishing harbour and the money being spent on it is justified. I hope it will not be too long until similar facilities and improvements are effected to the piers at Kenmare and Cahirciveen where improvements are required urgently.  However, it is good that a start has been made at Castletownbere and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his officials on the manner in which the project has been handled to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1121" /> I welcome also the proposal for at least 17 projects which are to be carried out by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs but I am a little disappointed that, again, no mention has been made of Killarney town in this context.  The telephone exchange which was erected at Killarney a few years ago is not big enough now. There are between 200 and 300 applicants on a waiting list for the installation of telephones and I believe that the reason for the delay is because of the inadequacy of the exchange.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CormacBreslin" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Cormac Breslin">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps that would be a matter for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased with the manner in which the section of the Office of Public Works which deals with national parks have been effecting improvements.  Much worthwhile work has been done at Derrynane but it is very important that further facilities be provided in that area, which is the centrepiece of the Ring of Kerry so far as tourists are concerned.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to press the Government to acquire any land that may become available in that area so that a national park could be developed there.  It is only right that the State should have control of as much land as possible in an area which has the wonderful amenities that Derrynane has to offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly the Office of Public Works are doing wonderful work at the national park in Killarney but there is still a good deal to be done there.  The park is the most beautiful in the country and I take this opportunity of complimenting the entire staff there, from the superintendent down to the labourers and the gate keepers, for their dedication and the manner in which they have carried out their duties.  I would like to see more picnic areas being provided in the park and also better toilet accommodation. It is important, too, that within the park there would be jarvey stands that would be approved by the State.  Nature trails have been developed at Muckross and I hope that more will be developed in time. <Col N="1122" /> Increasing numbers of people are visiting the park each year.</P>
    <P>I would like to know whether Dinis Cottage, which is a very important landmark at Killarney, is being overlooked. It appears to the people of Killarney that this cottage, which is steeped in history, is being overlooked to a certain extent.  This should not be the case.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to say how this spot could be made more attractive to visitors but with all the expertise available to him the Parliamentary Secretary should be brought to bear on the matter.  More walks should be developed within the park, by following natural trails or otherwise.  The existing car park should be extended. Whether we like it or not&mdash;and I like it&mdash;more and more people will be visiting this national park as the years go by.  It is important that provision should be made now for the ever increasing number of people who are being attracted to the national park in Killarney. More and better accesses should be made available to the lake.  In some areas along the park boundaries the lake might be regarded as being a little dangerous, but more and better facilities should be made available for pleasure boating by the shore.</P>
    <P>The information centre which was set up for a very good purpose by the Office of Public Works a number of years ago could be better located.  At the moment it is more or less tucked away in the back of a car park.  The Parliamentary Secretary and his officials should have another look at the suitability of its location.  It could be in a more prominent position, perhaps immediately across the road, outside the gate.  This would probably be an ideal situation for it.  It would be visible to people passing along the road.  It is important that it should be resited at this stage.  The intentions were good when it was set up.  It could serve a very useful purpose and it will be essential in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Park constables should be employed in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park in Killarney.  They would help and complement the existing staff and they would serve a very useful purpose in the supervision and guidance of the ever increasing number of people who <Col N="1123" /> use the park.  I would strongly urge that these park constables should be appointed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I read very carefully the Parliamentary Secretary's statement on drainage. It is very interesting to note that the Office of Public Works are operating on a 30 years old brief with regard to drainage.  The Parliamentary Secretary has arranged for a detailed survey to be carried out.  In this day and age we should not be working and planning and programming on a 30 years old brief.  It is very important that this survey should be concluded as soon as possible and a report made to the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>I would query the wisdom of spending large sums of money on the existing system of drainage.  The money which is being spent on schemes such as the Boyne could be more usefully spent, from the social and economic point of view, on carrying out a large number of minor schemes in the west and south-west.  A great deal of land could be improved in the west and south-west.  The smallholders are willing to do the work themselves provided that they are grant aided.  This would have a big impact on the employment situation and it would inject a good deal of money into the economy of the west and south-west.  A change in the arterial drainage policy which would lead to the carrying out of a large number of minor schemes in the west and south-west would be welcome.  It would be feasible and it would be a sounder policy, socially and economically speaking, than the present policy which costs a great deal of money in a very small area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the statement by the Parliamentary Secretary that the sum of £555,000 has been provided this year for maintenance.  It is very important that the existing schemes should be properly maintained.  I refer in particular to the large acreage of land which has been made arable along the Maine in County Kerry. If it is not maintained the land could fall back into disuse in the future.  Maintenance is very important and I welcome the provision of £555,000 for this important work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1124" /> I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary referred to coast protection work. A great deal of work needs to be done where coast erosion is concerned and this work will be quite costly.  The Office of Public Works should try to get people to co-operate with them, perhaps on a voluntary basis, in the areas in which they move.  That would reduce the cost.  It is possible the local people would be only too willing to help the Office of Public Works in this particular work.  A large acreage of land along the Ring of Kerry is subject to coast erosion.  In the area from Caherdaniel to Waterville, Ballinskelligs and Rossbeigh, and right up to Cromane, a very high acreage of land is being eroded.  The sooner a start is made on coast protection work in this area the better it will be.  Even before schemes are finalised, the local people should be encouraged, perhaps by way of grant, to carry out some coast protection work themselves.  This would be a very suitable field for grant-aided schemes.  The local people would be only too willing to do the work themselves in the short term, if they were encouraged and grant aided, and if they had the advice and expertise of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and all his officials for the manner in which they carry out their duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The first item I want to mention is one to which I referred also last year; it is that of our national monuments.  I have on previous occasions spoken about the need for having explanatory plaques on these monuments.  All that is available at the moment is a notice in Irish/English indicating that the object in question is a national monument and it is an offence to interfere with it.  Now that is the very minimum necessary.  For the sake of both visitors and our own nationals these monuments should have explanatory plaques so that people will know what they are and, knowing what they are, appreciate them all the more.  Some national monuments do not even have a plaque indicating they are national monuments.  This is a serious omission and is one that should <Col N="1125" /> be rectified as soon as possible.  The plaque should carry a simple statement as to what the monument is and what it represents.</P>
      <P>It sometimes happens that, in acquiring a national monument, the State has not simultaneously acquired a right-of-way to that monument and some national monuments are, so to speak, islands in the middle of some farmer's land.  Possibly the failure to acquire the right-of-way was due to an oversight. In view of the increased interest in these monuments a survey should be made of these monuments and negotiations should be entered into to establish a right-of-way.  It is absurd to have a situation in which anything as precious as a national monument is inaccessible.  If permission is sought to inspect the monument it may be refused, possibly with justification.  The Clonfinlough Stone, the oldest stone carving in the country, is situated in the middle of a meadow and one can understand the owner's exasperation summer after summer when that meadow is tramped over, unwittingly and in ignorance, by people who do not realise they are damaging a small-holder's property.  The Office of Public Works should acquire a suitable right-of-way and thereby avoid any grievance on either side.</P>
      <P>The greater interest being taken by the Office of Public Works in monuments like An tOscar and Trim Castle is to be commended.  Excavation work is now being undertaken before these monuments are restored.  This is very commendable.  It is also commendable that far more information is being published by the Office of Public Works about their archaeological activities. For too many years this kind of work was carried out in secret.  That was not deliberate, of course, but there was no policy of publication and I understand that there is a vast amount of material unclassified within the stores of the Office of Public Works. An effort should be made to catalogue and exhibit this material for the information of visiting archaeologists and for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A suitable site for the exhibition of this material would be Adamson's Castle in Athlone.  This is one of King <Col N="1126" /> John's castles.  It is in excellent condition and there is ample space for exhibition purposes.  There is no room in the Museum and the Office of Public Works could set a valuable headline for the Department of Education by exhibiting around the country some of its more interesting finds, thereby publicising its activities and educating the public with regard to the length and range of our historical heritage. I commend to the Office of Public Works their investigation of the use to which they could put Adamson's Castle.  It was Department of Defence property but the military have vacated it.  I do not know if it has reverted to the care of the Commissioners of Public Works; if it has not, then they should commence negotiations immediately with the Department of Defence to take the castle over and make use of it on the lines I have suggested.</P>
    <P>In regard to another aspect of the archaeological activities of the Office, the National Survey, I feel with regret that this is not going on as actively as it should.  I have no doubt the reason is lack of staff.  I understand that to date the counties of Louth, Meath and Monaghan have been surveyed.  This scheme began quite a number of years ago.  Two years ago activities began in County Westmeath but the county has not been fully surveyed yet.  If the entire country has to be done, I shudder to think at what date the survey will be finished on a national basis. Having regard to environmental changes that are taking place so rapidly, it is a matter of urgency that this survey be speeded up or so much will have been lost that the survey will be pointless.</P>
    <P>One way of speeding up the survey would be to integrate the activities of the Office of Public Works with the county development teams, part of whose job is to consider the natural resources within their counties, historical as well as material.  I suggest that if county development teams were subsidised by the office in the employment of undergraduate or recently graduated archaeologists the survey could be expedited enormously and instead of taking it county by county it could be going on simultaneously in a <Col N="1127" /> number of counties.  The experienced Board of Works staff would be available to supervise the county development teams' efforts.  Putting it on a county basis would also generate a tremendous amount of local goodwill for this activity and many natural features which the survey might miss could be brought to their attention if the public were involved through county development teams.  At the present rate of progress, having regard to the fact that the only counties completed are Louth, Meath and Monaghan and that the work has been going on for two years in Westmeath and has not been completed there, I think consideration must be given to the organisation of the scheme and I suggest the county development teams be subsidised as I have outlined so that this work can be expedited.</P>
    <P>Another subject on which I feel strongly and on which I must do some special pleading relates to the river Shannon.  At this stage I think the Office of Public Works must come face to face with the Department of Transport and Power or the ESB and decide who will control the River Shannon. At present the Office of Public Works are responsible for navigation, markings and all the works along the banks of the river such as quays, bridges and locks but the critical question of the level of the water is under ESB control. A decision will have to be made as to whether the Shannon is more important to the tourist industry than to the supply of power to the national grid.  The Minister for Transport and Power admitted to me at Question Time last summer when we debated the question of the level of the Shannon that the contribution by Ardnacrusha was comparatively insignificant and that in terms of costings it was not of the same importance to the economy as tourism.  Consequently, I think the level of the Shannon will have to be determined by navigational requirements rather than by the requirements of Ardnacrusha.</P>
    <P>I think that the minimum level now permissible by law, which is 121 feet OD, will have to be raised because the Shannon was maintained at that <Col N="1128" /> level last summer and while it was at that level the upper reaches were inaccessible to larger pleasure boats and even for smaller boats much of the water of the upper Shannon in Lough Ree and north of Lanesboro and Tarmonbarry was dangerous if they left the navigational channel because while shoals were not exposed they were so much nearer the surface in water which would normally be safe. Also, the Office of Public Works had spent a considerable sum in dredging and cleaning the Lecarrow Canal off Lough Ree, which was an amenity much appreciated in the district and by boat users on the Shannon but because the ESB dropped the level this canal was unusable by boats.  The substantial expenditure by the Office of Public Works on that canal was, to all intents and purposes, wasted.</P>
    <P>Also, a good deal of money was spent on Barley Harbour on the eastern shore of Lough Ree in County Longford but because the level of the water was dropped by the ESB many of the landing places provided at great expense by the Board of Works became inaccessible and this development was so much waste of money. CIE cruisers were unable to operate north of Athlone.  Therefore, a decision will have to be made as to whether the primary purpose of the Shannon is to generate electricity at Ardnacrusha or to be a tourist amenity for our own people and for visitors.  I have suggested that the Office of Public Works are the body with the most intimate knowledge of the Shannon and have shown considerable concern for the Shannon in their operations on it through the years.  The prime consideration in this day and age is tourism and the minimum level will have to be increased considerably over the present figure.  Otherwise, summer after summer we shall have a repetition of what happened in the past two summers and larger craft will not be able to navigate north of Athlone, navigation will be dangerous for smaller craft and amenities being provided by the Office of Public Works will be left literally high and dry and inaccessible to those for whom they were provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> I should, however, like to commend the Office of Public Works and thank them for one job they did in Athlone, the cleaning of the river bed along the eastern quay south of the town bridge.  This is very much appreciated and the effects of it were immediately to be seen.  If the work could be extended now out into the river from this quay some old obstructions in the river bed might be lifted.  Anything that makes navigation safer is desirable.</P>
    <P>One further development is urgently required in regard to the Shannon at Athlone.  I make no apology for talking about the Shannon at Athlone because this is the central point on the whole Shannon waterway and the great majority of craft navigating in the Shannon at some stage pass through and usually tie up at Athlone.  It is important that the facilities at this strategic point on this waterway should be first class in all respects.  One serious lack is the lack of mooring facilities south of the lock.  If a boat comes up the river late at night it is not always easy or suitable for it to go through the lock to tie up at the town quay.  Also, if the quays are crowded it may be difficult at night to get a berth.  Consequently, there is urgent need south of the lock for a jetty to which a boat can tie up overnight or to which a boat can tie up during the day if the lock is full or if there is a queue for it.  It is particularly important to have some place where a boat can tie up because at that point the river is running fast, having come over the sluice gates, and it is difficult for people on these pleasure cruises, many of whom are inexperienced sailors, to navigate against this strong current in safety. It makes the approach to Athlone from the south a slightly worrying experience for an inexperienced sailor.  This could be cured if there was a safe mooring place or a simple jetty to which these boats could tie if they were unable to go straight into the lock.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give that matter urgent attention.  It is a simple facility but would be of tremendous benefit to people using the Shannon and would enhance the Shannon as a waterway. At this stage of the development of our <Col N="1130" /> tourist industry anything that can be done to improve our facilities should get priority.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary gave the Phoenix Park scant enough attention in his opening speech.  He is apparently relying on whatever plans are to be put forward by a group of students from Bolton Street technological college.  We will have to wait and see what these will be.  The question of the Phoenix Park is of very considerable importance because it is of such tremendous amenity value to this city.  The first most important consideration in regard to that park is that not one inch of it should ever be given away except possibly for some unavoidable road-widening.  Certainly for no other purpose should one inch of that park be given away.  At this stage it seems to be a huge area.  There are many secluded corners which would appear suitable for desirable social development, non-commercial development, and there might be a temptation if pressures build up, but having regard to the way Dublin is growing and the scarcity of amenity lands the Phoenix Park will be small enough in years to come.  I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to lay down as a principle in the Office of Public Works that the Phoenix Park is sacred and that no part of it is for sale or for disposal.  I have tabled a question to him, which will probably be taken later today, in regard to the site of the Cheshire Home.  That site has been provided in the Phoenix Park.  I am not sure whether it is within the existing site of St. Mary's Hospital or whether it means extra ground.  I will be interested to learn and I will be sorry if I have to learn that some ground extra to St. Mary's Hospital has been given away for this home, commendable and all as it is.  I do not think anything justifies the giving away of this most precious asset.</P>
    <P>The use of the Phoenix Park has changed in the past number of years, principally in the increased number of horses that are using it and the increased number of motor cars.  I do not speak now of racehorses which have been traditionally trained in the Phoenix Park and were never an interference with the amenities of it and <Col N="1131" /> never cut up the ground.  Indeed, the trainers have their own special gallops which they maintain themselves and each trainer must pay an annual fee for the privilege of training his horses in the park.  The way this has been carried out over the years has not interfered with the amenities of the park and has not damaged the soil.  These activities take place in the comparatively early morning.  What I do refer to is the increased number of riding schools which have grown up around the park and the very large number of horses which are now using it all through the day and particularly at weekends.  This has resulted in large areas being cut up.  They are just small seas of mud.  This is unavoidable if a large number of horses are using the same ground day after day.  Consideration must now be given to providing horse trails through the park and restricting these animals to these trails. Whether they will be specially prepared of a mixture of clay and sand or whether they will be the ordinary grass surface marked out I do not know. This is a matter that the Office of Public Works, with its own technical competence, will decide on but it would appear to me that if these are to be permanent they will have to be artifically sanded or in some way constructed so that they will stand up to the constant use day after day.  The provision of these trails through the park will not detract from the amenities of horse riding at present available.  If they are carefully planned and well laid out it can be very pleasant and a healthy exercise to ride a horse along the trails. At the same time the general park will be preserved and the little seas of mud that at present disfigure it will disappear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling complained about the lighting in the Phoenix Park.  Of course, the lighting there is unique in that it is still lit by gas.  I would strongly appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that this gas lighting is not changed.  It is a unique feature of the park and a very interesting feature.  It preserves a continuity with the past and it would be a shame and a scandal to change it.  I hope this will never happen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1132" /> There is also the question of motor cars and what is to be done about them.  An increased number of cars in the country naturally leads to an increased number of cars in the Phoenix Park.  Consideration may have to be given to providing parking spots.  At present people are parking along the roadways and that is no nuisance. Occasionally at certain spots at weekends it may be a bit congested but at present it is not a great nuisance.  What is, however, developing is the habit of driving cars on to the grass.  This will have to be considered for control.  At present it is not doing any harm.  It is not interfering with the grazing nor is it spoiling the grass to any extent but if it is allowed to continue unchecked it could become an abuse.  Attention will have to be given to it with a view to formulating plans at this stage and getting them implemented at this stage before there can be any opposition to them.</P>
    <P>The question of arterial drainage was referred to by Deputy J. O'Leary. He indicated that the Parliamentary Secretary was working off a 30 years old brief and that as he said in his opening remarks the whole question of arterial drainage is being examined in his Department and he hoped to have a report of a joint committee of various interested parties before the end of the year.  I can well understand that such a report will have to take a tremendous number of things into consideration.  I suppose the prime consideration will be the cost benefit aspect of arterial drainage.  It is probable that if this is the only criterion applied there will be a drastic change in policy. I think now in particular of one scheme I know, that is, the drainage of the river Inny.  There were vast stretches of this river where no benefit accrued to adjoining landowners because the land was already high and was well drained by existing outlets into the Inny.  On the other hand, there were a certain number of landowners who did benefit by the drainage.  It is possible that a cost benefit study in relation to the Inny would show that the cost of it was out of proportion to the benefit given to a certain number of farmers.  If arterial drainage is to be <Col N="1133" /> determined on this basis it is possible it may come to a halt.  I would submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Government are not running a commercial business and that the criteria which might apply in a commercial business in relation to the expenditure of capital sums might not necessarily be applicable in the case of Government operations; that if some farmers would benefit who could not otherwise have their holdings improved, even though the cost would be out of proportion, the Government, because they have a social duty as well as a commercial duty, would have to consider the ways and means for these men to benefit.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, as against the arterial drainage, there has been tremendous ecological upset over very wide areas as a result of arterial drainage. Possibly, nature in its own time will heal the scars which these works necessarily inflict on the countryside but the cost of the healing and the time it takes means that permanent damage is done that may not be healed.  This is an aspect that will have to be considered in relation to any future arterial drainage works.  We do not know, because not many studies have been carried out, what harm has been done by existing works.  The heaps of spoil in some areas have put an ugly appearance on otherwise nice stretches of countryside.  We learn to live with these things which are another consequence of arterial drainage that must be taken into account.  It is a complicated subject with very important ramifications.  We look forward with interest to hearing the report of the committee that is advising the Parliamentary Secretary on the subject.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that this committee be asked to consider a point raised by Deputy John O'Leary, that instead of having huge national or seminational schemes on major waterways, consideration should be given to passing over the finance or a large proportion of it towards a large number of smaller schemes.  I think in particular of rivers in my area and Deputy O'Leary was thinking of rivers in his area.  I am sure every Deputy has in mind waterways in his area which have <Col N="1134" /> no hope of being drained.  The county council cannot be interested in them. It is difficult to get them to do land reclamation.  There may be technical difficulties over outlets and levels.  It would be possible for the Office of Public Works, with its large resources, which are all tied up in arterial drainage, to drain these rivers.  At this stage, having regard to the amount of arterial drainage that has been completed, there should be a shift of emphasis and drainage henceforward should be on small waterways and, possibly, looked at from a cost benefit point of view, there would be greater return from the money expended.</P>
    <P>I think in particular of the River Camlin, County Waterford.  On the occasion of this Estimate we all indulge in special pleadings, which is only proper.  The River Camlin is a very small but very long river.  It is part of a fairly intricate network of waterways. It is serving what may be called marginal land.  Its outlet is into the River Shannon.  The River Camlin is a river that will not qualify for an arterial drainage scheme because it is not big enough, the volume is not in it, but the amount of land affected by it and by its small tributaries is immense. It is mostly marginal land. I would suggest that the River Camlin would be an ideal subject, if there were to be a change of policy on the part of the Office of Public Works and, instead of spending money on huge schemes on the larger rivers, if the money were to be diverted and spent on schemes that would be able to cope with the River Camlin and such rivers all over Ireland, it would bring a far better return for the expenditure. The type of land through which many of these rivers flow may be marginal but the benefits of drainage would be immense to the farmers in the areas.</P>
    <P>The Boyne or the Inny, because of their length and size, go through differing types of countryside and do not benefit many of the places they go through because they were already well drained and did not need drainage of the type carried out there.  The small rivers, because of their smaller scope, serve a particular type of land for their whole course and the benefit of <Col N="1135" /> drainage is far greater.  I would commend this aspect of drainage to the committee which is considering the whole question of arterial drainage.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the question of canals.  The Grand Canal is in a healthy enough condition.  Since the Office of Public Works took it over it has been well maintained and it is well used.  It is a tragedy that the Royal Canal was so neglected as, possibly, to be beyond recall.  I should like to see an investigation, even at this late stage, carried out on the Royal Canal to see how much of it can be saved.  The Royal Canal has one advantage over the Grand Canal in that it goes through far more interesting countryside and has far more spurs and side canals off it.  I would ask that the Office of Public Works would at this stage start a survey of the Royal Canal.  There are many stretches of it, certainly link stretches, which cannot be saved because the old canal bridges have been levelled and new bridges have been built which have the effect of blocking the canal because the old hump has been removed and the bridges have been flattened.  The main waterway should be looked at to see if something can be done with it.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if we are talking of the cost benefit of expenditure, money spent, even at this stage, on saving the Royal Canal would be money well spent over the years to come because our greatest tourist attraction must be our inland waterways system.  We have not got sunshine to offer our tourists and consequently we can offer only specialised holidays that are not available elsewhere.  Inland waterway holidays going through unspoiled country will be unique in Europe very shortly and anything that will be unique in Europe as a recreational facility will be of fantastic value. If we have here the potential in the form of the Royal Canal it should be looked at with a view to saving it.</P>
    <P>I would endorse what Deputy Fitzpatrick said about opening the Woodford Canal so as to link the Shannon with the Erne.  This, again, is to increase the inland waterway facilities <Col N="1136" /> available for tourists.  The more we have, the more we can expect to come to enjoy them.  It is an exciting prospect to think that one could journey from Limerick in the south-west of Ireland, on inland waterways, right through the Erne down to a place adjacent to Ballyshannon. At one stage it was possible to go north from the Erne waterways and eventually reach the Bann.  There might be room for discussion or consultation with the appropriate authorities in Northern Ireland to have a survey made of the old canals to see if they could be brought into use again.  It would be an exciting prospect to think there would be an inland waterway system linking Belfast with Limerick, with Carlow, Kilkenny, Waterford and other places.  The Office of Public Works have given an indication of what might be done in relation to the Grand Canal which had been neglected for a long time by CIE.  I would ask the Office of Public Works to turn their attention to the Royal Canal, even at this late stage.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the provision in the Estimates for the transfer of Departments to Athlone and Castlebar. This is now almost becoming a joke especially for those who live in the two towns concerned.  We would like to see the matter clarified one way or another. Quite a few years ago an announcement was made that it was proposed to transfer the Department of Education to Athlone but it was made without any detailed statement of the implications involved in such a transfer.  A certain amount of shadow boxing took place subsequently; sites were purchased and we were told plans were being drawn up.  However, all this has taken an inordinate number of years and I am wondering if the Government are having second thoughts about the proposed transfer.  If they are having second thoughts, or if difficulties which were not foreseen have cropped up, they owe it to the people of the two towns to tell them the position.</P>
    <P>Is it the position that the staff do not want to come?  Is it a fact that the cost would be out of proportion to the benefits to the two areas concerned? Is it a fact that it would be ridiculous <Col N="1137" /> from the administrative point of view to have a Department in the middle of the country away from Parliament which is the seat of government and where the Minister must necessarily spend much of his time?  These considerations have never been debated; honesty demands that they be debated openly and frankly.  If the answer is that a mistake was made in announcing the transfers, let the Government say so.</P>
    <P>I realise the Government must be in a difficulty in relation to this matter and I put forward the following suggestion. The Departments concerned, particularly the Department of Education, have various sub-departments which might be examined to see if they would be suitable for transfer.  If this is possible, a degree of decentralisation would be obtained.  The arrival of at least part of the Department would be a consolation to the people in Athlone and would be a boost to the local economy.  In addition, the administrative and social difficulties involved in moving the entire Department would be avoided and the capital cost would be considerably less.  I suggest this as a reasonable compromise and I hope it will be examined.</P>
    <P>The shadow boxing should cease and a definite decision should be made to transfer, not to transfer, or to transfer part of the Department.  It is a ridiculous situation to have such an important move hanging fire for so long, without any debate or any real indication from the Government about their intentions.  It is not fair to the people working in the Departments concerned, nor is it fair to the people of Athlone or Castlebar.  The transfer of a Government Department would be a major event in the social, economic, and cultural life of a town and the question mark hanging over this matter inhibits development to some extent. That question mark should be removed and we should be told clearly and plainly what the Government propose to do in this matter.</P>
    <P>The delay in carrying out development in county towns is to be regretted. I realise that a certain amount of delay is unavoidable but in certain strategic <Col N="1138" /> areas delays should not take place.  I refer to the provision of post offices in country towns generally and in particular to the provision of a post office in Longford town.  The Office of public Works acquired about two or three years ago a fine old building as a site for a new post office but it has been left closed up and idle since then. Naturally any building that is left in this manner becomes shabby and dilapidated and this is what is happening in this case.</P>
    <P>The building is situated in a strategic position in the town.  The Office of Public works owe it to a county town to ensure that they do not leave a key building in such an important situation closed up.  I would ask that this matter be given priority so that work might be commenced immediately or at least within the coming year.  This old building takes from the appearance of the thriving town of Longford and the Office of Public Works owe it to the people to ensure that a new building is erected on this fine site without any further delay.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled that there is no provision in the Estimate for reconstruction in the prisons.  Last evening, in my capacity as spokesman on Justice, I had occasion to visit Mountjoy Jail&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Geoghegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's comment that there is no provision in the Estimate for the reconstruction of prisons, I should like to inform him that this is a matter for the Department of Justice and it will be dealt with in a separate Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That explains its absence in this case.  However, the actual work of providing new buildings in our prisons is part of the task of the Office of Public Works.  On my visit to Mountjoy I was saddened to see the amount of destruction that had been wrought there in the recent riots. Some of the damage was destruction for destruction's sake.  It was frightening and pathetic to think that this could have happened.  It was understandable enough and it was rather shaming that, <Col N="1139" /> as a society, we have not been able to order our affairs better, that we have a section of our population who have to be imprisoned but who have so rejected normal values that they could go on this rampage.  This was particularly noticeable in relation to the dental surgery where the most modern equipment had been installed.  This equipment, which was not in any way connected with the idea of imprisonment and towards which the prisoners could not have any resentment, was completely wrecked.</P>
      <P>It was discouraging that this should have happened particularly when steps had been under way to improve the physical layout of Mountjoy Jail with a view to improving the rehabilitative aim of imprisonment.  It was pathetic to see the amount of damage that was caused.  It was frightening to realise the amount of pent-up fury and violence that was needed to cause such damage and one can only thank God that there were no casualties involved as a result of the violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will not pursue this matter too far lest he should open a debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Conney Mr. Conney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of doing that but I am leading up to a point I wish to make, that is, that it is essential that the physical conditions in Mountjoy Jail be changed so that the moves towards rehabilitation which had got under way there may be implemented without delay.  This is where the Office of Public Works come into the picture.  New buildings are required in the grounds of Mountjoy Jail for a corrective training unit and the jail itself requires to be remodelled. Indeed, I must pay tribute to the Office of Public Works because I understand that, with commendable speed, they have produced very attractive plans to get both of these aspects under way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent trouble in Mountjoy highlights the need for giving an urgent priority to this particular work. The building of the new corrective training unit must be got under way <Col N="1140" /> without any delay and the Office of Public Works must cut every ribbon of red tape that might be put up towards delaying that particular work. At the same time, the reconstructing or the changing of the old prison must be got under way immediately. Anyone who saw the result of the violence and realised how pathetic it was that such pointless violence could have been undertaken by adult men will know that there is something wrong with our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would point out that the Office of Public Works can only act as agents for the Department of Justice when they get instructions from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the Chair is concerned, we cannot see anything on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking from the knowledge that the Office of Public Works is the construction arm of the Government and that they have their instructions to build and remodel Mountjoy Jail.  The point I want to make is that there cannot be enough speed with regard to the situation there.  We must ensure that such a situation will never arise again. The ball is now in the court of the Office of Public Works to provide the physical surroundings so that those who are in charge of our prisons can get the reforms under way that will ensure that the pathetic scenes of dangerous violence which took place will never be repeated.  I submit that that is relevant to the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the goodwill and expertise which is available within the Office of Public Works can be harnessed and if there is a realisation of the urgent need for rebuilding Mountjoy, a record in public works construction will be established in this country.  Of all matters with which the Office of Public Works have to deal, I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that this particular one is of the highest priority.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to refuse to be inhibited by any normal administrative <Col N="1141" /> or procedural difficulties.  It is within the capacity of the Office of Public Works to erect the necessary buildings and I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to provide the political will to ensure that that capacity is used to its utmost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate many topics have been discussed. These have included such items as piers and flooding and now we have had the Mountjoy Jail issue.  I regret that I cannot agree with my colleague who wishes to have Mountjoy Jail turned into a holiday camp.  From what I have seen of the conditions of some of the Garda stations throughout the country I can only say that, if certain prisoners had to tolerate similar conditions, their friends would be parading outside the prisons carrying placards bearing such phrases as &ldquo;police brutality&rdquo;.  We must get our priorities right in this respect.</P>
      <P>The problem of flooding should be our first priority.  Now that we are entering Europe, land will become even more valuable than it is.  Where there is flooding with all its consequences, such as the causing of fluke and other diseases in animals, there will be great loss to our farmers.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that there are certain types of flooding that cannot be undertaken by the Office of Public Works but which, at the same time, cannot be undertaken by country councils.  Therefore, there must be new thinking in respect of this problem. The blade of grass that was frowned on in the past by the present Government is now very valuable indeed. Admittedly, a good scheme has been carried out in respect of the River Corrib and there have been other good schemes in various parts of the country but I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to endeavour to ensure that lands that are now the habitat of the snipe and the water duck will be drained to enable them to provide fodder for our cattle.  We all know how valuable cattle are today.  The value of land will also increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to deal now with navigation on the Corrib.  We have 30 miles of scenic beauty on the Corrib.  We have <Col N="1142" /> an island for every day in the year.  It may not be well known here but it is well known locally that we have 365 islands on that lough.  The water bus and some of the motor boats are finding it very hard to navigate the section of water known as the Cut, the bottle-neck before you enter the lough from the River Corrib.  This has been going on for some years but it is coming to a head now.  Navigation through that section will be impossible if something is not done.</P>
    <P>The Corrib navigation trustees are responsible for navigation but they cannot deal with this problem.  It is a job that should be given priority because tourism is our second biggest asset to agriculture.  That may not be the case this year but we should think ahead.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of that point because pressure will be brought to bear on the Office of Public Works to do something about it.</P>
    <P>The Shannon was mentioned and it reminds me of one Sunday morning at a by-election.  We were outside a church gate and we saw a heading in <i>The Irish Press:</i>&ldquo;Twenty million pounds to drain the Shannon.&rdquo;  I warned the people not to be fooled by the promise of £20 million to drain the Shannon.  I told them that there would not be as much water taken off their land as they shook on their foreheads leaving the church that morning.  It was true for me.  The Shannon will always be mentioned at general elections.</P>
    <P>That reminds me of another election, the general election.  The night before the general election a great circular was issued in my area promising hundreds of thousands of pounds for the pier at Rossaveel.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary knows what I am talking about.  The circular was not issued by the present holder of the office.  It was issued by the present Minister for Local Government.  They were to do a great job on the pier at Rossaveel.  The circular went to every household within miles of the area.  I do not know whether they know where the pier is now.  The Parliamentary Secretary might tell us what dusty <Col N="1143" /> files he has on that pier.  I should like to know when it is hoped to do something about it.  He will be dealing with that in reply to a question today so I will not stress it any more.</P>
    <P>Piers and slips off the west coast are a must.  They are the only berthage for small fishing craft off the coast.  If fishermen are to get the harvest of the sea, if they are to reap the harvest which they do not have to sow, they must have a safe pier or a slip for their small boats.  That applies all over the west coast.  In certain areas there is great need for a winch to pull in heavy boats at a time of threatened storms to save them from damage, or to pull them in for repair and repainting.</P>
    <P>I have noticed throughout the country that where drainage has been carried out big banks of spoil are left on the edge of the rivers which look very ugly.  When that spoil is taken from a river bed, could it not be used to level off some of the adjoining land that has been drained?  Some of those mounds are not beauties.  I think Deputy Geoghegan will agree with me that in Oughterard there are some very ugly heaps of spoil.  I should like this matter to be looked into.  I want to stress the priorities in regard to the drainage of land and the Corrib navigation. I mentioned the Garda stations.  Some hundreds of young gardaí have joined the Force and the conditions under which they must live in some of the stations would not entice them to remain in the Force.  It would be sad if young men were to leave the Force, having been trained at the State's expense, because of the conditions of the stations.  Let us get our priorities right.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will take note of the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this Vote comes up each year it suffers because of the fact that the operations of the Office of Public Works in very many cases do not coincide with the arrival of an election.  In most cases the operations of the Office of Public Works on any project tend to spread themselves over a period of five years perhaps. First there is the planning period and <Col N="1144" /> then the building period, and very often heavy capital expenditure is involved, and heavy physical work.  For that reason for politicians there is not as much mileage and not as many votes to be gained from the operations of this Vote as from the operations of other Votes.  The Office of Public Works always seem to be somebody's ill-cared for child.</P>
      <P>Garda barracks have been mentioned. Prior to the sad events and the violence and threatened violence which started to take place a few years ago there was a feeling that many country barracks could be disposed of, and that the building of new barracks should be looked at with a jaundiced eye, and with a clinical approach, so that a barracks would not be built which would not be needed later.  It was felt that the Department of Justice could provide the services that the gardaí in barracks provide by making available a squad car fitted with a radio.  In my view all this has been completely discredited.  We must have country barracks for the prevention of crime rather the detection of crime. It may well be that the small barracks with a few gardaí residing in the village, or perhaps an unmarried garda residing in the barracks, or the sergeant residing in married quarters, appeared to be a pretty weak force in an area for the prevention of crime. These lived with the people and, because of that, their operations never reached the courts.  This was the evolution because they were interested in the prevention of crime as compared with the squad cars which are involved in the detection of crime after it has happened.  On many occasions in the past the garda walked up to a young fellow and told him to stop whatever it was he was doing or he would take certain steps and many a time that young fellow was guided on the right path.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago there was a stop/go policy with regard to smaller barracks and the renovation of existing barracks. There is a crying need for more barracks and more gardaí in every area, gardaí engaged in the prevention of crime rather than the detection of crime.  Housing will have to be provided <Col N="1145" /> for the gardaí and there will have to be proper living quarters in the various barracks.  In the village of Omeath at the moment, because of the Border troubles, there are five sergeants and 14 gardaí.  These are working under very difficult conditions. They are housed all over the place. The station sergeant might as well be living in Grand Central Station because there is a constant flow of people in and out of the dayroom all day long and this is the only entrance there is to his own private accommodation. Some time ago it was suggested that that barracks should be extended.  I have asked questions here about Clogherhead Barracks.  This is a developing seaside resort.  It has several lounge bars and a large dancehall. The sailing there is excellent and people come there from Drogheda, Dundalk and Dublin.  It was intended to close the barracks there.  What we need now is a proper barracks.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will accept that there was an error in Government policy a few years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>On the subject of drainage, we have heard on many occasions before elections that the Shannon was going to be drained.  It has not yet been drained.  I have been here 18 years and I remember all the rivers that were drained so many times; they are still undrained.  That is not the fault of the Office of Public Works.  It is the fault of the politicians.  I hope we will have a statement on this, a statement which may even lose votes, to the effect that certain things will happen in one, four or five years hence.  In that way those affected by the present lack of drainage will be able to plan their economy <Col N="1146" /> and be saved investing capital uselessly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the <i>Asgard</i>, I remember when this was a decrepit hulk in the Coal Harbour in Dún Laoghaire and I commend the ex-Minister for Finance, Deputy Haughey, who commissioned this vessel as a training vessel.  All nations with seaboards have far more training facilities than we have.  Those who live beside the sea may have some experience of the sea but those who live ten miles inland have very little experience of the sea.  We should make every effort to get the most we can from the sea and one of the best ways to ensure that is by providing training facilities for our young people.</P>
    <P>The <i>Asgard</i> has been an unqualified success.  This year it will take crews of ten young people with four watch officers as far as Cherbourg and the Baltic.  These will be trained and disciplined in seamanship.  They will be taught how to navigate.  I suggest that a similar vessel should be provided on the south coast and eventually a similar vessel on the west coast.  The amount provided this year has been reduced by some £2,000.  The sum provided is a very small sum to spend on a facility like this.  A vessel similar to the <i>Asgard</i> would cost very little.  It could be bought secondhand.  Surely we should do everything to exploit the seas around our coast.  From a population point of view, very few of us are really interested in the sea.  Each Deputy here represents 20,000 to 30,000 people but very few Deputies are interested in the sea.  If we reflect the views of the 20,000 or 30,000 we represent &mdash; and I think we do, irrespective of which side we are on&mdash; there is very little interest but this interest should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I said there should be a sail training boat on the south coast and that this one should remain on the east coast and I did not mention the west coast because I happen to know that the efforts to interest young people and their parents in the operation of the <i>Asgard</i> on the west coast were not very successful.  I was successful through the good offices of the watch officer and Captain Eric Healy, an <Col N="1147" /> excellent man whom we are very lucky to have, in getting two Drogheda boys on a trip to Cherbourg because western boys were not coming forward. There was a fear that it was dangerous but there is more danger in walking across O'Connell Street.  There is no danger if you are disciplined, know your job and do as you are told.  I know that certain college heads were contacted in the west and in the first instance there was great interest and it was thought the boys would jump at this wonderful opportunity but when it came to the time of sailing there was nobody to go.  This interest must develop. If we want to be a seafaring nation, if we are to have what I should like to see our Irish shipping fleet develop into, coasters, and if we are to have Irish skippers and Irish skippers of fishing boats, we need this service.  If a parent can send a boy or girl all the way across the south coast of England to Cherbourg and back at 30s per day for 15 or 18 days, is that not a great service?  Is it not something that should be provided?</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the provision should be included in this Vote.  I know that one of the reasons why it is there was the interest shown by Deputy Haughey when Minister for Finance in this matter.  He got it into the Vote for Public Works and Buildings but I wonder if it should be included in the Education Vote for the development of sport.  However, I strongly hold this service is necessary for young people. It is an indication, which should be extended, from the Government that we are a seafaring nation, that not sufficient people are interested, but that we are going to develop our fishing fleet and that we need a nucleus of people who have had the experience of taking out a boat, setting sail and returning safely.</P>
    <P>On the subject of coast protection and coast erosion it is rather frustrating for any Deputy from a constituency with a seaboard when he tries to get any coast protection work done.  I am aware that the limitations are financial and there are wide areas of coast where large sums could be spent. In saying that more should be spent <Col N="1148" /> I know that there is probably very little vote-catching capacity in the spending of more and that is probably why it does not happen.  I would strengthen my argument by referring to the old saying that if you put all the Dutch in Ireland they would become millionaires while if you put all the Irish in Holland they would drown.  This implies that we would not look after our dykes as they do in Holland, where you have highly fertile land as much as 30 feet below sea level and where they have saltings outside the dykes building up over long periods which are being taken in and properly treated so as to become arable land in a very short time.</P>
    <P>More should be done here.  One can see what has been done in Wexford where in the case of one slob there was nothing but a wonderful duck shoot and where now there are hundreds of acres of wheat and barley grown every year and where there is a fertility situation in which this grain can be grown for many more years without the rotation that is necessary in any other farm land.  I could instance an area in my own constituency, the Marsh Farm at Dundalk, where outside a Dutch-type dyke there are about 5,000 acres of saltings. If you suggested to the Louth people that these saltings should be contained inside a further dyke and that in ten or 15 years if proper treatment were applied, there would be land there, you would perhaps be regarded as a fit subject for a mental home.  But the truth is that the last Act of Grattan's Parliament was to drain the parish of Dromiskin by the erection of a Dutch dyke.  To this day for one or two miles inshore you can find cockleshells and other evidence that the sea was there and that some of the most fertile arable land on the east coast is in this area of Dromiskin which lies between the catchment areas of the River Fayle and the Rivers Glyde and Dee. An excellent book on this was written by an ex-principal officer of the Department of Agriculture, Mr. O'Loan, and anybody who wishes to read it can, I am sure, procure it from the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>This is a simple example of what <Col N="1149" /> can be done in regard to coast erosion in this country.  It was expensive.  In fact, the Act specified that the owner of the land at that time, the Protestant Bishop of Armagh, would receive when the land had been drained that portion of the land remaining when the cost of the drainage would have been paid to the Government.  The cost far exceeded the value of the land at that time and the Bishop was left with his garden.  While that is true, today many hundreds of my constituents are deriving a decent living from that fertile land.  If we were living in Holland, outside that dyke the saltings would be subjected to the most intensive examination.</P>
    <P>Apart from the areas of 5,000 or 10,000 acres of saltings that do exist and which would involve major consideration, one comes to the small cases of coast erosion.  I could instance cases in County Louth where two or three farmers are constantly having land washed away.  One can get nothing done.  The county council, to defend their own roads or, in one case, their own cottages, did some protective work and that is all they are asked to do.  But when it comes to protecting the land of the State, if it is Land Commission Land, I think it is necessary to have a proper approach to the problem. Even if it means proposing to the farmers concerned that their annuities would be increased as a result of coast erosion work being carried out, that would be a sensible approach.  I do not know if the old saying about the people having the right to do wrong holds, but in 1972 I do not think anybody has the right to allow our good, arable land to be progressively washed away by the sea.  The Government have no right to allow this to happen either.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of sanction for loans for certain building works of local authorities and this sanction resides in the Board of Works. I have been extremely disappointed over the last 12 months in relation to sanctions for loans that were to issue and did not issue in time for housing in the Drogheda Corporation area and in the Louth County Council area.  I find that to get to the stage of loan sanction is not that difficult.  I had <Col N="1150" /> to approach the Ceann Comhairle recently because questions of mine had been ruled out of order on the ground that they were repeats.  When I pointed out to the Ceann Comhairle that these questions were in respect of loan sanction while sanction for the tender had been given months before he was good enough to rule, properly so and I thank him for it, that these questions could be asked.  The Office of Public Works process these.  Again, there is a delay that is related to finance.  There is a reluctance on the part of the Government, the Parliamentary Secretary, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government to come out and say: &ldquo;As funds come forward, as revenue is available, I will sanction these loans and you, whichever local authority you are, are sixth on the list and you may have to wait six months.&rdquo;  That approach would seem to be a far better one than the irritating approach of fighting in a war of cotton wool, asking questions here, badgering Ministers, when the real truth is that money as it becomes available is applied and that no matter what Government was over there the same situation would exist.</P>
    <P>The right thing to do would be to tell the people what exactly the position is.  I said, on arterial drainage, that if a farmer is told it will be five or ten years before a particular river is drained he can plan accordingly.  If a local authority is told that money will be forthcoming in nine months time in respect of a housing scheme and that there will not be a deviation of more than a fortnight either way, that housing authority, whether it is controlled by the Government or by the Government's opponents, will be happy rather than having the fairytale situation in which nobody admits there is no money in the kitty.  The flow of money through the Government is so huge at present that there are times when there is no money in the kitty and, of course, there are times when there is plenty of money in the kitty.  That will happen no matter what Government is in power.  The right thing to do would be to tell the people rather than play tricks with them and leave them waiting for loan sanction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1151" /> I should like to refer to maintenance in relation to arterial drainage and to say that in respect of the Glyde and Dee drainage scheme I am not satisfied with maintenance.  This drainage scheme was opened by James Dillon as Minister for Agriculture and it has benefited a large number of farmers both in the upper reaches and near the estuary at the village of Annagassan where the Glyde and Dee join and meet the sea.  The tributaries which should be drained, and are the subject of attention by the staff of the Glyde and Dee, are not being drained as well as they should.  This is not a criticism of the staff.  It is a criticism of the amount of money that is available.  I have had complaints in relation to these tributaries which are periodically given attention but minute attention by the staff of the Glyde and Dee.  The benefits which should accrue to farmers do not accrue.  A farmer is looking at a perfectly drained major river and the tributary of that river which is the subject of attention by the staff of the Glyde and Dee is choked up. It is very irritating for a farmer to see running through his land a large river with a good fast scour and a tributary which should be attended to not being attended.  I believe the amount of money should be increased and that the level of clearance that is demanded by the engineers of the Glyde and Dee drainage board or Office of Public Works should be increased. I have not got information on other rivers but I am not satisfied with maintenance and I think the amount of money for maintenance should be increased.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to Drogheda port.  I am a bit hazy about what is happening in relation to the work that is going on at Drogheda port on the drainage and cleaning of the River Boyne.  There are complaints from the mussel men at Mornington that they are being interfered with.  Of course it must be accepted that one cannot make an omelette without breaking eggs and I suppose if you are to deepen the river so that larger ships can come in and keep it maintained you will have to remove some mussels which <Col N="1152" /> could be removed at low tide by these fishermen and sold.  I know there has been a launch, the property of the Office of Public Works, at the mouth of the Boyne at Mornington for some months and that they are taking levels.  An advertisement in relation to the taking over of the foreshore appeared in the newspapers and when certain people who were invited to be objectors if they so desired inquired they were told that the advertisement was an error. At the same time, we are working in Drogheda towards the provision of the new port at Mornington rather than the port up river at the town.  This will mean a very big increase of traffic on the Boyne.  We have got as far as being able to say that the probability is that the produce of Tara Mines will go out through the port of Drogheda. All this requires fast action.</P>
    <P>The port of Mornington should be completed without delay.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give an expose of what the position is and how soon we can expect that this job will be completed.  I know it is a long-term job.  I, at low tide, at a spring tide, stood on the bar at Drogheda three-quarters of a mile out with the water not up to my waist about 20 years ago.  I know the channel there has been deepened successfully and that great work has been done.  However, with the arrival of Tara Mines on the scene and having regard to the fact that we have a big container ship a day now running to Preston and that Drogheda had, last week, 14 ships in at the same time, it is necessary that this project should be speeded up.  While it is not exactly in the Parliamentary Secretary's area of operation he has got a launch down there, he has advertised, as far as I know, in relation to the foreshore, and he should utilise his reply to this Vote to give an exposé of what the position is.  The people of Drogheda and the people of Louth and Meath will be strongly behind him in the development of this port.  It is important to realise the degree of scour provided by the river Boyne.</P>
    <P>There are vast areas of sloblands which capture, particularly at spring tides, huge volumes of water which, <Col N="1153" /> when the tide recedes, flow out into the River Boyne, providing scour of such dimension that any drainage done on the River Boyne, any depth produced in the River Boyne, any improvements which allow bigger ships to come into the River Boyne is far more permanent than would be the case in other ports.  The problem, particularly with sand dredging and with the sort of mussel dredging where mud coagulates into a pretty solid mass, is that when you remove it, if you have not got a huge volume of water to scour it out, you will be dredging again in five or ten years. That is not the position on the River Boyne.  The Boyne drainage scheme which will be completed in a few years and which will be done under this Vote, will mean a far greater scour because up river the waters that fall by way of rain and that flow from the tributaries into the River Boyne will come down much faster.</P>
    <P>I have read the report of the consultants to Drogheda Corporation in this regard and I find that their prognostication is that at certain points in the town, notably St. Mary's Bridge, the faster flow of the volume of water down the River Boyne from up river, because of the Boyne drainage scheme, will raise the levels at spring tides at certain times by as much as one foot to 15 inches.  That is a great deal of water.  It is surprising how many million gallons of water that would be as far as scour is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would earnestly request, as perhaps my most serious contribution to this debate, that the Parliamentary Secretary, in respect of the items he is dealing with on the Boyne drainage and the improvement of the Boyne port, bearing in mind that the Minister for Transport and Power is also involved, should avail of the opportunity when replying of giving us his best exposé of the exact present situation because when the extra traffic is generated by Tara Mines we will need extra facilities.  The improvement of the port of Drogheda and the port of the River Boyne is something that will never be regretted because of the scour that is there and the fact that drainage and dredging carried out <Col N="1154" /> there will be permanent rather than temporary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> The importance of the Office of Public Works is shown by the length of this debate.  I should like to start on the subject of Leinster House, the first item mentioned in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech.  I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary and his predecessor on the many renovations which have been carried out which benefit the staff and the Members of the House.  These improvements have been welcome and have made life in the Dáil easier.</P>
      <P>There is some suggestion of erecting a grille on the public gallery.  In my view the existing arrangements are very suitable.  I would not like to see them changed.  I doubt if a ceilinghigh grille would afford greater protection. It would detract from the appearance of the House.  The public in the gallery would not be in a position to hear the debates.  In my view the gallery should be left as it is.</P>
      <P>I want to comment on the interview room in Leinster House.  As it was originally, the interview room gave more privacy to Deputies interviewing constituents.  The room is too public a place.  It is not an ideal situation to have members of three political parties interviewing their constituents openly in one room.  It is an embarrassment to Deputies to have to interview constituents in that room.  It is impossible to preserve privacy in making telephone calls from that room. Deputies do not want to listen to other Deputies' phone calls but it is impossible at times to make telephone calls that will not be overheard.  I should like to see cubicles erected in the interview room.  I would prefer the room as it was originally, with cubicles in which Deputies could privately interview constituents.  That is the only criticism I have to make of the House.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to examine the possibility of making more suitable provision for Deputies to interview their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the staff here for their efficiency and courtesy <Col N="1155" /> over the past year.  The manner in which they have served in the House, under trying conditions at times, is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I now come to the question of public parks under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public Works.  I shall refer mainly to St. Stephen's Green and the Phoenix Park.  We are fortunate to have a park of the size of the Phoenix Park.  Better car parking facilities are required in the outer section of the Phoenix Park, at the Castleknock and Chapelizod Gates.  The public tend to converge in the People's Gardens and the area around the Wellington Monument. There are large open spaces in the outer section which could be utilised to a greater extent.  A problem of transport arises, especially for children who have not the facility of a private car.  There is no public transport going right through the Phoenix Park.  Mothers with children find that they have to stay near the Parkgate Street Gate or near the Chapelizod Gate.  In order that the Phoenix Park could be utilised fully, there would have to be some arrangement for public transport.  I am convinced that the Office of Public Works would like to see the Phoenix Park used to the full extent.  It is one of the finest parks in the world.  Children should be facilitated in getting to the farthest parts of the park.  The People's Gardens and the area around the Wellington Monument can become congested.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the decision to lay out a golf course along the Liffey.  This will be a welcome amenity and something that is long overdue in this city.  Golf clubs in this city are rather exclusive and membership is expensive.  It is desirable that municipal or public golf courses should be provided. In Scotland the average golfer can get in his game of golf at a reasonable charge.  When this course is completed the average wage-earner in Dublin will be able to use it.  I realise that golf is an expensive game and that it is difficult for a person to be accepted as a member in the golf clubs.  I hope when this course is completed that it will help to cater for those people who <Col N="1156" /> have not been able up to now to avail of the facilities of golf clubs in this area.  It may be found that the new course will not be able to cope with the numbers of people who may wish to play golf but, at any rate, it is a step in the right direction and I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on what he has done.</P>
    <P>Strict supervision is necessary in the Phoenix Park and in St. Stephen's Green.  Complaints have been made to me, and I know them to be true from personal experience as I have young children, that it is not always safe to allow young people to be left unattended in the parks.  In this connection I am referring to children between the ages of 10 and 15 years. It has been brought to my notice that certain elements are roaming in the parks even in the afternoons.  Much more strict supervision should be maintained at least until 8 p.m. in order to ensure that young children can play in safety.</P>
    <P>There is also a new element in our society nowadays &mdash; the group known as &ldquo;skinheads&rdquo; who can be seen in St. Stephen's Green every afternoon. Every effort should be made to ensure that these vandals should be eradicated from our society, that our children will not be subjected to blackguardism, as is happening at the moment.  Even adults have been attacked in St. Stephen's Green.  The Office of Public Works, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, should ensure that these elements will not be tolerated in our society or allowed to roam in our public parks and our streets.  These people believe they are a law unto themselves but we must ensure that they do not prevent our children from playing in the parks.</P>
    <P>The canals will soon come under the jurisdiction of the Office of Public Works and this step must be welcomed. The Minister for Transport and Power informed me recently that he intends to introduce legislation to this effect in the next session of the Dáil. I am concerned about one section of the canal from Suir Road Bridge to St. James's Harbour.  I am told that the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with the Minister for Transport and <Col N="1157" /> Power, will transfer this section to Dublin Corporation.  This section of the canal does not serve any special purpose and I am informed that it is the corporation's decision to close it.  When it is transferred to the corporation I hope they will be able to lay out a park along this section.</P>
    <P>The River Camac is one of the main causes of pollution of the Liffey.  Some improvement can be effected when the new sewer under the Grand Canal is completed.  The Camac runs through Bluebell, a highly industrialised area, and this is bound to cause serious pollution in the Liffey.  It is vitally important that the main sewer under the Grand Canal should be completed as soon as possible.  Some effort must be made to reduce the pollution in the Liffey&mdash;at present when one passes over O'Connell Bridge one can see that the river is grossly polluted.</P>
    <P>Greater publicity should be given to the people regarding our public buildings and monuments.  Dublin Castle is open to the public at certain times and this fact should be given more publicity because many of our citizens have never visited the wonderful apartments in the castle.  Also, tourists should be told that the castle may be visited.  In my constituency we have many historic buildings&mdash;places such as Tailor's Hall, St. Audoen's Christ-church and St. Patrick's Cathedral. These places are situated in one of the most historic places in Dublin and greater publicity should be given to them.  Very little material on the historical background of these places is available and in this connection, perhaps, something could be done in conjunction with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The Tailor's Hall is one of the most interesting buildings in Dublin.  I understand that is being restored now with the help of private subscribers and restoration work is being carried out also to St. Catherine's Church in Thomas Street.  I do not know whether any public moneys have been contributed to assist in the work.  At any rate, the people involved in the work are to be congratulated on their efforts and every effort should be made to help them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1158" /> The question of Garda stations has been raised again this year.  It is desirable that there be proper standards and facilities available to gardaí especially now that the force is being expanded.  I expect there will be a big increase in the number of gardaí in Dublin because they are badly needed in all parts of the city to deal with the vandalism that is occurring.  However, the increased numbers will create overcrowding at police stations.  In my constituency there are four Garda stations that must be the busiest in the whole country.  These are Kilmainham, Kevin Street, Mountjoy and the Bridewell. Improvements have been carried out to the station at Kevin Street but there are many improvements that could be carried out in respect of the other stations.  It is desirable that there should be at least a reasonable standard of comfort at the station so that gardaí can relax when they are off duty.  Gardaí on night duty in particular require a comfortable place to return to for their break.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that plans have been completed for the reconstruction of Mountjoy Jail.  It is regrettable that a riot should have taken place there. However, now that the prison is almost empty, the Board of Works have a glorious opportunity of carrying out major reconstruction works there so that in future the emphasis there can be more on rehabilitation than on punishment.  I hope this is what is in mind.  I have never been in the prison but I know from people who work there that it was very much overcrowded up to the time of the riot.  Let us hope that the reconstructed prison will be as good as any to be found in any part of the world.</P>
    <P>It is gratifying to note that the Office of Public Works are taking a keen interest in the provision of schools for mentally retarded children.  Any assistance that can be given in this direction is to be welcomed heartily.  On a few occasions I have been involved with an organisation who were interested in providing funds for a school on the Navan Road.  Anyone who has been through hospitals or schools for mentally handicapped children will realise <Col N="1159" /> how grave is the need for adequate facilities for them.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on what has been achieved by his section.  One matter, however, which I might mention again is that of the interview room at Leinster House. This room is not a suitable one for Deputies of different parties to have to interview constituents in simultaneously. I would like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider having the room changed in a way that would make it more suitable for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the J.F. Kennedy Memorial Hall that is to be built in the future in commemoration of the late President of the US for whom we all had the utmost regard and respect.  However, I should like to put it on record that I am, and always will be, in total opposition to the erection of any further buildings of any type in the Phoenix Park.  It has been said that this memorial concert hall is to be built on a site near the Wellington Monument.  At this stage it might be no harm to mention a few details concerning the Phoenix Park.  This Park comprises approximately 1,760 acres of which, sadly, more than 500 acres are not open to the public.  Most of these 500 acres are taken up by Aras an Uachtaráin, by the residence of the American Ambassador and by the residence of the Papal Nuncio.  The Zoological Gardens and St. Mary's Hospital are also in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad to see any Government continuing something which they decried in the past, namely, the fencing off of public lands for private use.  In former years the park rangers built houses, which were very quickly extended. In order to graze some cattle they enclosed a small acreage in proximity to their houses and, like their houses, this acreage was gradually increased. In the case of Aras an Uachtaráin over 10 per cent of the total acreage of the Phoenix Park is fenced off with electric fencing, 205 acres out of a total of 1,760 acres.  In the case of the American Embassy over 100 acres are enclosed.  The acreage <Col N="1160" /> attached to the Nunciature is approximately the same.  I do not know what rent the American Embassy pays.</P>
    <P>I do not know the cost of maintaining Aras an Uachtaráin.  One thing I do know is that the fencing off of any further acreage for any purpose whatsoever is just not on.  There are only 1,000 odd acres left for the public.  It is sad that nearly half the total acreage is unavailable to the public.  I have no animosity towards anyone living in the Phoenix Park, but it ill becomes any Deputy of the Fianna Fáil Party to decry the use of a small acreage there for horse riding, complaining that the sod is being cut up by the horses' hooves.  On one occasion, when I was in the Phoenix Park, I saw a group of 24 riders exercising there.  They were in no one's way.  They moved along by the Nunciature and out by the American Embassy, an area that is not used for anything else.  Many of those using this recreational facility are constituents of mine.  Some of them are nurses with very irregular hours of work who find it difficult to engage in systematic and regular recreation.  I would condemn utterly anyone who would try to forbid horse riding in the Phoenix Park.  Indeed the Board of Works might consider maintaining the riding schools there.  Already the ordinary people are forbidden entry to 205 acres which are enclosed by an electric fence.  Nobody wants to take away from the status of the President. Let us equally not take away from the status of Irish citizens and let us do nothing which would infringe upon their rights.</P>
    <P>I would also condemn the suggestion that the Kennedy Memorial Hall should be erected in the Phoenix Park. The ideal location would be St. Anne's. It is about time the north side got some public buildings.  Nearly all new buildings are erected on the south side of the city.</P>
    <P>I suggested as far back as 1969 the erection of a municipal golf course in the Phoenix Park.  Certainly there should be a pitch and putt course for those people who would like to play golf but cannot afford to do so, to say nothing of membership of golf courses being a closed shop.  A club is a club. <Col N="1161" /> The definition of a club is that it is a group of people.  They stay with the group they are with, and they do not like taking in new members.  Therefore, you have to be proposed and seconded by existing members, and it can be very difficult for people to get into a club in the city or on the outskirts of the city.  I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the general development of the Phoenix Park.  The provision of an 18 hole municipal golf course on the extension lands of the park is one of the best things this Government have done in the provision of sporting and recreational facilities for the city of Dublin in a long time.</P>
    <P>If the Government could change their mind about putting this golf course inside the walls of the park, as they did because certain objections were raised&mdash;sporting, recreational, academic and cultural buildings are permitted to be erected under the byelaws of the park&mdash;and decide to put it in the extension of the Phoenix Park lands, then they can do the same about the John F. Kennedy Memorial Hall.  The total estimated cost of the golf course is £80,000.  The total expenditure up to 31st March, 1972, on the State Memorial to the late President Kennedy is £117,000, almost £37,000 more; almost 50 per cent, certainly 40 per cent more.  What have we got for that £117,000?  Only a set of plans.  This year we are to spend a further £5,000.  For the £80,000, the estimated cost of the golf course, which is no cheap undertaking, we will have an 18 hole golf course and a club house.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to tell us what the £117,000 has been spent on.</P>
    <P>You could almost build two 18 hole municipal golf courses for that money.  We have not seen any sign of the memorial hall.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to place in the library a map of the 18 hole golf course so that Deputies can see it and bring interested parties to see it. I want to compliment him and his officials on the consultations that took place with interested parties. This will be one of the great successes in Dublin city.  The Parliamentary <Col N="1162" /> Secretary has his heart in the right place in regard to the provision of this facility.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is no provision for repairs to the Botanic Gardens.  The glasshouses are very old.  I went there a few times with my family and I consider that certain renovations are necessary, particularly with regard to the heating of the hothouses and the structure of the glasshouses. An accident could easily occur there.  On weekends the gardens are crowded.  People studying medicine, zoology or botany go there to study the plants.  There are wonderful facilities and the staff are very helpful. I should not like to see one of the glasshouses toppling down on a crowd of visitors.  I know they are very old and I know that in many instances the timber is suspect.  A full survey should be carried out of the glasshouses and hothouses to make sure that they are structurally sound and to avoid accidents.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Parliamentary Secretary on the plans for the Phibsboro' Post Office.  He may remember that I mentioned to him in the past that there was a need for a big post office in Phibsboro', which is in the corner of my constituency. Whether it is in the corner or the middle it will get the same attention. I am grateful to him for the £60,000 odd which he proposes to spend on it. He might also provide a post office in Ballymun instead of the subpost office which is there at present.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the way the Garda barracks in Chapelizod was disposed of.  I am reasonably familiar with the problems in Chapelizod.  Deputy Fitzpatrick of the Fianna Fáil Party mentioned the skinheads roaming around Dublin.  He said they are new to the city but they are not.  They have been there for years and years.  They are out again because the police force are so tied up with administration work, traffic duty, office work and other work.  Even though they may be numerically increased, the efficiency of the Garda Síochána does not appear to have increased in relation to their numbers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> The Chapelizod Garda barracks provided the entrance to an excellent housing site, the Gambles Buildings. The Gambles were due for demolition but the corporation could not take them over because they could not find out who the owner is.  It is a site of about an acre and a half.  There is a great need for new houses in Chapelizod.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of this because it is just north of his constituency.  I made very strong representations to the Taoiseach, the Department of Justice, the Department of Local Government and the corporation to ensure that the Garda barracks at Chapelizod would be handed over to the corporation to provide an entrance into the acreage at the back of the Gambles Buildings so that vehicles could get in and out and building could commence.</P>
    <P>It was handed over to a body of people who do excellent work.  They must be complimented on their work to rehabilitate children who fall by the wayside.  However, in the circumstances priority should have been given to the building of houses for the people in Chapelizod so that they could stay close to their friends.  We all know that Chapelizod is a unique type of village within the city boundaries.  It is a unique type of community, very closeknit and going back over hundreds of years.  In general the manner in which the community has been treated by different Departments in regard to Garda barracks is disgraceful.  The matter of closing down Garda barracks is one for the Department of Justice and I shall not go into it here.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the Department on the progress of the <i>Asgard</i> training course.  The <i>Asgard</i> last year won two sail training races, both from Portsmouth to Cherbourg and in both cases there were about ten other competitors.  The second race was in September in very difficult weather conditions and it showed the skill and expertise of the skipper who is to be complimented.  An Coiste Asgard should also be complimented on their administration of the £6,500 <Col N="1164" /> given to them by the Department of Defence.  I should like to have an increase in the amount of money made available to this committee because the type of service provided by the <i>Asgard</i> for our youth is unparalleled. A boy or girl aged between 12 and 18 can go for a week on this boat, to learn all about navigation, sailing, seas, beacons and all the associated skills for approximately £1 a day with food also provided.  This is an excellent service.  Last year when I had the privilege of being navigation officer on a course of the same type around the Kerry coast from Fenit to Crosshaven I was pleased to find the boat was completely full and that places were at a premium.</P>
    <P>As this is the Olympic year when the <i>Asgard</i> will be representing Ireland in the associated Olympic races at Kiel during the latter part of the summer and as equipment is expensive&mdash;I should say they will need altogether four crews: one for the race from Portsmouth to Kiel; two for the events around Kiel and a fourth crew to come back to Portsmouth&mdash;I should like to see the amount of money increased if only to set the precedent that when Olympic year comes around and the <i>Asgard</i> will fly the tricolour in the Olympics sail training course races, they will have sufficient money to do the job properly.  I should be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would use his good offices with the Minister for Defence to see that one of the naval vessels would travel over to support this Olympic team, as is the practice in other countries, and also to endeavour to have the amount of money for An Coiste Asgard increased during this year.</P>
    <P>I think there should be two skippers, a senior skipper and a junior skipper. It is too much for one skipper to do all the clerical work, filling up one crew, putting in substitutes for those who drop out and trying to take out a competitive boat from Dún Laoghaire to Portsmouth there to wait for his crew to arrive.  The work done by the present skipper is excellent; I do not know if anybody else in the country could do it.  A junior skipper could be appointed capable of taking full <Col N="1165" /> responsibility so that one skipper could administer one crew on land while the other would take them to sea and the duty could be rotated.  At present the Parliamentary Secretary may not be aware that if the engine breaks down, say, in Tralee or Dingle the skipper must come from there to Dublin to get a new part and go back there and try to find some maintenance man in the area to install it.  Sailing is a rather hazardous sport and equipment must be top-class at all times.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to investigate that situation.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the number of public meetings held in Dublin in the past few years.  Speakers are regularly standing at Middle Abbey Street with crowds around them and the same thing happens in O'Connell Street.  I should like to see the provision of facilities something like what is found at Hyde Park, some place where these people would be in off the road and where they could talk at length if they wished without disrupting traffic.  We talk at great length here but traffic is not obstructed and the normal functioning of city life is not held up.  I should like the Board of Works to investigate the possibility of setting up a speakers' corner, something like that which exists in Hyde Park where people can hold public meetings without interfering with traffic.  It is very frustrating to drive through the centre of the city wondering what all the traffic is about when the street is congested because some meeting or march is in progress. This situation is becoming worse rather than better.</P>
    <P>The Board of Works are responsible for the renovation of Mountjoy Jail. Recently I had occasion to visit the skyscraper at Phibsboro' and looking down into the jail one could see that it was quite antiquated.  One could turn back the clock and see the prisoners filing out under guard.  The only thing missing was the iron ball and chain.  It is completely antiquated and depressing for the inmates.  I am totally against locking anybody up; if a person is psychopathic he should have treatment in an institution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is no wonder a riot occurred there.  Earlier Deputy Fitzpatrick said it was overcrowded and to my mind it was deliberately allowed to become overcrowded.  There are about 57 people in that jail for drug offences and there is no provision for the treatment they require.  They are just locked up.  One of the first assaults after the keys had been obtained was on the jail dispensary.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should have a look at the central heating in Leinster House.  It is exhausting.  I had visitors here yesterday and they were gasping for breath.  Numerous myths have sprung up about this.  It is said that if you open a window is gets hotter. I was told in one of the Minister's offices yesterday that when windows are opened the heat goes up in a neighbouring room.  I do not understand how that can happen.  I work in an area where there is uncontrolled central heating of a type similar to this.  One of the complications here, I understand, is that the old part of the building must be kept at a certain level of heat so that the staff can work in comfort, and I am in favour of this, but the new part of the building, which is better insulated, has the same temperature. After one hour in this House I am literally exhausted from the heat. Too much central heating is unhealthy. Surveys have been carried out in Zurich and in Germany which show that central heating can be unhealthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to have a look at the central heating and also at the telephones here, many of which have broken down, and see whether we could be provided with greater facilities for interviewing constituents.  I was very surprised when I came in here in 1969 to see many Deputies sitting around one table in the Fine Gael Party room writing letters.  Even at school one had a desk to oneself.  In the library the <Col N="1167" /> lights are far too hot, beaming back from the table at you.  They are far too close to the tables.  The tables are good but the lamps are hot enough to heat the library.  Otherwise, the furniture is excellent.  To read or study one should have a light that comes from behind, not a glare in front of you. This is all right if you are trying to display something like jewellery.  The Parliamentary Secretary should ask his Department to have a look at these lights and possibly have them removed or toned down and then to provide reading lamps.  Otherwise the facilities provided in the library are excellent. The new bell that calls us in here is tremendous except that it sounds, at times, like my front door bell.</P>
    <P>I think the efficiency of many TDs in carrying out constituency and research work is hampered by the fact that there are no facilities.  The interview room is inadequate.  The problem probably is that we only sit three days a week and the massive expenditure involved in providing TDs with offices, secretarial assistance and research facilities would not be justified.  For four days of the week a TD is not here. Some effort should be made to increase the efficiency of TDs.  I have never experienced such frustration in trying to research or prepare something than I have experienced since I came in here.  You must go to the National Library, to Trinity Library and back up to this library, get your references, write away to England for certain research work, try to keep your own filing system and brief case maybe in your car, upstairs in the party room or in a locker.  No matter how hard one tries to be tidy there is a lot of unnecessary slogging work and time wasted.  I would suggest that some secretarial service should be made available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary at page 11 of his brief mentions the gaining of access to public buildings for the handicapped. As one who has been making representations to the Minister for Local Government on behalf of associations like the Irish Wheelchair Association and associations catering for the deaf, the blind, and so on, I know the Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated on his initiative in getting the commissioners to accept his point of view.  I would refer, first of all, to wheelchair cases and come as near as possible to home, that is, Leinster House.  When one meets a constituent in a wheelchair or a group of people in wheelchairs one has to physically lift them up the steps at the entrance to Leinster House.  I would strongly urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take note of the need for a ramp at the front entrance and, indeed, at every entrance.  It is not good enough in 1972 not to have this.  I do not say this by way of carping criticism but as a constructive observation.  A ramp there is absolutely essential.  We should not exclude our physically handicapped citizens from entry to Leinster House.  They should have full access to the public gallery in Dáil Éireann and to the two galleries in the Seanad.  This is their right as citizens of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of them are in full-time gainful employment.  In quite a number of instances they pay the average tax to the State arising out of their employment. Sympathy is of no avail if it is not accompanied by action.  The <Col N="1169" /> Parliamentary Secretary has translated his sympathy into action.  I welcome his instruction to the commissioners and the sympathetic receipt of the instruction by the commissioners that in future buildings associated with the Office of Public Works will have access for the physically handicapped. The requirements do not end with the provision of a ramp at the entrance to a building.  The question of providing parking space must be considered.</P>
    <P>Suitable stairs, non-slip flooring, suitably placed mirrors and toilet facilities, public telephones, the placing of light switches, warning signals, audible and visual, for blind persons and identification of objects by touch for blind persons, must be provided. The Parliamentary Secretary has given the instruction that access to buildings must be provided for the physically handicapped but more is required.  The facilities I have mentioned should also be incorporated in public buildings. We could start in Leinster House by providing these facilities for handicapped persons.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with a number of other Deputies I have made strong representations to the Department of Health and they have been more than sympathetic.  We also made representations to the Department of Local Government and the Minister for Local Government recently issued instructions in relation to access to buildings under his control.  The Parliamentary Secretary is to be congratulated on the initiative he has taken in instructing that all public buildings under his control will have access for the handicapped. Provision must be made not only for paraplegics but for the blind, the deaf and the mentally handicapped. This is a big demand and money is required.  These people are entitled to consideration.  Those handicapped persons who contribute to the revenue are entitled to consideration in that context but those who are not in a position to contribute to the revenue are also entitled to be treated as full citizens.</P>
    <P>I want to go on record as being one of the instigators of the simultaneous translating system in Leinster House. <Col N="1170" /> The provision of this translating system has come in for a considerable amount of criticism during the debate. I want to say that I supported the proposal to install such a system 100 per cent, without qualification or apology. If we are to give the national language its proper place, not merely give lip service to it, it is time a translating system was provided for Deputies who wish to speak in the Irish language.  I was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which proposed the simultaneous translating system for the House.  I was one of those who voted for it on the committee. In my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, I am the Government's representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. I agreed with the Government decision and projected the Government view.  In my personal capacity, I have no apology to make to anyone. The translating system will be installed during the summer recess.  I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I should like to support Deputy Fitzpatrick's criticism of the interview room as being too public a place. Privacy is very important.  Constituents with urgent problems who cannot wait to come to the Deputy's clinic on Saturday or Sunday come to Leinster House to meet their Deputy. It is embarrassing to have to discuss these problems in low tones so that one will not be overheard.  There should be separate sound-proof cubicles.  Deputies from the three political Parties use the room.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Parliamentary Secretary did intend doing something with the room.  He took a view which I considered the right view at the time but I have changed my mind. The Parliamentary Secretary took the view that the erection of cubicles in that room would detract from its aesthetic beauty.  That is a valid point of view.  The room is a beautiful room and contains a magnificent ceiling.  I realise that space is at a premium in Leinster House.  If separate rooms could be provided for Deputies to interview constituents, that would be the ideal solution.  In the meantime Deputies will tolerate what they have <Col N="1171" /> got.  The room is grand but confidentiality is eroded.  It is impossible to make a private telephone call from that room.  I do not for one moment suggest that Deputies eavesdrop; on the contrary, Deputies have a high code of honour in this respect; but it is impossible not to overhear.</P>
    <P>In regard to my constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I welcome the extra provision of £10,000 for the removal of the final obstacles on the East Pier Terminal.  The Parliamentary Secretary gave an undertaking some years ago in relation to this and he has honoured his undertaking. He is to be congratulated and, indeed, thanked by the people of Dún Laoghaire for the attitude he has taken. Also, I should like to express appreciation for the car ferry terminal at St. Michael's Wharf.  It is a credit to everyone.  There were certain public representatives a number of years ago who would not have had a car ferry terminal at Dún Laoghaire at all.  That is somewhat like the no semi-State hotel syndrome which also prevailed there and prevailed to the detriment of the provision of a semi-State CIE hotel in Dún Laoghaire.  That is the sort of backward thinking that I hope we have got over.  However, not to be abrasive or critical, I welcome the development there.  It is a credit to the Board of Works and to the workmanship of the employees there.  This development has become a tourist attraction, because people go on top of the terminal to have a look at cars coming in at regular intervals.  People congregate there and consequently people are brought into Dún Laoghaire as a result of which they spend a few new pence here and there, and, of course, that is welcomed by the local traders.</P>
    <P>Our thanks are due, therefore, to the Parliamentary Secretary for the manner in which he has dealt with the whole environment of Dún Laoghaire harbour.  He has preserved an amenity very tidily and efficiently.  There is no question of vista pollution.  It is all there: there is a walk along the pier; in the middle, a number of sailing <Col N="1172" /> clubs; on one side there is the car ferry terminal bringing in badly needed tourists into the country and, on the other side, again enclosed by the environs of the piers and the walks, a small industrial estate.  It would be wonderful if this had been overlooked by a semi-State hotel which would have attracted, as I have said on many occasions in this House, much needed capital into the pockets of local traders and the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I undertook to speak for a very short period, so I merely wish to say that the Parliamentary Secretary has shown, by his capacity in his office, that he is a modern and liberal thinker, and this has been reflected in his brief here and in the type of work he has been undertaking.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this Estimate and to say that, on the whole, with the exception of maybe one or two, they have been very constructive and very helpful to me and my officials, and we shall certainly bear in mind all the various suggestions that have been made.  I wish to express a very special word of thanks to Deputy L'Estrange for taking such a very keen interest in the affairs of the Office of Public Works and for his complimentary remarks about me and the officials of the board.  I should like to assure him of my full co-operation and that of the officers of the board in his new assignment as the &ldquo;Shadow&rdquo; for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was puzzled by Deputy L'Estrange's reference on last Thursday week to an expenditure from the vote of over £18 million for the year 1966-67, and I was satisfied that it could not possibly have been anything approaching that figure.  I have since discovered that the explanation lies in a fault in the stencil of my reply to question No. 134 by the Deputy on Tuesday, 16th May, 1972. The fault was a mark which could have been taken as the numeral 1 and it appeared at the start of the figure £8,750,953.  Not the slightest blame attaches to the Deputy for taking this figure to be £18,750,953, and I am sorry <Col N="1173" /> that he was inadvertently misled into doing so.  I have taken steps to ensure that this fault is corrected in the revised Official Dáil Report for May 16th.</P>

      <P>Unlike previous years, I should like to deal with arterial drainage in a global way rather than with each individual river, with the exception of a few remarks I wish to pass in relation to the Shannon.  I know from the files in the office that a firm Government decision was taken some years ago to provide the necessary moneys for the arterial drainage of the Shannon to be done over a period of 15 years.  It was not due to the failure of the Government at that time to provide the money on this project that it did not go ahead.  It was held up simply because it was an engineering project that could not be undertaken by the Office of Public Works existing at that time.  Indeed, there was difficulty in finding suitable contractors outside the country and it was questioned whether it was wise to go outside the country to have a scheme of this nature undertaken. However, since then there was an assessment of arterial drainage as a whole and the Shannon as a priority went down the list.  I shall refer to that again later when I am talking about drainage in general.</P>
      <P>I should like to refute the remark made here that a Dublin Deputy does not understand the difficulties of the small farmers in the west with 15 acres or so.  I made a special point on several occasions of going down and visiting these small farmers to talk to them and to get to understand as far as possible exactly what the difficulties of the small farmers were, particularly those on the western seaboard.  I wish to assure the House that when the cost benefit survey to which I referred in my opening remarks is completed and a report is made to the Government in order to determine future Government policy, the full social side of the benefit to be derived from drainage will be taken fully into account by the Government in formulating policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite well aware of the frustration <Col N="1174" /> of a farmer of 15 acres with, say, ten acres of mountain which can be used only for grazing for cattle and sheep and five acres which would be invariably near a river, the only place suitable for tillage, and the frustration of the farmer producing hay or crops on this small acreage and seeing it washed away if not every year every alternate year.  That is one of the things, as I say, that will be considered by the Government when formulating future policy.  As has been said before, the brief we are working on is pretty old and it is time we had a complete and proper study of the situation.</P>
    <P>In case&mdash;and I think this is true&mdash; there is any misunderstanding among Deputies of what I have been saying over the past month in relation to arterial drainage, I should like to say a few more words on it and I hope I shall make myself very clear.  If I am interested in a subject&mdash;and I know this is true for most Deputies&mdash;even though I may not have been present in the House, I always read it up in the unrevised report a few days later. Many Deputies have complained about delays in carrying out arterial drainage in catchments in which they are interested and about the reduced provision for arterial drainage work and the lower priority given to this service in recent years.  That these complaints are true I do not deny.  We are now operating in changed circumstances of allocating capital resources through the guideline of programme budgeting. This requires that broad objectives of policy be defined and full analyses made of the alternative ways of achieving the objectives and the full costs. Modern scientific methods of assessing the full benefits and costs of alternative programmes are now being used in almost all developed and in many developing countries, and the use of them continues to grow.</P>
    <P>Under programme budgeting, the main objective of arterial drainage would, perhaps, be to increase the productive capacity of land.  The big question to be answered would be whether, say, for the £10 million to be spent on the Boyne arterial drainage scheme, a higher national return would <Col N="1175" /> be obtainable if the money were invested in some other projects with the same objective.  I might mention here that an objective study was carried out a few years ago on the economics of arterial drainage and the result was, to say the least of it, most disappointing. Hence the lower priority given since then to arterial drainage.  That study was not, however, a scientific cost benefit analysis.</P>
    <P>Under the guidance of a qualified expert, a full cost benefit analysis is now in hands.  The facts are being ascertained by fully qualified personnel and the findings, when available towards the end of this year, should bring light into what are at present obscure facets of the economics of arterial drainage.  I am hopeful that when all the facts have been assessed in this scientific analysis, arterial drainage will be shown to be a more economic proposition than that revealed by the prior study to which I have referred.  If my hopes are justified, drainage will then be accorded a higher priority than at present and so will qualify for a greater share of the annual capital budget.  If they are not, at least we can be satisfied that the conclusions have been reached conscientiously and scientifically on the best information obtainable.</P>
    <P>Other matters appertaining to drainage were raised by Deputies and I should like to deal with them individually. Deputy Tully made inquiries regarding the Broadmeadow maintenance scheme.  For his information, the following annual sums have been expended on the Broadmeadow and Ward scheme since it was completed in December, 1964 : 1965, £1,651; 1965-66, £6,987; 1966-67, £7,265; 1967-68, £6,693; 1968-69, £8,808; 1969-70, £7,969; 1970-71, £8,063; and the estimated cost for 1971-72 is £8,250. Scheme channels are inspected regularly so that estimates can be made of the amounts needed to finance adequate maintenance programmes. These programmes are devised and carried out by engineers who have great experience in such matters and they are satisfied the scheme is functioning <Col N="1176" /> efficiently and providing outfall of land drainage to its full design capacity.</P>
    <P>Deputies L'Estrange, Tully and Hogan O'Higgins and others complained of damage to land by spoil banks and their unsightly appearance. The complaints are accepted but, as Deputies have admitted, a remedy is not easy to find.  With the increased concern generally for our environment, the brief of the engineers in charge of drainage works has also changed.  Any Deputies who may have inspected the Boyne drainage works will have noticed the attention given to the disposal of spoil in sensitive areas.  Our engineers always try to be fair in the dumping of spoil as between adjoining landowners but at times access and availability of space for excavators may dictate otherwise. They will continue to use their best endeavours to be fair to all.</P>
    <P>Also in connection with spoil, in some scenic districts in the River Moy area around Foxford we have had what appeared to be an insoluble problem.  However, the Parks and Monuments Branch have been examining this matter and they tell me they are hopeful to be able to improve the appearance of the area where a lot of rock spoiling exists.</P>
    <P>Deputy L'Estrange, Deputy Tully and Deputy Begley argued that the maintenance of arterial drainage schemes should be a national charge. The State is bearing the capital cost of the works which is not an insignificant charge on the general taxpayer. Maintenance generally costs approximately 2 per cent per annum only of the capital cost and unless this is to be charged to the actual beneficiaries, charging it on the rates in the proportion in which individual counties have benefited, while heavy in cases where counties have benefited a lot, is not unfair.  I should like to point out that when the maintenance of drainage was left to the local authorities in the past, before the 1945 Act, many rivers were not maintained properly and were allowed to deteriorate into the same state as they had been before money was spent on the capital end of drainage.  I would not be inclined <Col N="1177" /> to amend our legislation for the purpose of allowing the local authorities to take up this work themselves.  I think the system we have now is not only the most efficient but is certainly also the fairest.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tully was particularly anxious about having a bird sanctuary established at the mouth of the Boyne. This is, of course, a matter for the Minister for Lands who, I understand, has taken steps to that end.  Deputy Coughlan, referring to the Grand Canal, spoke about difficulties in navigation. The Deputy's statement that cruiser boats have to be brought overland from Dublin to the Shannon because of the condition of the Grand Canal is not understood.  The Office of Public Works brought a boat drawing 3'7&rdquo; through the canal recently without difficulty.  It left Ringsend Dock on 2nd May and reached Athlone on 4th May.  Most hire boats draw only 3' of water.</P>
    <P>Deputies Moore and Dowling referred to the Grand Canal as well. Deputy Moore spoke in particular about the proposed transfer of the canal to the Office of Public Works and asked when work on beautifying the canal was likely to commence. Naturally, I assume both Deputies were referring to the stretch of the canal within Dublin city.  If and whenever the canal is taken over, resources to be made available will be concentrated initially on urgent structural work to the canal and locks.  This would include necessary cleaning work to the bed of the canal to facilitate safe navigation conditions.  I understand that the Department of Transport and Power are already drafting legislation which will, in effect, transfer the canal from CIE to the care of the Office of Public Works.  Naturally, we have made our observations but the initiative in regard to the introduction of legislation is with the Department of Transport and Power.  The Grand Canal will be taken over as an extension of Shannon Navigation.  I understand that this legislation also proposes that the Royal Canal be handed over to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal is another kettle of fish altogether.  I believe CIE should <Col N="1178" /> reclaim this canal and then transfer it. As well, I believe Dublin Corporation have plans for portion of the Royal Canal in connection with road traffic. If this canal is to be reclaimed the proper people to do it are CIE.  They have proper knowledge of the leases and have been working on the canal for many years.  The Office of Public Works have not got this knowledge. The Minister and the Government should consider giving the necessary funds to CIE to reclaim the Royal Canal rather than making the money available to the Office of Public Works, because CIE can do this work with less expense as a result of their experience with this canal.</P>
    <P>There is only a small stretch of the canal which is polluted.  I have been in Robertstown on many occasions and the water there is so clean that anybody could drink it without doing himself any harm.  With regard to improving the appearance of the banks of the canal, I would hope that the Dublin Corporation would take a leading role in this as the improvements would mainly benefit the citizens of Dublin.  The corporation also have power to deal with derelict sites, which the Commissioners have not got.  Perhaps organisations or communities with buildings adjacent to the canal could also assist in this kind of amenity work, as some have already done.</P>
    <P>As to other waterways in the Dublin region&mdash;Deputy Moore referred to 28 of them in all&mdash;it would not be appropriate for the Office of Public Works to involve themselves in the control or management of these rivers.  These also come within the ambit of local administration and if there is need for national guidance and co-ordination the Department of Local Government would, I think, be best suited to this task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher referred to the Ballinamore and Ballyconnell Canal. A survey of this canal is being carried out at present to investigate what is involved in making this canal ready for navigation.  A navigable connection between the Shannon and the Erne would undoubtedly be very attractive but the practicalities of the proposal <Col N="1179" /> as regards works and cost must first be investigated.  This is a matter which was favourably looked on in North-South co-operation discussions.  It would be a very big job.  We are investigating the canal section now.  We will be only too glad to investigate the whole matter if the Government tell us that the money will be available to do the work.</P>
    <P>Deputy O.J. Flanagan suggested that it would be more efficient if various Departments for whom the Office of Public Works act as agents at present were to look after their own buildings and services.  In effect, what he is recommending is wholesale fragmentation.  I could not, for one moment, agree with the Deputy's views on this and if he were to reflect fully on his ideas he would realise that this would only lead to undesirable competition between Departments and to very considerably increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan also wanted to know the cost of the site for the new post office in Portlaoise.  I am afraid that I have no information on this.  The cost of sites for post offices is borne on the Vote for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with as many individual points as I can this afternoon. Deputy Cooney spoke about archaeological findings.  I am satisfied with the rate of archaeological surveys, but I admit that there is much to be done. We release each year to the Press a report on archaeological findings.  The newspapers do not publish this report in full.  The information is available in my office for anyone who wants it.  We will be only too glad to co-operate with anyone who wants information about the archaeological findings.  A survey of national monuments is being conducted in three counties at the moment.  I agree with Deputy Cooney when he says that this work is proceeding far too slowly.  As the Deputy surmised, this is because we have not got sufficient expert staff.  During the coming year I will make every effort to build up the numbers engaged in this work.  I hope to be able to make more rapid progress in future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Deputy Cooney is also concerned about the level of water in the Shannon at Lough Ree.  Discussions are taking place between the Office of Public Works, the ESB, the Department of Transport and Power and Bord Fáilte with a view to coming to a fair working arrangement in regard to the needs for navigation and power.  I am hopeful that a satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at.  There is a conflict of interest here but I am hopeful that it can be sorted out.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer now to the <i>Asgard</i>.  I was happy to hear Deputy Kavanagh and Deputy Donegan suggesting that there should be a second yacht available on the south coast for activities such as the <i>Asgard</i> is engaged in now.  This is a compliment to the committee who are running this boat.  It is a compliment to the captain of the boat.  I personally would like to congratulate the committee on the excellent work they are doing.  Whether the purchase of a second boat, as Deputy Donegan suggested, would be a good idea or not is not a matter for me.  That matter would have to be investigated by somebody other than me.  The <i>Asgard</i> is of very significant historical interest.  Anybody connected with the <i>Asgard</i> would agree that the right thing to do with a monument of this sort is to have it sailing in the sea. I should like also to congratulate the many individual yacht clubs on the work done in helping to train the boys and to give them the basic rudiments and knowledge so that they can participate fully as crew on the <i>Asgard.</i> Some international trophies have already been won on the <i>Asgard.</i></P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to commercial and fishery ports.  The commercial ports are a matter for the Department of Transport and Power, and the fishery ports are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Deputy P. Brennan and Deputy J. O'Leary suggested that we should decentralise more Government offices.  The situation in regard to the Departments of Lands and Education has been explained fully in this House.  It has been suggested that we should provide a central office for various Government <Col N="1181" /> Departments in rural towns.  This has been done in several places and we are planning several more.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of a statement made at the recently held conference of the Association of Fire Chiefs to the effect that the fire safety standards of Irish hospitals were grossly below the minimum required standard for fire safety; and what steps his Department have taken or are taking to rectify this serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to Press reports of statements said to have been made by some of the participants at the conference mentioned by the Deputy in regard to fire safety standards in hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be correct to say that fire safety standards in our institutions as a whole are below minimum specified standards.  Many of our institutions were constructed in relatively recent times and would comply with proper standards.  In many other instances extensive schemes have been carried out aimed at eliminating or reducing fire hazards.  Some of the older institutional buildings such as county homes have been replaced entirely by modern fire resisting buildings <Col N="1185" /> and the balance of that programme is being pushed ahead as rapidly as possible.  Attention is also given in the drawing up of building programmes to ensuring that funds are set aside to finance urgent schemes of fire precaution measures.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that it is not possible to replace all the older buildings in a comparatively short time and attention has been given to the steps that can be taken to minimise the risks that still obtain in a number of institutions.  My Department has emphasised to hospital authorities their responsibilities in the matter.  They have been asked to ensure that the hospitals under their control are examined regularly by the local fire officers, that fire fighting equipment is inspected and tested regularly, that regular fire drills take place, that hospitals are adequately patrolled by night and that proper records of all matters relating to fire precautions are maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider the fact that one hospital which has only one nurse at night for 40 patients is sufficiently and adequately protected against the possibility of fire?  Does he consider that to be normal?  It is happening in Nenagh at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It would depend on the character of the hospital as to whether the control was adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will give me particulars I will have it investigated. It may or may not be adequate.  It depends on the nature of the hospital and the likelihood of a fire outbreak.  One of the principal duties of the night patrol in a hospital is to ensure that patients do not go to sleep while smoking cigarettes. That is probably the principal fire hazard in a hospital which is architecturally not up to date from the point of view of fire hazard.  I presume that in every hospital where patients are allowed to smoke every precaution is taken at night to ensure <Col N="1186" /> that the bedclothes are not set alight. This is one of the most frequent causes of fire.</P>

      <P>The classifications referred to by the Deputy are not used in the Community.  The criterion for publication of commission proposals in the Official Journal is whether the European Parliament or the Economic and Social Committee is to be consulted. Proposals other than those published in the journal are regarded as internal documents and are not made public. Proposals which are necessarily regarded as confidential include, for example, Community negotiating positions to be adopted in trade talks with non-member countries.</P>
      <P>It is intended that English versions of proposals and communications from the commission to the council be prepared by the commission from about October next.</P>

These studies will not comprise formal plans for the consideration of the planning authorities or the Government but are rather discussion documents put forward on behalf of the board alone.  In the light of the reaction to the studies of the public and special interests concerned, the board would consider at a later stage the formulation of specific plans for consideration by the planning authorities. No approval for the general proposals is being sought by the board at this stage.</P>

I am informed by Bord Fáilte that, to date, approximately 5,500 firm additional bookings have been made as a result of the campaign.

Contrary to what is <Col N="1192" /> implied in the statement, the other organisations were not prepared to concede exceptional treatment to ICTU in this respect.

Very briefly, at the moment in respect of £100 repaid in equal half yearly annuities, which is the present ACC system, a repayment period of 20 years has a half yearly annuity in respect of £100 of £5.24 with total repayments of £210, but a 60 year period would have a half yearly annuity of £4.27, with total repayments of £510.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that these land bonds have proved to be a most unjust method of payment for land?  Could the State not make up for this injustice to some extent by accepting the bonds in part for death duties?  This would impose only a very limited demand on the State and would result, possibly, in considerable recompense to bond holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>At one time I was of the opinion that this would go some way towards remedying what is, to say the least, a very unsatisfactory situation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>However, a number of reasons have emerged which seem to indicate that it would not be satisfactory in that, first, the Deputy may have noticed that in National Loans we did have the provision that the loan would be accepted in payment of death duties but he may have noticed also <Col N="1198" /> that this has been dropped from the last National Loan because it was found that it did not have any real effect.  Secondly, we have made some efforts to activate the land bond market but these efforts have not been successful because the number is so small.  Thirdly, the bulk of the land bonds issued were issued prior to 1939 and it is very unlikely that many of these bonds are now held by the original holders.  Therefore, if we were to give the concession that is suggested in the question it would amount really to a free gift to the purchasers of a lot of those bonds who bought them at a price that was low and took account of all factors including the fact that they do not rank for payment of death duties.  At the moment the existing issue of 9¾ per cent bonds is at a premium and unless interest rates increase to a higher level than they are at the moment, this death duties concession would be of no value at all in relation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I suggest to the Minister that the bonds of 7, 7½ and 8 per cent issues are in the hands of the original allottees and that it would be an ease to them if the bonds were accepted in the way mentioned?  May I suggest further that it is wishful thinking to speak of a market in land bonds being created when there is no redemption date for land bonds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We tried to create a market by having the Government stockbroker dealing in them.  The question raised by the Deputy in his supplementary is one that has been considered also but the problem is where to draw the line or what should be the basis to justify drawing the line as between one set of bonds and another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that to say the least the situation in regard to land bonds is unsatisfactory. We would all agree with that and I think most Deputies would admit the cogency of some of the points raised by the Minister in reply to Deputy Cooney's questions.  Since the situation is unsatisfactory will the Minister not agree that some action is needed and needed quickly because there is a real <Col N="1199" /> injustice, even if the suggested way of remedying it is not the correct one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Lands and I have been going into this matter in some detail recently.  As I have outlined, the problem is that any steps that would be taken to remedy the situation will operate only for the benefit of earlier issues which may well not be in the hands of the original holders. The recent issues of land bonds are not such as to create any injustice to those to whom they have been allotted. We have not completed our consideration of the matter.</P>

      <P>The office block to which the Deputy refers is being erected on the site of the former Church of Ireland Training College in Kildare Place.  The Commissioners of Public Works acquired the fee simple interest in the site and leased it back to the developers for the purpose of the erection of the building.  The State has made a capital contribution of £½ million towards the cost of the site acquisition and the erection of the building, which will contain approximately 165,000 square feet of office space.  The State will pay an annual rent over a period of years and the building will eventually become the absolute property of the State.  While it would be contrary to standard practice to disclose the amount of the annual rent I can say that it compares very favourably with rents being charged at present for modern office accommodation.</P>

      <P>The two products approved for the dressing of cattle under the Warble Fly Eradication Scheme have remained essentially the same since the scheme was introduced. The formulation of one of the products was altered in 1970 to make it easier to handle and to apply and it was then marketed under a different name.  There was no change in its active principle nor was its efficacy affected.  The two products are accepted internationally as being between 95 per cent and 100 per cent effective against warbles and have been produced here by the same two firms throughout.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a proportion of cattle, even though properly treated last autumn, now show some evidence of warble infestation. Reports received by my Department indicate that the number of animals so affected is relatively small.

      <P>I think I said in reply to an earlier question that the products that are generally used for the treatment of cattle are between 95 per cent and 100 per cent effective.  I understand that the mechanics of the effectiveness of the dressing is that if a grub, in the process of migration through an animal's body, happens to be in a layer of fat tissue at the time of application, that particular grub has a chance of emerging unscathed and fully maturing.  It is not 100 per cent effective or cannot be made so, as far as I understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a wrong basis to go on.  The ultimate effectiveness of the application of the dressing would be determined, I should think, by the ability of the dressing to kill or render ineffective the emerging grubs.  It is not 100 per cent effective and never was thought to be so.</P>

The second thing is that there is a need now in this area for a diversification plant and any delay would militate against the milk suppliers in the area</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>This is undisputed but the Deputy will realise and, I think, also admit, that the area most in need of assistance in the procuring of the necessary plant to get good quality milk was the dairying industry rather than the liquid supply area and for that reason assistance was provided in that area.  It is assumed that the facilities available to liquid milk suppliers are and have been adequate.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>The scheme of loans at reduced interest rate for livestock expansion, details of which I announced on 2nd June, will operate from 7th June to 31st March, 1973.  This is a temporary measure, pending the introduction of a comprehensive farm development scheme, and no part of the cost will be borne on EEC funds.</P>
      <P>It is the intention that the farm development scheme, which will be in conformity with the relevant EEC directives, will replace the existing Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme. The principal change will be the substitution of the concept of income earning potential for those of acreage and valuation now used as eligibility criteria in the Small Farm Scheme. As the Deputy is, no doubt, aware, under the EEC directives, eligible farms will be those shown on the basis of a development plan to be capable of achieving, for each manpower unit on the farm, a level of income comparable to that earned by non-agricultural workers in the same region.  A contribution of 25 per cent of the cost of aids for such farms will be recoverable from EEC funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister three questions?  First of all, why are we not getting Community aid from 1st February to 31st March in relation to the livestock development project in view of the fact that we will be a member of the EEC from 1st February and should, therefore, qualify for Community aid?  Could the Minister also tell me when he expects to bring in legislation to introduce the farm development project? Can he give us an assurance that it will be operative from 1st February so that we could start getting Community aid immediately?  The third question is, is he aware that it was stated in the Press release at the time of the issue of these directives that Community aid would be available to the extent of 65 per cent in backward <Col N="1231" /> areas for farm modernisation?  Could he tell me why, therefore, he says we will be getting only 25 per cent Community aid for the new farm development scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The answers to these questions greatly depend upon the examination which has to be carried out between the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Commission in Brussels as to the details of our scheme as they now exist and the steps that will have to be taken to bring them into conformity with EEC regulations.  Among those considerations will be the determination of areas for special treatment that will qualify for the maximum 65 per cent assistance that the Deputy mentioned. It is, as I mentioned in my reply, a purely temporary measure that may not be totally compatible with the EEC concept of the development farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries why the recently announced extension of the Small Farm (Incentive Bonus) Scheme is to be confined to the 12 western counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>It was evident from experience that there were, in the western counties particularly, numbers of smaller farmers who, although not fully capable at this stage of reaching the minimum target of £1,000 gross margin within the time stipulated under the incentive bonus scheme, could, nevertheless, expand significantly with the aid of proper guidance and planning.  The aim is to encourage as many as possible of these farmers to expand to the status of &ldquo;development&rdquo; farms as envisaged in the EEC directive on farm modernisation.  The extension of the scheme is in line with the provisions in the EEC directive for transitional aids to smaller farmers and for special aids for areas like the west of Ireland where depopulation tends to be a problem and where the maintenance of agricultural activity is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If this problem is confined to a great degree to the west of Ireland, surely it would not have cost the Department all that much extra to extend this concession to the whole country?  Does the Minister not agree that there are certain very small farmers in all parts of the country who would benefit from the scheme and that it is wholly wrong to confine it to the 12 western counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not accept that it is wholly wrong to confine this special assistance to the western area, because this is the area that requires special assistance over and above what is being provided for the rest of the country.  The existing small farm incentive bonus scheme <Col N="1233" /> has been improved very much since 1st January for the whole country, and this is an extension of that scheme in order to ensure that farmers who would not otherwise be able to benefit by the small farm incentive bonus scheme as it now stands will be able to overtake it, as it were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">

      <P>In the area I am talking about&mdash;I am speaking from memory&mdash;about four out of five of our farms under 50 acres are concentrated; about 70 per cent of the people who participate in the small farm scheme anyway come from that area.  Obviously, therefore, this is the area that requires special assistance, particularly as the opportunity for alternative employment in this area is somewhat less than it is in the rest of the country.</P>

The Government have concluded that the difficulties in these cases cannot be dealt with by agreed action, and have decided to exclude these products from the application of Article I, Article IV or Article VI of the AIFTA.  Following these exclusions, it has been decided that the duties on these products imported from the United Kingdom will not be reduced on 1st July, 1972. Certain outwear has already been similarly excluded from the application of the relevant articles of the agreement, and the duties on outerwear will likewise remain unchanged on 1st July, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he has yet reached a decision to make provision for a district court for Dún Laoghaire Borough and South County Dublin with jurisdiction in all matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that on the last occasion on which this matter was raised in the House I said that, while I personally favoured having a District Court with full jurisdiction in Dún Laoghaire, the removal of Dún Laoghaire from the Dublin Metropolitan District would have some serious side effects on the status of the area in the context of the licensing laws and amending legislation would be necessary to preserve the present status. Because of pressure of more urgent work in my Department, it has not been possible to make much progress with the preparation of such amending legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the licensing laws, the Minister is aware that there are a number of other matters which come within the District Courts' jurisdiction and which, in fact, <Col N="1250" /> have now assumed more significance because of the increase in the jurisdiction. Perhaps in that context the Minister will consider making an order covering these matters, and leave aside the question of amending legislation for further consideration on some other suitable occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I cannot do this, because if I were to establish a District Court in Dún Laoghaire with full jurisdiction it would automatically follow that Dún Laoghaire would be taken out of the Dublin Metropolitan District and various serious consequences in relation to licensing would immediately crop up. There is the further problem, as I pointed out here in February, 1971, that the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure were unanimous in recommending that there should be no District Court at all in Dún Laoghaire. One of their recommendations was that there should be complete centralisation of all Dublin Courts, not just Dún Laoghaire, but various courts in parts of Dublin city and county.  A general decision in relation to other courts would have to be made at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that since then the legal practitioners in Dún Laoghaire, as well as the corporation itself, and the Wicklow Bar Association whose members practise in the same area, have all recommended, because of the increased volume of work, that Dún Laoghaire might be considered as a separate area not only for the District court but also for the Circuit Court?  In addition, adequate court facilities are available there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my own view but, unfortunately, as I said before, there are these two sets of difficulties, of which the major one is the licensing laws.  The Deputy may not appreciate the effect that would follow. I am sure he would be one of the first to come to me to revert to the previous situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McLaughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it unreasonable that sometimes a member of the Garda is not free to wear his greatcoat, as it is called, instead of wearing a light raincoat, which is very cold?  I am informed that the position at the moment is that the chief superintendent has the right to make those decisions in built-up city areas.  That rule or regulation should be changed because it is unfair to a member of the Garda to stand at a bank or at any other point on a cold morning wearing nothing but a very light uniform.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me.</P>

      <P>I understood the problem was that they had to wear them. I understand now that the problem is that they do not have to wear them. However, this is a matter for which I have no responsibility whatever.  It is part of the internal administration.  The Garda code sets out the regulations. The Commissioner informs me that in his opinion there is considerable flexibility. I have read the relevant part of the code and unquestionably there is a great deal of flexibility.  The Commissioner also tells me that he has never received either from the Representative <Col N="1252" /> Bodies or indeed any individual any complaints in regard to it.</P>

The figures asked for in the question are not available and I do not consider that I would be justified in asking the Garda to undertake the task of assembling them at the expense of more important work.  Moreover, it would be quite misleading to give figures for prosecutions in relation to very recent offences, owing to the timelag between the reporting of an offence and the making of a detection and the institution of legal proceedings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 96, 97 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to comment on the views of the Catholic Head Chaplain or indeed on the views of any other individual.  Neither do I propose to comment on the Swedish prison system.  It is, I think, common knowledge that Sweden differs from us quite substantially both in resources and in employment opportunities. There is also some reason to believe that there may be differences in social attitudes between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that contract documents in respect of Mountjoy Prison might by now be ready is unrealistic. I have available in my Department only a very small number of officers with the requisite knowledge and experience of prison administration to enable them to engage in detailed consultations with architects, <i>et cetera</i> and these same officers, because of their experience, have had to devote most of their time in the last couple of weeks tothe pressing day-to-day problems arising in the immediate aftermath of the riot.  The planning work is proceeding as quickly as circumstances permit but I am not willing to see the matter rushed to the point that plans are drawn up and approved without careful and detailed thought.  There are many complex and to some extent conflicting factors to be taken into account and balanced. The consequences of decisions <Col N="1256" /> made in the coming months will be with us for many years.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to set up a commission to deal with this matter.  As I explained in my detailed statement about prisons and prison planning in my recent Estimates speech, we are in close touch with developments in other countries and have gained much valuable information from Denmark in particular.  Their problems are in many respects similar to ours. They have one new prison, not yet quite completed, but other prison buildings in Denmark are old&mdash;some were not even designed as prisons. Neverthless, very successful conversion jobs have been done on them. The Danish authorities have, in fact, studied the problems very fully.  They have most generously given us the benefits of their studies from them of what we have learnt from them will be implemented.</P>

The council did not succeed in acquiring any suitable existing houses and are now seeking a site on which to provide the small number of houses required in the town.</P>

      <P>Section 70 of the Housing Act, 1966, which requires local authorities to make bye-laws in relation to rented houses, has been in operation since the 31st December, 1966.  Under subsection (5) of the section, the obligation to make such bye-laws does not have effect where bye-laws made under section 20 of the Housing (Ireland) Act, 1919, are in force in the area of a housing authority.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes of bye-laws under section 70 is to ensure the provision of water supplies and of accommodation&mdash;but not facilities&mdash;for the cooking of food.  Local authority dwellings generally have adequate and readily accessible water supplies and accommodation for cooking available to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of the facilities referred to is primarily the responsibility of Dublin Corporation. Deputies will be aware of my anxiety to see a significant upgrading in the standard of the accommodation and living conditions generally at Mount Pleasant Buildings and other similar schemes.  Programmes currently being pursued by the corporation in conjunction with the Eastern Health Board and appropriate voluntary bodies, have as their objectives improvements in the physical state of the accommodation, a reduction of the density of occupation, and the achievement of better social conditions through the provision of amenities and recreational facilities and through social work.</P>
      <P>I understand that the playing facilities provided to date within the curtilage of the flats at Mount Pleasant include swings, a joywheel and slide, a handball alley, goalposts and a marked-out football pitch.  The need for further facilities of this kind is being kept under review by the corporation. In addition, a sports centre, including gymnastic and boxing facilities, is being provided beside the flats through the Rathmines Social Service Centre.  Other joint ventures between the corporation and the social service centre, involving the provision of recreational outlets for the residents of the flats, include the holding of weekly swimming sessions in a local pool, the making of arrangements for the use of a nearby basket-ball court, and the organisation under three youth leaders of a special summer project embracing football, basketball, judo and other sports.  Special facilities for playing football are being made available for this project, with the co-operation of schools in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from playing facilities, the Eastern Health Board have assigned a <Col N="1269" /> social worker to work full-time with the social service centre there which has already undertaken the provision of a nursery centre in the area.</P>
    <P>Physical improvements made to the flats in the last year or so include the provision of new sinks, draining boards, w.c. pans and cisterns, the installation of new lighting at the entrances, the fitting of hundreds of panes of glass, and the provision of improved refuse disposal arrangements through the building of a new refuse chamber.</P>

I have made a block allocation for 1972-73 to Donegal County Council under the scheme and it will be for the county council to select the projects for execution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940, sanitary authorities are obliged to make reasonable provision for the <Col N="1275" /> prompt and efficient extinguishing of fires in their areas and for the protection and rescue of persons and property from fire injury.</P>
    <P>The Act also empowers these authorities to inspect any buildings which are believed to be or suspected to be potentially dangerous from a fire point of view.  My Department have no statutory power to carry out such inspections.</P>
    <P>I have not got the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the numbers of people fatally injured in fire accidents in the last five years.  Figures supplied annually to my Department by fire brigade authorities indicate, however, that fatalities resulting from fires attended by fire brigades for the period in question were as follows: years ended 31st March in each case: 1966-67&mdash; 20; 1967-68&mdash;26; 1968-69&mdash;31; 1969-70&mdash;32; and 1970-71&mdash;42.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> With regard to the other matters raised by the Deputy, I would refer him to my reply of 13th April last, in which I indicated that the main structure of the fire service is currently being reviewed in the context of local government reorganisation generally, and that this review covers an examination of the position in relation to fire protection and prevention, publicity and education aspects, the need for and the form of new organisational arrangements and a detailed review of the 1940 Act to determine whether amending legislation is necessary to strengthen the powers of sanitary authorities, particularly, in relation to fire prevention. In addition, a new code of building regulations, under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, incorporating fire protection measures, is in course of preparation.</P>

      <P>I am certain that the Parliamentary Secretary will agree that the figures for the past five years as quoted by him are alarming in that they show an increase of over 100 per cent.  Would he consider having some courses on fire control on television covering the use of fire extinguishers and so on?</P>

      <P>Further proposals are being considered with special emphasis on prevention and education. A very wide publicity campaign was carried out on television in Britain some time ago.  I am afraid that the reports on its effectiveness do not encourage us to spend a lot of money on this kind of publicity.  Nevertheless, it is necessary to educate the people and particularly young people and this matter is being considered. Very useful films are available to schools and are shown in the larger centres of school population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Marquees like any buildings or fixtures come under the Planning Act, 1963.  The person who erects a marquee must have planning permission.  When his application for planning permission is being considered the planning authority will ensure that there are adequate fire protection measures available.  This is the duty of the local authority.  Local authorities through their fire officers ensure that there are adequate fire precautions in regard to marquees and buildings.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at this stage to give a precise date for commencement of building work on the new post office at Longford but the Commissioners of Public Works advise that, provided no unforeseen delays occur, it is hoped to commence the work in the latter half of 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the strategic situation of the premises acquired for the new post office in Longford, would the Minister try to arrange for the early building of the new post office? The building in question has been acquired for a number of years.  It is now more or less a derelict and decaying site in the middle of this county town.  In view of the fact that new accommodation is urgently required by the post office employees in Longford, could the Minister arrange for priority to be given to this job?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a good deal of preliminary planning has been done on this project.  Outline planning permission has been obtained. The first sketch plan produced by the Office of Public Works did not fully meet the requirements of my Department and a revised sketch plan is being prepared.  The Office of Public Works advise that this plan will be available in June of this year.  This sketch plan will then have to be approved before the actual working drawings can be produced and they, in turn, will have to be approved before tenders are sought by the Office of Public Works.  I can assure the Deputy that this will be given top priority and everything we can possibly do to speed it up will be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it to the Minister that in a rural area where a post office closes down, and where the demands very often come outside office hours, whether it is little used or not, it is ridiculous to have the telephone inside where it is inaccessible to the local people for emergency calls to the doctor, priest or vet.  I suggest to the Minister that if it were outside he might find that the revenue from that call office might vastly increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>If the county council want to take up with my Department the possibility of their subsidising a telephone kiosk in this area, I will be more than happy to deal with that.

Since April, 1971, there has been a decrease in the number of calls made from the public call office telephone at The Downs from about 25 calls a week to less than 20 calls a week.

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties at Fermoy exchange as they affect the public and the staff.  A contract was placed early in 1971 for the conversion of the exchange to automatic working.  A further contract was placed in September, 1971, for a major coaxial cable between Fermoy and Cork.  Pending completion of these works in late 1973/early 1974, interim relief will be given by the provision in the next month or so of extra trunk circuits between Cork and Fermoy.  In addition direct circuits will be provided in about three months between Mitchelstown and Cork.  These will relieve Fermoy exchange of a considerable amount of traffic to and from Mitchelstown.  Meanwhile two extra switchboards are being installed and extra staff will be provided to operate them.</P>

      <P>I am personally very unhappy and disappointed with the amount of publicity being given by RTE on radio and television to members of subversive organisations.  While the direction under section 31 of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, may not have been breached it seems to me that an undue amount of time has been given to these people, who have no mandate from the electorate and represent nobody but themselves, to express their viewpoints and philosophies which are clearly unacceptable to the vast majority of the Irish people.  I am reluctant to intervene in programming matters but the authority has its duties <Col N="1289" /> under the Act and I have my duties and responsibilities in the last resort in relation to the performance by the authority of its statutory functions and I hope to convey my views on this matter to the authority in the very near future.</P>

I should like to ask you have some of those little anarchists and members of the subversive organisations, many of them in the Provisional IRA, have they a standing arrangement to contact those particular people at all hours of the night?

This is an aspect of it that I should like the Minister to take into account and balance it out against the views expressed by Deputy L'Estrange.

Would the Minister not agree that it is unsatisfactory that a major statement of policy of this nature made by him in the past few minutes should be made arising out of a question at Question Time when there is no opportunity available to the House now to discuss the matter raised unless, as I would wish, that we would raise the matter on the Adjournment and have a discussion on it?

      <P>It is a matter of great concern to everyone in the House that anyone should risk death by hunger strike.</P>
      <P>In the present situation it is clearly the desire of the Irish people, North and South, of all shades of political opinion that there should be in Northern Ireland a cessation of violence&mdash;whatever its origin or purpose. This is essential to enable political progress to be made.  We must be clear about this&mdash;Dáil Éireann has consistently taken a stand in favour of a reasoned and peaceful approach to the question of the future of our country. We are entitled to insist that violence should end and that justice should prevail.</P>
      <P>Our views on all these matters are well known to the British authorities. I am sure I speak for the House as well as for the Government in calling for an end both to violence and the present hunger strike.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked has not been answered.  I do not press that, but I do want to ask the Minister whether, arising from his reply, he is in fact indicating that justice prevails in the Six Counties and that this is a justification for jailing the people who are now on hunger strike?  That is No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> No. 2, these people, who may be regarded by some as gangsters, as gunmen, as terrorists, and given all sorts of appellations, are now in their 24th or 25th day of hunger strike for a principle and that principle, to them, must be of very grave significance to endanger their lives by hunger.  If this is so, what is at issue in so far as the authorities are concerned except regulations, red tape if you like?  Surely in these circumstances, when the wish of all in Britain, in the Six Counties, and the Twenty-six Counties is for peace, a just peace and a lasting peace, this is the time of all times when those authorities should waive their regulations and their red tape and give to these men of principle, these very brave men, the status which would enable them, if nothing more, to wear their own clothes.  That is about all it really means, and yet it is being denied and denied to the point of death in some cases and may be in many cases before this week or next week is out.  I would appeal to the Minister to make it in every way known to his associates in the Six Counties and in Great Britain, who have the authority to change this situation, to do so now before it is too late and to say that there is not anybody in this country who does not want peace but it is not peace at any price and this, I think, should be clearly understood and we should get the opportunity if saying it in our own way in this House in the very near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sherwin</NameTxt>
      <P>Can this House take it that the Government have made appropriate representations to the British authorities at this particular juncture and, if so, why was it so secretly done?  Why do we not, as citizens of the country, know what the Government are doing in these instances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the House has largely accepted my stated practice over the last two years, or however long I have been in this post, not to say what went on in representations between Governments.  What I tried to do in answering the question was to bring home to everybody concerned the actuality that no matter what we say <Col N="1295" /> privately or publicly the decision of the British Government in this case will be their own decision and there is very little that can be usefully said in this House to help the situation.  For that reason I decided to take the one little ray of hope that is there for our country. I do not accept peace at any price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept peace without justice and I think I have made myself very clear on this on many occasions but I am personally now convinced that there is one ray of hope for our country.  It is not anybody's country to take in his hands and do what he likes with it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>This ray of hope has no guarantees attached to it but at least it does not have the cataclysmic definite guarantees of any other course of action.  For that reason I think that everybody concerned, no matter how little he may think of other people's motives, no matter how highly he may think of his own, should at this time grasp the one ray of hope that the Irish people have of peace, peace with justice and not peace at any price because any Irishman must know that if we accept peace without justice or peace at any price then everything goes wrong again after a while.  There is no question in my mind of accepting something for peace at any price but I do say anybody who listens to me should accept this one chance.  If it fails then we will have tried to bring peace with justice to our country.  Certainly, I am not asking anybody who believes in me as a person in public life to accept peace at any price or peace without justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister whether I understand him correctly in saying that in this, as in other matters over the last couple of years, what he may be doing may not necessarily be seen to be done?  If that is so, would he not consider that it is necessary, particularly at this time, absolutely vital, that whatever he and the Government <Col N="1296" /> may be doing, it should be seen that they are trying to do it in order that the British Government and the British people should be brought to a realisation that we are in earnest about a settlement in the Six Counties, that we do care and that we do want the Six Counties rather than the impression which is getting abroad at the moment: that because of our casual approach or apparent lack of approach we are not concerned?  Could I just ask the Minister to bear that in mind, while appreciating what he has said in regard to the manner in which he has handled matters without saying what he is doing?  I feel it is necessary that he should be seen to be doing and should be heard to be doing in order to counter the propaganda coming from other sources to the British Government at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJohnHillery" hpid="Dr. Hillery Dr. Hillery">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hillery</NameTxt>
      <P>I think nobody is more Irish than the next Irishman so that you will have to leave it to our own motivation to see how well we take care of the interests of our own country.  The Deputy has experience, as a Minister, of having to carry, without public explanation, heavy responsibilities.  It is part of government and it is a necessary part of government, because often public explanation of what you are doing could totally damage the cause you are trying to assist.  I think the Deputy will accept that.  I, therefore, cannot accept the idea that we must be all the time seen publicly to be doing something.</P>
      <P>I would say, too, that the British Government have taken an action. For us it is perhaps short of what people would want.  Certainly for them it is far beyond what many of their supporters would have wanted them to do.  At this stage, as I say, it represents for us an opportunity and we should not miss this opportunity and, certainly, we should not damage it by the need for me at this time to justify myself&mdash;I say &ldquo;me&rdquo;: I mean for the Government to justify themselves to people in the country who feel that we are not doing anything. The British Government are in no doubt about where we stand and how we feel.</P>

      <P>I am not offering it as a debate.  I am merely asking again, despite what has been said by the Minister, with a great deal of which I agree, as far as keeping silent, and so on, can he not see the absolute necessity at this of all times for our being seen and heard to declare what we want rather than being misinterpreted and people believing that we do not want that which we seek, that is, the freedom of our country?  It is not a question of being more concerned than the next man.  That is <Col N="1298" /> not my purpose.  The fact that the general public are not aware that the Government are doing anything is in itself most damaging to the Government and to the cause of peace in the Six Counties.  The British Government would be helped by our being seen and heard rather than that we should be working, as it were, behind the scenes.</P>
