    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware that only 40 per cent approximately of national schools had medical examinations in respect of eligible children during the past three years; and what action he intends taking to ensure that early examinations are held in all national schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has never been the practice to examine all children in all national schools annually and I do not intend to suggest that this should now be done.</P>
      <P>The former arrangements envisaged that each child would receive three school health examinations during his school career and about 40 per cent of children at national schools were seen each year.  The older system is now being progressively replaced by one in which all children will be given an initial comprehensive medical examination at age six to seven and a selected number of children, who are deemed to require it, will be given another examination at about nine years.  A child may also be examined at any time at the request of a parent or teacher and, in addition, hearing and vision testing will be done annually in all schools by public health nurses.</P>
      <P>This is in accordance with the recommendations of the Study Group on Child Health Services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell us when the initial examination from six to seven years will be given? Will it be given automatically in the schools or will it be on request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be given automatically in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it would be a good idea, when the doctors are in the schools, to have them examine all the children and have an early diagnosis?  We are not having that at present under the present scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new child health scheme of examination all children between six months and the time they go to school will be medically examined and, therefore, many defects will be discovered before ever children reach school.  We consider that it is better to have this comprehensive medical examination of all national schoolchildren and then go on to a more selective examination.  This is the advice given to me by the study group which had on it all the experts in this field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldLEstrange" hpid="Mr. L'Estrange Mr. L'Estrange">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L'Estrange</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is aware that under the present scheme, if a child is examined in school and suffers from any complaint, the State pays whereas, if the parents have to bring the child to a doctor, the parents very often, they are not in a position to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is a possibility in some schools of children completing their primary schooling without ever having a medical examination?  In some schools medical examinations are not held over a period of seven years, the normal period during which a child attends the primary school.  Did I understand the Minister to say that a medical examination can now be requested by a parent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very important. Would the Minister take a minute to explain the procedure because I am sure the health board <Col N="1343" /> are not aware of it?  It would be no harm to make them aware through this House that this is something a parent can get of right and not because of a gracious act by a health board officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole scheme is being carried out over a period of four or five years.  It is spreading gradually. There is no use my answering the Deputy until I know the exact position in the area to which he refers.  In actual fact there has been an increase in the number of children examined in the school health services between 1969 and 1970 so that the ordinary school health service is not diminishing and will not be diminished until we have the other system established.  I will communicate with the Deputy as to what the arrangements are in west Cork at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will state why two hospitals in Waterford City (names supplied) refused admission to a one-and-a-half-year-old child (name supplied) suffering apparently from gastroenteritis; if he is aware that the child died in Cherry Orchard Hospital. Dublin the following day; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that because of the risk of infection of other patients, both general hospitals concerned do not admit patients considered to be suffering from gastroenteritis. The family doctor considered that there would be important advantages in arranging for treatment in Cherry Orchard Fever Hospital. Dublin, and the patient was transported there by car accompanied by a doctor and a nurse who were friends of the family.  Unfortunately the baby was in a very low condition on admission at 3 a.m. on 18th January last and, despite every effort on the part of the hospital staff, died at 9 p.m. on that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the lack of an isolation unit in a city the size of Waterford, which serves a large area, possibly led to the death of this child and would he state what steps he intends to take to provide an isolation unit in Waterford city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>This was a matter formerly for the Waterford Health Authority.  It is now a matter for the South Eastern Health Board.  On two occasions my Department reminded the Waterford Health Authority&mdash;they have now reminded the Eastern Health Board&mdash;that the Waterford area is the only area in the country without a <Col N="1345" /> paediatric unit of this kind.  One is available in Cork, in Limerick, in Galway and in Sligo.  I hope the chief executive officer will regard this matter as one of priority.  If he can make arrangements for a paediatric unit, I assure the Deputy it will be included in the list of capital works for 1972-73.  It is a matter for the health board now to initiate the arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's interest in the matter, but could he take any steps to ensure that an isolation unit will be provided and will he have a word with the CEO to this effect?</P>

It is a figure I would very much like to know.  I would point out to the Minister that the word &ldquo;approximate&rdquo; is used.

      <P>The Land Commission some years ago suggested to landowners who found themselves obliged to let lands that they should consider the desirability of making longer lettings, for five or ten-year periods with appropriate conditions as to husbandary, as distinct from the prevailing system or conacre of 11 months grazing <Col N="1357" /> lettings.  The Land Commission undertook to grant approval readily to suitable letting contracts, provided too much land was not thereby concentrated in the hands of one person or of persons not ordinarily engaged in agriculture.</P>
      <P>There was no appreciable response to this initiative.  At the same time,  I might say that, historically, the temper of our people has been overwhelmingly in support of unitary ownership vested in the occupier of the lands.  During the course of the land struggle both the system of unitary ownership residing in a landlord, and that of dual ownership as between landlord and tenant, were, in turn, rejected in favour of tenant proprietorship.  Personally, I do not think that there is any indication of a real change in attitude to this concept down the years.</P>
      <P>However, the matter is one which will form part of any general review of land policy.</P>

      <P>In view of the important recommendations of the Scully Report which are vital to the structure of Irish agriculture, I asked in my question whether the Minister would initiate a study of the feasibility of leasing land and restructuring land occupation generally.  In his reply, the Parliamentary Secretary has told me what happened in the past with regard to the Land Commission.  The type of study to which my question referred is vital to Irish agriculture at this stage and I cannot understand why the Land Commission would not have the study carried out.  I should like an answer to the specific question I put down.</P>

If the Commissioners so recommend, my Department will sanction a grant towards the cost of the transfer, and will instruct them to have the work carried out as a matter of urgency.

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>It is expected that provision will continue to be required for a very limited number of boys in Marlborough House until the new building for the Remand and Assessment Unit at Finglas and the new Special School at Observation in replacement of Daingean Reformatory School have been provided. It is anticipated that these two buildings will be available before the end of the present calendar year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Is the Minister not aware that the Kennedy Report some considerable time ago literally condemned Marlborough House as quite unsuitable?  The Minister promises to transfer boys on remand to Finglas.  I understand the buildings there were completed in September last but the boys are still being sent on remand to Marlborough House. The Minister has not dealt with the question which asked when it was proposed to train the staff in Marlborough House.  Is it not a fact that the staff there are not trained and that the Kennedy Report so found?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">

There are some intractable cases for whom there is no accommodation elsewhere at the moment.  We are trying to deal with that.  As I say, by the end of this year we hope to have Finglas and also the building in Oberstown completed.  At that stage we will be able to deal with this relatively small number of difficult boys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan) Joseph Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. J. Brennan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies will have gathered from the Explanatory Memorandum which I have circulated, the object of the Dangerous Substances Bill is, briefly, to bring up to date existing law protecting the general public against the dangers inherent in the use of explosives and petroleum, and to enable the Minister for Labour, by means of statutory instruments, to prescribe any necessary measures required to protect the public against other dangerous substances. Many of those things are not subject to any statutory control at present.</P>
      <P>At present safety law on explosives and petroleum is contained in the Explosives Act, 1875, the Petroleum Acts 1871, 1879 and 1881, and various regulations and orders made under those Acts.  These subsidiary instruments were made mostly around the turn of the century.  The first thing to be said about that body of legislation is that it belongs to another and a simpler age.</P>
      <P>Although the Explosives Act, 1875 deals with other explosives besides gunpowder, these appear to have been brought in almost as an afterthought and the Act is primarily concerned with gunpowder.  It controls in considerable detail the activities of gunpowder factories and the storage of gunpowder in magazines, but most of its provisions are anachronisms today. The very use of the term &ldquo;gunpowder&rdquo; dates the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not say offhand whether the Petroleum Acts pre-date the invention of the internal combustion engine, but it is clear that the framers of those laws did not foresee the extent to which our whole civilisation would become so dependent on the products of the <Col N="1390" /> petroleum industry.  The very definition of the word &ldquo;petroleum&rdquo; has a touch of the alchemist about it.  The 1871 Act applies to &ldquo;petroleum, including any rock oil, Rangoon oil, Burmah oil, oil made from petroleum, coal, schist, shale, peat or other bituminous substance, and any products of petroleum, or any of the above-mentioned oils, which gives off an inflammable vapour at less than 100 degrees Fahrenheit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Act envisages the transport of petroleum in what it calls &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;, which I take to be some kind of fairly small containers, and speaks of ships &ldquo;landing&rdquo; their cargoes of petroleum. The 1879 Act, by reducing the flash-point of petroleum from 100 degrees to 73 degrees Fahrenheit, restricted statutory control to the lighter and more volatile petroleum-spirit, although the heavier petroleum oils in their own way can be every bit as great a fire hazard as the lighter ones.  The 1881 Act regulates the hawking of petroleum-spirit from what it calls, &ldquo;carriages&rdquo;.  The amount which could be carried in any one &ldquo;carriage&rdquo; is limited to 20 gallons, and again, it is envisaged that the petroleum will be in &ldquo;vessels&rdquo;.  Modern methods of transporting petroleum both by sea and by land just do not fit into this legal framework.</P>
    <P>In addition to the deficiencies of existing law which I have already indicated, there are other hazards which technological development has thrust upon us and which are not subject to statutory control at present.  Among these are the transport and storage of industrial acids and chemicals, the use of the slurry-truck explosives process in mining and quarrying, and the use of compressed gas cylinders and aerosols. With the continuous acceleration of technology it is only to be expected that further hazards will arise; some of these may take forms which we, like our predecessors, cannot foresee at present.  This Bill would enable the responsible Minister to prescribe any measures that may be found necessary to protect the community against such hazards.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill makes the usual preliminary and general provision for <Col N="1391" /> interpretation, presentation of orders and regulations, expenses, repeals, <i>et cetera</i>.  One point to which I would like to draw attention is that the definition in section 1 (2) of &ldquo;proper local or harbour authority&rdquo; for the purposes of the Bill will end the anomalous situation in existing law where owners of private harbours can, as harbour authorities, grant petrol storage licences to themselves.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces and Civil Defence are exempted from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II deals with explosives.  It controls, by means of a licensing system, the importation, possession, sale and purchase of explosives.  These restrictions will not apply, however, to firearms ammunition which will continue to be dealt with under the Fire Arms Act, 1925.  Explosives may be manufactured only in a licensed factory.  There are provisions regarding the marking and packing of explosives for conveyance.  The foregoing requirements may be modified, by regulations, for fireworks, safety, signalling and rescue devices and similar articles.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with petroleum.  It provides that petroleum-spirit in other than small quantities may be kept only in a store licensed by the appropriate local authority or harbour authority.  Containers of petroleum-spirit must be marked &ldquo;petroleum-spirit&rdquo; and &ldquo;highly inflammable&rdquo;. There is provision for the making of regulations for the protection of persons against risk of injury caused by petroleum.  The term &ldquo;petroleum&rdquo; includes petroleum-spirit but also covers other less volatile and inflammable petroleum such as fuel oil and heating oil.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with other dangerous substances.  It empowers the Ministers to declare by order a particular substance to be a dangerous substance and to make regulations to protect persons against risk of injury from such a substance.  Before making such an order or such regulations, the Minister must give public notice of his intention, and afford interested parties <Col N="1392" /> an opportunity to make representations to him.  In common with all other statutory instruments made under the Act, such orders and regulations must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Part V is concerned with the notification and investigation of accidents arising out of the keeping of dangerous substances under licence.  The procedures for holding inquests and formal investigations are similar to corresponding provisions in the Factories Act, 1955 and the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.</P>
    <P>Part VI deals with administration &mdash;licensing, regulations, exemptions, fees, and powers of inspectors. Licences for explosives factories and magazines will be issued by the Minister.  Local authorities and harbour authorities will issue licences for explosives stores and petroleum-spirit stores.</P>
    <P>Appeals against refusals by local or harbour authorities to grant licences, or against conditions imposed by such authorities in licences granted, will lie to the Minister.  There is a general power to make regulations for the purposes of the Act and also a power to provide for exemptions by regulations. The powers of inspectors are similar to their powers under existing safety legislation.</P>
    <P>Part VII makes the usual kind of provision for offences, penalties and legal proceedings on behalf of the Minister or licensing authorities as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Finally, Part VIII deals with a number of miscellaneous matters.  Setting-off fireworks in public places will continue to be an offence which can be prosecuted by the Garda.  Suitable precautions must be taken in the conveyance, loading and unloading of dangerous substances and every ship carrying such substances must notify the harbour master on entering harbour. Trespass upon premises licensed under the Act will be an offence. Employees in such premises must use any safety appliances provided, and must not endanger themselves or others.  Regulations may require the posting of abstracts of the Act, copies <Col N="1393" /> of regulations, or other prescribed notices.</P>
    <P>Essentially what I am proposing in this Bill is an up-dating and extension of safety precautions in the use of explosives and petroleum in industry and trade.  Both the workers immediately involved and the general public need the support of these safety measures in their every-day lives</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noted that the Bill does not concern itself in any way with the criminal use of explosives which is dealt with in a different code of legislation</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1961" hpid="Mr. P. Belton Mr. P. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fine Gael accept the Minister's recommendations in this Bill.  However, I feel that this Bill might not have been introduced at all if it were not for the trouble in the North and the need to control explosives or petrol because they might be used as raw material for petrol bombs.  When the Minister for Justice introduced the Firearms Bill he could have included three-quarters of this Bill in it.  The section of this Bill which requires safety first measures, which are not spelled out in this Bill but promised in the future, should form another Bill to be brought in by the Minister for Labour.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Labour is bringing in this Bill at all.  It is a Bill for the Minister for Justice and Department of Justice. It is a Bill which controls explosives, petroleum products and I presume dangerous substances mean something that could be used in the making of a bomb.  In each section of the Bill there is a reference to safety which is not spelled out.  This safety measure, in my opinion, has just been put in so as to have it brought in by the Department of Labour.  There is the provision regarding the notification of accidents and the investigation of same and permission for an inspector to enter premises.  This again shows that it should be a matter for the Department of Justice.  Section 13 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An officer of the Garda Síochána (including an inspector acting as superintendent) may issue to any person a certificate authorising the <Col N="1394" /> purchase of explosives subject to and in accordance with regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour, not the Minister for Justice, can revoke licences.  In other words, the gardaí now have two Ministers running them.</P>
    <P>Section 35 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may make regulations for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, regulations may provide for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the expiry and revocation of licences, or any class of licence, continued in force under section 8;</P>
    <P>If this practice were to be continued to its logical conclusion the Garda could have six or seven Ministers as bosses.</P>
    <P>The safety first measures in this Bill should have been brought in under the Factories Act and could have been given to the safety first officers, of which there are very few to enforce. In spite of the Minister's promises very few have been recruited in the last few years.  Where there are safety first regulations I do not think they are checked or people made to comply with them.  This is something that could have been taken in hand and it could have been in a separate Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not see why this Bill should be handled by the Department of Labour particularly when the Minister only said what precautions would be taken in the future.  Section 17 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  A person packing explosives for conveyance shall take all practical steps to prevent risk of injury to person or property.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Minister may, by regulations, provide for the packing of explosives for conveyance.</P>
    <P>(3)  A person who consigns or conveys any explosive packet otherwise than in conformity with this section or such regulations shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>What regulations?  Let us see what regulations there are to be.  We want to know what they are.  Section 23 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  The Minister may, by regulations, provide for the protection of <Col N="1395" /> persons against risk of injury caused by petroleum.</P>
    <P>(2)  Regulations may impose duties upon employers, employed persons, occupiers of premises and other persons.</P>
    <P>(3)  Before making any regulations the Minister shall publish in such manner as he thinks fit notice of his intention to do so and give persons desiring to make representations in relation to the proposed regulations an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>There are provisions in every section to make this Bill qualify for handling by the Department of Justice.  I cannot understand why it is not a matter for the Department of Justice.  We want the details of the safety precautions, the clothing that must be worn, the type of vessel which is to be used to deliver the stuff.  We remember what happened in Sherriff Street when dynamite was missing.</P>
    <P>I object to this Bill being introduced by the Department of Labour but I agree with the controls provided for. We accept this Bill in principle though there are amendments to it that we want to see accepted.  Before we agree to this Bill we want to see the various safety first measures spelled out.  We do not want to see this Bill passed without knowing what the safety regulations are.  We want to see if they are sufficient.  In particular, members who are officials of trade unions and who are involved in this can get details from the workers of what is required. It should not be left to the Minister and the civil servants.  I am not saying they would not make a good job of it, but I think the proper information will be obtained only from those who handle these things, the owners and the carriers.  I agree that places must be licensed and that the licence must be issued by the gardaí.</P>
    <P>I notice the carrier is exempted.  I should like to see the regulations spelled out where the carrier is concerned because he should not carry these things unless they are clearly marked and all the regulations are complied with.  If the regulations are <Col N="1396" /> not complied with he should be liable to prosecution, but not to the same extent, of course, as the consignee.</P>
    <P>It is only right and proper that any person who refuses to give information to the gardaí should be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>In section 24 it is provided that the Minister shall publish in such manner as he thinks fit notice of his intention to declare a substance to constitute a potential danger to person or property. I approve of this and I approve of the opportunity being given to those affected by the notice to make representations to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides that no person shall sell or purchase any explosive unless he is the holder of an import licence under section 10 or the licensee of a factory, a magazine or a store. There are, of course, other controls too.</P>
    <P>There are quite a few firms which use explosives on a small scale.  I am thinking now of firms which supply the power gun and nails or rawl plugs in the construction industry.  These speed up the work of construction considerably.  They are invaluable in reconstruction work.  The power gun is used to drive the nails or the rawl plugs into concrete walls or through iron girders.  They are a time-saving device.  I am worried as to what the effect of this legislation may be in this particular connection.  These power guns are used by TV erectors, caravan assemblers and certain types of builders. A company based in Dublin may have 1,500 customers and of that 1,500 customers 200 may buy no more than £20 worth of cartridges per annum. Taking the powder out of these cartridges would be a lengthy and tedious operation and, because of that, I think that there should be an exception in this particular case.</P>
    <P>These companies could not maintain branches throughout the country because there would not be enough business to justify the maintenance of branches.  The bigger customers might order anything up to 20,000 cartridges. Controlling the amount purchased would be very awkward.  Incidentally, these firms do not sell unless a traveller calls on the purchaser or the purchaser <Col N="1397" /> is well known to the firms.  The firms, of course, have records of all the cartridges sold.  The gun itself is quite safe because it has to have pressure against it to be effective; it must be reflexed from a hard surface.  These cartridges would not fit any other type of gun.  The amount of powder used is negligible.  If every individual using these had to get a licence a good deal of time might be wasted.  There is no reason why the firms should not be licensed.  I should like the Minister to look into this aspect and find out if similar machines are used in other types of business.  because if this Bill comes in it will harm industry and put many people out of employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggests petroleum and petroleum products.  I do not understand the technical position but at present we are allowed to store 60 gallons of petrol without a licence.  Does ordinary paraffin or TVO come under this control?  In any reasonably-sized business house you would have a tank for 600 gallons of whatever fuel is used for heating.  In some cases the tank would be much bigger.  In the case of farmers using TVO they could have up to 500 gallons, depending on the number of tractors they use.  I am asking do these come under control?</P>
    <P>In his opening statement the Minister mentioned that gas cylinders and aerosols would come under control.  I do not know very much about the subject but aerosols are in common use and I do not know what is the extent of the control.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Among these are the transport and storage of industrial acids and chemicals, the use of the slurry-truck explosives process in mining and quarrying, and the use of compressed gas cylinders and aerosols.</P>
    <P>I do not know how this will be controlled because very often gas cylinders are used by sub-contractors in various places of work; they could be moved from place to place.  I am not very well up on gas cylinders but I understand there are several ways of producing pressure sometimes by compressed air and sometimes by actual gas pressure.  I do not know to what extent aerosols are controlled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>Before making such an order or such regulations, the Minister must give public notice of his intention, and afford interested parties an opportunity to make representations to him.</P>
    <P>I believe that to cover section 12 and give the Minister a fair chance of finding out what exists&mdash;I know it is very difficult to find out by writing to people&mdash;he should put an advertisement in the newspapers to find out what other things like Hilti nails or power-driven nails are in use.  There could be other instruments, of which I am not aware, which are used in the construction industry.  Probably big building contractors might use these things and I think we should make sure of this.  I know the Minister can amend the Bill afterwards but it is far better to have the provision in the Bill at the beginning rather than amend afterwards.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister in all his other regulations.  The marking of containers, and if it is possible making them in different colours, is to be commended if it is not impracticable. It may not be fair to ask people to do this.</P>
    <P>It is stated in Part V:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where any explosion or fire, or any accident involving a substance kept under licence, occurs in or about or in connection with licensed premises and occasions loss of life or injury to person or property, the licensee shall forthwith send to the Minister written notice of the accident and of the loss of life or injury.</P>
    <P>(2)  (a) No person shall, except with the consent of an inspector, disturb the place where any such accident occurred or tamper with anything thereat before&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the expiration of three clear days after notification of the accident in accordance with subsection (1), or</P>
    <P>(ii)  that place has been visited by an inspector, whichever first occurs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1399" /> (b) In any proceedings taken in respect of a contravention of this subsection consisting of the doing of any act, it shall be a defence to prove that the doing of that act was necessary for securing the safety of the place or persons thereat.</P>
    <P>The Minister is asking for three days. Who is this to suit?  The inspector? Suppose it happens at a petrol station or at the Esso place.  A key must be put in the gate and it must be closed for three days until an inspector strolls along to see it.  The onus should be on the inspector to be there, if the company telephones, within three hours.  A firm such as Texaco or Esso could afford to close and pay their staff for three days because they have the resources to do so but a small business cannot do this.  Yet the owner must close his business for three days unless that inspector comes.  We most certainly object to that.  I agree, and I do not want to be taken otherwise, that there should be a proper investigation, but to close for three days could break a small firm that is living from day to day.  If inspectors are to be appointed they should be on the job within three, four or five hours after being telephoned and the job should be done in a day.</P>
    <P>In Part V, section 27, subsection (4) states:</P>
    <P>If the Minister considers that it is expedient that notice should be given under this section in case of an occurrence of any special class in or about or in connection with licensed premises, he may by regulations extend the provisions of this section to every occurrence of that class, whether loss of life or injury to person or property is caused or not.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  I agree that the Minister should get notice of an inquest and that no person having any personal interest, be he an owner or a worker, should be on the jury.  I agree also that invitations to give evidence should be subject to the discretion of the coroner.</P>
    <P>Section 29 gives to the Minister the <Col N="1400" /> power to direct a formal investigation of accidents.  In the case of the Minister having received information from an inspector or a garda, it would be only right that he would be in the position to direct a formal investigation, but otherwise this could be it dangerous, because of pressure, be it business, political or anything else, to let him have a such power.</P>
    <P>Section 37 reads that:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prescribe the fee to be paid for licences generally or for any particular kind of licence.</P>
    <P>Surely at this stage we should know what are the fees.  If licences are to be required for the purchase of nails, we should know how much these licences will cost.  This provision might mean that a person who buys £12 worth of nails each year might suddenly find that he is required to pay £5 or £6 for a licence.  We must know, too, what the safety regulations are to be.  We have been told nothing about these matters.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (a) of section 39 gives to inspectors the power to: enter, inspect and examine at all times, by day and night, any premises which he has reasonable cause to believe to be used for the manufacture, storage, packing or sale of any substance...</P>
    <P>It would seem that the law is being broken by the Department of Justice. If an inspector is of the opinion that a search of a premises is warranted, he should have a search warrant before entering that premises in the same way as he would have a search warrant to enter one's home.  There is something to be said for safety-first regulations and the Minister may be right in this. However, it is my opinion that a search warrant is required for this operation.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) (f) of section 39 deals with the powers of inspectors in respect of any persons found on any such premises and with the questioning of such persons.  I wonder whether the two-month period is sufficiently long.  A person might have left the employment of a factory manufacturing explosives <Col N="1401" /> and after two months, or even six months, he could organise a raid on that premises and take goods away.  I do not see any reason why the period stipulated should not be 12 months.</P>
    <P>Section 40 deals with the power of an inspector to require a remedy for immediate or apprehended danger.  It is concerned with the taking away from premises of whatever an inspector wishes to take away.  In such circumstances should not a receipt for the goods involved be given to the owner? This matter, while not covered in this section, is covered later to some extent; but what can happen in practice is that an inspector can go before a peace commissioner and say that he had to destroy so much material.  Perhaps his doing so is a kind of receipt, but I would favour giving a receipt at the time of taking goods away.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of section 45 points out that sections 115 and 116 of the Factories Act, 1955, shall apply in relation to any structural or other alterations in any premises to which this Act applies.  Surely this point could be covered in most cases by agreement at the time of letting of a premises.  If the loopholes are to be eliminated, the sender should have proper rules and controls as to the method by which goods are packed and marked and as to how they are to be delivered.  There should also be explicit directions in relation to how goods are to be carried.  In the case of a lorry, should that lorry have creels; must there be a lock on the creels or must a person remain with the goods for the duration of their transportation?  All these questions should be answered explicitly so that we might know whether there is proper control.  There is no point in the Minister making the odd amendment later.  I agree that a ship coming into harbour should give notice of carrying explosives.  We have been very lax in this respect up to now.</P>
    <P>Basically, this is a Bill for the Department of Justice.  The only respect in which it can be considered a Bill for the Department of Labour is in so far as it proposes safety regulations and precautions against injury or death on the part of those handling these substances.  However, nothing has <Col N="1402" /> been explained in the Bill and we are told merely that the Minister has good intentions.  In order to be accepted, the Bill should contain all details of the safety-first measures that are taken.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would ask the Minister whether it is not possible to get in touch with the various construction and reconstruction industries in the country for the purpose of ascertaining what tools or instruments they use that need power charging.  This is very important and it could save a lot of time to the many people involved in construction. As I pointed out earlier, there is practically no chance of these power charges being used in any way to make a bomb or bullets.  I should like the Minister to check this matter thoroughly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We in the Labour Party wish to give a general welcome to this essential piece of legislation.  It is our opinion that it fulfils a longstanding need.  We understand that the Bill has been with the parliamentary draftsman for some considerable time. In updating and in codifying the current legislation and in extending it, as this Bill rightly does, we find it brings our statutory regulations in line with the best of international practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the major technological developments today, with mining development, with the extensive use of pressed gas in industry, with the ever-growing use of acids and other chemicals in new industries, and even with the development of off-shore oil exploration, this legislation is necessary and will be very valuable in the decades ahead.  Many Irish people in industry, both employers and workers, are far too casual in their handling and use of explosives, acids, petroleum and oil products.  Many of the accidents which occur in industry in the use of these substances could be avoided.  As a union official and as a member of the National Industrial Safety Organisation I have had to read of instances where workers have, on some occasions through their own fault, suffered severe accidents, been blown to pieces or sustained severe burns in, say, storage tanks or been overcome by fumes from industrial acids or other chemicals. <Col N="1403" /> Anyone on the trade union side who has ever had to meet the relatives and friends of such workers will strongly support this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>I often have occasion, as I am sure do other Members of the House, to be apprehensive of the kind of catastrophe that could occur with very heavily laden articulated trucks carrying petroleum and oil products and so on, very often at quite a high speed, along our arterial roads.  The danger is extreme and it is necessary, therefore, that the law should be rigidly enforced, that the Department should have the necessary number of inspectors and that the police authorities be given assistance to ensure that these regulations and orders are fully enforced under the proposed Act.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party are also concerned to ensure that there will be a further tightening up in order to avoid theft of industrial explosives from stores within the Republic.  There are criminal elements and extreme political elements in society who would readily avail of such explosives if they could get their hands on them.  It is to be hoped that this legislation will ensure that explosives, in particular, are effectively controlled and stored and that any abuse will be prevented in the national interest.  While I am aware that such prevention is normally the function of the Minister for Justice, the legislation brought in here by the Minister for Labour and Social Welfare will also help in this direction.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Labour Party to consider the Bill with a view to putting down any necessary amendments on Committee Stage.  At the moment we do not have any amendments in mind but, as a result of the Minister's statement here today on Second Stage, we shall consult with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and with any of the employer organisations who might be interested to see if they wish to put in any amendments. The Minister would expedite this legislation by indicating to what extent such consultations have already taken place. I gather they have been quite extensive over a long period in the preparation <Col N="1404" /> of the Bill, and I wonder if any major aspects are still outstanding.</P>
    <P>Again, I welcome the Bill.  This codification of existing legislation is long overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> Like Deputy Belton, I welcome this Bill.  It is necessary that explosives and other substances capable of injuring people or damaging property should be under control and that they should not fall into the hands of people who are likely to make improper or illegal use of them.  This Bill is particularly opportune at this time.  The Minister referred to the legislation of 1875, 1871, 1879 and 1881 and said that that body of legislation belongs to another and a simpler age.  I think it belongs to what might be described as a less explosive age.</P>
      <P>The one thing that struck me about the Minister's approach to this Bill and the problem with which it proposes to deal is that he did not tell us in his speech or in his explanatory memorandum what the objects of the Bill are.  It is usual to start off, either in the Minister's speech or in his explanatory memorandum, by saying that the objects of this Bill are A, B and C. The Minister has not told us that.  I have been reading the Bill and the explanatory memorandum and I think I could summarise the objects of the Bill by saying that the first object seems to be to control securely dangerous substances and explosives and petroleum, and to ensure that these substances will be so secured that they cannot be stolen by people with evil intent and that they will not be readily available for purchase by people who want them for illegal purposes.</P>

The Minister says the entire object of the Bill is to make provision for the safety of people engaged in work involving the use, or sale, or purchase of these substances. If that were so, the latter portion of the Bill would be quite adequate.  If the Minister disagrees with me it is hard to understand Part II.  Section 10 provides that no person shall import any explosives except in accordance with a licence granted by the Minister. Surely the Minister for Labour is an odd person to be entrusted with the right to decide whether explosives shall come into the country.  I would think that the Minister for Defence would be the proper person and, failing him, the Minister for Justice and, failing him, the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If I were asked on a quiz programme what Minister would grant a licence for the import of explosives I could be pardoned if I put the Minister for Labour at the bottom of the list.</P>

I would certainly think that Part II falls within the ambit of the Minister for Justice.  Section 18 provides for the keeping of records.  What has that got to do with safety?</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> Section 18 provides:</P>
      <P>The licensee of a factory or magazine shall keep in such form as the Minister may direct a daily record of the quantities of explosives taken into and out of the premises...</P>
      <P>Surely the whole object of section 18 is to keep a check on explosives, to see where they are going, and to see who is purchasing them and to enable them to be traced.  Petroleum is the same.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with the Government that the Bill is necessary and we will give it to the Minister.  It is outrageous that, as at present, explosives should be stored in comparatively large quantities in isolated places where they can be stolen in the middle of the night and used for illegal purposes.  Subsection (5) of section 29 provides for the setting up of a tribunal for the purposes of conducting investigations.  The subsection reads:</P>
      <P>The tribunal shall have for the purposes of the investigation all the powers of a Justice of the District Court when hearing a prosecution for an offence under this Act, and all the powers of an inspector under this Act...</P>
      <P>This is one of the sections that get this Assembly into trouble and which end up in the Supreme Court with somebody challenging the constitutionality of the Act.  Does that mean that the tribunal can sentence somebody for contempt of court?  Does it mean that the tribunal can hold somebody in contempt of court, convict him and sentence him to a fine and imprisonment? If it does, I think this is the performance of judicial function by someone who was not appointed as a judge under the Constitution.  Like the inquiry into the funds for the North it will end up by being held to be unconstitutional. The Minister and his advisers should have another look at that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coroners Act is amended to a considerable extent by section 28.  I <Col N="1407" /> suppose there is nothing wrong with those amendments.  I would have thought that a lot of the powers being taken in this Bill were already available under the Factories Act.  I suppose they would all be available in relation to a premises which was considered to be a factory.  I suppose the object of this Bill is to extend them to premises which would not be a factory within the meaning of the Factories Act.</P>
    <P>I would not have spoken on this Stage of the Bill but for the fact that Deputy Belton's approach struck me as very reasonable.  This is essentially a Bill to control the purchase, storing and sale of gelignite and kindred substances.</P>

This Bill provides for the storing of explosives in the licensed factory where they are manufactured, in a magazine licensed by the Minister, in a store licensed by a local authority or harbour authority or in accordance with the certificate issued by the Garda authorities.  In the present situation gelignite and such substances should be stored in one of two places.  They should be stored in the factory in which they are manufactured or, alternatively, in the care of the Irish Army.  If gelignite or such substances are to be used industrially they should be conveyed under the guard of the Irish Army in the quantity which is prescribed and they should be used under the surveillance of the Irish Army.  I believe that is the proper procedure in this country at this time.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful indeed for the constructive approach to the Bill.  It does not leave much which it <Col N="1408" /> would be necessary for me to say at this stage.  Most of the references made by Deputies who saw any conflict in the Bill are applicable to the Committee Stage, which will be taken in a fortnight's time and will give them a chance to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with two aspects of the Bill which have been questioned by the Fine Gael front bench speakers.  First of all, I should like to say that if this was a Bill to deal with the criminal side of explosives I would spell it out.  Indeed it would be a much bigger Bill, such a Bill as the Minister for Justice intends to bring in and which is necessary.</P>
      <P>This Bill has to do with my responsibility in regard to the safety of workers.  Everything that is in the Bill is necessary to that end.  I was accused of not spelling it out in my opening speech.  I thought I had made it quite clear.  In the last paragraph I said:</P>
      <P>Essentially what I am proposing in this Bill is an updating and extension of safety precautions in the use of explosives and petroleum in industry and trade.  Both the workers immediately involved and the general public need the support of these safety measures in their everyday lives.  Deputies will have noted that the Bill does not concern itself in any way with the criminal use of explosives which is dealt with in a different code of legislation.</P>
      <P>I would not be the appropriate Minister to deal with the criminal use of explosives.  However, my Department is deeply concerned with the usage of explosives and dangerous substances in regard to the safety of those persons who are concerned with the manufacture, the packaging, the storing and the transport of these explosives and dangerous substances.  We find ourselves in the position, in trying to enforce safety regulations under existing legislation, that our legislation falls far short, when it comes to dangerous substances and explosives, of laying down specifically what would enable us to carry out our functions properly.</P>

      <Col N="1409" /> It is for that reason and in conjunction with the parties concerned, including the Congress of Trade Unions, the ILO and, I may add, in the light of the EEC requirements which require the categorising of explosive substances, that it is essential to bring before the House this Bill which has been around for a long time.  It has been chopped and changed.  That is the purpose for which the Bill has been brought in.  If we require markings, licensing and other provisions in some sections of the Bill, which would only be concerned with the criminal side, it is because it is necessary, if we are to safeguard the lives of the people who are handling these substances, that we should know who handles them, where they are being handled and who has the right to handle them.  If we are to get tabs on the people who are handling these substances we must do it by way of compelling them to be licensed and by providing that only those who have the right to be licensed should have the right to handle them.</P>
    <P>We cannot undertake to protect the safety of the people working with these dangerous substances in all their various stages, whether transport, sale, packaging, manufacture or otherwise, if we are to allow indiscriminate use of them.  It is a first essential to establish who the people entitled to use these dangerous substances are and from there on to try and enforce certain regulations which will not indeed of themselves eliminate the dangers but which will minimise them and make it easier for those working with the substances concerned to avoid the dangers involved.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was correct when he said that unfortunately many of the industrial accidents we experience are not due always to inexperienced people but are very often due to those who are most experienced, and very often to those who become so accustomed to dealing with dangerous substances that they take risks.  That is the reason it is so necessary to try to get our legislation observed and the persons responsible, the employers and the employees, to co-operate in observing <Col N="1410" /> the precautions necessary to avoid accidents, fatal and otherwise.</P>
    <P>The number of accidents in industries increased last year.  In fact, it has reached an alarming stage.  The number of fatal accidents has increased and also the number of accidents generally.  If one is to take a purely material view of it this is a loss to industry but it is also a loss to humanity, particularly when the lives lost are breadwinners of families and their widows are left with families to rear.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically all accidents can be avoided.  We probably have not enough inspectors, although we have a good many.  We are continually adding to the number.  None of the accidents I have heard of in the last year&mdash;all the fatal accidents are reported to me&mdash;could be attributed to the lack of activity of the inspectors. I have said very often in the House, and I want to put it on the record again, that our inspectorate are a very dedicated, hard working body of people.  We are finding it difficult to get suitable inspectors because the standard required as a result of technological advances and the type of thing which has necessitated this Bill makes it more difficult to find the type of inspector, with all the necessary qualifications, to be able to properly enforce the regulations.  I should like to say that our inspectors are not just there to be sent out to prosecute somebody after an accident occurs, although that is part of their duty.  I would much prefer that they be invited in by the people in industries to instruct them on what to do and to see that proper safety committees are set up.  There should be an awareness of the activities of NISO, the National Industrial Safety Organisation, in each particular factory, project and concern and everything possible should be done to ensure that the necessary safety precautions are taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a set of rules which specify practically everything that is required particularly in the construction industry <Col N="1411" /> with regard to scaffolding, dismantling of scaffolding, the appointment of safety officers, and so on.  These are issued to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>We read every day of accidents occurring in industry and we have got to bring home to people in a forceful way, preferably by co-operation, the understanding that lives can and must be saved if the necessary precautions are taken.  Our existing legislation dealing with dangerous substances and explosives is antiquated, going back to the last century.  It did not visualise many of the things we have to deal with now.  One does not have to go into complicated details to refer to a number of them.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to enable the Minister for Labour to make regulations to cover existing situations and any new situations which may arise from time to time.  We can visualise certain products and substances not now in common use but which will be in the near future with technological advances.  The Bill gives the Minister power by statutory regulation to cover these.  I should like to assure the House that as far as the Government and I are concerned we desire only to bring up to date our safety regulations in order to protect the lives of persons involved in the handling of dangerous substances and if this legislation extends to the general public it is not a bad thing.  The legislation enables us to deal with persons involved in the transport, storage and packaging of dangerous substances.  In this we are concerned with the safety of the public at large.</P>
    <P>I am taking power with regard to the conduct of inspectors who have to enter premises to probe accidents.  These powers are similar to those already in existence.  It is necessary to follow up accidents to find out as far as possible the cause of the accidents and to determine whether there has been criminal negligence on the part of anybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond referred to some of the firms which deal with cartridge powered tools.  I should like to assure him and the House that there is no desire on my part to persecute anybody <Col N="1412" /> who is giving good employment because he handles something that would come under the provisions of the Bill. We will attempt to make it as easy as possible for all concerned.  All we seek is that the necessary precautions are taken.</P>
    <P>I had representations from the firm referred to by Deputy Belton and they have been given the necessary assurance that their fears can be easily allayed.  I have arranged for them to meet some of my officials.  The Bill is overdue and I am glad it has been welcomed on all sides of the House.  I hope it will contribute to the avoidance of many accidents which might otherwise occur.  There have been accidents which have not resulted in loss of life but they were nevertheless serious accidents in which people were marked for life.  Accidents have occurred through the handling of acids and other such substances which have come into use as part of technological advances.  All the substances referred to in the Bill are not explosives.  There are others which can have serious effects, many of them being potential killers and it is vital that they become known as such and handled accordingly.</P>
    <P>The reason the Minister for Labour is handling this Bill is that it is entirely appropriate to safety in employment. The code of legislation dealing with the criminal use of explosives is one which the Minister for Justice will be dealing with shortly.  It will contain a great many provisions not mentioned here, dealing with ammunition and firearms. Deputies may wish to study this Bill in greater detail&mdash;I do not know whether amendments will be necessary&mdash;and I, therefore, do not propose to look for the Committee Stage today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor) Patrick J. Lalor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lalor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  My powers to control prices and charges derive from the Prices Acts, 1958 and 1965.  While the powers given in the 1958 Act may be exercised only in certain limited circumstances the amending 1965 Act gave me wide powers to investigate and control prices and charges, but these powers are of a temporary nature renewable by the Government at six monthly intervals. <Col N="1414" /> Price control as operated since October, 1965, has taken the form of requiring manufacturers to give me advance notice, at present one month, of their intention to increase the price of their products and of requiring importers or wholesalers to give similar advance notice about any intention to increase the margin which they take on the goods in which they deal. Where I felt that the proposed increases were not justified I took steps to prevent them from being imposed or to have them reduced.</P>
      <P>The system of price control operated up to now has been directed primarily towards manufacturers, importers and wholesalers.  It was expected that competition would be instrumental in keeping retailers' prices generally at reasonable levels.  This form of control was particularly appropriate when the majority of home manufacturers were protected by high tariff walls, but it has been gradually losing a great deal of its relevance in recent years with the dismantling of tariffs between ourselves and Britain under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the resulting gradual exposure of home manufacturers to competition from external manufacturers. With our entry into the EEC competition from external firms will be further accentuated and if in these circumstances a home manufacturer succeeds in making good profits, it will generally be the result of the efficiency of the firm concerned and not through charging excessive prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Experience of the working of price control demonstrates that while the need for control at the manufacturer's level is declining, there are other sectors and circumstances where it is apparent that there is a need to extend price control.  The fact that the existing prices legislation does not apply to prices for commodities or charges for services which may be controlled, regulated or specified under other legislation has meant that some large firms and organisations were subjected to price control on a less rigorous scale than under the Prices Acts.  This has led to complaints from time to time that certain sectors were in a more favourable position than firms whose prices and <Col N="1415" /> charges were controlled by the Prices Acts.  To remove any basis for this complaint the present Bill proposes in section 2 (1) (a) and (b) to extend the Prices Acts to prices for commodities and charges for services which may be controlled under other legislation.</P>
    <P>The extension of the Prices Acts to charges for professional services, proposed in section 2 (1) (c) of the present Bill, is desirable particularly in view of the fact that where such a charge is a percentage of the price obtained from property or of the value of a contract, recent inflationary trends have automatically increased the charge so that in some cases it may now be out of proportion to the value of the service given.  Furthermore, trade union representatives have sometimes argued that while their members are required to negotiate increases in remuneration with employer bodies or through conciliation and arbitration machinery, some professional people are in a position to a large extent to achieve an increase in their remuneration without having to justify the need for the increase. The present Bill, accordingly, proposes to give power to the Minister concerned to require advance notice to be given to him of proposed increases in professional fees, and where necessary, to control such fees.  The powers now proposed can be exercised even in cases where there may already be machinery of a kind in operation for the determination of professional fees.</P>
    <P>A feature of trading at the importing, wholesale and retail levels is the adding on in many cases of a customary percentage mark-up on buying prices.  This practice, taken in conjunction with inflationary trends over the past number of years, can mean an increase in absolute margins to the trader concerned out of proportion to increases in his labour and overhead costs.  This type of situation is not likely to occur where there is real competition in a trade and I recognise that there are many such cases.  There are, however, many other cases where, for whatever reason, market forces do not operate satisfactorily and traders continue to take customary margins <Col N="1416" /> which may have been reasonable in the past but, because of the inflationary trends mentioned, have ceased to be so.  It is now proposed in the present Bill in section 4 to extend the scope of the Prices Acts to permit of the investigation and control under those Acts of the margins of profit of importers, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as manufacturers. It is also proposed in the present Bill to extend the scope of the Prices Acts to permit of the investigation and control under those Acts of the amounts which may be added by traders for tax purposes and to enable orders to be made requiring retail traders to display their tax-inclusive prices for all goods being sold by them.</P>
    <P>A particular feature of the last few years has been the increase in the price of houses.  It has not been possible to control such prices under the existing Prices Acts since these Acts relate to commodities and, according to the legal advice tendered to me, houses could not be regarded as commodities. To remedy this situation it is proposed in section 3 of the present Bill to extend the scope of the Prices Acts to enable prices of new houses to be investigated and controlled.</P>
    <P>The existing prices legislation does not apply to interest charges <i>et cetera</i> in relation to hire purchase and credit sale agreements and in view of the importance of this type of trading it is proposed in section 5 of the present Bill to bring hire purchase and credit sale charges within the scope of the Prices Acts.  Powers for the control by the Central Bank of interest and other charges by banks and similar institutions are provided in the Central Bank Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides in section 8 for the amendment of the Second Schedule of the Prices Act, 1958 so as to revoke the statutory requirement for maintaining a prices advisory committees panel from which members of any prices advisory committees must be appointed.  Nominations for appointment to the panel are invited from the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Federated Union of Employers, the Federation of Trade Associations, the <Col N="1417" /> Institute of Costs and Works Accountants and the Irish Housewives Association. In the period from 1963 to mid-1965, seven prices advisory committees were appointed, but with the coming into operation of the Prices Act, 1965 recourse since then has been had to the appointment of prices advisory bodies under that Act, whenever formal price investigations were warranted. The Minister may appoint any persons of his choice to be members of a prices advisory body or he might invite nominations for appointment to a particular body from appropriate organisations. The amendment of the 1958 Act which is now proposed would bring the position in relation to membership of prices advisory committees into line with that of prices advisory bodies.  It would not in any way interfere with the Minister's powers to appoint such committees. I should also mention that in actual fact great difficulty has been experienced continuously in obtaining nominations from the organisations I have mentioned for formal appointment to the prices advisory committees panel.  The Bill also provides for a number of consequential amendments of the Second Schedule to the 1958 Act which became necessary because of the abolition of the prices advisory committees panel.</P>
    <P>The Prices (Amendment) Act, 1965 specified that the Minister's powers under that Act for price investigation and control could only be exercised after the Government had made an order under the Act enabling him to use those powers.  The Government made such an order on 7th October, 1965&mdash;the Prices Stabilisation Order, 1965.  The Act specified that the enabling order would have a maximum life of six months, but that it could be renewed by the Government for periods of six months by continuance orders. Since 1965, the prices stabilisation order has been continued in force for successive periods of six months by continuance orders; the amendment of the 1965 Act proposed in section 9 of the present Bill is necessary in present economic circumstances so as to remove the &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; element from the Prices Stabilisation Order, 1965, and to eliminate the need for further <Col N="1418" /> temporary continuance orders to be made by the Government.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Prices Acts to enable the Government, by order, to transfer from the Minister for Industry and Commerce to any other Minister, powers and functions under those Acts for the investigation and control of particular prices or charges.  It is the intention, for example, that powers and functions under the Prices Acts in relation to the prices of new houses would be transferred to the Minister for Local Government and that there would where appropriate be a similar transfer of powers and functions, particularly in relation to professional fees, to other Ministers.</P>
    <P>As regards the implementation of prices policy generally, Deputies will be aware of the establishment in recent months of the National Prices Commission whose function broadly is to keep under review the prices of commodities and the level of charges and fees for services and to advise the Minister thereon.  The establishment of the commission does not mean that prices advisory bodies cannot be established for specific purposes, although the need for the establishment of such bodies should become less having regard to the activities of the commission.  The commission is representative of employer, trade union and consumer interests with an independent chairman.  A word of congratulation is due to the chairman and members of the commission for the exceptional vigour and enthusiasm with which they have gone about their tasks. The monthly reports furnished by the commission show that in addition to making recommendations on applications for price increases, the commission has undertaken several worthwhile projects in the prices field and I look forward confidently to the undertaking by them of several further such projects in the future.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the object of the Bill commends itself to the Dáil and I recommend the Bill for its approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The party for which I have the honour to speak has no objection to this measure.  It is, indeed, <Col N="1419" /> part of its policy that there should be proper control legislation and in its published policy document it comments on the fact that price control has never been 100 per cent successful.  It is extremely easy to control the price of the loaf of bread or the bottle of beer because these are consumer goods measured by weight or by volume. When, however, one comes to articles of choice control can be difficult.  One may buy a pair of shoes one year at a certain price and buy what looks like an identical pair of shoes the following year at an enhanced price.  There may be some slight difference or modification, but for all practical purposes the shoes are the same.  The greatest difficulty is experienced with regard to wearing apparel for women.  There is difficulty too where certain articles of male apparel are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be price control.  The Minister underlined the fact that this Bill is designed to control the price of services as well as of goods and commodities. It will, therefore, apply to doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons, legal practitioners and so forth.  This is a step forward but I doubt if it will be 100 per cent successful.  It may well result in an increase in the cost of certain services.  I do not suggest that all doctors have no regard for money but there are many who, if they were paid a proper fee for the time and attention they give their patients, and the number of hours they work per day, would earn far more than they do. In the past many doctors have been almost unthinking where their own families are concerned and almost too thinking about their patients' welfare. This Bill is designed to bring all these sections of our community under price control legislation.  We do not oppose the Bill.  It would be quite unfair to expect a working man to accept that he must pay a certain price for a certain article or accept a certain emolument for his services while, at the same time, those in the higher income group are not expected to accept the same stricture upon their incomes.  I do not think the result of this measure will be a reduction in the cost of the services of doctors, dentists, <Col N="1420" /> veterinarians, legal practitioners and so on.</P>
    <P>I certainly approve of bringing new houses under price control.  We know the situation at the moment.  Young couples enter into a contract and pay a deposit.  When the house is ready for occupation they find the cost has increased and they have to pay more than they anticipated.  Usually they have to meet the deficit out of their own pockets which results in their buying no carpet for the diningroom in the first year of occupancy.  Price control of new houses is a good step, but I doubt if this Bill will result in a spectacular reduction in the cost of new houses.  We have spiralling inflation and there are increases in wages and increases in the cost of materials. These are increases which cannot be avoided.  Inevitably between the time of the signing of the contract and the taking up of occupation the cost of the house will have increased but in future that increase will have to be justified both to the purchaser and to the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the services of doctors and the bargains made under the Health Acts, I do not regard the fees charged to private patients as excessive. Perhaps this Bill is in the nature of letting it be seen that justice is done rather than in aiming at the eradication of injustice.  Doctors' fees have not been excessive.  If at times heavy fees are exacted from patients the Revenue Commissioners subsequently remove almost four-fifths of the fee charged.  Last year a specialist in this city paid to the Revenue Commissioners 16s in every £ he charged his patients.</P>
    <P>This brings up the question of whether one of the greatest niggers in the woodpile of increasing costs is the Government itself by that particular application of income tax legislation and also by the application of selective wholesale tax of 20 per cent and turnover tax of 5 per cent.  These taxes over a wide area of goods must surely increase prices and when that has happened and there has been political agitation about them we then find legislation must be introduced and justice must be seen to be done.  I <Col N="1421" /> believe that justice will now be seen to be done in this sphere of doctors, dentists, veterinary surgeons and, to a lesser extent, house-builders, but a reduction in prices is something that I, as a politician could not, in honesty, offer the people I represent as a result of this legislation.  I do not think there will be a spectacular reduction in the cost of services provided by these gentlemen.</P>
    <P>More and more people involved with professional persons whether in the matter of health or animal health are covered in various ways.  In dentistry there are fixed fees already for the earning contributor to social welfare.  In the case of doctors there are fixed fees in hospitals which doctors and specialists enjoy for the provision of services, whether surgical operations or other services.  When you come to private patients the success of the voluntary health insurance scheme established by Deputy O'Higgins when he was Minister for Health has meant that the great majority of the population not otherwise covered are included in the voluntary health insurance.  When, as I have at the moment, one has a member of the family in hospital and when the bills come, one sends them to the VHI board.  I expect the bills are scrutinised there and would be in line with the proper fees to be charged.  That is a matter of past congratulation for Deputy O'Higgins who is just now arriving.  It is nice to find a Government, sinning in many other ways, but carrying on something which the people would never have tolerated them removing.</P>
    <P>In regard to health and dentistry services the Bill will not change things to any great extent and may create a situation in which if there is a fixed fee per visit or a fixed fee for certain attention, doctors and dentists charging private patients a lesser amount in the past may adopt the fixed fee in future. If there is a fixed fee and you have the qualifications and are providing the service nothing would be more natural than to charge the prescribed fee, neither more nor less.</P>
    <P>As regards veterinary surgeons' fees, if the powers are transferred, as the Minister suggests, to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries it will be <Col N="1422" /> found that there has been much discussion already about whether veterinary surgeons' charges are generally higher than doctors' charges for calls to farms at present.  It has been suggested that the vets are charging too much but it is forgotten that very often vets must undertake most arduous tasks which take a long time, involving remaining on the farm for long periods. One thing that might be mentioned is the common operation now of a caesarean being performed on a cow which cannot give birth to a calf.  Fifteen years ago this operation was unknown but it might now require a vet to stay four or six hours on a farm.  One could not expect in such a case that the vet would charge £1.</P>
    <P>At present, one is charged at the current rate for a mechanic working on one's car, 30 shillings per hour outside the city and £2 in the city.  I do not say the mechanic gets that amount; he does not, but when one adds all the garage services to it, that is the going rate.  That is what Deputy O'Higgins will pay if he puts his car into a city garage.  If one considers a fee is high one must realise these men have costs and expenses and are physically able to perform only a certain number of these services in a day.  My considered opinion is that when the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries meets the veterinary surgeons on this matter it will be found that justice will be done, a label will be put on this service and a proper fee, whatever it is, will be fixed but this will not mean a reduction in fees.  We cannot look to this legislation for any reduction in prices in the field of professional services.</P>
    <P>I have referred to houses but have not mentioned the fact that I, because Drogheda and Dundalk are developing so rapidly, have had groups of people coming to me.  These people had bought new houses and they complained that when it came to the final payment an extra charge was included in respect of the extra costs of labour and goods incurred by the builder during the course of building the house.  That sort of thing will continue. Creeping inflation will stay with us at the best.  At present we have galloping inflation and even that may <Col N="1423" /> stay with us and become something we must tolerate.  If the building of an average house takes nine months and there is a wage increase in that period, inevitably a clause will be included in contracts recompensing the builder for the extra costs.  The evidence for this is that every local authority accept this situation and you could not get a builder to build houses or build even one private house if that clause were not included. The only way it could be avoided would be to pay so much that you would be gambling on whether the amount by which costs increased during the building of the house would equal the extra amount of money to be paid, over and above what should have been the actual price.</P>
    <P>To some extent I see in this Bill a whitewash brush for the Government. They can point to the fact that there is control but I cannot see any reduction in costs or that in respect of doctors, dentists and in most cases house-builders&mdash;although there may be individual instances of overcharging&mdash;that there will be the spectacular reduction for which we might have hoped with the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>In the course of my <Col N="1424" /> remarks last evening I was seeking to impress on the Parliamentary Secretary, on the Government and on all concerned, the need for each of us to show much greater concern about the preservation of a healthy and aesthetic environment.  Fortunately, so far, by international standards, we are relatively free from pollution of a serious nature.  Our air is relatively clean and the same can be said of our waters. Our noise problem has not yet become very critical.  However, we must be concerned gravely with the destruction of some of our historic buildings and with the destruction of our landscape. The situation in regard to these is not beyond redemption.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it is clear that if we continue to do nothing in these areas, it will not be long before the industrial and technological developments overtake us.  I submit that it would be much cheaper for us as a nation to spend money and time now in ensuring the creation and preservation of a healthy environment and to try to redeem the situation before it is too late.  In the restricted time allowed me last evening I suggested briefly what my Party believe should be done. It is our belief that the whole range of environmental problems should be dealt with by one Minister.  We consider the matter to be of such gravity and urgency as to deserve the creation of a special Ministry.  However, if that suggestion should not be considered feasible in the circumstances, perhaps the Minister for Local Government might be empowered to deal with this whole problem and, of course, he should have available to him the staff and resources necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night, too, I pointed out that at present matters appertaining to our environment are scattered throughout a whole range of Departments&mdash;the Departments of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, Lands, Local Government, Transport and Power, Health and others.  This is an unsatisfactory situation and that is why we advocate that the matter be dealt with by one specific Department.  It is necessary that more money be spent on research.  An Foras Forbartha, the agency dealing <Col N="1425" /> primarily with matters of this kind, receive an annual grant which is totally inadequate for their purposes.  Only a small portion of that grant is devoted to physical planning, water resources and so on.  Having regard to the intrinsic worth of An Foras Forbartha and the very many talented people employed by them, they should be utilised more fully and given the necessary finances to carry out their work in this important field.  We support the motion in the names of the Fine Gael Members and we believe that new legislation should be introduced as a matter of urgency so that one Act can be substituted for the seven Acts which relate now to the matter of environment.</P>
    <P>Special help should be available to local authorities to enable them to grapple effectively with the problems of pollution.  The problem of untreated sewage, which is polluting our rivers and streams and, consequently, destroying fish life, is one with which the local authorities are genuinely concerned; but they do not have the capital resources necessary to tackle the problem. Therefore, the Minister must come to their assistance.  As of now, there is a very good chance of redeeming the situation.  We have the lowest population density in Europe&mdash;41 people per kilometre.  Our volume of production is probably the lowest in Europe.  We escaped the Industrial Revolution and half of our population reside in rural areas.  These are matters in our favour.  We have been allowed to retain very much of the natural beauty and rich scenic heritage of our country but that rich heritage is now under attack and is being whittled away.</P>
    <P>Now is the time to act.  Wildlife is under serious attack.  The natural habitat of the bird life of the country is being eroded.  Some of the Departments of State are responsible in this regard.  I refer, in particular, to the Department of Lands in regard to the work they have been doing in drainage, work that is excellent in its own way, but at the same time the Department should make every effort to retain the natural habitat of the bird life of the country.  There is a growing incidence of the use of pesticides and <Col N="1426" /> insecticides which constitutes a serious threat to our health in so far as it affects our food.  I understand that the Food Advisory Committee are concerned about this matter and that there is evidence of growing danger of organochlorine residues in food.  This is a matter which must be tackled so that we may maintain our prestige as users of good, pure and natural foods.</P>
    <P>River pollution is becoming a very serious problem.  When referring to this matter, I would have adverted to the problem as it affects this city but, no doubt, Deputy Luke Belton will deal adequately with the situation in so far as the city is concerned.  Many of the rivers in this city have become seriously polluted.  They have become stagnant cesspools, but this situation is not peculiar to the city because many of the rivers throughout the country are being affected also by the discharge of untreated sewage.  It is known that the air in this city is twice as dirty as the air in London despite the fact that we escaped the Industrial Revolution.</P>
    <P>These, then, are some of the matters one would wish to put before the House in the time available.  We must have regard to that very eminent man, Mr. Steward Lee Udall of the United States, who, after an examination of the situation in this country, said that Ireland is moving into a dangerous era, an era in which she is attracting industries which can contribute a classical pattern of pollution and despoliation of the countryside.  We should have regard to the comments of that gentleman because he has observed what has happened in his own country. I am grateful to Deputy Belton for having afforded me some of the precious time available to him for discussion of this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some months have elapsed since this motion was tabled but, due to nobody's fault in particular, it is only now that it is before the House for discussion.  In introducing the motion I referred to the condition of the River Tolka and the dreadful stench which the people who lived in the vicinity of the Tolka had to tolerate.  I addressed questions to the then Minister for Local Government <Col N="1427" /> as far back as 1969.  He disclaimed all responsibility for this and said it was entirely a matter for the local authority.  When I raised the matter with the local authority, the sanitary section of Dublin Corporation, they said there was no need to worry, that there was nothing seriously wrong with the River Tolka, that the stench was merely due to the fine weather and the low level of the river and it would disappear with the rise in the level of the river.</P>
      <P>When I contacted the medical officer of health he had a different story.  He informed me that for many years he was fully aware of the dreadful state of the River Tolka, that raw sewage was flowing into this river, and that effluent from a slaughterhouse in the vicinity of the river was also going into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation also informed me that they had considerable difficulty in exercising whatever power they had, that many of the laws which existed in regard to pollution were archaic, and that it was very difficult to bring prosecutions and to secure a conviction.  Another difficulty to which they pointed was that no Minister had any direct responsibility for this matter. While it might be primarily the duty of the Minister for Local Government, it also involved the Minister for Lands and the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and, of course, anything concerning money must involve the Minister for Finance.  A section of a very old Act provided that the Minister for Local Government could not act without prior consultation and prior agreement with other Ministers.  Therefore, whatever laws were there were outdated and could not be enforced by the local authorities.  There is also the consideration that the penalties laid down in this out-of-date legislation were related to the time when the legislation was introduced.  A minimal fine of £5 was the normal penalty to be imposed against anyone guilty of a pollution offence.  If any industry or factory were to pollute a river today and if a prosecution were to be brought against them, they might find it much more economical to pay the <Col N="1428" /> £5 fine than to carry out the reconstruction work necessary for the prevention of pollution.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde, who seconded this Bill, referred to our unique position in that, unlike many other countries, our rivers are our own concern and we do not have to worry if any laws we would make to prevent the pollution of a river would affect another country through which that river flowed.  I do not know if there is any river flowing both through the northern and southern parts of the country, but certainly it would not affect our legislation to any great extent.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also said there were three main ways in which river pollution was occurring: first, by allowing untreated domestic sewage to flow directly into rivers; secondly, from industrial waste from factories; and, thirdly, seepage from dumping in the vicinity of the river, or, in rural areas, agricultural pollution from artificial manures or from large piggeries adjacent to the river, or the seepage from silage.  He also posed the question as to what powers were available to the Minister should there be such a disaster as the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>.  Would the Minister have powers to deal with this or would the Department of Transport and Power have to intervene?  Or, if this happened down along the Wexford coast, for instance, would it be the responsibility of the local authority?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell referred to the effect pollution was having on our tourist industry.  If ever our tourist industry was in need of being protected, surely it is the present time.  We need all the encouragement we can possibly get to try to build up our tourist industry, because, due to circumstances outside our control, it has been very seriously affected and is likely to be still further affected.</P>
    <P>At the moment we can boast of one thing as regards pollution, that we suffer less than most other countries, that our rivers are purer and clearer than most of them, and that our air is purer.  We must do everything possible to preserve those advantages we have.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore said that local authorities <Col N="1429" /> had allowed dumping on and adjacent to beaches because it was the cheapest method of dumping.  It is a reflection on our local authorities that, just because it was the cheapest form of dumping, and regardless of the consequences they had allowed it to continue. He stated that the Thames had been in a far worse condition than ever the Liffey was but that the Thames was now clear of pollution.  He exhorted us to tackle the Liffey problem, and said he regarded pollution as a disease that must be conquered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cruise-O'Brien gave us the benefit of his experience in America. He told us of the conditions in New York which probably suffers more from air pollution than any other city.  He said that in America unrestricted free enterprise allows factories to operate without having regard to their effect on the pollution of the air in the cities.  In Britain and France certain conditions and regulations are laid down with which factories must comply.  Deputy Cruise-O'Brien wondered whether we in Ireland, because of our anxiety to provide factories here, might be inclined to allow the American system to operate rather than the French or British system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling, like his colleague, Deputy O'Connell, was worried about the state of the Camac river.  He said that the medical Officer of Health for Dublin had stated that this river was not polluted but that, when it was examined, it was found to be very definitely polluted and that fish life was extinct in it.  He said that if you were looking for the Camac there was no need to get a map, and this applies to the Liffey too.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry and Deputy Cott referred to pollution in the south of Ireland.  Deputy Barry suggested that there should be a Minister for environment. I was at a meeting in Mullingar two or three nights ago and the people there are very worried about the state of Lough Ennell.  They also mentioned that Lough Sheelin is heavily polluted and Lough Derravarragh.  The problem of pollution is spreading and increasing.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary told us yesterday that the Minister agreed that <Col N="1430" /> there was no major problem and said that he had powers to deal with the present situation.  He was hoping that we would not press this motion too hard.  Deputy de Valera was in favour of getting pollution under control but he was worried about having too many laws on the Statute Book and none of them enforced, as is the case in regard to road traffic legislation.  The idea behind this motion was to restrict the number of laws on the Statute Book and, instead of having several archaic measures, and several different Ministers responsible, that the whole question should be put under the control of one Minister.  We also wanted to awaken public opinion to the dangers of pollution.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister is fully satisfied that he has ample powers to deal with the present situation. We will not press this motion unduly if the Minister will guarantee that he will utilise fully the powers available to him and, as Deputy Treacy said, that he will not hesitate to allocate the necessary money to the different bodies dealing with it.  The Minister told us that he hoped to have a report from the commission he had set up by autumn but, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, that report is still not available.</P>
    <P>The Minister should utilise whatever powers he has.  He should allocate the necessary money to the people who are inquiring into this problem.  If he finds that he lacks any powers he should not hesitate to acknowledge that.  He should seek all the powers he needs to deal with the problem as effectively and expeditiously as possible.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Dangerous Drugs Bill, 1971: First Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to make further and better provision to control the distribution and manufacture of certain drugs and to provide for related matters.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Dr. Byrne.)</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody knows that unfortunately the problem of drug taking is increasing and has assumed frightening proportions.  We believe that adequate legislation and adequate treatment facilities are lacking to deal with this really urgent problem.  There appears to be no indication whatever that this trend will not continue at an even faster rate.  The Bill provides for the imposition of a maximum of 15 years imprisonment on drug pushers. This is similar to the legislation under which that type of person is dealt with in other countries.  The Bill also provides that addicts can be treated compulsorily. It also seeks to deter people from manufacturing these drugs on their premises.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and his Department have had the report from the working party on drug abuse before them for practically 12 months.  During that time little has been done about it.  The report makes suggestions which I believe should be discussed in this House.  In moving this Bill and giving the House an opportunity of discussing it, we are also providing an opportunity for discussing the report of the working party on drug abuse.  In our opinion the control of drugs is urgently necessary. The House should also discuss how we should deal with drug pushers. I believe that parents throughout the country, and all those who are closely associated with the drug problem, will thank this House if we give it our immediate attention and give them some help and hope for the children of Ireland in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne1969" hpid="Dr. Byrne Dr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill provides for a maximum of 15 years penal servitude for anyone caught illegally selling for a consideration any of the substances outlined in the Bill.  One of the possible defects is that there is no graded scale of penalties in accordance with the report of the working party on drug abuse, brought out last year.  We feel that this is an important interim measure.  Any amendments which are found necessary to the 15 years penal servitude provision can be brought in at a later date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We drafted and moved the Bill because the problem of drug abuse has <Col N="1432" /> escalated considerably over the past number of years.  It is not sufficient for this problem to be dealt with solely by the Minister for Health.  On 30th July, 1970, on an adjournment debate, as reported at column 2867 of the Official Report, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Deputy knows perfectly well that I and the health authorities have taken every possible step to deal with drug addiction here.</P>
    <P>At that stage I did not know perfectly well and I still do not know perfectly well that they have done everything possible.  The only step taken since 1934 when the Dangerous Drugs Act was passed was the introduction of section 78 of the 1970 Health Act which provided for a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months.  This section, also, by definition, included the drug LSD which up to that date had not been included at all and which we know is one of the most widely abused of all drugs in this city.</P>
    <P>We would like to say further that under this Bill it should be an offence for anybody to allow his premises to be used for the manufacture of drugs or knowingly to allow peddling to take place on his premises and on conviction he should be sentenced to penal servitude of seven years or have to pay a fine of £500.  The Garda Síochána drug squad can obtain a search warrant under subsection (5) of section 78 of the 1970 Health Act, which refers back to section 31 of the 1934 Health Act, but a justice of the District Court must be asked by a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána to sign the search warrant. It is almost impossible to obtain a search warrant late at night when men of such high standing have got to be obtained, particularly at the weekend. We should make easier provision for obtaining search warrants.</P>
    <P>I also want to quote the Minister from the Dáil Debates of 30th July, 1970, when he said:</P>
    <P>I shall do my best in this matter but there is no crisis situation in regard to drug addiction in this country and I hope there will not be <Col N="1433" /> a crisis.  It is no use for a Deputy to get up in this House and make these statements without providing the evidence.</P>
    <P>I would like to state that the evidence was provided 12 months ago by the working party on drug abuse when they brought in their report.  We feel very strongly about this and we certainly denounce the Minister for Health for playing party politics by not allowing this Bill to be introduced sooner, to appear on the Statute Book and then be amended as desirable in accordance with the wishes of the working party on drug abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that we support the publication of this Private Members' Bill because we think the drug problem is a serious problem and any measures within reason that can be taken to control this serious menace are desirable. Secondly, we would like to see it published because we cannot accept the excuse from the Minister for Health that he intends to bring in his own legislation.  The right of this House to bring in a Private Members' Bill, to have the First Stage accepted, and allow the Bill to be published should be granted.  We support the Bill for that basic reason alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Childers) Erskine Hamilton Childers">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Childers)</NameTxt>
      <P>The stated purpose of the Bill is to make further and better provision to control the distribution and manufacture of certain drugs and to provide for related matters.  The general scheme of a Bill to provide additional measures for the control of drug abuse and to amend the Dangerous Drugs <Col N="1434" /> Act, 1934, was approved by the Government on 9th November, 1971. The provision of the legislation will be comprehensive and will enable extensive and improved controls over the manufacture, distribution, possession, <i>et cetera,</i> of drugs to be implemented.</P>
      <P>The relevant recommendations from the working party on drug abuse have been fully taken into account in framing the scheme of legislation.  The drafting of this Bill in accordance with the scheme approved by the Government is in an advanced stage and the introduction of the legislation will not be long delayed.  In the circumstances, and having regard to the more comprehensive nature of the legislation proposed, in the context of the overall problem of drug abuse, there would be little point in proceeding with the Bill on the lines proposed by Deputies Byrne and Barry.  When the Government legislation comes before the House Deputies will have every opportunity of raising any points on which they feel the legislation does not measure up to requirements. They can mention these points and make comparison between this Private Members' Bill and the actual Bill when introduced.  Any amendments which Deputies may wish to suggest at the appropriate Stage of the passage of the Bill will be considered on their merits and not in any spirit. I hope, of party conflict because I do not think the Bill will have a party content.  In all the circumstances I propose that the House should not give its consent to the First Reading of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I introduce this as a politician and not as a doctor.  To me this particular Bill represents the rights of the minority in a pluralist society, a society such as ours.  It is a right which I believe should be accorded to the religious minority living in our society here as well as those Catholics who feel that they conscientiously have a right to use contraceptive methods if they wish to do so.</P>
      <P>I want to show beyond any doubt that this Parliament, predominantly, is opposed to the giving of minority rights to a religious minority in a pluralist society whether it is a 5 per cent or a 25 per cent minority.  The issue of contraception to me is a part of the issue of the <i>Ne Temere</i> decree, Article 4 of the Constitution, Article 41 of the Constitution in relation to divorce, censorship of publications, the right of community schools, representation of all or no religion preferably, as far as I am concerned, secular schools, a non-sectarian attitude towards legal adoption. All of these issues are being decided here tonight because they all have the same content.</P>
      <P>What astonishes me is that we are not even allowed to print this Bill. The Minister for Health recently gave me authority to print and circulate a Bill about tobacco.  I have been forbidden to print and circulate, with Deputy O'Connell, this Bill about the issue of contraception.  It is a simple Bill.  All it does is to allow for the sale under certain protection of contraceptive devices.  That is one part.  The second part is the repeal of the law which prevents the circulation of responsible advice on family planning.</P>
      <P>These facilities have been asked for by the Protestant minority down here and by the Catholic minority who do not share the general view on this matter.  For that reason we introduced this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider it to be extraordinary that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Hillery, is at present touring the world, begging for help from Canada, America, France a Common Market country, to get minority rights in the North of Ireland.  The Taoiseach has said that he himself is anxious to <Col N="1438" /> help win for the minority in the North of Ireland their rights there under the Orange, Unionist Government.  We have been refused permission even to circulate this Bill so that people will know what is in it and will not be frightened by it, and that it will not be misrepresented.  The damage done to us by that misrepresentation shows that the only equal for sectarian bigotry in this country to the present Fianna Fáil Government are the Unionist bigots in the North who perpetrate the same kind of sectarian discrimination against the minority in the North.  I believe that that is disclosed today, is shown today without question.  But there is this difference between the North and the South.  At least in the North they make no pretence of wanting a united Ireland.  We do.</P>
    <P>In all of the items I have mentioned we have shown the religious minority here that they are to be discriminated against because they are a religious minority and because we allow ourselves in relation to our social teaching, economic teaching and in matters of conscience such as this to be dictated to by the majority church in this country.  This is now being demonstrated beyond any doubt whatsoever. There is no use in the Minister pleading that he is setting up a commission. This Parliament has been here for nearly 50 years.  The Government have been in office for 40 years. An all-party committee recommended five or six years ago that most of these disabilities on the minority in this part of the country should be removed and none of the parties&mdash;the Government, Fine Gael or the Labour Party&mdash;have taken the initiative to remove the disabilities which at present affect minorities here.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad this was introduced by Senators Mary Robinson, John Horgan and West and they also were refused permission to print or circulate the Bill.  One of the most pathetic examples of the position of the Protestants here, I felt, was shown up in a request by one of the Protestant Senators, Senator Jessop.  He asked: &ldquo;May I ask a question?&rdquo;.  A Protestant Cathaoirleach replied to him: &ldquo;Yes, as <Col N="1439" /> long as you make it a very short one&rdquo;. That was two Protestants talking to each other in a Catholic Parliament. They were not allowed to consider or seriously debate this very serious and important issue.  The 1937 Constitution established what I have described before as a symbolic relationship between the Church and State, each furthering the interests of the other. The Government appear to feel that since 1937 all this was carried out in a vacuum.  How can this Government continue to behave in this way in the light of the present circumstances, with the enormously increased seriousness of these issues?  They were always serious but they are very much more serious now because the unfortunate, wonderful people who are fighting for civil rights in the North know quite well that the most eloquent, the most telling, the most damning case against a united Ireland has been made by successive Governments down here.</P>

      <P>This Bill adumbrates the one change in our Constitution which is absolutely vital if we are to show the minority here and the majority in Northern Ireland that we are sincere in our attempts to eliminate any discrimination.  This Bill, and I speak now as a doctor and a politician, provides the right of private family planning.  This right was guaranteed at the United Nations Convention in Teheran in 1968, a Convention to which Ireland was a signatory, and that Convention provided that couples had a basic human right to family planning.  It also provided that the right to education should be guaranteed as a basic human right.  We, the Irish delegates, subscribed to this Convention and supported it.  Because of that I am more than surprised that we still have here laws which discriminate against people, against the minority and others, who want to go by their own consciences in the matter of family planning.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act of 1935 and the Censorship of Publications Act are discriminatory.</P>
      <P>We are asking here for the right to have this Bill published.  This is a very important right.  Any political party here should have the right to publish this Bill so that it can be discussed by the public and by the Members of this House.  The Taoiseach has been pleading for help in the solution of the problem of Partition.  If he is sincere in that then let him prove his sincerity and the sincerity of his Government by allowing this Bill to be published and by not voting against it.  That would prove that the Government are anxious for a 32-county, non-sectarian State.  This is vital because in a 32-county State we must include the Northern Protestants and we must guarantee their rights to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the statement of the Taoiseach that the matter is <i>Sub judice</i> and he and his Government cannot, therefore, support this Bill.  <i>Sub judice</i> implies that a man is on trial anything we might say here might pre- <Col N="1441" /> judice his case.  But that does not arise in this.  We, the Parliament, have the right to change the laws, laws which are not in the interests of our people. I cannot understand how the Taoiseach could argue, with sincerity, that the matter is <i>sub judice</i>.  This is a matter for this Dáil to decide.  It is for this Dáil to remove from the Statute Book discriminatory legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are expecting moves or sacrifices <Col N="1442" /> from the Unionist majority in the North we, too, will have to face up to some change from our present stance and policy.</P>
    <P>This Bill presents us with an opportunity of doing exactly that.  The fact that the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act is being tested and may be proved unconstitutional is not a sufficient answer and will not provide the safeguards we ask for in this Bill.  Proving that Act unconstitutional will not eliminate the discrimination or the prohibition of education on family planning. I appeal to Deputies on the Government benches to support this Bill and give us the right to publish so that there can be free discussion. That is all we ask in all sincerity.  We ask for a free vote on the Government benches so that there can be free discussion and it cannot be said in the North that we practice the same sectarianism, bigotry and hatred that they practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> As spokesman for this party on Justice it falls to me to speak on this Bill.  First of all, I should like to outline very briefly what is involved here.  The procedure under Standing Orders in relation to the introduction of a Private Members' Bill, unlike a Government Bill, lays it down that the Bill cannot be printed and circulated to Members until a Resolution of the House directing that it be printed and circulated has been passed.  Many people think that is a denial of the rights of Opposition parties.  Many people think that that Standing Order should be amended and, perhaps, before very long it will be amended so that a Private Members' Bill like an ordinary Government Bill can be introduced, printed and circulated and discussed on its merits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals with a delicate personal problem, a problem that was first highlighted by the Taoiseach in the last couple of years and by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs. Earlier this evening the Fine Gael Party sought to introduce a Bill dealing with the problem of drugs among young people in an effort to curtail and control drug taking and drug pushing.  We wanted to get that Bill <Col N="1443" /> printed and circulated so that it could be discussed on its merits.  We did not succeed because, under Standing Orders, the Government opposed the Bill and denied us the right to circulate it.</P>
    <P>I very seldom find myself in agreement with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Browne.  I do not know whether or not I am in agreement with the proposals contained in this Bill because I have not seen those proposals. Deputy Browne in the short time he devoted to the Bill talked about certain conditions, about ministerial control, about responsible advice. I do not know what all that means. I believe, as this party have always believed, that we should have an opportunity of reading the Bill, seeing what is in it and making up our minds on its merits or demerits and voting on it in the light of that.</P>
    <P>This subject was first introduced by no less a person than the Taoiseach followed up, I think, at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis or shortly after it, by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Hillery.  It is time it was discussed and put out of our minds one way or another.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not committing this party, myself or any other member of it either to supporting or opposing the Bill because we do not know what is in it.  When the party see the Bill, if the Government agree to publish it, we shall make up our minds on it and either support or oppose it. As the principal Opposition party, we should take the stand of supporting discussion and supporting the right of the Opposition parties to have a Bill or a motion fully discussed.  There is a large volume of opinion in the House that the Standing Orders in relation to Private Members' Bills are unjust and unfair to the Opposition and I hope that within the lifetime of this Dáil they will be changed.  I support the printing and circulation of this Bill.  I say nothing about its merits or demerits because of them I know nothing.  I shall make up my mind when I see the Bill.</P>

      <P>I shall give them. First, the Government accept and believe that there are people genuinely dissatisfied with the present law in relation to contraceptives and the advocacy of contraception.  It is the Government's view that the simple amendment of section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, would effect a substantially greater change than has been advocated by the vast majority of those who have expressed themselves as being in favour of some change.  That includes representatives of many religious denominations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy not indulge in the habit of interrupting. I want to explain the difficulties and problems that arise in framing proper legislation to deal with this matter.  The strongest argument that has been advanced by those in favour of some change has been that the law should not deny to any married couple the means to acquire contraceptives if they so wish and that, in regard to the use of contraceptives, the State should not interfere in a matter of private morality. This question is one of private morality.  This is the real issue and it should not be confused with the other issue of Irish unity.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise here that considerations other than the consideration of private morality are involved in this area.  The free availability of contraceptives and literature advocating contraception and advertising contraceptives could have significant social implications.  Deputy Dr. Browne is well known for his advocacy of countering the social evils that flow from unrestricted and unrestrained advertising in regard to any matter.  There would be, of course, serious practical difficulties&mdash;and this is our problem at present&mdash;in evolving an effective method of limiting the availability of contraceptives to any particular category or categories of persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This aspect is being thoroughly examined by the Government at present.  The effect of the enactment of the proposed Bill or any measure which would deal <i>simpliciter</i> with, as is suggested in the title of the Bill, the deletion of section 17 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, would be that anybody who wanted contraceptives could get them lawfully either by purchasing them in this State or by importing them in person or through the post.  In addition, the title of the Bill proposes the consequential <Col N="1446" /> deletions of sections in the Censorship of Publications Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the sections that deal with advertising publicity and sale of contraceptives.  The point I am emphasising is that a simple amendment of the Acts relating to this matter, deleting section 17 from the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, deleting sections 16 and 17, as suggested in the title of the Bill, of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929, and amending sections 7 and 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946&mdash;the effect of implementing these amendments and deletions would be unrestrained and unrestricted sale, publicity and advertising.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties and problems involved are being fully explored at present. We believe that the Private Member sponsors of this measure are not sufficiently aware of the deep and complex problems involved in drafting <Col N="1447" /> a measure which can have regard to the private morality aspect and, at the same time, deal with the very practical and real difficulties that are involved in preventing undue advertising, undue publicity or undue sale or an approach to contraceptives that is completely unrestricted and unrestrained.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Prices (Amendment) Bill, 1971: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned I had been dealing with the question of professional services but before I proceed with that I want to advert to the question of the powers that are to be vested in certain people to see that the charges for these services are fair and equitable.</P>
      <P>This Bill provides, as I have mentioned, in passing, when discussing another aspect of it, for the transfer of these powers to the various Ministers, to the Minister for Health, in the case of doctors and dentists, to the Minister for Local Government in respect of houses and so forth.  At the same time, we have had the establishment of the National Prices Commission.  I do not want to criticise in any way the National Prices Commission or the personnel on it, because I have the greatest respect for every member of that commission, of whom I know all except one.  However, there seems to be an extraordinary divergence of activity on the part of the Government.  Each Minister of State will have responsibility for the fixing of prices for services and goods in the particular sector within his administration.  For instance, the Minister for Industry and Commerce will, I presume, have responsibility under this Bill, without delegating to any other Minister, for the prices of ordinary consumer goods.  Why then should we have the National Prices Commission, and the abolition of the Prices Advisory Committees with provision made for other prices advisory committees?</P>
      <P>It really means that this National Prices Commission is not a commission within the meaning of the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; as I learned it at school. My understanding of the word was that a commission were inviolable, that if we established a commission the country at large would accept the fact that this commission could not be influenced by the Minister, could not be influenced by anybody, even as to the extent of the time they might take to produce their findings.  It would appear to me that the National Prices Commission are in the same position as the Prices Advisory Committees were in before the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I understand the situation, and I have practical experience of it, the Prices Advisory Committees produced findings which were sent to the Minister. They were not of necessity accepted by the Minister.  He ruled on whether or not they were to be accepted.  In the last case which was dealt with, the findings were altered by the Minister&mdash;not in great depth, but they were altered.  There were many cases in the past where findings of Prices Advisory Committees were altered quite radically by Ministers.  I am not saying that the alterations were wrong.  I am merely stating that the <Col N="1451" /> Prices Advisory Committees, which are still to continue as I understand it, were not all-powerful.</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission now seem to be factually&mdash;and I use the word deliberately&mdash;relegated to the position of an advisory body, perhaps a very important advisory body, and perhaps one that can help the Minister in dealing with problems relating to the cost of services and the cost of goods.  It is an anomaly to see a National Prices Commission established and a Bill introduced into the Dáil which gives to each Minister in respect of the part of our lives for which he has responsibility the final say and the arbitrary right to decide what we will pay for our services or our goods.</P>
    <P>I have not dealt with the question of the law.  As I understand it, in costs for legal work there are scaled fees.  The scaled fees here are rather like the scaled fees in England except, so far as I know, for the transfer of property, in which case they are somewhat higher here.  I am told that the reason is that there is less property and less business to be transferred here.  Perhaps that was so in the past but, with the development of our nation, and because we have such a backlog in housing and must of necessity during the next 15 or 20 years try to catch up with this backlog, it is no longer the case and it appears to me that we must look at the scaled fees.</P>
    <P>It has been said to me&mdash;and I agree with it completely&mdash;that one of the cheapest forms of law is that provided by barristers who give opinions.  A solicitor who wishes to have something clarified for a client sends his brief, having prepared it carefully, to a junior or senior counsel who has, perhaps, specialised in that section of the law.  The normal sort of fee charged for a most exhaustive opinion is about 15 guineas or less by a junior and about 50 guineas by an eminent senior.  There is a lot of work in the investigation of legal problems by these gentlemen.  They put their reputation at stake when they give an opinion.  It <Col N="1452" /> is possible that an experienced junior or senior counsel would have investigated the same type of problem before and he might be in a position to do the job much faster than a colleague. This service has been cheap and efficient.</P>
    <P>The service that seems to me to be quite expensive at times is the service charged for on scaled fees on the transfer of property.  I do not wish to say that there have been overcharges. I know perfectly well that in many cases the transfer of property is an easy matter where administration is taken out by the people who own it, and where it had been owned by their forefathers, and where there was only one move to be made.  Solicitors have bashed their brains out trying to clear title in cases where perhaps for two, three or four generations administration had not been taken out and, for borrowing purposes or any other purposes, it was necessary that there should be clear title to the deeds of property.</P>
    <P>There is a great variation in the amount of work that has to be done. For this reason I am certain that solicitors have worked extremely hard for very little.  In other cases solicitors have worked very little for quite a large fee.  I am not saying this in criticism but perhaps the matter should be investigated.  I am glad that services are included in this Bill.  There is no objection to it.  I do not want to criticise the legal side in any way except to say that that problem may exist.</P>
    <P>One must not accept that all the complaints one hears are properly based, but one of the complaints one commonly hears is that in the building of 100 or 200 private houses there are scaled fees on every one of them when, in the first instance, the architect who drew up the plans decided on the different sections of ground.  Young people going into these houses should not have to pay the full scale fee in respect of what would seem to be a repetitive action on the part of the solicitor.  The production of legal documents by solicitors for building societies is also repetitive.  The contracts were printed in hundreds and were, perhaps, changed ten years ago. <Col N="1453" /> The scaled fee could be looked at.  That is the only criticism I have to offer on that aspect of the service.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that hire purchase transactions are included and that they can be investigated.  There have been many first-class hire purchase companies. The commercial banks have set up what could be described as subsidiary companies that engage in hire purchase and provide short-term finance in different ways from the commercial banks.  This is a good thing since it provides competitions from a reputable source.  The people who were grinding the faces of the poor in hire purchase transactions have now got competition from this reputable source which will not overcharge them.</P>
    <P>I started my contribution with the statement that price control could never be effective.  I do not believe for a moment that it could be effective either in the case of services or goods except in the case of a loaf of bread, a bottle of beer or something which is clearly definable.  In the Monthly Report No. 2 of the National Prices Commission Report for December, 1971, at page 7 paragraph 8 it is stated:</P>
    <P>Any attempt to control rigidly the prices of all or most food and household products would have little or no prospect of success.  In the grocery trade alone there were nearly 11,000 outlets at the last Census of Distribution.  A typical small to medium independent grocer or member of a voluntary chain might stock 500-700 different lines, and a large supermarket might stock upwards of 1,500 to 2,000 different food and household items.  Given the sheer scale of the problem, effective enforcement of the controlled prices would be virtually impossible. Moreover, price controls would slow down improvements in organisation and efficiency in retailing and in that way could make for still higher prices in the future.</P>
    <P>This is something that, as I say, corroborates that fully effective price control is an impossibility.  It is easier in regard to grocery items than clothes items or other items like that.  The fact <Col N="1454" /> that you can now make the person, if you want to, put the price and the weight on the article at the point of sale is a good step in that direction. Nevertheless, the grocery items are probably the easiest ones and yet we have the National Prices Commission saying that there is no hope of rigidly enforcing such a price control.</P>
    <P>I now want to pass on to what has happened in the past and deal with whether or not this legislation will have any effect on the Government's failures in the past in regard to price control. This party are in favour of price control but there is a necessity to ensure that jobs shall not be put in jeopardy by dilatory action on the part of anybody. In a case where a price increase is necessary the Minister has a good prices section in his Department who are capable of giving him in time the necessary advice, I think there is evidence that in the past when an item came up, which was of political potency, the Minister and the Cabinet dithered and related the increase in price, which would have been a small one, to the next election or the next-by-election. In that way they created the situation that in the end not only had a huge increase to be given but also back money had to be given in respect of what was stated to be a loss of £26,000 per week, for as long as nine months.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the flour and bread inquiry.  I want to point to what happened in relation to that inquiry and how it was dealt with by the Government. I have no doubt the Government were receiving letters from the flour milling people, who are a most active body in that regard, and have a permanent staff working on their cost increases.  I believe that because bread was a political factor the flour millers over the years were forced into that position.  The bread producers had to wait for an increase in the price of bread until after the next election and only then was the increase given.  That has been the Government's attitude over the years.</P>
    <P>The inter-Party Government had a different line on this: they produced food subsidies.  It appears as if that <Col N="1455" /> particular line, with the Common Market on the threshold, has now gone.  At the time it was a most advantageous method of helping the less well off section of the community and giving them an advantage in respect of the essential items of their diet.  I will not comment further on why the flour millers have a permanent staff working on their cost increases.  I will only say that information was presented to the Government that the industry was losing £26,000 per week and nothing was done.  By-elections were pending in Longford-Westmeath and in Kildare. Eventually the flour millers announced they intended to break the law, that on a certain day they would increase the price of a sack of flour.  There was a period of tension and not long after the present Minister was put in charge of the Department of Industry and Commerce and the flour and bread inquiry was established.  The result of that inquiry was not only had there to be this large increase but that back money had to be paid.  In fact, the woman in Gardiner Street who buys two loaves of bread tomorrow is paying not only for the bread she buys but also for the much smaller increase she should have been paying at a time when it was not propitious for the Government to allow the increase to be given, as far back as 12 or 15 months ago.</P>
    <P>My point in making this case is that if there are industries in this country who validly need any increase in the price of their products to continue in operation that price increase must come quickly.  There is no point in creating a situation whereby an industry can perhaps produce a loss over a period of 12 or 18 months before they get their price increase.  The Minister might say that there never was such a delay.  I say to him there was such a delay and there were such situations forced on industries.  That put jobs in jeopardy and meant that profits which could have been used to improve industries for the challenge of the Common Market were not so applied.</P>
    <P>This new system cannot work unless not only is justice done as far as the consumer is concerned but that justice <Col N="1456" /> is done as far as the industrial worker and his boss are concerned.  I want to know whether or not this new system proposed by the Government will speed up things.  There is no point in postponing the evil day as happened in the case of bread.  If there is a relatively small increase required it should be given immediately.  This has been the fault of successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Industry and Commerce who were prepared to place party first and consideration of these particular problems afterwards.</P>
    <P>It is not possible in the case of most industries to do what was done in the case of the flour and bread inquiry. This particular industry is a closely-knit one in which it was possible to give back money, to arrange a price that would be a general price for a sack of flour and for a loaf of bread. It was perhaps only a little more complex than arranging a price for Guinness's stout which is only manufactured by one firm.  How can an industry which has 12 or 13 factories within its ambit, which has not got a price increase and which makes varying products within the same line of business, be compensated for a period in which the increase that was necessary to keep their industry viable and prepare them for the future was not given?  It is not possible because they are not a closely-knit unit.  They are all producing different things, each within the same line of business.</P>
    <P>It is therefore necessary that justice be done on both sides without any thought of general elections, by-elections or whether the Government are popular or unpopular.  I have not access to the files and archives of the Department but it would not require any great intelligence to instance the cases in which price increases have been allowed.  The message I would give to the consumer first, to industrial workers second and to employers is that there is necessity for more than this legislation which is nearly a difference in mechanics.  There will be price increases if inflation creates the need for them.  They should be allowed only in small measure at the right time and as soon as possible after they become <Col N="1457" /> necessary.  That is the only way in which fair play can be given to everyone. If fair play is not given the result is unemployment and we are not doing so well in that respect at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the logic of the second paragraph of the Minister's opening speech in which he said:</P>
    <P>The system of price control operated up to now has been directed primarily towards manufacturers, importers and wholesalers.  It was expected that competition would be instrumental in keeping retailers' prices generally at reasonable levels. This form of control was particularly appropriate when the majority of home manufacturers were protected by high tariff walls, but it has been gradually losing a great deal of its relevance in recent years with the dismantling of tariffs between ourselves and Britain under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement and the resulting gradual exposure of home manufacturers to competition from external manufacturers. With our entry into the EEC competition from external firms will be further accentuated and if in these circumstances a home manufacturer succeeds in making good profits, it will generally be the result of the efficiency of the firm concerned and not through charging excessive prices.</P>
    <P>That is true but what does it convey? To me it is a bit of waffle.  It merely states that any trader here who makes profits in competition with goods from abroad is efficient.  This legislation has no bearing on that.  If I were the Minister and that statement was handed to me&mdash;I do not know whether the speech was written for the Minister&mdash;I would draw my pen straight through that paragraph because I do not think it does any good as far as putting across this legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph on page 3 of the Minister's speech states that a feature of trading at the importing, wholesale and retail levels is the adding on of a percentage mark-up on buying prices.  A percentage make-up naturally gives a higher real profit, but it is also true that a percentage mark-up on an <Col N="1458" /> article is related to the cost of bringing the article on to the counter, paying rents, rates and taxes, paying for heating the shop, paying the other expenses, taking all risks of bad debts.  That statement in the speech more or less indicates that if an article cost 10p a year ago and if the mark-up were 20 per cent, and if the price today is 15p, the mark-up should not be regarded as 20 per cent.  That is a fallacious argument.  After all, is the unfortunate shop-assistant not entitled to an increase, does heating not cost more, have rents and rates not gone up?  A trader who was able to exist on a 20 per cent mark-up last year could not exist on less than 20 per cent this year because the article had increased in price and so had costs.</P>
    <P>I fear that to some extent there is written into the Minister's speech a suggestion that small shopkeepers in particular and generally persons in trade have been getting too high profits.  I do not accept that.  This is a country with a small population.  In Britain, with high populations in towns, the turnover even at small shops can be spectacularly higher than here and they can therefore make higher profits on smaller percentage mark-ups.  I do not hold that profits in shops here have been excessive.</P>
    <P>The solution is to have price investigation and control.  In that way justice would be done and would be seen to be done.  I do not think this Bill will reduce prices for the consumer. There may be individual instances of some trader hitting the jackpot.  An instance I could give is of somebody importing Italian fashion hats.  I understand a profit of 150 per cent can be made on them.  I am sure that if one were to bottle French perfume in a back room one could make 300 per cent if you could sell the thing. But how many people want Italian fashion hats or French perfume bottled in back rooms?  The number is strictly limited.</P>
    <P>For that reason the housewife who goes to the supermarket to buy ordinary grocery goods or ordinary clothes for everyday use for her children, or the ordinary man who goes to buy a suit, are not paying to the shopkeeper <Col N="1459" /> a very high percentage mark-up.  At the same time, as I have said, it is necessary there should be investigation.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the House further except to express the hope in relation to this legislation that when action comes to be taken on a projected price increase it be taken swiftly and that the application should be refused, partly granted or given fully. I speak from experience of the disastrous flour and bread inquiry.  I was on oath in the box for an hour in private session and I was present for more than half a day at that inquiry. My impression of that disastrous inquiry was that it was entirely the fault of the Government that a situation was created in which the unfortunate women of this city are now paying back-money on bread.  They are not only paying the increase, the justice of which one can argue about, but also back-money and will pay it, if I remember rightly, for the rest of this year.</P>
    <P>What is needed is fair play for the professional people and for their clients, swiftly applied, fair play for the shopkeepers and their customers, swiftly applied, and, perhaps most important of all, fair play for the industrialists and their workers, swiftly applied.  In this way pace can be kept with creeping inflation which will always be with us; wage increases can be granted perhaps more often but can be smaller and have less of an impact on our exports and on our employment.  Price increases may occur more often but again these will be smaller and will be fairer and will keep our industry and our distributive trades, our professional services and the people who have to avail of them in line with the increases in costs.  The Government have, in my time in this House, constantly postponed the unpleasant thing until the propitious political moment, with disastrous results afterwards, and have even gone to the stage of disregarding it if they felt so inclined.  Anything like that will do harm to our economy.  Our economy must progress by stages and month by month adjustments must be made. <Col N="1460" /> If there are more numerous adjustments they will be less radical and less punitive as far as employment is concerned, as far as industry is concerned and as far as the ordinary consumer is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Prices Commission remarked in their Report No. 1: &ldquo;In the field of price control there are no miracles.&rdquo;  This is quite true.  Nobody in opposition here imagines that miracles are possible.  On the other hand, disaster is not essential and that is what we have had on the prices front over the past few years.</P>
      <P>Newspaper columnists and leader writers treat of wildcat strikes being a threat to the economy.  Over the past few years we have had wildcat price increases.  We have had wholesale robbery over counters of the housewives. This robbery&mdash;that is what the price increases that took place were&mdash;was due overall to the poor economic management by the Government of the country's economy.  The taxation policies pursued by the Government, the rather haphazard attempts to bring in particular taxation policies&mdash;one thinks in particular of the doubling of the turnover tax&mdash;had their own effect in causing very sharp increases.  Decimalisation gave a further fillip to rising prices.  The housewife, who has no union fighting her side of the case, has been faced with increased prices week by week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While newspaper headlines are naturally occupied a great deal with problems elsewhere at the moment, for the ordinary people of this country the feature of life which has hurt them most over the past year has undoubtedly been in the field of prices.  This is where the increases gained under the national wage agreement disappeared. Nobody suggests that miracles are possible.  The Minister's proposals under this Bill, largely the result of consultation with the trade union movement, are overdue.  It has been remarked hitherto in relation to the Minister's approach in this field that there is a complacency which appears to pervade the corridors of power in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It has been suggested <Col N="1461" /> to us here month after month that there is nothing to worry about.  The housewives have practically been told that they have never had it so good. They certainly have never had it so dear.</P>
    <P>What could have been done has been set out pretty clearly in some of the valuable work done by the National Prices Commission.  That body achieved more in three months than did the entire Department of Industry and Commerce in the previous three years in the whole area of price control.  They make various suggestions in their Report No. 2. There is the idea of ensuring that there is greater intelligence on the purchase front for shoppers.  There is nothing extraordinary or miraculous suggested but these things just have not been done or talked about or implemented by the Department of Industry and Commerce previous to this report.</P>
    <P>The most upsetting thing in relation to price increases over the past two years has been that the impact has been felt most heavily in the field of foodstuffs.  There have been pretty sharp increases there and this is a big blow to lower income groups where the proportion of family income spent on foodstuffs is higher than at other income levels.  The report shows that the kind of intelligence available to the shopper is incomplete, that the shopper has very little knowledge of the price variations in particular localities for the same kinds of goods. We have been pressing in this House for a long time that this kind of information should be available to the shopper.  It would obviously improve the competitive position in the retail trade.  This Report No. 2 suggests that the housewives' organisation should themselves be equipped to take on this task.  In a television debate in which the Minister and I took part I suggested that there should be a television programme which would consider price variations each week and serve as an intelligence centre for the housewives so that they could compare prices and be in a better position to ensure that they get value for money. There is information available to farmers <Col N="1462" /> about cattle prices and so on. There is no reason why the housewives should not have a similar service from the national television service. Report No. 2 says:</P>
    <P>Special efforts should be made to improve the information about prices possessed by those that have least to spend.  At present these groups are worst informed and can least afford the time and money involved in shopping around for the lowest prices.</P>
    <P>This applies with the greatest force to the welfare groups, which approximate such a large percentage of the population, nearly one-quarter of a million, who would be at the disadvantage of having the least intelligence in regard to price variations in a locality.  As the report says, they probably get the poorest value for the money they have to spend.  There are two suggestions made for the marking up of prices and the report stresses the necessity for greater consumer protection and ensuring that there is no possibility of people suggesting that there are bargains when there are really no bargains at all.</P>
    <P>This Bill is introduced some months after the trade unions asked for it and suggested the basic components of the Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he has noted these reports and whether he can now give us a legislative schedule of the activity suggested in these reports.  At page 11 of the report we find:</P>
    <P>We understand that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is at present preparing an order to be made under Section 2 of the Merchandise Marks Act, 1970.  The order will require that pre-packed goods must carry an identification of the quantity contained in the package.</P>
    <P>Why the delay in this?  It is not as if any great creative energy were called for on the part of the Minister and his officials.  All they had to do was copy similar legislation in Britain.  Why then the delay?  There seems to be no satisfactory reason for the delay.  Nobody asks the Minister to perform miracles. No one suggests that price increases can be totally eliminated.  The fact is the Irish consumer has been left by <Col N="1463" /> the Government totally defenceless in the face of rising prices.  Practically all that stands between the consumer and flagrant price increases are voluntary organisations such as the Irish Housewives Association.</P>
    <P>The report goes on:</P>
    <P>When made, however, this order under the Merchandise Marks Act will remove only some of the difficulties which now face consumers. When different brands of the same product are heavily advertised, how can the typical consumer, lacking technical knowledge, decide which brand offers best value for money? How can a consumer tell whether a particular petrol, detergent, analgesic, shampoo, toothpaste, baby-food or vacuum cleaner is better or worse than a cheaper unadvertised brand?  How can he compare the quality of a retailer's own brand of instant coffee, soap or jam with that of nationally advertised brands?</P>
    <P>How indeed?  At the moment there is no information available to him and no legislative action to compel manufacturers to ensure that this information is available.  All this comes into the area of consumer protection, the area in which little has been done by the Minister and his Department and in which little indication has been given by the Minister and his Department that they recognise there is a need to be met and an urgency about the problem.</P>
    <P>The commission reject any rigid form of price control.  It is probably a confession of despair to say they will not impose rigid price control but, so bad is the situation now, this requirement is obviously necessary, certainly in the area of foodstuffs and in those areas of most vital importance for the average consumer.  Possibly the best method would be to increase the competitive position in the retail area and ensure that the most efficient and most price-conscious competitive sections are given credit.  The shopper would then be able with some sophistication to choose between the more competitively priced articles.  As the report points out, it is not possible at the moment for the <Col N="1464" /> shopper to make correct decisions because the information is not available and the law does not require the manufacturer to make the information available.</P>
    <P>Miracles are not asked for, but we do not want a continuation of the dreadful situation which has been permitted to grow here over the past two or three years.  No government can outlaw inflation.  No government can ensure that it does not occur but, here, we appear to have actually thrown petrol on inflationary tendencies in our economy; the turnover tax, decimalisation, lack of information about products, all these, coupled with the mismanagement of the economy by the Government have contributed to the present bad situation.  All these have contributed to a price increase unparalleled in Europe.  In that situation it is very difficult for trade unions to negotiate orderly increases for their members.</P>
    <P>It is true that we import a good deal of inflation because so much of our industrial manufacture is involved in imports from Britain.  Very little can be done about that in the area of economic control, but we have made a bad job of influencing the situation from the point of view of ensuring that prices did not increase to the extent to which they did.  The reason advanced for this is that possibly the Government's attention was directed elsewhere and has been so directed for quite a long time.  That story belongs to another debate.  There is a mystery as to why this Government and the Minister remained utterly inactive in the face of price increases which were eating up wage gains.  No effort was made to stem the tide of rising prices and it will take a great deal of effort now to correct this situation and damp down prices.  The introduction of the value-added tax may give another fillip to rising prices.  The introduction of that tax has been delayed until after the referendum.  With our experience of the past there is no reason to believe that at the end of the day we will not have even more extraordinary price increases as a result of the value-added tax.</P>
    <P>The idea of controlling professional <Col N="1465" /> fees and services has been mooted for a long time.  These should be subject to some surveillance.  There are reports on record which would suggest that many fees were exhorbitant.  I do not know whether or not that is true but there is certainly a case for surveillance. If the incomes of other sections are subject to a certain degree of scrutiny there is no reason why professional fees and services should not likewise be subject to some scrutiny. Auctioneers' fees are often mentioned. The fees charged appear to bear little relation to the effort or work put in by members of these bodies.  Of course, they would be the first to protest that their function is most essential.  Every occupational or professional group will think this in regard to their own occupation or profession.  Certainly, in recent years in the case of house purchases, auctioneers' fees appear to be rather high.  House purchasers appear to be very indignant about the amount auctioneers claimed in fees.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have some say in regard to new house prices.  Deputy Donegan has already mentioned the way in which prices have gone in this area and described how the purchaser enters into a contract for one price but when the house is built he finds it costs a great deal more.  The builder would say that wage costs had gone up in the interim.  But it is still good that when professional fees are subject to scrutiny, this area which previously seemed to be subject to no control will have some attention focussed on it as a result of this Bill.  To quote somebody else: &ldquo;If it does not do any good, it can scarcely do any harm.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister when we may look forward to some of the recommendations of the Prices Commission No. 2 being implemented. He has had their report since December.  There is the recommendation on page 12 in which they state:</P>
    <P>We recommend that a consumer research and testing unit be established within the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.</P>
    <P>That could well be undertaken and it would seem to be a desirable extension of the information available to consumers. There is also a recommendation <Col N="1466" /> about public sector prices.  When one talks about price surveillance and so on people think that this is another form of creeping socialism, a stealthy advance by the tax inspector into the pockets of individual citizens.  The Prices Commission report suggests that the public sector, the prices of public companies and of the State sector should also be subject to certain surveillance. On page 15 it is stated:</P>
    <P>The National Prices Commission would be free, however, to examine and report on a proposed increase in prices or charges by a semi-State body.  We do not regard price control as a discipline appropriate only for the private sector.  In the course of our work, we will normally take the view that an increase in the prices or charges of a semi-State body or Government trading department should be submitted to detailed examination by us (or under our auspices) where the increased prices or charges would affect the generality of firms and households in this country.</P>
    <P>I welcome that.  I do not believe the State or semi-State sector should be given <i>carte blanche</i> on the basis that this is public property and should not be subject to the ordinary law which exists for private firms in regard to price increases.  If we do not protect the consumers who are spending most of their weekly income on foodstuffs for their families from prices that appear to know no limits we cannot expect, when it comes as it will this year, to the time for a general review of wages, a rational response or a disciplined approach on the part of the wage-earners to the matter of incomes increases.  The appropriate reaction from the ordinary father of a family, in company with his trade union colleagues, in regard to what he should seek in weekly increases, if he considers the records of the last two years, should be that the sky is the limit.  No counsel about productivity or efficiency should deflect him when he considers how prices have advanced in the last two years.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants inflationary problems intensified by this kind of intransigent approach by unions or a similar intransigent <Col N="1467" /> approach by managements but it can scarcely be avoided when the Government give little protection on prices generally and when ordinary simple remedies such as making information available to consumers are not adopted and when we do not do everything possible to ensure that competition is truly maintained in retail outlets.  I hope the Prices Commission go on inquiring.  I am sure they will because their work to date gives hope that they will probe other areas.</P>
    <P>The whole matter of pseudo-bargains and knock-down prices available to shoppers suggesting that extraordinary value is being given on a certain day when, in fact, the marked-down price is little different from the ordinary going price of the product, merits investigation. The whole psychology of supermarkets is designed to lure people into purchases they do not need.  One could question the kind of advertising used by certain manufacturers.  While nobody can be compelled to purchase, in the large supermarkets, foodstuffs are displayed in a certain way&mdash;phychologists have worked on this&mdash;in tempting profusion and so on, and are well-nigh irresistible to the ordinary housewives and the woman who goes in to purchase X goods comes out with X, Y and Z goods.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say his Department is not designed to reform human nature in regard to cupidity but there is a great deal to be done and one could say that the Prices Commission No. 2 report suggests many avenues of approach to price control, all apparently small and not amounting to a final, total answer but which taken in combination amount to a serious approach to combating price increases.</P>
    <P>No magic wand can wave away the prospect of price increases.  We import a great deal of our inflation but in the area of prices subject to our own decision the Government, as a consequence of their attention being focussed elsewhere, on the courts and other forums, have not had time to consider the unfortunate results for the housewife of their lack of attention on the prices front.  Now, after several years of inattention they return to the <Col N="1468" /> prices front to find it in chaos and disorder and a situation existing in which the most burning issue in the country for housewives at present is the matter of price increases.</P>
    <P>If ever we are to have an election again in our lifetime in this part of the country the Minister would do well to recall the last general election in Britain when a Conservative Premier won an election that was to become known as the shopping-bag election. That was the approach which proved effective for that Premier when he succeeded in beating a superior government. It is an approach which, unless the Minister can very quickly and progressively tackle this whole area, could prove fatal to any ambitions this Government might harbour regarding a return for them to the offices of Merrion Square, that is, if they harbour any longer such ambitions.  I recommend the Reports of the National Prices Commission to the Minister.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill.  Its formal provisions do not supply all the answers to the control of prices: they simply open up areas to a certain surveilance which up to now have not been scrutinised for price increases.  We welcome this but emphasise, at the same time, that underlying the whole approach to this Bill should be a determination to implement the report of the National Prices Commission so as to permit of some defence and information to the consumer.  The housewives of this country have been given very little information in regard to prices.  Seemingly, they have been left to the slings and arrows of outrageous price increases and without any help from the Government.</P>
    <P>Their call seems to be unheard in official quarters.  Yet, their cause, even if unheard, must affect every family in the country.  If their call is not heeded, we cannot expect ordinary income increases.  How often have Ministers come to this House with all kinds of coercive income arrangements? Prior to the Christmas before last, the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy Colley, took off his coat and we saw a picture of him in braces in <i>The Sunday Press</i> indicating that he was ready to take on the trade unions <Col N="1469" /> of the country.  The Minister, then, was controlling special incomes legislation. All of this ambitious legislation arose from the unwillingness of the trade unions to enter into an orderly arrangement relating to their incomes.  Their unwillingness arose from the chaotic position on prices.</P>
    <P>For a comparison of the rate of inflation that is gripping the country now, we must go back to the second world war.  It might be said that at that time conditions were extraordinary and that there were many countries at war with each other but today, in peace time, this Government have been responsible for a situation in inflation which, without any exaggeration, can be compared to the war years.  Little wonder, then, that the President of the Confederation of Irish Industries accuses the Government of economic mis-government.  Little wonder that voices are raised in business circles, in trade union circles and in semi-State circles by way of complaint that the Government apparently lack any interest in righting the economy.  Is it any wonder that the National Prices Commission in their report bemoan the position but, perhaps very charitably, point out that the Minister promises to do this or that?</P>
    <P>I hope that the measure before the House this evening is an indication that the Minister for Industry and Commerce intends to take his coat off &mdash;not in the fashion of his predecessor &mdash;that he will spend more time at home, will consider more the problem of price increases and will take to heart the recommendation of the National Prices Commission.  One would hope that he would get down to the solid and necessary work of attempting to combat a very serious crisis situation.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The Bill which we are dealing with now proposes to amend the prices legislation and to control prices and service charges.  It is very important thing.  It is a Bill that will affect the everyday life of each citizen in the community.  It is a Bill that will operate to effect justice as between one section of the community and another.  I am rather surprised to see the Minister <Col N="1470" /> sitting there on his own.  There is a complete absence of any member of his party to either support him, criticise him or analyse the measure with which we are now being asked to deal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> This is the second Bill that we have been asked to deal with today and if I had not stood up now the Minister would have risen immediately to reply and the debate would have concluded. We dealt today also with a measure for the purpose of controlling dangerous substances.  The Minister for Labour was entrusted with that Bill and, like the Minister for Industry and Commerce now, he was left on his own.  There was no suggestion as to whether his party as a whole agreed with the Bill which we supported.</P>
      <P>In relation to this Bill I want to say at the outset that in private life I am a solicitor and I want to direct my remarks to the proposal in the Bill to control charges in the legal profession. We operate a system of democracy in this country which is at least three-pronged. First, there is Oireachtas Éireann which enacts legislation, then, the Executive which administers that legislation and, lastly, the judiciary who interpret the legislation.  On the other side, there is the legal profession who are considered by many people to be a necessary evil but who stand up between the ordinary man in the street and the Executive.  If there is not a strong and independent legal profession to uphold the rights of the ordinary citizen, there is bound to be a situation in which the Executive will prevail, a situation in which the underdog will have no protection against the strong arm of the law.  I do not believe that the legal profession in general should be at liberty to charge any fees they wish.  I do not believe they should be above and beyond the law; neither do I believe we should create a situation here in which they would be completely in the claws of the Executive, and I am afraid that is what this Bill proposes to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Long before anything in the nature of price control was introduced the charges of the legal profession were <Col N="1471" /> controlled and regulated by various committees on which the judiciary and the legal profession were represented and in respect of which the Minister for Justice had a very substantial say. What is proposed here is that the charges which can be made by members of the legal profession should be at the discretion of the Government. That will mean that the legal profession will cease to be independent and will find itself under the control of the Executive.  If the Executive can wield the big stick and say to the legal profession: &ldquo;You will be paid so much in respect of such a service,&rdquo; the legal profession will cease to be independent. When that day comes true democracy will cease to exist in this country; the courts will be operating at less than full strength; justice will be administered in the courts with the dice loaded in favour of the Executive and against the citizen.  That is a position I hope we shall never reach.  That is why I say the fees in respect of services rendered by the legal profession should be excluded from the ambit of this Bill.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that the charges for services rendered by the legal profession should be above and beyond control.  The legal profession have never said that, nor do I say it, and I readily admit that I am a member of the council of the Incorporated Law Society.  There are at the present time &mdash;and for the sake of simplicity I shall not go into detail&mdash;several committees regulating the charges of the solicitors' profession.  I believe that should be scrapped.  There should be one overall committee representative of the judiciary, who are independent.  Once a judge is appointed to one of these superior courts he can only be removed from office by a two-thirds majority of the Oireachtas.  That independence, which is not enjoyed by many people, is conferred not just for the sake of conferring independence on him but so that he can stand between the Executive and the ordinary people, between the rich and the poor.</P>
    <P>We are agreeable to the costs of the members of the legal profession being measured by a committee consisting of the judiciary, representatives of the <Col N="1472" /> legal profession, representatives of the general public and of such professions as the accountancy profession who are in a position to measure the overhead expenses and the reasonable profit the legal profession should have.  We are not asking of the Government that the matter should rest there.  We are going further to say that such recommendations as shall be made by such an omnibus committee shall be subject to the control of Oireachtas Éireann.  The legal profession are quite agreeable to that. They have put that proposition to the Minister for Finance, to the Minister for Justice and to his predecessor, and I think that is going sufficiently far.</P>
    <P>It may be asked, and, of course, it will be asked: why should the legal profession operate under a different system from that of the grocer, the motor car assembler, the house building contractor?  My answer to that is unless you have an independent legal profession, unless you have a legal profession that can snap its fingers at the Executive, then you are on the high road to the end of democracy, and not only in this country but in any other country.  It is highly significant that in countries where they operate a similar system of democracy and courts of justice, such as England, from which we took our system of courts and system of justice, there is no interference by the Executive with the charges which can be made by the legal profession.</P>
    <P>It may be said and it will be said that I am speaking here tonight on behalf of myself and my colleagues in the legal profession.  I am trying to emphasise that the day the Minister for Industry and Commerce, the Minister for Justice, or any other Minister in the Government, or the Government collectively can say to the legal profession: &ldquo;You are entitled only to such fee as we, the Executive, decide&rdquo; they cease to be independent.  The House might be interested to know that the largest instructor or employer of the legal brains in this country is the State.  The State engages in the largest turnover of legal business in the country.  It is very important that the State can pay what it likes.  We indulge <Col N="1473" /> here in the system of patronage.  We know that many members of the legal profession who are instructed or briefed by the Government eventually end up on the bench or in other offices of security.  It is important, therefore, that on the other side of the scale we should have an independent legal profession who are not dependent on the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Justice for their bread and butter, or for the quantity of their bread and butter.</P>
    <P>That is what the proposal in this Bill is.  That is what the Minister proposes to do.  I want to warn the House and the country in general that we are embarking on a dangerous course if we do not exclude from this Bill the professional services of the legal profession. I do not say, and no member of the Council of the Incorporated Law Society, or of the solicitors' profession, or of this House says that the profession should be completely outside price control.  The solicitors' profession were subject to price control over their services when it was unheard of in this country.  The solicitors' profession were subject to a control in respect of the charges they could make long before any other profession or any other service or any other commercial enterprise.</P>
    <P>We have the system of committees which I have mentioned to the House, the committees who decide the maximum costs or fees which can be charged by the legal profession.  Then we have the taxing masters of the High Court and the county registrars of the Circuit Court who measure bills of costs and decide whether the maximum fee should be charged, or the minimum, or an in-between fee.  That is the reason why I say it should not now be necessary to introduce another form of control.</P>
    <P>I invite the Government as a whole, not the Minister for Industry and Commerce, to look into this again and to consider the arguments I have made.  It is admitted by all that we must have an independent judiciary.  I do not think anybody in the House would deny that an independent judiciary is a &ldquo;must&rdquo; in any democracy.  You cannot have an independent <Col N="1474" /> judiciary functioning in an independent manner without the assistance of an independent legal profession.</P>
    <P>The object of this Bill is to subject the legal profession to the Executive. Once you subject the legal profession to the Executive you take away their independence and you then cease to have a position in which an independent judiciary has the assistance of an independent legal profession.  Unless a case is presented in court fairly and squarely, whether that case is against a private individual or against the Government or the Executive, you have not got justice.  It is interesting to note that it is only at this late stage the Government have decided to include the profession in this Bill.  All the professions are not subject to control and subject to having their remuneration measured.  The legal profession are.</P>
    <P>I will be putting down an amendment on Committee Stage in relation to the matter I have been talking about.  I want to emphasise that for a long number of years the legal profession have subjected themselves to price control in a way that no other profession have done.  The profession are prepared to continue to submit themselves to reasonable control but it is not in the interests of the country as a whole that the charges of the legal profession should be subject to the control of the Executive.  We are quite prepared to have the fees of the profession scrutinised by a committee representing the judiciary, the profession, the general public and other professions, even semi-State bodies, and to accept their measurement.  I would go further and say that if we believe that the charges measured by the committee that I suggest are unreasonable the Oireachtas can reject the recommendation of the Committee.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable proposition. If that is done you have a situation in which the lowliest person in the State will be able to fight a case against the Executive and against the Government and a situation in which democracy will truly work.  The proposition in this Bill is designed to kill democracy.  I do not say that is the <Col N="1475" /> point in introducing it but it certainly paves the way for the destruction of democracy.  I hope on Committee Stage the Minister will accept the amendments which will be put down.</P>

If Deputy Fitzpatrick, who is one of the very able advocates of democracy in this House, were Minister for Industry and Commerce and introduced this Bill, he would have to face up to the fact that it was a very contentious measure.  Everybody knows we have to try to do something to control prices.  People are complaining about the prices of various commodities. They blame the Minister for Industry and Commerce and say he is not doing his job.  Deputy Fitzpatrick made a very good case for the legal profession.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a number of other people giving advice.  We are all subject to criticism in the democracy we live in.  We are all anxious to strike, as far as possible, a middle course so that nobody will succeed in doing something which is contrary to what we believe in.  The system of price control operated up to now has been directed primarily at manufacturers, importers and wholesalers.  If the Minister for Industry and Commerce were St. Peter himself and could work a miracle he would not be able to satisfy all the people.  It is very hard to bring in something to which everybody will agree.  The Minister stated in his speech:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This form of control was particularly appropriate when the majority of home manufacturers were protected by high tariff walls, but it has been gradually losing a great <Col N="1476" /> deal of its relevance in recent years with the dismantling of tariffs between ourselves and Britain under the terms of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and the resulting gradual exposure of home manufacturers to competition from external manufacturers.</P>
    <P>The late Seán Lemass, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, asked our manufacturers to try and readapt their factories.  Grants were given at that time to enable them to improve their factories so that they could compete generally.  I am more concerned with this than I am with the legal profession or anybody else.  We are deeply concerned about what our manufacturers have done.  There is an old adage: <i>tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in illis,</i> times change and we have got to change with the times.  We succeeded over the years in giving protection to our home industries.  We are entering the Common Market where we have to compete with other manufacturers in Europe.  It is up to us to improve our industries.  Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke of the legal profession as a whole, but I am concerned with dealing with the matter on a national basis.</P>
    <P>We are up against allegations from time to time that a particular solicitor has charged too much for acting in the purchase of a house or land or other property.  These are very personal things between solicitor and client.  I suggest that in a democracy such as we have here and which we hope to sustain for posterity, much of the legislation required can be enacted through co-operation between all the parties concerned.  I hope that system will continue.  If I live until next May I will have been 28 years in the Dáil.</P>

      <P>On this question of legal fees I suggest the Law Society <Col N="1477" /> should come to confer with the Minister to try to arrive at a gentleman's agreement on the matter of fees in relation to buying and selling.  In a democracy it should be possible to have these things discussed and then there would not be any need for imposing legislation.  There is one example I can give of how co-operation can succeed.  A Bill was about to be introduced here dealing with prices, wages and other things.  I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley, to be big enough to change his mind. He did and the result was, due to co-operation between the Department and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, that a Bill was introduced that met both sides.  That is democracy in action and it is essential we have such co-operation if we are to sustain democracy.  At that time I used a phrase which was the greatest I could have used.  I said: &ldquo;It is a good Government and a good Minister who will always change their minds on greater enlightenment.&rdquo;  It is what a democratic assembly is all about.  In this instance there is need for conference between the various interests, the legal profession, the manufacturers, the retailers and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister for Industry and Commerce in introducing this Bill, in trying to control house prices and the price of land.  If John Murphy must pay £10,000 an acre for land he cannot be expected to sell his house as cheaply as Paddy Burke who bought land 20 years ago at £1,800 or £1,000 an acre. When I was a member of the Council of Europe I saw how the French had to deal with house prices.  At that time the house that cost about £4,000 here cost about £10,000 in France.  The only way they could deal with the price of land was to set up a committee.  That committee bought land along the Seine Valley on the way to Le Havre, serviced it and made it available to local builders.  We are trying to do that in County Dublin but with the growth in population we are having a good deal of trouble.  It is very hard on our revenue resources to do this but this is all we can do to deal with the problem.  We have no cure for all ills in this regard.  We must take into <Col N="1478" /> consideration the prices that builders are paying for land.  This is the kernel of all our troubles.</P>
    <P>The only advice I can give the Minister is to see that we have a larger pool of serviced land at our disposal. There is no use in asking the small builder who is paying £10,000 an acre for land to be a philanthropist, and sell houses at £3,000 or £4,000.  It cannot be done.  It is not for us to deprive a builder of his normal profits.  People say they are jerrybuilders.  They are our people and they are building houses for our people.  I have recommended that the Minister should have consultations with the legal profession. The Minister cannot have consultations with everybody but his officials can have consultations.  Every Deputy in this House is concerned about the price of houses, why they are costing so much and how we are going to deal with rising costs.  However, we must be fair in a democracy.  I shall leave it to the Minister and his Department to see how best this problem can be dealt with.  I am not a wizard at finance but I am making my observations as a Member of a democratic assembly.</P>
    <P>I took a deputation of publicans to meet the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They had been up against a number of increases and they felt they should have got a concession from the Minister.  The Minister told them he was referring the question to the National Prices Advisory Body.  He has done that and I compliment him for it.  One expects a responsible trade like the licensed trade to act in a responsible way.  The Minister is being pressurised by the consumer about increases.  Anybody who is Minister for Industry and Commerce is up against this kind of thing.  It is not a bed of roses to be Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He must accept all the criticism.  Nevertheless, we expect people to be constructive in their criticism. The Minister met the trade.  We discussed the matter coolly and calmly and the Minister told them he was referring it to this body.  This is the sort of thing we want.  The Minister referred to the prices manufacturers are charging and to the prices of imported articles.  There should be more <Col N="1479" /> and more consultation.  I am not saying the Minister should receive everybody but his Department should consult with people.  No business firm can be a philanthropist firm because they depend on a certain profit to continue. They cannot fall back on a supplementary budget from the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I have made representations to various Ministers for Industry and Commerce.  I have always found the Minister for Industry and Commerce most approachable when I had a case to make to him about any firm which found itself in difficulty.  I am most anxious that that situation should continue, as I am sure it will continue.  I am concerned that justice should be done to everybody in our society and that no one should suffer because of temporary financial embarrassment. No Minister for Industry and Commerce will refuse to sanction price increases because a firm may temporarily be losing money.  No Minister will refuse financial assistance to enable that firm to modernise.  These are the things which are so important in a democracy.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a very onerous task.  He carries heavy responsibility. If the day ever comes when a Minister for Industry and Commerce refuses a legitimate price increase on the grounds that the applicant has already had a price increase sanctioned, then that is the day on which I shall say that I am sorry I am a Member of this democratic assembly.  I doubt very much if that day will ever dawn in our democracy. The Minister has a tough job pleasing everybody.</P>
    <P>Deputy T.J. Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i> dealt with the position of legal practitioners. We have heard in this Dáil criticisms about the fees charged by legal practitioners.  These people have their society and that society is quite competent to fight their case.</P>
    <P>Price control is a very difficult job. It is all very well to say that prices should be controlled, but the problem is a very complex one.  As soon as prices are controlled people start saying that the Joneses, the Murphys, the Burkes and others are charging this and that price.  One does not want to prosecute everybody.</P>

He is blamed for rising prices and other things.  If the Archangel Michael were Minister for Industry and Commerce and worked miracles even he would not please everybody.  The only thing that would please everybody is if Deputy Donegan and Deputy Burke, representing the public, discussed their problems with the Minister's Department and after submitting audited reports, the Minister said: &ldquo;You are entitled to an increase.&rdquo;  We must consider how we would do the job if one of us were Minister for Industry and Commerce.  If we could raise ourselves above the level of party politics we would achieve something for the national wellbeing.</P>
      <P>I thank the Chair for its forbearance in allowing me to speak for so long.  I wish the Minister well in his task.  I know he will do his best for all the people of the country.</P>

      <P>Having heard Deputy Burke, one inevitably concludes that the economic situation is desperate. I am glad the Government have at last seen fit to accept in a small way the advice they have been getting from these benches for the past 15 years. They have been repeatedly warned that unless they produce a Prices and Incomes Bill which will operate smoothly the economic and financial situation will get out of control.  This Bill is rather like an effort to close the stable door when the horse has bolted.  When legislation is delayed, as this has been, it is found that legislation must be introduced which imposes controls on the freedom of the individual.  I listened with interest to Deputy Fitzpatrick of Cavan who pointed out the difficulties that would face the legal profession as a result of this Bill.  The fact that they have been dragged into the Bill is a further sign of panic on the Government's part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister represents a constituency, as I do, and every day hears <Col N="1481" /> complaints about the extra prices people must pay for food and the extra cost of rent and houses and wages. There is a continuing escalation of costs in every sphere.  In this Bill the Minister, no doubt acting on advice, tries to rectify the situation.  This morning I was in the Department of Education in connection with a school.  The estimates are prepared for schools but apparently, due to the chronic shorage of money from which the Government suffers, it will be some time before the schools are built.  In this case the estimate was £17,000 in 1969 but for the same size of school the estimate today is £19,000, an increase of something like 20 per cent.  That gives some idea of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Some 20 years ago we were a low cost economy and as such had tremendous advantages in regard to tourism and exports and so on.  We then moved into a moderate or hard cost economy but today we are a high cost economy and nobody is more conscious of that than the man in the street.  Whenever there has been any attempt to regulate the situation and control the inflation which is devouring us there is a by-election or a general election and, again, the sky becomes the limit.  Wages are allowed to rise and prices to increase and the vicious spiral goes on.</P>
    <P>Two or three years ago a moderately sized house could be built for about £3,000 or £4,000.  Today the cost approaches £8,000.  Complaints have been reaching the Government from every side and the result is the introduction of this Bill about 15 years too late.  The present Minister cannot be blamed entirely because I think he is one of those who came into office following the night of the long knives, 2nd May, 1970.  At least, he then came into his present Department.  Before that, I think he was in the Department of Lands.  Fianna Fáil Ministers change so rapidly it is hard to keep up with the situation.  However, he is not entirely responsible for the present disastrous situation.  The Government must admit that in between dealing with internal problems in their party and the unhappy political situation in Northern Ireland, they must have decided they had to do something in order to control prices.  The tragedy of it is that we <Col N="1482" /> are forced to legislate, if we support methods such as this, to hand over the country to the control of a greater bureaucracy than that which already exists.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see the matter of the price of houses is handed over to the Minister for Local Government in this Bill.  Obviously, the Minister himself cannot deal with it and, therefore, it goes to his Department and it is bureaucracy which will decide on the price of houses.  For some years past, it has decided the level of rents and it moved so slowly that it has killed all private enterprise in regard to house-building and renting.  Bureaucracy moves so slowly and is so much out of touch with life in general that it cannot be regarded as being a solution to the problem.  Perhaps it is unfair of me to criticise on those lines because I cannot see any reasonable alternative now. However, there was the alternative before and if the Minister's predecessor had had a definite planning scheme whereby wages and prices were controlled we would not have this problem now.  Instead, both have been made the playthings of party politics.  The present Government who were elected a few years ago with a sizeable majority were in a position to give us strong government and to do everything that was necessary for the good of the public generally.  That is the purpose of electing a Government.  Instead, they fell out among themselves so that all the necessary legislation and planning and anything that might have been helpful to the building and stabilising of our economy and stopping inflation went by the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzpatrick spoke at some length on the question of solicitors' fees.  Being a professional man, I have great respect for professional men but, of course, I do not earn any money now from the medical profession.  I have always been of the opinion that in regard to fees, solicitors have always had a much easier passage than the other professions in so far as they handle the money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very sinister implication.</P>

      <NameTxt>Sir Anthony Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>People such as veterinary surgeons and architects must go out and collect their fees but solicitors are in the happy position of handling the money involved, and consequently, can collect their fees more easily than can people in the other professions.  Solicitors are accused of over-charging.  In the peculiar circumstances in which the legal profession operate there must be a great temptation on their part to over-charge but I fail to see how legislation of this nature will control professional charges.  I presume the idea is that if there are complaints regarding excessive legal charges, these will be referred to the Minister for Justice.  However, I happen to know that if there is one person now who is unpopular with the legal profession, and I refer to the legal profession at all levels, that person is the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the Minister would not be considering these complaints personally but would refer them to his officials. Deputy Fitzpatrick made the case aptly when he said that while the legal profession are supposed to be one of the custodians of the rights of the people, they will not be as free from now on as they will be under the control of what he calls the Executive but which I prefer to call bureaucratic control.  I suppose the same situation applies to a large extent to the medical profession.  Having practised in this profession I do not see how the Minister for Health will be able to control medical fees without, at the same time, interfering with the doctor-patient relationship.  This is one of the difficulties in trying to bring bureaucracy into the medical profession.  The Minister for Health may be able to control fees in so far as they relate to any service connected definitely with the State&mdash;for instance, the State medical service, or anything that comes under the aegis of the regional health authorities&mdash;but with regard to the ordinary situation, if a person complains about being charged too much by his doctor, this legislation is ludicrous.  How can the officials of the Department of Health go between the doctor and his patient and say to the doctor that instead of charging so-and-so £1.50, he should have charged <Col N="1484" /> only £1.25?  This is merely an attempt at palaver on the part of the Government in their effort to indicate to the general public that they are aware that everything is very expensive.</P>
    <P>Costs today are exorbitant and are increasing all the time.  Of course it is necessary for the Minister to try to have some control but I do not think he is going about his task in the right way.  If he really wished to have control he would have to call in everyone concerned and have consultations with representatives of every sphere of life.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, there are people who, literally, have been getting away with murder not only in the city but in rural areas also.  I have no wish to name anybody but I know some people who bought land in rural Ireland and who sold it at approximately ten times the price they paid for it.  Land purchased as one site might be sold as a dozen sites afterwards provided planning permission could be obtained.  One can charge practically anything one wishes for a site today.  Unless everything associated with the cost of houses can be controlled it will be impossible to control their actual price.  There is a theory in this country that builders are making a fortune.  While some contractors and builders may be making a lot of money, there are many also who have gone bankrupt.  Some have been declared bankrupt in the recent past.  Perhaps there is a higher rate of bankruptcy among that section of the community than among any other. That proves there is something wrong. The point I am trying to make is that the Minister cannot stop the escalation in the cost of living by playing politics.  If there is to be a freeze on prices and if increases in wages are to be prevented, the restrictions must apply to everybody.  There are people who have been making a fortune under the auspices of Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <P>I am not accusing the Minister directly but there has been more injustice in the financial sphere in this country under this Government than there has been in any other country in the world.  The <Col N="1485" /> Minister for Industry and Commerce is charged with the responsibility of trying to eliminate that kind of chicanery. Everybody is complaining that the people to whom I am referring are being allowed to exploit the public.</P>
      <P>Another point I wish to stress concerns something that will lead to the wreck and ruin of everything we have had in the past.  I refer to the growth of enormous supermarkets which, very often, are controlled by non-nationals. These combines can supply almost everything from a needle to an anchor but, in addition, they have supplied something that the local authority in Dublin should have supplied long ago, that is, parking space which in itself is of great importance to the shopper. Supermarkets charge less for their goods.  They break and destroy people who are in business in a small way in their areas and who have traded there for years.</P>
      <P>When the supermarkets get control&mdash; and this did not happen yesterday or the day before; it has been going on for years&mdash;they put up the prices.  I suggest to the Minister that the game of these people is that they give enormous subscriptions, which they can well afford to do, to political parties, and that is something against which the Government should defend the public. These people are driving out of business those who are the backbone of the country, the small traders and even the bigger business people.  They are being replaced by racketeers.</P>
      <P>I do not know if this Bill will counteract that.  I have only had a chance of reading it very rapidly this evening.  This Bill is really a political gimmick.  It is suggesting that the doctors will be made charge less, that the solicitors, for whom I am not as sorry as for the other professions, will be made charge less.  This is a vote-catching Bill which will not deal with the real issues, which will not fight the cost of living, defend the people who are suffering more today than anybody else, the poorer middle-classes who are struggling to exist, who are hit by every increase in taxation and by every extra charge.  It is the Minister's duty to defend those people and I hope he will not forget them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Bill which goes towards fighting inflation must be welcome and to that extent this Bill is welcome, but I echo the previous speaker when he says it is a case of closing the stable door in relation to prices.  Looking back on the Prices Commission for the last year or more, I think the most significant thing that happened was the dramatic increase on a universal level as a result of decimalisation.  It was denied to me here in response to a Parliamentary question a considerable time ago that decimalisation had any effect on the cost of living.  If the Minister and his advisers had contact with any housewife doing shopping in any part of Ireland they would soon learn that decimalisation has had a most serious upward effect on prices.  Everything has been affected: food, newspapers, toilet articles, all the small mundane items that go to make up the household budget.</P>
      <P>Any rounding-off that took place invariably took place upwards, and there was no effort to control that increase. It should have been quite obvious to the Minister that any rounding-off to be effected would be upwards, and steps should have been taken to ensure that the decimal prices would exactly correspond to the old LSD prices.  If there had to be any rounding-off some effort should have been made to ensure it would be a smooth operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this Bill is welcome as an effort to control the most potent inflationary factor, that is, escalating prices.  Nevertheless, it cannot be taken in isolation, because there are so many other weapons necessary to fight the inflationary battle.  We do not know if the same teeth are being given to the other weapons, principally wage control. The Government are depending on voluntary restraint of wages.  So far, I must happily admit, there has been a period of comparative calm, but some ominous clouds have appeared on the horizon, namely, claims by the maintenance workers.  We remember that two years ago or a little longer a claim by the same body of workers triggered off a very drastic inflationary spiral. Voluntary restraint might work if the philosophy behind this Bill works, that <Col N="1487" /> is, restraint on prices.  Presumably the Government could go to the person who is looking for an increase and say: &ldquo;Prices are under control.  There is no need for you to claim such a high level as you are seeking.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill points up a number of anomalies.  The principal one I should like to mention is in relation to house property and the price of houses.  The price of houses is, perhaps, the most potent inflationary factor in the whole economy.  The provision of a house for the average couple is as essential as buying bread and the charges in respect of house purchase come into the weekly budget of that married couple.  Therefore, pressure is exerted for increased wages to try to meet these heavy charges.</P>
    <P>I suppose it would be too much to expect that this Bill would spell out how this problem is to be tackled.  An effort has been made in the sense that an advisory committee on the price of building land is at present sitting, but that is only one aspect of the cost of houses.  I should have liked the Minister in his speech to give some indication of his Department's thinking or the thinking of the Department of Local Government on this matter.  We all know it is a problem.  As the previous speaker said, it could nearly be termed a racket in many cases.</P>
    <P>Quite recently I fortuitously heard of a small housing development in the city where the developers, having regard to the status of their site and the spoof that the auctioneers, were able to provide in describing their houses, decided to ask a price of £20,000 for a detached though not an extraordinary dwelling-house. They did this with some trepidation and with their tongue in their cheek, and they were snowed under with applications.  It is a constant mystery to me how there are so many people in this country either with the income or the earning capacity to borrow that amount of money.  There seems to be no shortage of such people around the city.  There was such a rash of applications that these developers reckoned they were on to a good thing and decided that the next batch would cost £23,000.  Even though the actual <Col N="1488" /> cost to them was remaining the same, they were increasing their profit per house by £3,000.  What their profit on the original cost of construction was I did not learn.  Either the Minister or the Minister for Local Government will have to tackle this problem, because this sort of profiteering with regard to housing is endemic throughout this land.</P>
    <P>I regret, too, that the Minister&mdash;he may correct me on this if I am wrong; I read the Bill rather quickly&mdash;has taken power to deal only with the price of new houses.  The price of existing houses or secondhand houses, as we call them, is as potent an inflationary factor as the price of new houses.  The same results follow from a married couple buying a secondhand house as buying a new house.  They have to get their mortgage and arrange their budget to meet their weekly repayments which are just as high on a secondhand house as on a new house.</P>
    <P>The problem has reached such serious proportions and is such a strong contributor to our inflationary problem that drastic action is demanded from the Minister.  A Prices Bill introduced by the Minister, without making more than a passing reference to the problem, and without giving any indication as to how it might be solved, or what line of country the Minister would consider appropriate for attacking it, or how he would propose that his colleague the Minister for Local Government&mdash;and apparently the buck will be passed to him&mdash;should tackle it, is disappointing.  It leads one to wonder if this Bill is, as Deputy Esmonde suggested, a piece of shadow boxing to reassure the public that &ldquo;We are keeping our eye on prices so go easy on your wages.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Another factor which has contributed to unduly high prices for housing has been the willingness of certain institutions in country towns to pay more than the going market price to get a house.  I refer in particular to the banks.  My experience in my town is that, by comparison with other towns, up to 18 months ago, or even a year ago, the price of housing was at what we all considered to be a rational figure.  A good four bedroomed house <Col N="1489" /> could be got for £3,500, £4,000, or perhaps, £4,500 if it was very well decorated, and had gardens, and so on.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months the banks&mdash; for what motive I do not know; there may have been a change of policy; or, perhaps, they want to use their surplus assets before the day of revelation dawns&mdash;have proceeded to buy houses for their employees.  In several cases I know of they have been asked to pay figures of £7,000 and £8,000 for houses which were selling the previous month for £4,000, £4,500 or, perhaps, even £5,000.  Without a quibble the banks paid these prices with the result that a standard was set and every house vendor sought a similar price and held out until he forced the market up.  There was not a lot of difficulty in forcing the market up because the people coming in to buy these houses were coming from places where inflation had already gripped and these prices did not seem out of the way to them.</P>
    <P>This is a very practical example of how something inflationary happens in the economy.  This is the sort of problem with which this Bill does not seem able to deal in any way.  The Minister did not advert to it in his speech. Too often the science of economics is applied on a global scale, whereas to be really effective the problem has to be examined in minutiae.  With our small economy we are in an ideal situation to manipulate our affairs so as to ensure that things such as excessive prices being paid for houses by the banks do not take place and upset the economic structure.  That is why I say that this Bill is a bit woolly and a bit of shadow boxing.  It does not get to grips with the reality of economics in Irish life.</P>
    <P>We are approaching the stage where we nearly have two societies&mdash;Dublin and the rest of the country&mdash;with two different attitudes towards prices and costs.  I do not know what the answer is, but there is no suggestion as to what it might be from the Minister. The Minister should be able to inspect in greater detail the various activities within the community which we all know tend towards inflation, for example, <Col N="1490" /> the price of houses.  I would urge the Minister to take power to deal with old houses or secondhand houses as well as new houses.</P>
    <P>The question of the banks themselves is not dealt with in the Bill.  The Minister said it is dealt with under the Central Bank Act, 1971.  Presumably, the Central Bank will be the authority keeping an eye on how the banks behave themselves.  It will be very interesting to see their profits when the day of revelation comes&mdash;and I think it will come this year&mdash;when the true profits will be shown to the public for the first time.  The grapevine suggests that the figure will be substantial.  Having regard to the money which is being lavished by the banks on premises and development and furniture, this extravagant spending by the banks will possibly keep the profit figure down to a level which, while it will be noticeable, will not excite undue comment.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is good enough that control of the banks, which have such an important and influential place in our economy, such an influence on attitudes to money and to levels of spending, should be left to the Central Bank without, apparently, any supervision by the Minister under this Bill. If this Bill is to provide a global survey on prices it should give the Minister power to survey all sectors and all aspects of the economy.  The banks are put in a privileged position, a position which they do not seem to appreciate. It is time they were made aware of their extra responsibility because of the very nature of their functions.</P>
    <P>I do not know if their charges for the services they render have ever been surveyed with a view to seeing how they compare with charges for services rendered by other sections of the community. One would expect from the banks a very high degree of responsibility in controlling their affairs so as not to contribute to inflation.  We had the recent spectacle of Associated Banks indicating agreement on a wage increase far above the national norm which, in itself, is inflationary because it aggravates the situation and invites unfavourable comparison by persons in other occupations.</P>

      <P>Today I asked the Minister for Finance a serious and searching question, pregnant with meaning and importance, concerning the future of one of the most important industries in my constituency, the Ballingarry Collieries.  The question was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Finance if he will state in detail the arrangements now made with the management of Ballingarry collieries for future operations; if these arrangements include measures to secure long-term security for all the employees and maximum production from the mines; and when measures of this nature will come into effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister's non-reply was to refer me to an answer to a previous question which was of a totally different nature. I am not ungrateful for the part which the Minister has played in this delicate and protracted serious matter over the past 12 months.  Nevertheless, the Minister should know me well enough to realise that I would not be fobbed off by an offhand and irresponsible reply of the kind which he gave me today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The welfare of the miners in Ballingarry has been a cause of deep concern for a large number of people in County Tipperary and the adjoining counties for the past 12 months.  That concern has been expressed in a very practical way on numerous occasions by the passing of motions by many of our local authorities, by the presence of public representatives from County Tipperary, County Waterford, County Kilkenny and other places at a specially convened meeting in Clonmel by our county development team, by the many representations which have been made to the Minister over the past 12 months, by delegations comprising Members of the Oireachtas, county managers and other important public people, and the trade union directly concerned in this matter which met the Minister and Taiscí Stáit, the State body who have been dealing with this matter.  All our efforts have been directed towards the ultimate objective <Col N="1492" /> of saving the jobs of these 240 miners, which were placed in jeopardy because of the aftermath of the bank strike of 1970.  We all know that, because of the serious financial difficulties of the company at Ballingarry Collieries, Thurles, the mines closed at Easter, 1971 and 240 men lost their jobs.</P>
    <P>After long and protracted negotiations an arrangement was eventually worked out between the Minister, An Taiscí Stáit and the owners of the mine to provide a pretty substantial loan. The nature of the arrangements and the amount of money involved in this transaction I will leave to the Minister to outline.  In any event, the <i>modus operandi</i> was to reopen the mines and put the people back to work.  There was also the problem of meeting the cheques which had been dishonoured. I believe also there was attached to this agreement a stipulation that the Minister had the right to appoint two State representatives to the board of directors of the mining company at Ballingarry.</P>
    <P>It took from Easter to Christmas, 1971, to finalise the legal transactions involved.  In the meantime, the 240 men concerned were declared redundant. The majority of these men qualified for redundancy lump sums and the appropriate weekly payments in conformity with their years of service. After nine months anxiety, waiting and agitation the legal arrangements were eventually finalised.  Then, with a flourish of trumpets, about the 23rd December, 1971, the Minister's Department announced that the problems in respect of Ballingarry Collieries had been very largely resolved.  Cheques were being honoured and arrangements were being made for a resumption of work.</P>
    <P>Government Deputies were quick to rush into print, seeking to convey to everybody in the area that they alone were responsible for this joyous news. The news was carried in the national daily papers and in the local papers in such a fashion as to leave no doubt in the minds of everybody that the problem had been resolved and that there would be an immediate resumption of work.  Indeed, some of the papers wished the miners of Ballingarry &ldquo;a <Col N="1493" /> happy Christmas&rdquo;.  This very definite impression was conveyed by the newspapers and by the Minister's statement. We expected an immediate resumption of work at Ballingarry and the reinstatement of the 240 miners involved.</P>
    <P>This was last Christmas.  Seven weeks have elapsed since and so far there has been no notification of a positive settlement.  There has been no resumption of work and no indication as to when a resumption of work will take place.  We have reached another stalemate in this serious problem.  This is something of an anti-climax to the impression created in the statement of Christmas week.  The miners of Ballingarry and their families are more despondent and disillusioned now than ever before.</P>
    <P>I have a right as a public representative, the Ballingarry miners have a right and this House has a right to know from the Minister what has gone wrong now and when the matter will be rectified.  I understand that the owner of the mine now takes the view, to use the Minister's words, that substantial additional capital will be required before production can commence. Accordingly, plans for a resumption of work for the unfortunate miners have been deferred indefinitely. It is tragic that all our hopes should be dashed.</P>
    <P>Most of the miners by now have exhausted their redundancy weekly payments and are on unemployment benefit. Stamps for this purpose are running out.  These men will in a very short time find themselves on the dole. They will then be forced down to subsistence level and poverty and privation will be widespread among the 200 families involved.</P>
    <P>In Ballingarry there is no alternative employment and we can, therefore, understand the situation there at the present time.  I want to ask, therefore, whether the attitude of the owner of the mine in demanding or requesting substantial additional capital is in all the circumstances justified.  If he is right, why was this need not foreseen by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his advisers in Taiscí Stáit, and what are the views of the Minister's directors in this company?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> Twelve months have passed.  How much longer must we await finalisation of this problem?  May I ask also whether in all the circumstances it would not be right and proper to have a full, impartial inquiry?  This can no longer be regarded as a private, domestic affair between the Minister for Finance and the owner of the mine. This has become a human problem, the source of a great social evil affecting an entire community for a radius of 30 miles around the Ballingarry area.  It affects The Commons, Fethard, Mullinahone, Killenaule, and Callan, the entire hinterland from Thurles to Clonmel and on to Kilkenny. It is the people's money that is being used to rehabilitate this mine and the people have a right to know what has happened and what is now happening. I, as their representative here, do not intend to stand idly by or to remain silent.  I will not allow the miners of Ballingarry to be made a political football or to be used as pawns in a callous and unscrupulous financial wrangle between the Minister and the mine owner as has happened during the past 12 months.</P>

      <P>The Minister will not stop me.  The ball is at the Minister's feet.  A substantial loan has been granted and the intention of that was to put men to work.  The Minister has an obligation to get those men back to work as a matter of urgency.  I am aware that the mine owner has not been satisfied with the amount of capital which was furnished for the rehabilitation of the mine.  He has repeatedly stated that the amount was inadequate, that double the amount would be required.  I respect the view of the owner in this regard.  He is obviously a very good judge of his own business and he deserves credit for having operated the mine successfully <Col N="1495" /> for a number of years when the State itself had failed.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, this serious matter has been gone into in great detail by the Minister and his experts during the past 12 months.  The two State directors are men of some importance and distinction.  I understand one has very high qualifications in the field of finance and that the other has expertise in mining and exploration.  A decision should have been made long ago adequately to fund this mine.  It must be done now as a matter of urgency.  There is also the question of the feasibility of taking over the mine. This cannot be ruled out particularly having regard to the large State subvention involved and the existence of the two State directors.</P>
      <P>None of us can be accused of rocking this boat.  This boat, so to speak, has been stuck fast during the past 12 months.  There is no secret about the grant of loan involved.  Unfortunately the mine has had more than its share of adverse publicity.  The Minister has a duty to explain in detail what is happening.  This bluff must end.  We must decide now, without the slightest ambiguity, whether the entire Ballingarry community are to be safeguarded or wiped out.  The miners of Ballingarry and their families have a right to know where they stand at this critical time.  That is why I have taken the House to the Adjournment.  I want the Minister to answer for the whole situation and I want him to place the responsibility where it lies, whether it be in his Department or in Ballingarry.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I was delayed on the road. Deputy Treacy is once again kicking around his political football, using the workers of Ballingarry for his own political game.  We in the Fianna Fáil Party have made more efforts than anybody on behalf of the Ballingarry <Col N="1496" /> miners.  We introduced countless deputations of miners, shopkeepers and others in attempts to have this matter brought to a head.  We succeeded in having relief money brought to them before Christmas.  Deputy Treacy makes little of the fact that the miners were paid one and a half weeks wages four days before Christmas.  I considered this a very pleasant surprise for the miners. Deputy Treacy tries to make a skit of the efforts we have put into this.  He said the workers are despondent.  I do not agree with him.  I may know the position better than he does.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. Treacy Mr. Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>A fair but not a good knowledge.  The people there are not despondent.  They are quite prepared to await a decision.  Deputy Treacy has called for an inquiry.  That would further delay resumption in the mine. The Minister has stated he will consider further financial assistance.  If so, how much is needed?  Deputy Treacy wants to delay the matter further and is using it as a political football.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This very unfortunate incident began almost a year ago and as Deputy Treacy has said it took a very long period, nine or ten months, before the agreement referred to was arrived at.  Deputy Treacy also referred to a number of deputations received by me, deputations very broadly based from the area.  He will know from his attendance, I think he has a very accurate idea, that there was delay in the completion of the agreement.  One thing is certain: there is no delay attributable to any official source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no secret about the arrangement made.  It provided for the payment of a total sum of £280,000, made up as follows: £83,000 to meet wage cheques which had been referred to drawer, £32,000 payments due to the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare, £80,000 towards the purchase of a new plough and £85,000 for general working capital.  As has been referred to, the money in respect of wage cheques was paid out before Christmas and an <Col N="1497" /> announcement was made that the arrangement had been completed, that this money was being paid out and that it was expected the mine would resume full working very shortly.</P>
    <P>I indicated today in the House that I was disappointed with the situation which has now developed and I also indicated what the problem was but perhaps I could elaborate a little further and say that the position is that it is now the best part of a year ago since the then financial position of the company and the projections made were available to my Department. In the meantime the mine has not been operated, it has just been maintained.  Until the loan agreement was concluded we could not appoint anybody to the board.  As Deputy Treacy has said, Taiscí Stáit did appoint two people to the board.  Those two gentlemen, and I agree with Deputy Treacy that they are eminent and competent in their field, on their appointment to the board, went into the affairs of the company and they, in conjunction with the other members of the board, but they in particular&mdash;I suppose it is understandable that I would pay particular attention to the opinions of those people&mdash;expressed the view that the provision for general working capital included in those figures I have mentioned would not be sufficient and that the likely result was that if they started operating they would have to come back in a very short time looking for further working capital.</P>
    <P>This is a position with which I personally am not in the least pleased or impressed but the fact is that we could not get information about what the actual situation in the company was, other than the almost year old situation and projections, until we appointed these people to the board.  It is not a situation that I wished to see occur but it has occurred and arising out of it an assessment is being made now of what additional working capital will be required.  I have done what I can to ensure that that assessment is made as quickly as possible but I am assured that it will be at least a few weeks before we can get that assessment.  When we get it we <Col N="1498" /> will then have to consider where we go from there.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the situation in regard to this mine, the implications of its closure and the investment which has already taken place by the State, are such that we will ensure, within all reasonable limits, that this mine will reopen just as fast as we can ensure that it will reopen.  Like Deputy Davern, I do not think that to call at this stage for, to quote Deputy Treacy, &ldquo;a full and impartial inquiry&rdquo; is a very helpful suggestion.  If Deputy Treacy thinks, when the mine reopens and is in full operation, that there is some matter that requires investigation, by all means let him make his case at that stage but at this stage what is required, in particular what is required by the miners of Ballingarry, is to get the mine reopened, not to be having full and impartial inquiries.  That is not what they are interested in.  They want to get the mine reopened and that is what I want.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;rather than opening the mine?  Surely any practical man wants to get the mine opened and get these men back to work and at that stage if anybody wants to say anything about an inquiry let him say it but the immediate and important priority is to get the mine opened and get the miners back to work.  Let us get our priorities right.  As far as this side of the House is concerned that is our priority.  Deputy Treacy may have another priority and he is welcome to it.  The miners of Ballingarry can rest <Col N="1499" /> assured that the priority on this side of the House is to get the mine reopened as fast as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out too, that while I do not like interrupting a Deputy I did, in ample time, when Deputy Treacy still had plenty of time available to him, ask him to explain what he meant by the statement he made which was a repeat of a statement he made today and which I understand from Deputy Davern was a repeat of a statement he made in his constituency recently.  That was where he referred to &ldquo;an unscrupulous and callous game between the Minister and the mine owners&rdquo;.  I asked him to elaborate on that and I asked him in time, long before his time was up, and it is very noticeable that he did not avail himself of that opportunity. I think anybody who is interested will know why he did not avail himself of that opportunity and why he made his <Col N="1500" /> allegation which he is not prepared to elaborate on, explain or substantiate.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the position as far as I am concerned is that I personally have, as I said today and I repeat, been very much involved in this matter from the time it came to my notice and I intend to continue to involve myself personally in it.  I think it is a very serious matter for that area. I have indicated in my actions and attitude since the trouble developed my willingness and the willingness of the Government to do everything possible to ensure the reopening of this mine.  That attitude has not changed and that attitude will not change.  The position is as I have outlined it and I repeat that the priority on this side of the House is to get the miners back to work.  Then if Deputy Treacy, or anybody else, wants to talk about an inquiry let us hear all about it then if he has something to say.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Percentage figures corresponding to those published in Table 17 of the <i>Trend of Employment and Unemployment</i> are not compiled in respect of individual local employment offices because the separate totals for each office for insurance cards exchanged and insurance cards lodged are not always directly comparable. Insurance cards are not necessarily exchanged at the local office area of employment nor are they necessarily exchanged at the same local office in successive years.  On a regional basis the possible distortion is relatively small and percentages are therefore compiled on a regular basis for each region.  The local offices specified in the Deputy's question are all located in the North-Leinster region.  For this region the percentages of insured persons on the live register&mdash;excluding agriculture, fishing and private domestic service&mdash;was 9.1 in mid-December, 1971, and 7.4 in mid-December, 1970.</P>
